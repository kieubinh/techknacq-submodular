        "Whenever the user feels that she has accomplished the task, the ordered list of preferred alternatives is saved as her Preliminary Decision (Figure 2 (2b)).",
        "After that, this list, the User's Action History and the initial Model of User's Preferences are analysed by the User Model Refiner (Figure 2 (3)) to produce a Refined Model of the User's Preferences (Figure 2 (4)).",
        "At this point, the stage is set for argument generation.",
        "Given the Refined Model of the User's Preferences for the target selection task, the Argument Generator produces an evaluative argument tailored to the user's model (Figure 2 (5-6)).",
        "Finally, the argument is presented to the user by the IDEA system (Figure 2 (7)).",
        "The argument goal is to introduce a new alternative (not included in the dataset initially presented to the user) and to persuade the user that the alternative is worth being considered.",
        "The new alternative is designed on the fly to be preferable for the user given her preference model.",
        "Once the argument is presented, the user may (a) decide to introduce the new alternative in her Hot List, or (b) decide to further explore the dataset, possibly making changes to the Hot List and introducing the new instance in the Hot List, or (c) do nothing.",
        "Figure 3 shows the display at the end of the interaction, when the user, after reading the argument, has decided to introduce the new alternative in the first position.",
        "Whenever the user decides to stop exploring and is satisfied and confident with her final selections, measures related to argument's effectiveness can be assessed (Figure 2 (8)).",
        "These measures are obtained either from the record of the user interaction with the system or from user self-reports (see Section 2).",
        "First, and most important, are measures of behavioral intentions and attitude change: (a) whether or not the user adopts the new proposed alternative, (b) in which position in the Hot List she places it, (c) how much she likes it, (d) whether or not the user revises the Hot List and (e) how much the user likes the objects in the Hot List.",
        "Second, a measure can be obtained of the user's confidence that she has selected the best for her in the set of alternatives.",
        "Third, a measure of argument effectiveness can also be derived by explicitly questioning the user at the end of the interaction.",
        "about the rationale for her decision.",
        "This can be done either by asking the user to justify her decision in a written paragraph, or by asking-the user to self-report for each attribute of the new house how important the attribute was in her decision (Olso and Zanna 1991).",
        "Both methods can provide valuable information on what aspects of the argument were more influential (i.e., better understood and accepted by the user).",
        "A fourth measure of argument effectiveness is to explicitly ask the user at the end of the interaction to judge the argument with respect to several dimensions of quality, such as content, organization, writing style and convincigness.",
        "Evaluations based on judgments along these dimensions are clearly weaker than evaluations measuring actual behavioural and attitudinal changes (Olso and Zanna 1991).",
        "However, these judgments may provide more information than judgments from independent judges (as in the \"human judges\" method discussed in Section 3), because they are performed by the addressee of the argument, when the experience of the task is still vivid in her memory.",

        "In the context of this task, an evaluative argument is generated and Measurements related to its effectiveness can be performed.",
