        "The natural language generation community has emphasized for a number of years the strengths of multilingual generation (MGEN) systems (Iordanskaja et al., 1992; Wisner and Stede, 1992; Reiter and Mel-lish, 1993; Goldberg et al., 1994; Paris et al., 1995; Power and Scott, 1998).",
        "These strengths concern the reuse of knowledge, the support for early drafts in several languages, the support for maintaining consistency when making changes, the support for producing alternative formulations, and the potential for producing higher quality outputs than machine translation.",
        "(The weaknesses concern the high-cost of building large, language-independent knowledge bases.",
        "and the difficulty of producing high-quality, broad-coverage generation algorithms.)",
        "From an economic perspective, the more a system can rely on language independent modules for the purpose of multilingual generation, the better.",
        "If an MGEN system needs to develop language dependent knowledge bases, and language dependent algorithms for content selection, text planning, and sentence planning, it is difficult to justify its economic viability.",
        "However, if most of these components are language independent and/or much of the code can be re-used, an i\\IGEN system becomes a viable option.",
        "Many of the early implementations of MG EN systems have adopted the perspective that text planners can be implemented as language-independent modules (lordanskaja et al.. 1992: Goldberg et al., 1994), possibly followed by a lnicari.",

        "Although such an approach may be adequate for highly restricted text genres, such as weather forecasts, it usually poses problems for less restricted genres.",
        "Studies of instruction manuals (Wisner and Stede, 1992; Delin et al., 1994: Delin et al., 1996) suggest that there are variations with respect to the way high-level communicative goals are realized across languages.",
        "For example, Delin et al.",
        "(1994) noticed that sentences (1), (2), and (3), which were taken from a trilingual instruction manual for a step-aerobics machine, yield non-isomorphic Rhetorical Structure (Mann and Thompson, 1988) analyses in English, French, and German respectively (see Figure 1).",

        "In this paper.",
        "we describe an experiment that was designed to answer these questions.",
        "To investigate",
        "how discourse structures differ across languages, we manually built a parallel corpus of discourse trees of newspaper Japanese texts and their corresponding English translations.",

        "In section 3, we present our experiment and discuss our empirical findings.",
        "In Section 4, we discuss the implications of our work for the task of text planning, in the context of multilingual natural language generation.",
        "2 Towards building a parallel corpus of discourse trees: an example Consider, for example, Japanese sentence (4), a word-by-word \"gloss\" of it (5), and a two-sentence translation of it that was produced by a professional translator (6).",
        "[The Ministry of Health and Welfare last year(.5) revealed'] [population of future estimate according toe] [in future 1.499 persons as the lowest3] [that after *SAB* rising to turn that] [*they* estimated buts] [already the estimate misses a points] [prediction became.']",
        "[In its future population estimates'] [made(6) public last year.']",
        "[the Ministry of Health and Welfare predicted that the SAB would drop to a new low of 1.499 in the future.3] [hut would make a comeback after that .4] [increasing once again.']",
        "[However, it looks as if that prediction will be quickly shattered.G] The labeled spans of text represent elementary discourse units (cdus).",
        "i.e.. minimal text spans that have an unambiguous discourse function (Mann and Thompson, 1988).",
        "If we analyze the text fragments closely, we will notice that in translating sentence (4), a professional translator chose to realize the information in Japanese unit 2 first (unit 2 in text (4) corresponds roughly to unit 1 in text (6)); to realize then some of the information in Japanese unit 1 (part of unit 1 in text (4) corresponds to unit 2 in text (6)); to fuse then information given in units 1, 3, and 5 in text (4) and realize it in English as unit 3; and so on.",
        "Also, the translator chose to repackage the information in the original Japanese sentence into two English sentences.",
        "At the elementary unit level, the correspondence between Japanese sentence (4) and its English translation (6) can be represented as in (7), where j C e denotes the fact that the semantic content of unit j is realized fully in unit e; j D e denotes the fact that the semantic content of unit e is realized fully in unit j; j = e denotes the fact that units j and e are semantically equivalent; and j e denotes the fact that there is a semantic overlap between units j and e, but neither proper inclusion nor proper equivalence.",
        "Hence, the mappings in (7) provide an explicit representation of the way information is reordered and repackaged when translated from Japanese into English.",
        "However, when translating text, it is not only that information is repackaged and re-ordered; it.",
        "is also that.",
        "the rhetorical rendering changes.",
        "What.",

        "Each discourse structure is a tree whose leaves correspond to the edus and whose internal nodes correspond to contiguous text spans.",
        "Each node is characterized by a status (NUCLEUS or SATELLITE) and a rhetorical relation, which is a relation that holds between two non-overlapping text spans.",
        "(There are a few exceptions to this rule: some relations, such as the CONTRAST relation that.",
        "holds between unit.",
        "[3] and span [4,5] in the structure of the English text are mult.inuclear.)",
        "The distinction between nuclei and satellites comes from the empirical observation that the nucleus expresses what is more essential to the writer's intention than the satellite: and that the nucleus of .a rhetorical relation is comprehensible independent.",

        "For example, the ELABORATION-OBJECT-ATTRIBUTE-E relation that holds between units 2 and 1 in the English discourse structure corresponds to a restrictive relative.",
        "We chose to label these relations because we have noticed that they often dominate complex discourse trees.",
        "whose elementary units are fully fleshed clauses.",
        "if one knows the mappings at the edu level, one can determine the mappings at the span (discourse constituent) level as well.",
        "For example.",
        "using the elementary mappings in (7), one can determine that Japanese span [1,2] corresponds to English span [1,2], Japanese unit [4] to English span [4.5].",
        "Japanese span [6,7] to English unit [6], Japanese span [1,5] to English span [1,5], and so on.",
        "As Figure 2 shows, the CONCESSION relation that holds between spans [1,5] and [6,7] in the Japanese tree corresponds to a similar relation that holds between span [1.5] and unit [6] in the English tree (modulo t he fact that, in Japanese, the relation holds between sentence fragments, while in English it holds between full sentences).",
        "However, the TEMPORAL-AFTER relation that holds between units [3] and [4] in the Japanese tree is realized as a CONTRAST relation between unit [3] and span [4,5] in the English tree, And because Japanese units [6] and [7] are fused into:unit [6] in-English., the relation ELA'BORATION-OBJECT-ATTRIBUTE-E is no longer made explicit in the English text.",
        "Assume now that it is the task of an MGEN system to produce from a knowledge base texts (4) and (6).",
        "The system will have to select the appropriate information, generate text.",
        "plans for the two texts.",

        "Or something in between?",
        "As one can see.",
        "the discourse trees in Figure 2 are",
        "quite different: they suggest that depending on the output language, text plans should use different relations, different orderings of elementary units, different aggregations across semantic units, etc.",
        "Some researchers may argue that the two RST analyses in Figure 2 are too specific.",
        "That they, in fact, correspond to.,text ;plans ,that have beep, already refined by an aggregation module and arguably, even by a sentence planner.",
        "After all, the reordering of units 1 and 2 can be explained only in terms of different syntactic contraints in Japanese and English.",
        "We agree with such a concern.",
        "Nevertheless, as our experiment shows, significant differences across discourse trees are found not only for trees built at the sentence level, but also for trees built at the paragraph and text levels.",
        "For these levels, it is difficult to explain the differences in terms of language-specific syntactic constraints.",
        "Rather, it seems more adequate to assume that there are significant differences with respect to the way information is organized rhetorically across languages.",
        "The experiment described in the next section estimates quantitatively this difference."

        "and the way the units are grouped recursively into discourse spans, we computed two types of recall and precision figures.",
        "In computing Position-Dependent (P-D) recall and precision figures, a Japanese span was considered to match an English span when the Japanese span contained all the Japanese edus that corresponded to the edus in the English span, and .when Ihe,Japanese-Artd,,Eaglialy:spans appeared in the same position linearly.",
        "For example, the English tree in Figure 2 is characterized by 10 sub-sentential spans, which span across positions [1,1], [2,2], [3,3], [4,4], [5,5], [6,6], [1,2], [4,5], [3,5], and [1,5].",

        "[4,4], [5,5], and [1,5].",
        "Hence the similarity between the Japanese tree and the English tree with respect to their discourse structure below the sentence level has a recall of 4/10 and a precision of 4/11 (in Figure 2, there are 11 sub-sentential Japanese spans).",
        "In computing Position-Independent (P-I) recall and precision figures, even when a Japanese span \"floated\" during the translation to a position in the English tree that was different from the position in the initial tree, the PI recall and precision figures are affected less than when computing Position-Dependent figures.",
        "The position-independent figures reflect the intuition that if two trees ti and t2 both have a subtree t, t1 and t2 are more similar than if they were if they didn't share any subtree.",
        "For instance, for the spans at the sub-sentential level in the trees in Figure 2 the position-independent recall is 6/10 and the position-independent precision is 6/11 because in addition to spans [1,2], [4,4], [5,5], and [1,5], one can also match Japanese span [1,1] to English span [2,2] and Japanese span [2,2] to Japanese span [1,1].",
        "The Position-Independent figures offer a more optimistic metric for comparing discourse trees.",
        "They span a wider range of values than the Position-Dependent figures.",
        "which enables a finer grained comparison, which in turn enables a better characterization of the differences between Japanese and English discourse structures.",
        "In order to provide a better estimate of how close two discourse trees were, we computed Position-Dependent and Independent recall and precision figures for the sentential level (where units are given by edus and spans are given by sets of edus or single sentences); paragraph level (where units are given by sentences and spans are given by sets of sentences or single paragraphs): and text level (where units are given by paragraphs and spans are given by sets of paragraphs).",
        "These figures offer a detailed picture of how discourse structures and relations are mapped from one language.to the other.",
