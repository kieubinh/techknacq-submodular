      "text": [
        "This paper discusses an approach to the architecture of an experimental interactive editing tool that integrates the processes of source document composition and translation into the target language.",
        "The tool has been conceived as an optimal solution for a particular case of bilingual production of legal documentation, but it also illustrates in a more general way how to exploit the possibilities of SGML (IS08879, 1986) used extensively to annotate a whole range of linguistic and extralinguistic information in specialized bilingual corpora.",
        "SGML is well established as the coding scheme underlying most Translation Memory based systems (TMBS), and has been proposed as the coding scheme for the interchange of existing Translation Memory databases Translation Memories eXchange, TMX (Melby.",
        "1998).",
        "The advantages of SGML have also been perceived by a large community of corpus linguistics researchers.",
        "and big efforts have been made in the development of suitable markup options to encode a variety of textual types and functions as clearly demonstrated by the Text Encoding Initiative, TEI; (Burnard Speberg-MacQueen, 1995).",
        "While the tag-sets employed by TMBS are simple and task-oriented, TEI has offered a highly complex and versatile collection of tags.",
        "The guiding hypothesis in our experiment has been the idea that it is possible to explore TEI/SGML markup in order to develop a system that carries the concept of Translation Memory one step further.",
        "One important feature of SGML is the DTD.",
        "DTDs determine the logical structure of documents and how to tag them accordingly.",
        "We have concentrated on the accurate description of documents by means of TEI conformant SGML markup.",
        "The markup will help disclose the underlying logical structure of documents.",
        "From annotated documentation, DTDs can be induced and these DTDs provide the basic scheme to produce new documents.",
        "We have collected a corpus of official publications from three main institutions in the Basque Autonomous Region in Spain, the Bo-letin Oficial de Bizkaia (BOB, 1990-1995).",
        "Bo-letin Oficial de A lava (BOA, 1990-1994) and Boletin Oficial del Pais Vasco (BOPV, 1995).",
        "Documents in the corpus were composed by Administration clerks and translated by translators.",
        "Both clerks and translators have been using a wide variety of word-processors, although since 1994 MSWord has been generalized as the standard editing tool.",
        "Administrative documentation shows a regular structure, and is rich in' recurrent textual patterns.",
        "- For each document type different document tokens share a common global distribution of elements.",
        "Official document composers learn these global structures and apply them consistently.",
        "It is also the case that composers tend to reuse old",
        "document files when producing new documents of the same type.",
        "Despite the fact that no SGML software was used at the editing phase, texts in the corpus show regular logical structures and consistent distribution of text segments.",
        "Our main goal in tagging the corpus was to make all them explicit (Martinez, 1997).",
        "The most common type of document in the corpus , the Orden Foral, was chosen (see Table 1).",
        "We analysed some 100 tokens and hand-marked the most salient elements.",
        "The heuristics to identify these elements were later expressed in a collection of recognition routines in Perl and tested against a set of 400 tokens, including the initial 100.",
        "As a result of this process of automatic tagging of structural elements we produced a TEI/SGML tagged corpus with yet no corresponding overt DTD.",
        "In.",
        "Section 2 we will explain how DTDs were later induced from the tagged corpus.",
        "Once the corpus was segmented the next step was to align it.",
        "This was conducted at different levels: general document elements (DIV, SEG, P), as well as sentential and intra-sentential elements, such as S, RS, NUM, DATE, etc.",
        "(Martinez, 1998b).",
        "Aligned in this way, the corpus becomes an important resource for translation.",
        "Four complementary language databases may be obtained at any time from the annotated corpus: three translation memory databases (TM1, TM2, and TM3) as well as a terminology database (termbase).",
        "The three TMs differ in the nature of the translation units they contain.",
        "TM1 consists of aligned sentences than can feed commercial TM software.",
        "TM2 contains elements which are translation segments ranging from whole sections of a document or multi-sentence paragraphs to smaller units.",
        "such as short phrases or proper names.",
        "TM3 simply hosts the whole collection of aligned bilingual documents, where the whole document may be considered the translation unit.",
        "TM3 can be'construett as--a hilingualdocirment-database.",
        "Much redundancy originates from this TM collection, although it should be noticed that they are all by-products derived from the same annotated bitext which subsumes them all.",
        "Good software packages for TM1 and TM3 already exist in the market, and hence their exploitation is beyond our interest (Trados Translator's Workbench, Star's Transit,„SDLX Deja VU IBM's Translation Manager) for TM1; and any SGML browsing tool for TM3).",
        "The originality of our editing tool lies in a design which benefits from joining the potentiality of DTDs and the elements in TM2, as will be shown in sections 4 and 5.",
        "2 DTD abstraction SGML mark-up determines the logical structure of a document and its syntax in the form of a context-free grammar.",
        "This is called the Document Type Definition (DTD) and it contains specifications for: ® Names and content for all elements that are permitted to appear in a document.",
        "® Order in which these elements must appear.",
        "• Tag attributes with default values for those elements.",
        "DTDs have been abstracted away from the annotations that were automatically introduced in the corpus.",
        "Similar experiments have been reported before in the literature.",
        "(Ahonen, 1995) uses a method to build document instances from tagged texts that consists of a deterministic finite automaton for each context model.",
        "Subsequently, these automata are generalized and converted into regular expressions which are easily transcribed into SGML content models.",
        "(Shafer, 1995) combines document instances with simplification rules.",
        "Our method is similar to Shafer's, but with a..modification in the way rules reduce document instances.",
        "A tool to obtain a DTD for all document instances has been developed (Casillas, 1999).",
        "Given that source and target documents show some syntactic and structural mismatches, two different DTDs are induced.",
        "one for each language, and",
        "are paired through a correspondence table.",
        "Correspondences in this table can be up-dated, or deleted.",
        "At present, we have six DTDs, one for each document type in each language (there are three document types; Figure 2 shows a part of one of these DTDs).",
        "By means of these paired DTDs, document elements in each language are appropriately placed.",
        "In the process of generating the bilingual document, a document type must first be selected.",
        "Each document type has an associated DTD.",
        "This DTD specifies which elements are obligatory and which are optional.",
        "With the aid of the DTD, the source document is generated.",
        "The target document will be generated with the aid of the corresponding target DTD."

        "These <segn> tags include two attributes: id and correspond which locate the aligned segment both in the corpus and in the database (Figure 1).",
        "Segments tagged <rs> are referring expressions which have been recognized, tagged and aligned and which correspond largely to proper names (Martinez, 1998a), (Martinez, 1998b).",
        "TM2 is managed in the form of a relational database where segments are stored as records.",
        ".Each record in the database consists of four fields: the segment string, a counter for the occurrences of that string in the corpus, the tag and the attributes (type, id and corresp).",
        "Table 2 shows how the text fragment inside",
        "the </divl>...</divO> tags of Figure 1 renders three records in the database.",
        "Note how the content of the string field in the database maintains only the initial <segn> and <rs> tags.",
        "Furthermore, <rs> tagged segments inside <segn> records are simplified so that their content is dismissed and only the initial tag is kept (Lange et al., 1997).",
        "The reason is that they are considered variable elements within the segment (dates and numbers are also these type of elements).",
        "The strings Orden Foral of record 2 marked as <rs type=law> and Sala de lo Contencioso-Administrativo del Tribunal Superior de Justicia del Pais Vasco of record 3 <rs type=organization> are thus not included in record 1 <seg9>, since they may differ in other instantiations of the segment.",
        "These internal elements are largely proper names that vary from one instantiation of the segment to another.",
        "The <rs> tag can be considered to be the name of the varying element.",
        "The value of the type attribute <rs type=law> constraints the kind of referential expression that may be inserted in that point of the translation segment.",
        "Table 2 shows that source and target records may not have straight one-to-one correspondences.",
        "Although this is by no means the general case; only about 5.61%, (Martinez.",
        "1998a), such one-to-N correspondences provide good ground to explain how the TM2 is designed.",
        "The asymmetry can be easily explained.",
        "The Spanish term recurso contencioso-administrativo has been translated into Basque by means of a category changing operation, where the Spanish adjective administrativo has been translated as a Basque noun complement Administrazioarekiko which literally means \"Administration-the-with-of\" triggering its identification as a proper noun.",
        "Table 3 shows the way in which source language units are related with their corresponding target units, which, as can be observed, can be one-to-one or one-to-N.",
        "This means that one source element can have more than one translation.",
        "TM2 is created in three steps: ® First, non-pertinent tags are filtered out from the annotated corpus.",
        "Tags marking sentence <s> and paragraph <p> alignment are removed because they are of no interest for TM2 (recall that they are registered in TM1).",
        "O Second, translation segments <segn>.",
        "<title> phrases and referential expres",
        "sions <rs> are detected in the source document and looked up in the database.",
        "Third, if they are not already present in the database, they are stored each in its database and values of the id and corresp attributes are used to set the correspondence between source and target database."

        "This has two consequences.",
        "On the one hand, the selected DTD produces a source document template that contains the logical structure of the document and some of its contents.",
        "On the other hand, the selected source ,DTD triggers target paired DTD, which will be used later to translate the document.",
        "There are three different types of elements in the source document template: Some elements are mandatory and are provided to the user, who must only choose its content among some alternative usages (s/he will get a list of alternatives ordered by frequency, for example <title>).",

        "Composers may also browse TM3 to retrieve whole blocks for those parts which are not determined by the DTD.",
        "One of the clear targets for the future is to extend the coverage of the corpus and to test structural taggers against other document types.",
        "A big challenge we face is to develop tools that automatically perform the recognition of documents from less restricted and more open text types.",
        "However, we are not sure of the extent of the practicality of such an approach.",

        "It is a process currently being implemented in the Basque administration to define document models for writers and translators to follow.",
        "What we have demonstrated is that paired DTDs, complemented with rich language resources of the kind defined in this paper, allow for the design of optimal editing environments which would combine both document composition and translation as one single process.",
