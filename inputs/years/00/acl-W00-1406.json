        "During argumentation, conversational partners often use expressions of doubt, such as \"But the victim was stabbed\", and requests for the consideration of additional facts they consider relevant, such as \"What about the fingerprints found on the gun?\".",
        "In this paper, we describe a mechanism which generates rebuttals to such rejoinders in the context of arguments generated from Bayesian networks (BNs) (Pearl, 1988).",
        "This mechanism is implemented in a system called BIAS (Bayesian Interactive Argumentation System).",
        "Given an argument produced by BIAS and a follow-up rejoinder posed by a user, our mechanism generates a rebuttal on the basis of a line of reasoning identified by BIAS from the user's rejoinder.",
        "These capabilities constitute a significant step towards allowing a user to interact freely with an argumentation system and to improve the explanation capability of Bayesian systerns.",
        "Normal arguments are unconstrained in the sense that they can use whatever means are available to justify a goal proposition.'",
        "-In--contrast, rebuttals are constrained, since they must address the point through which the conversational partner attempted to undermine or question a previous argument.",
        "To illustrate the operation of BIAS and its rebuttal capability, consider the exchange in Figure 1, which consists of a preamble that contains background information.",
        "followed by an argument generated by BIAS, a user's rejoinder and BIAS' rebuttal.'",
        "The domain of implementation is a murder investigation where the question under consideration (the goal proposition) is \"Did Mr Green murder Mr Body?\" , and both the user and the system have access to evidence.",
        "After the presentation of the argument where BIAS contends Mr Green's possible innocence,2 the user presents a rejoinder which requests that BIAS consider a fact that was omitted from the argument: The found gun is available only to Mr Green.",
        "BIAS infers from this rejoinder that the user is adding support to Mr Green having the means to kill Mr Body, and hence to Mr Green's guilt, through the following line of reasoning, which is determined as described in (Zukerman et al., 2000): The gun being available only to Mr Green > The gun was fired by Mr Green 4 Mr Green had the means to kill Mr Body Mr Green killed Mr Body.",
        "BIAS finds that it does not share the user's belief in the rejoinder proposition, and that in addition, the effect of this proposition on the goal is rather weak.",
        "This prompts the generation of a rebuttal of the form Deny-Dismiss--Follow, whereby the rejoinder proposition is denied, its effect on the goal proposition is dismissed, and its implications are followed hypothetically until they break down due to the marginal effect of the rejoinder on Mr Green's guilt.",
        "In the next section, we present our knowledge representation formalism, followed by an outline of our procedure for determining a user's line of reasoning.",
        "In Section 4, we describe our algorithm for rebuttal generation and discuss our results.",

        "It is important to note that although BIAS' immediate objective is to strengthen its belief in the goal proposition, its primary purpose is to \"tell the truth\" to the best of its knowledge (which may contradict its initial beliefs), rather than to win the argument at all costs.",
        "Our algorithm supports this attitude by retaining any sub-argument which has a significant impact on the goal or on a proposition on userPath.",
        "We use this disjunctive condition on impacts in order to address a situation where a proposition P3 on userPath has been affected by a sub-argument, but does not affect the goal because of an inaccurate belief in a proposition Pk which appears later on userPath (recall that the propositions are inspected from R towards the goal).",
        "However, once a sub-argument for Pk.is presented, then P, affects the goal.",

        "Our research builds on work described in (Zukerman et al., 1998), which generated arguments from BNs, and (Zukerman et al., 1999), which enabled a user to explore the impact of different propositions on the generated arguments.",
        "The former system only generated arguments, while the latter received instructions from a user (through a menu) about modifications to be performed to a previously generated argument, e.g., including or excluding a proposition, and then generated a new argument in response to these instructions.",
        "Neither of these systems generates rebuttals which take into account a user's intentions, as done by BIAS.",
        "Several researchers have dealt with different aspects of argumentation; e.g., (Flowers et al., 1982; Quilici, 1992; Chu-Carroll and Carberry, 1995; Carberry and Lambert, 1999).",
        "Like BIAS, the system described in Carberry and Lambert (1999) combined linguistic and contextual knowledge to recognize a user's intentions from rejoinders.",
        "However, their system did not generate rebuttals.",
        "Chu-Carroll and Carberry (1995) provided a comprehensive approach for proposal evaluation which focused on dialogue strategies rather than argumentation strategies.",
        "In addition, they considered exchanges where each participant utters one or two propositions in each conversational turn.",
        "In contrast, we focus on strategies for the generation of extended probabilistic rebuttals to individual rejoinders.",
        "In the future, our strategies will be-:combined with dialogue strategies in a complete argumentation system.",
        "Flowers et al.",
        "(1982) presented a partial theory of argumentation which advocated the combination of distinct knowledge sources; their implementation focused on recognizing and providing episodic justifications to historical events.",
        "Our focus on the generation of rebuttals in the context of BNs allows us",
        "to provide an operational definition for the broad argumentation strategies discussed in the literature,_ e.g., attack the main point directly or attack the supporting evidence (Flowers et al., 1982).5 The argumentation system described in (Quilici, 1992) used a plan-based model of the user's beliefs to recognize the justification for a user's proposal and provide its own justifications.",
        "However, the rebuttals generated by this system were based on a single strategy: applying backwards chaining using a set of justification rules.",
        "This strategy is a special case of the more general rebuttal schemas presented here."

        "We have offered a mechanism for generating rebuttals to a user's rejoinders in the context of arguments generated by a Bayesian argumentation system.",
        "We have implemented three main argumentation strategies: refuting the rejoinder, strengthening the argument goal, and dismissing the user's line of reasoning.",
        "For each strategy we have identified applicability conditions, proposed a procedure which determines the information to be included in a rebuttal, and defined a presentation schema.",
        "An interesting area of future research pertains to the omission of information from an argument.",
        "There are different types of information which may be omitted from an argument, such as (1) easily inferred information and information which has a small effect on the argument; (2) information which is required for representational reasons, but makes the resulting argument more confusing; (3) probabilistic information which, although correct, makes the resulting argument more tedious; and (4) previously stated information.",
        "Our previous research deals with the first type of information (Zukerman et al., 1998), and in this paper we have identified some conditions for the omission of previously stated information when expressing the relative impact of a proposition.",
        "Another factor that affects the omission of information is the trade off between accuracy and conciseness.",
        "The omission of information affects the belief in the conclusion(s) presented in an argument.",
        "Stating beliefs that differ from a system's own beliefs may cause the system to appear inconsistent or even deceitful, while presenting all the relevant factors may yield a verbose argument.",
        "A mechanism which addresses these issues will support the generation of better arguments and rebuttals.",
        "The evaluation of this sesearch,encompasses several components: (1) the WWW interface, (2) the path-finding mechanism.",
        "and (3) the rebuttal-generation mechanism.",
        "A preliminary evaluation of 5We do not handle the \"attack the claim that the evidence gives support for the main point\" strategy, as this involves inferring Conditional Probability Matrices for the user model, which is outside the scope of this research.",
        "the path-finding mechanism has yielded encourag.ing results (Zukerman Two_,,types of evaluation are envisaged for the rebuttal-generation mechanism.",
        "A whole-system evaluation, where users interact freely with BIAS, may be used to determine whether users are satisfied with the system as a whole.",
        "In contrast, a specific evaluation of rebuttals would be restricted to showing users rejoinder-rebuttal pairs (after showing an initial argument), and eliciting the users' reactions regarding the appropriateness of the rebuttals."
