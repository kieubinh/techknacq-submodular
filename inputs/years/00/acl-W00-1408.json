        "In order to determine the users' preferences for different argumentation strategies, we performed a preliminary evaluation where we presented two sets of arguments to subjects.",
        "One set contained the premise to goal and reasoning by cases arguments for the problem of evil shown in Figure 4.",
        "The second set contained a preamble which presented some background information, and a premise to goal, a reductio ad absurdum and an inference to the best explanation argument for a large asteroid striking Earth 65 million years BC (Figure 5).",
        "The argu",
        "ments in each set were presented in two different orders.",
        "40 subjects read the 'problem of evil' arguments, and 35 the 'asteroid' arguments.",
        "In the former set, the distribution of preferences was uniform among the three strategies.",
        "In the latter set, premise to goal was preferred, followed by inference to the best explanation and then reductio ad absurdum (these results, which were not affected by the order of presentation, were supported by x2 tests which were significant at the 0.01 level).",
        "At first glance it appears that premise to goal is the preferred argumentation strategy.",
        "However, the participants' comments indicate that further experiments are required to determine the conditions under which different argumentation strategies are appropriate.",
        "For example, several participants irt-dicated that reductio ad absurdum arguments are appropriate when the ensuing contradiction is compelling, which they did not find to be the case in the asteroid example.",
        "Further, they stated that they liked the premise to goal argument because it contained more information than the other arguments (which have one line of reasoning only).",
        "However.",
        "this additional information may be less appealing for arguments that are longer than one paragraph."
