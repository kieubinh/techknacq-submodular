        "The reinterpretation exercise took the form of coming up with an account of how the interfaces to the CGS modules corresponded to the RAGS model and reimplementing a working version of each module (apart from Text Planning and Realisation) which was tested to ensure that, given appropriate input, its output was correct (i.e. conforming to the global account) on key examples.",

        "Here we have collapsed the Abstract Rhetorical and Rhetorical and the Abstract Semantic and Semantic.",
        "It is interesting to note that the build up of levels of representation does not tend to correspond exactly with module boundaries.",
        "One of the major issues we faced in our reinterpretation was where to produce representations (or partial representations) whose emergence was not defined clearly in the descriptions of CGS.",
        "For instance, many decisions about document structure are made only implicitly by the system.",
        "In most cases we have opted to produce all types of representations at the earliest point where they can conceivably have any content.",
        "This means, for instance, that our reimplementation assumes an (unimplemented) text planner which produces an Abstract Rhetorical Representation with Abstract Semantic leaves and an Abstract Document Representation.",
        "Text Planner The input to the Longbow text planner discussed in section 4 above is a representation of a picture in SAGE format (which has been annotated to indicate the types of complexity of each grapheme) together with a goal, which can typically be interpreted as \"describe\".",
        "It outputs an essentially flat sequence of plan operators, each of which corresponds in the output text 10 .a .speech act.",
        "In our reinterpretation, we have assumed that this flat structure needs to be translated into an Abstract Rhetorical Representation with (at least) minimal structure.",
        "Such a structure is implicit in the plan steps, and our interpretation of the rhetorical structure for the example text corresponds closely to that of the post-processing trace produced by CGS.",
        "However, we are still not entirely sure about where exactly CGS creates this structure, so we have imposed it at the very beginning, onto the output of the text planner.",
        "Already at this stage it is necessary to make use of mixed RAGS representations.",
        "As well as this Abstract Rhetorical Representation, the text planner has to produce an Abstract Document Representation, linked to the Abstract Rhetorical Representation.",
        "This is already partially ordered – although the exact value of POSITION features cannot be specified at this stage, the document tree is constructed so that propositions are already grouped together.",
        "In addition, we make explicit certain default information that the CGS leaves implicit at this stage, namely, that the LAYOUT feature is always wrapped text and that the TEXT-LEVEL feature of the top node is always paragraph.",
        "Ordering The ordering module takes the Abstract Document Representation and the Abstract Rhetorical Representation as input and outputs an Abstract Document Representation with the POSITION feature's value filledlor all the nodes.",
        "That is, it fixes, the linear order of the final output of the speech acts.",
        "In our example, the ordering is changed so that steps 7 and 8 are promoted to appear before 3, 4, 5 and 6.",
        "The resulting structure is shown in figure 36.",
        "Aggregation Although aggregation might seem like a self-contained process within NLG, in practice it can make changes at a number of levels of representation and indeed it may be the last operation that has an effect on several levels.",
        "The aggregation module in our reinterpretation thus has the final responsibility to convert an Abstract Rhetorical Representation with Abstract Semantic Representation leaves into a Rhetorical Representation with Semantic Representation leaves.",
        "The new Rhetorical Representation may be different from before as a result of speech acts being aggregated but whether different or not, it can now be considered final as it will no longer be changed by the system.",
        "The resulting Semantic Representations are no longer Abstract because further structure may have been determined for arguments to predicates.",

        "These \"holes\" are linked back to the knowledge.",

        "Centering Because Centering comes before Referring Expression generation and Realisation, all it can do is establish constraints that must be heeded by the later modules.",
        "At one stage, it seemed as if this required communicating a kind of information that was not covered by the RAGS datatypes.",
        "However, the fact that an NP corresponds (or not) to a center of some kind can be regarded as a kind of abstract syntactic information.",
        "The reconstruction therefore has the centering module building a partial (unconnected) Abstract Syntactic representation for each Semantic Representation that will be realised as an NP, inserting a feature that specifies whether it constitutes a forward or backward-facing center, approximately following Grosz et al. (Grosz et al., 1995).",
        "This information is used to determine whether active or passive voice will be used.",
        "An example of such a partial Abstract Syntactic Representation is given in Figure 4.",
        "Referring Expression In our reconstruction of the CGS system, we have deviated from reproducing the exact functionality for the referring expression module and part of the lexical choice module.",
        "In the CGS system, the referring expression module computes association lists which can be used by the",
        "lexical choice module to construct referring expressions suitable for realisation.",
        "In our reconstruction, however, the referring expression module directly computes the Semantic Representations of referring expressions.",
        "We believe that this is a good example of a case where developing a system with the RAGS data structures in mind simplifies the task.",
        "There are undoubtedly many different ways in which the same results could be achieved, and there are many (linguistic, engineering etc.)",
        "reasons for choosing one rather than another.",
        "Our particular choice is driven by the desire for conceptual simplicity, rather than any strictly linguistic or computational motivations.",
        "We considered for each module which RAGS level(s) it contributed to and then implemented it to manipulate that (or those) level(s).",
        "In this case, that meant a much more conceptually simple module which just adds information to the Semantic Representations.",
        "Lexical Choice In CGS, this module performs a range of tasks, including what we might call the later stages ofreferring expression generation and lexical choice, before converting the plan leaves into FDs (Functional Descriptions), which serve as the input to the FUF/SURGE module.",
        "In the reconstruction, on the other hand, referring expressions have already been computed and the Rhetorical Representation, with its now complete Semantic Representations, needs to be lexicalised\" and",
        "translated into FUF/SURGE format.",
        "Lexicalisation in our terms involves adding the lexeme and major category information to the Abstract Syntactic Representations for the semantic predicates in each Semantic Representation.",

        "The reconstruction of CGS has taken the form of working, out in detail the RAGS representations passed between modules at each stage for a set of key examples and reimplementing the modules (apart from the Planner and Realiser) in a way that correctly reproduces these representations.",
        "The actual implementation used an incrementally growing data store for the RAGS representations which the modules accessed in turn, though the passing of data could also have been achieved in other ways.",
        "The fact that the reconstruction has been successful indicates that the RAGS architecture is broadly adequate to redescribe this NLG system: • No changes to the existing levels of representation were needed, though it was necessary to make extensive use of partial and mixed representations.",
        "• No new levels of representation needed to be introduced to capture the intermodule communication of the system.",
        "• All of the levels of representation apart from the Conceptual level were used significantly in the reconstruction.",
        "In some ways, it is unfortunate that none of the intermodule interfaces of CGS turned out to use a single level of RAGS representation.",
        "Given the motivation for partial and mixed representations above, however, this did not really come as a surprise.",
        "It may well be that any really useful reusable modules for NLG will have to have this complexity.",
        "In spite of the successful testing of the RAGS data model, some difficulties were encountered: • It was difficult to determine the exact nature of the representations produced by the Planner, though in the end we were able to develop a system to automatically translate these into a format we could deal with.",
        "• Although the theoretical model of CGS has a simple modular structure, in practice the modules are very tightly integrated and making the exact interfaces explicit was not always easy.",
        "• Referring expression generation requires fur",
        "ther access to the \"knowledge base\" holding information about the graphic to be produced.",
        "This knowledge was only available via interactions with SAGE, and so it was not possible to determine whether the RAGS view of Conceptual Representations was applicable.",
        "Our own implementation of referring expression generation had to work around this problem in a non-portable way.",
        "• It became clear that there are many housekeeping tasks that an NLG system must perform following Lexical Choice in order for the final Semantic and Abstract Syntactic Representations to be appropriate for direct input to a realisation system such as FUF.",
        "o The fact that the system was driving FUF/SURGE seems to have had a significant effect on the internal representations used by CGS.",
        "The reconstruction echoed this and as a result may not be as general as could be desired.",
        "o Even though CGS only performs simple types of Aggregation, it is clear that this is a critical module for determining the final form of several levels of representation.",
        "The division of CGS into modules is different from that used in any NLG systems we have previously worked on and so has been a useful stimulus to think about ways in which reusable modules can be designed.",
        "We envisage reusing at least the reimplementation of the Centering module in our further work."
