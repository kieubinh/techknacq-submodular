        "In this paper we present a psycholinguistically motivated architecture and its prototypical implementation for an incremental conceptualizer, which monitors dynamic changes in the world and simultaneously generates warnings for (possibly) safety-critical developments.",
        "It does so by conceptualizing events and building up a hierarchical knowledge representation of the perceived states of affairs.",
        "If it detects a safety problem, it selects suitable elements from the representation for a warning, brings them into an appropriate order, and generates incremental preverbal messages (propositional structures) from them, which can be taken by a subsequent component to encode them linguistically.",
        "Systems that generate natural language descriptions of what happens in a dynamically changing world can be improved substantially by working incrementally.",
        "Incrementality enhances the overall quality of the systems for three reasons: (1) The dynamic nature of a continuous stream of input information can be handled more directly and, therefore, easier.",
        "(2) Incremental systems are capable of producing fluent speech, i.e. speech without artificial auditory gaps.",
        "(3) Parallelism that comes with incrementality makes better use of the available resources.",
        "Furthermore, Reiter (1994), who reviews the architecture of some models of natural language generation, shows that psycholinguistic and engineering approaches often result in systems, which are similar in crucial respects.",
        "In this paper we ground on two of these common aspects, namely the distinction between what-to-sale and how-to-say (De Smedt, Horacek & Zock, 1996) and the use of a pipeline architecture, which divides the generation process \"into multiple modules, with information flowing in a 'pipeline' fashion from one module to the next\" (Reiter, 1994).",
        "Reiter states that these architectures do not require modules to work in parallel; if parallelism is used one has an incremental model, cf. De Smedt & Kern-pen (1987), Ferreira (1996).",
        "The primary research topic of the ConcEv' project is the what-to-say component, in which the content of utterances is planned (Reiter's content planning, in contrast to the language specific sentence planning component).",
        "We use the terminology of Levelt (1989), who calls the first component the conceptualizer, the second the formulator.",
        "These modules interact via preverbal messages, which are propositional, non-verbal representations of the utterance built up by the conceptualizer.",
        "They are transformed by the formulator into linguistic structures for spoken or written output.",
        "Besides considering high level communicative goals (macroplanning), which are in the focus of most computational approaches to the what-to-say component, e.g. De Smedt & Kempen (1987), McKeown (1985), Hovy (1993), Chu-Carroll & Carberry (1998), Radev & McKeown (1998), the type of information to be verbalized also determines the processes of conceptualization on the level of microplanning, cf. Levelt (1989).",
        "Thus, the traditional top-down approaches have to be combined with bottom-up data-driven approaches of text planning (Marcu, 1997).",
        "The conceptualizer that is described in detail in section 3 fits the pipeline architecture on a coarse level, but integrates on finer levels the ideas of functional modules (Cahill et al., 1999).",

        "Parallel_processing has the advantage that several tasks can be done simultaneously; thus, while utterances are generated for some input, subsequent input can already be taken in and processed.",
        "Simultaneous conceptualization can be used as the basis of systems producing verbal messages when they detect a (possibly) safety-critical development while monitoring a safety-critical system, like intensive care units, nuclear power plants, or airports.",
        "A module for the generation of natural language can be an effective enhancement for monitoring for mainly two reasons: first, in most cases operators are busy observing many displays.",
        "Here the auditory presentation of information can make use of idle cognitive resources of the operators and, thus, reduce their workload in directing their attention to a development that may lead to hazardous situations.2 Second, the essential piece of information can be extracted from a highly complex set of multimodal information and presented by the system in a crisp way.",
        "Language is the best conceivable means to transfer information as pointedly as possible.",
        "Moreover, taking the dynamics of the permanently changing world into account has the advantage that safety-critical situations can be anticipated earlier and much more reliably.",
        "Conventional systems, in contrast, just compare actual measurements with allowed values and give a warning or an alarm when a violation occurs.",
        "But it is more useful, e.g. for a nurse if the system tells her that a patient's blood pressure is rapidly dropping than that his blood pressure is already dangerously low.",
        "We see the proposed implementation of an incremental conceptualizer also as a means to gain 2 The multimodal monitoring environment proposed here reflects the division of labor between the components in working memory (Baddeley, 1986), especially between the visuospatial sketchpad (VSSP) and the phonological loop.",

        "If the system has to produce descriptions about what it 'sees', the main conceptual task is building up conceptual entities representing spatio--temporal-constellations of the external world, i.e. event conceptualization.",
        "Events emerge from dynamic input data, which are segmented by the conceptual system into meaningful units (Avra-hami & Kareev, 1994).",
        "They are therefore internal representations rather than external entities: \"[...] events arise in the perception of observers\" (Zacks, 1997).",
        "Consequently, a language production system designed for verbalizing what the system perceives has to deal with information stemming from multiple modalities, e.g. auditory and spatial.",
        "In particular, a continuous multimodal `perceptual stream' has to be translated into discrete propositional output (preverbal messages) that can be encoded linguistically, cf. Levelt (1989).",
        "To meet such demands, three subtasks have to be solved: (1) The input stream has to be subdivided into 'perceptual units'; (2) conceptual representations have to be built up from these `percepts', which (3) have to be combined to preverbal messages.",
        "For the time being, we take the input stream to be strictly sequential, but later versions of our model will compute simultaneous events, as well.",
        "According to Habel & Tappe (1999) the function of the conceptualizer can be subdivided into the following processes: segmentation & grouping, structuring, selection, and linearization.",
        "The first process operates on the (perceptual) input that is segmented into meaningful basic units (segmentation), andif possibletwo or more of these units are grouped together to form more complex entities (grouping).",
        "The structuring process builds _up multilevel hierarchical structures from these meaningful basic units.",
        "To exemplify these steps we use the scenario of monitoring the :taxiing of an aircraft, viz. the movements of an aircraft from the terminal to its assigned runway and vice versa.",
