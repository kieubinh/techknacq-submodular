        "To convey information concisely and fluently, text generation systems often perform opportunistic text planning (Robin, 1995; Mellish et al., 1998) and employ advanced linguistic constructions such as ellipsis (Slime, 1998).",
        "But a system can also take advantage of quantification and ontological information to generate concise references to entities at the discourse level.",
        "For example, a sentence such as \"The patient has an infusion line in each arm.\" is a more concise version of \"The patient has an infusion line in his left arm.",

        "invalid readings are eliminated using various const raints.",
        "Ambiguity in quantified expressions is caused by two main culprits.",
        "-The first type of ambiguity involves the distributive reading versus the collective reading.",
        "In universal quantification, a referring expression refers to multiple entities.",
        "There is a potential ambiguity between whether the aggregated entities acted individually (distributive) or acted together as one (collective).",

        "Under the collective reading, the nurses inspected the patient together as a group.",
        "The other ambiguity in quantification involves multiple quantifiers in the same sentence.",

        "In Vpatient3nurse, the universal quantifier V has wide scope, outscop-ing the existential quantifier 3.",

        "In both types of ambiguities, a generation system should make the desired reading clear.",

        "Using discourse and ontological information, the system determines if quantification is appropriate and if it is, which particular quantifier to use to minimize the ambiguity between distributive and collective readings.",
        "More importantly, when there are multiple quantifiers in the same sentence, the algorithm generates different expressions for different scope orderings.",
