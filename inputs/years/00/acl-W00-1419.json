        "Controlled Languages (CLs) result from a growing concern about technical documentation quality and translation, be it human or automatic.",
        "A CL consists of a glossary and of writing rules for the linguistic aspect of the documentation.",
        "These rules are given as recommendations or prohibitions for both the lexicon and the grammar.",
        "Currently, most CLs are varieties of \"controlled English\" which derive from the Caterpillar Tractor Company Fundamental English that was elaborated .in the six-_ ties (Scheurs and Adriaens.",
        "1992).",
        "However CLs are presently being defined for German, Swedish and French.",
        "Technical writers find it difficult to comply with the writing rules of a CL which are often hard to justify (CLA.",
        "1996).",
        "For them, a CL is seen as an additional constraint on an already complex task.",
        "This is why tools have been de-Work clone while at the Aerospatiale Research Center veloped for CL users, the best known being conformity checkers/controllers such as AlethCL or SECC (CLA, 1996).",
        "A writer expects that the checking tool should not only detect errors but also propose a CL conformable expression.",
        "A. Nasr (Nasr, 1996), who worked on the problem of CL reformulation, underlines the difficulties of this task.",
        "Reformulation cannot make any hypotheses about the conformity of the input sentences, and therefore must deal with a wider variety of lexico-syntactical constructions than those allowed in a CL.",
        "Some instances of noncompliance are relatively easy to detect but much more difficult to correct: for example, sentences that are longer than the prescribed number of words.",
        "So there is little hope that human writers will ever produce documentation complying strictly with a CL even with the help of a conformity checker.",
        "We argue that it may be more promising to use NLG technology for generating documentation in.",
        "CL instead of analyzing it afterwards, as it is the case with a conformity checker.",
        "Few researchers have looked at CLs Inamea -.generation point of view.",
        ": (Nasr, .1996; Hartley and Paris, 1996): hut we think that there are very compelling reasons for taking a generation perspective, in addition to the advantages of NLG for CLs that will be presented in section 3: Â® As CLs can be viewed as linguistic specifications for human beings, it seems natural .consider them - as specifications for the linguistic component of an NLG system.",
        "o CL writing specifications come on top of other writing norms which deal with document structuring.",
        "For example, in the aeronautical industry, CLs such Simplified English (SE) (AEC, 1995) and Francais Rationalise (FR) (GIFAS, 1996) extend the ATA 100 norms (Bur, 1995) which describe the division of the document into chapters, sections, subsections, etc.",
        "reflecting a tree-structured functional organization of the airplane: a chapter corresponds to a system (e.g. main rotor), a section to a subsystem (e.g. gear box), a subsection to a sub-sub-system (e.g. set of gears), and so on.",
        "Over this thematic structure is added a communicative structure to fulfill two main goals: describe all systems of the airplane and prescribe all maintenance instructions for the airplane.",
        "The norms of the ATA can be viewed as specifications for the text structuring component of an NLG system.",
        "e The thematic and communicative structuring of the document must also conform to a systematic non-linear page numbering system and strict formatting rules using SGML tags.",
        "These constraints can be viewed as specifications for the layout component of an NLG system.",
        "So we claim that CLs should riot be considered outside the context of the production of complex structured documents, which naturally raises the question of the automatic generation of this documentation given some formal representation.",
        "This claim led V. Lux (Lux.",
        "1998) to redefine the notion of a CL.",
        "Her study has shown that only a few syntactic constraints (e.g. coordination constraints) are applicable to the whole document.",
        "Most constraints are only valid for sub-parts of the document, identified as \"textual modules'.",
        "Each textual module has a particular communicative .goal and a. precise theme according to the ATA 100 norms.",
        "It, can be divided into smaller modules: for example, the Task module is divided into simpler Sub-Task modules which are themselves composed of simpler Instructions modules.",
        "From a linguistic point of view, a textual module uses only a controlled sublanguage.",
        "V. Lux thus extended FR to a new CL .ealled.-EREM (Francais Rationalise Etendu Modulaire) comprising many CLs, each having its own syntactic rules for a specific textual module.",
        "She also performed a corpus study showing that the same textual modules could be identified for both French and English.",
        "It should thus be possible to remodu-larize SE similarly to what has been done to FR with FREM.",
        "In this paper, we therefore introduce the notion of an Extended Modular Controlled Language (EMCL) which first defines some general rules and then some more specific ones for each textual module.",
        "We now look at the problem of automatically generating technical documentation complying both to structuration norms such as ATA 100 and to the rules of an EMCL."

        "These forms can be derived directly from the treelike structure of the document given in the ATA norms.",
        "The goal is that, once the writer has finished filling in these forms, the technical documentation is already properly structured in an abstract language instead of a natural one.",
        "In a general text generation setting, using forms to describe what is to be said might seen, like a difficult task; but in the context of technical writing, the informational content is almost already prescribed and forms are thus a simple way of complying with the rules of a CL.",

        "This input can then be processed by the-How to say it and layout components.",

        "A CL forces the writer to become conscious of behavioral mechanisms that are usually automatic; The writer is thus distracted from choices made earlier in her/his writing task.",
        "So s/he often ends up writing it in the way it has to be written but does not write exactly what had to be written, thus defeating the whole purpose of a CL which was meant to produce a better expression of the information.",
        "This model also explains why a human writer has less difficulties following the ATA norms: this part of the job corresponds to conscious choices.",
        "In the NLG scenario, this is replaced by filling in some information in the forms that are presented.",
        "To sum up, the What to say component requires a modelization of the domain model and the design of a series of forms to be filled.",
        "A human writer using the NLG system has to fill forms but on the other hand, s/he does not have to learn a CL, since compliance with the CL norms is taken care by the How to say it component which we now describe."

        "To handle such numerous lexically dependent syntactic rules, a formalism based on a lexicalized grammar is needed.",
        "We chose Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) for the following reasons:",
        "â¢ A text generation formalism inspired from LTAG, called G-TAG, has been designed, implemented and used in several applications (Danlos and Meunier, 1996; Meunier, 1997; Danlos, 1998; Meunier and Danlos, 1998; Danlos, 2000).",

        "as sentence connectors by extending LTAG to handle discourse comprised of more than one sentence.",
        "One of the major innovations of FREM compared to FR (and of EMCL compared to CL) is to implement rules for connecting sentences (clauses).",
        "The way to connect sentences has largely been ignored in CLs, although this linguistic issue raises ambiguities which can lead to maintenance errors.",

        "Only one of these operations is right, the other one may lead to a maintenance error.",
        "On the other hand, traditional syntactical ambiguities such as a preposi,tional at tachment:.will-not- usually lead to maintenance errors because the technician can usually solve them on the basis of some domain knowledge.",

        "if the rule to write an Instruction",
        "changes from \"Put a verb in the infini-tive\" to \"Insert an imperative\", then this must be changed everywhere in the lexicalized grammar.",
        "Using the metagrammar we can achieve this quite easily because of the hierarchical organization of a LTAG: with only one rule, an imperative can be allowed and an infinitive disallowed (in a main clause) for every verb, whatever its argument structure and syntactic construction.",
        "G-TAG thus seems a good candidate for producing technical documentation complying with the constraints of an (EM)CL.",

        "We should also provide revision tools to allow the writer to fine tune the final text.",
