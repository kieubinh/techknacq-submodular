        "This paper deals with the generation of definite (i.e., uniquely referring) descriptions containing semantically vague expressions (`large, 'small', etc.).",
        "Firstly, the paper proposes a semantic analysis of vague descriptions that does justice to the context-dependent meaning of the vague expressions in them.",
        "Secondly, the paper shows how this semantic analysis can be implemented using a modification of the Dale and Reiter (1995) algorithm for the generation of referring expressions.",
        "A notable feature of the new algorithm is that, unlike Dale and Reiter (1995), it covers plural as well as singular NPs.",
        "This algorithm has been implemented in an experimental NLG program using PropiT.",
        "The paper concludes by formulating some pragmatic constraints that could allow a generator to choose between different semantically correct descriptions."

        "The problems are caused partly by the extreme context-dependence of the expressions involved, and partly by the resistance of vague properties to discrete mathematical modeling (e.g., Synthese 1975, Pinkal 1995).",
        "The weight of these problems is increased by fact that vague expressions are ubiquitous in many domains.",
        "The present paper demonstrates how a Natural Language Generation (NLG) program can be enabled to - generate uniquely referring descriptions containing one gradable adjective, despite the vagueness of the adjective.",

        "One property setting our treatment of vagueness apart from that in other NLG programs-(e.g. Goldberg 1994) is that it uses vague properties for an exact task, namely the ruling out of distractors in referring expressions (Dale and Reiter 1995).",
        "Another distinctive property is that our account allows the 'meaning' of vague expressions to be determined by a combination of linguistic context (i.e., the Common Noun following the adjective) and nonlinguistic context (i.e., the properties of the elements in the domain)."

        "In 24 cases, the lists had the following form: illxyz111, where each of x, y, z equalled either 6 or 9, and where there were always two numbers among x, y, z that appear in brackets.",
        "In 16 out of 24 cases, the two bracketed positions are right next to each other, allowing us to test whether spatial contiguity plays any role.",
        "Subjects were presented with two additional situations, namely 1 1 1 (6) 1 (7) 1 1 1 and 1 1 1 (7) 1 (6) 1 1 1 in which, unlike the other 24 situations, the two largest numbers are not equally large, to make sure that the descriptions do not require the elements in their denotation to be similar in that respect.",
        "Our questions were presented via email to 30 third-year psychology/cognitive science students at the University of Durham.",
        "UK.",
        "all of whom were native speakers of English and ten of which responded.",
        "Results: Eight subjects responded in exact conformance with the analysis of section 2.1, marking all and only those five sequences in which the highest numbers appeared in brackets.",
        "Only two subjects deviated slightly from this analysis: one of the two (subject 9) described all the expected situations as 'correct' plus the two cases in which Iwo coutiguous 6-es appeared in brackets: the other subject.",
        "(subject 10) appears to havtc wade a tvp:rig error.",
        "confusing two subsequent situations in the experiment.9 All other responses of subjects 9 and 10 were as predicted.",
        "This means.that all subjects except subject 10 were consistent with our hypothesis.",
        "The experiment suggests that the converse of the hypothesis might also be true, in which it is claimed that expressions of the form 'the n large CN' cannot be employed to refer to the set S unless S consists of the n largest objects in D: Hypothesis (-): In a situation in which the domain D represents the set of perceptually, relevant objects;:,a,mexpre.ssion of the form 'the n large CN' (where n > 1), can only be used to refer to a set S of cardinality n if all objects in D S are smaller than any of the n. Again disregarding subject 10, eight out of nine subjects act in accordance with Hypothesis while only one appears to follow a somewhat more liberal rule.",
        "Given these findings, it appears to he safe to build a generator that implements both hypotheses, since none of our subjects would be likely to disagree with any of the descriptions generated by it.",
        "This experiment has evident limitations.",
        "In particular, it has no bearing on the pragmatic constraints suggested in section 5.2, which might be tested in a follow-up experiment."
