        "We are engaged in the construction and implementation of a theory of content-planning for complex, mixed-initiative task-oriented dialogs based on corpus analysis, for use in dialog systems such as the TRIPS system (Allen et al., 2000)'.",
        "Our basic premise is that a conversational agent should be able to produce whatever a human can produce in similar discourse situations, and that if we can explain why a human produced a particular contribution,",
        "we can program a conversational agent to produce something similar.",
        "Therefore, in examining our dialogs the question we must answer is \"Why did this speaker produce this?\".",
        "RST is a descriptive theory of hierarchical structure in discourse that identifies functional relationships between discourse parts based on the intentions behind their production (Mann and Thompson, 1987).",
        "It has been used in content planning systems for text (effectively text monolog) (e.g. (Cawsey, 1993), (Hovy, 1993), (Moore and Paris, 1993)).",
        "It has not yet been used much in content planning for spoken dialog.",
        "Because the dialogs we are examining are task-oriented, they are hierarchically structured and so provide a natural place to use RST.",
        "In fact, in order to uncover the full structure behind discourse contributions, it is necessary for us to use a model of rhetorical structure.",
        "Certain dialog contributions are explained by the speaker's rhetorical goals.",
        "rather than by task goals.",
        "In example 1, utterance 3 is justification for utterance 1 but does not directly-contribute to completing the task.",
        "The details of how to apply RST to spoken dialog are unclear.",
        "If we mark rhetorical structure only within individual turns (as has generally been the case in annotations of text dialog, e.g. (Moser et I996),(Cawsey, 1993)), we miss the structure in contributions like example 1 or example 2.",
        "There is also the question of how to handle dialog-specific behaviors: grounding utterances and back-channels (utterances that maintain the communication), and abandoned or interrupted utterances.",
        "Example 2 (simplified) A 1 Bus C at Irondequoit broke down.",

        "Initial annotation",
        "In our first attempt to annotate, we removed abandoned utterances, back-channels, and simple acknowledgments such as \"Okay\".",
        "We used utterances as minimal units; utterances were segmented using prosodic and syntactic cues and speaker changes (see 3.2.2).",
        "We did occasionally split an utterance into two units if it consisted of two phrases or clauses separated by a cue word such as \"because\".",
        "Two annotators, working separately, marked one complete dialog using Michael O'Donnell's RST annotation tool (1997).",
        "They used the set of relations in (Mann and Thompson, 1987), and some additional relations specific to dialog or to our domain.",
        "Examples of the additional relations are given in figure 1.",
        "When we compared the results, the tree structures obtained were similar, but the relation labels were very different, and in neither case was the entire dialog covered.",
        "Also, the annotators found structure not covered by the relations given.",
        "As a result, we stopped the annotation project and started developing an annotation scheme that would retain rhetorical relations while dealing with the difficulties we had encountered.",

        "The elaboration relation is too broad; in some sections of our dialogs almost every utterance is an elaboration of the first one, but the utterances cover a wide variety of different types of elaborations.",
        "Anticipating this, we had given the annotators several more specific relations (see figure 1), but we also allowed them to use the elaboration tag in case a type of elaboration arose for which there was no subtype.",
