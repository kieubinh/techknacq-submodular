        "We start initially with a relational database, as defined by a set of tab-delimited database files, plus some minimal semantics.",

        "See figure 2.",

        "Mapping Domain taxonomy onto Upper Model: ILEX uses an Upper Model (a domain-independent semantic taxonomy, see Bateman (1990)), which supports the grammatical expression of entities, e.g., selection of pronoun, differentiation between mass and count entities, between things and qualities, etc.",
        "We require that the basic types in the domain taxonomy are mapped onto the upper model, to allow the entities to be gramtnaticalised and lexicalised appropriately.",
        "With just this semantics, we can generate texts, although impoverished texts, such as: The class of J-997 is necklace.",

        "Several tricks are needed to generate without a specified domain semantics: Â® Use of standard clause templates: lacking any knowledge of how different attributes are to be expressed, the system .can only generate each attribute using a standard template structures., such as the X of Y is Z or It's X is Z.",
        "The attribute names, e.g., Designer, Style, etc.",

        "Lacking a name, it is possible for the system to form nominal references using the Class attribute of the entity (all entities in ILEX databases are required to have this attribute provided).",
        "We could thus generate indefinite references such as a brooch as first mentions, and on subsequent mentions, generate forms such as the brooch or the brooch whose designer is Jessie M. King.",
        "Without specification of which entities should be considered part of the general knowledge of the reader, we must assume all entities are initially unknown.",
        "o Fact Annotations: ILEX was designed to work with various extra information known about facts, such as the assumed level of interest to the current reader model, the importance of the fact to the system's educational agenda, and the assumed assimilation of the information (how well does the system believe the reader to already understand it).",
        "See the main paper for more details.",
        "Lacking this information, the system assumes an average value for interest and importance.",
        "and a 0 value for assimilation (totally unknown).",
        "With only default values, the system cannot customise the text to the particular user.",
        "It may provide information already well known by the user, and thus risking boring them.",
        "Also, there can be no selection of information to ensure that the more interesting and important information is provided on earlier pages (the reader may not bother to look at later pages).",
        "Other information (defeasible rules), which allows us to organise the material into complex rhetorical structure, is also missing.",
