        "Speech recognition has advanced considerably, but has been limited almost entirely either to situations in which close speaking microphones are natural and acceptable (telephone, dictation, command&control, etc.)",
        "or in which high-quality recordings are ensured.",
        "Furthermore, most recognition applications involve controlled recording environments, in which the user turns the recognition event on and off and speaks cooperatively for the purpose of being recognized.",
        "Unfortunately, the majority of situations in which humans speak with each other fall outside of these limitations.",
        "When we meet with others, we speak without turning on or off equipment, or we dont require precise positioning vis a vis the listener.",
        "Recognition of speech during human encounters, or meeting recognition, therefore represents the ultimate frontier for speech recognition, as it forces robustness, knowledge of context, and integration in an environment and/or human experience."

      "text": [
        "Over the last three years we have explored meeting recognition at the Interactive Systems Laboratories [5, 6, 7].",
        "Meeting recognition is performed as one of the components of a meeting browser; a search retrieval and summarization tool that provides information access to unrestricted human interactions and encounters.",
        "The system is capable of automatically constructing a searchable and browsable audiovisual database of meetings.",
        "The meetings can be described and indexed in somewhat unorthodox ways, including by what has been said (speech), but also by who said it (speaker&face ID), where (face, pose, gaze, and sound source tracking), how (emotion tracking), and why, and other meta-level descriptions such as the purpose and style of the interaction, the focus of attention, the relationships between the participants, to name a few (see [1, 2, 3, 4]).",
        "The problem of speech recognition in unrestricted human meetings is formidable.",
        "Error rates for standard recognizers are 5-10 times higher than for dictation tasks.",
        "Our explorations based on LVCSR systems trained on BN, reveal that several types of mismatches are to blame [6]: Mismatched and/or degraded recording conditions (remote, different microphone types), Mismatched dictionaries and language models (typically ideosynchratic discussions highly specialized on a topic of interest for a small group and therefore very different from other existing tasks), Mismatched speaking-style (informal, sloppy, multiple speakers talking in a conversational style instead of single speakers reading prepared text).",
        "In the following sections, we describe experiments and improvements based on our Janus Speech Recognition Toolkit JRTk [8] applied to transcribing meeting speech robustly."

      "text": [
        "As a first step towards unrestricted human meetings each speaker is equipped with a clip-on lapel microphone for recording.",
        "By this choice interferences can be reduced but are not ruled out completely.",
        "Compared to a close-talking headset, there is significant channel crosstalk.",
        "Quite often one can hear multiple speakers on a single channel.",
        "Since meetings consist of highly specialized topics, we face the problem of a lack of training data.",
        "Large databases are hard to collect and can not be provided on demand.",
        "As a consequence we have focused on building LVCSR systems that are robust against mismatched conditions as described above.",
        "For the purpose of building a speech recognition engine on the meeting task, we combined a limited set of meeting data with English speech and text data from various sources, namely Wall Street Journal (WSJ), English Spontaneous Scheduling Task (ESST), Broadcast News (BN), Crossfire and Newshour TV news shows.",
        "The meeting data consists of a number of internal group meeting recordings (about one hour long each), of which fourteen are used for experiments in this paper.",
        "A subset of three meetings were chosen as the test set."

        "The baseline language model is trained on the BN corpus.",
        "Our baseline system has been evaluated across the above mentioned tasks resulting in the word error rates shown in Table 1.",
        "While we achieve a first pass WER of 18.5% on all F-conditions and 9.6% on the F0-conditions in the Broadcast News task, the word error rate of 44.2% on meeting data is quite high, reflecting the challenges of this task.",
        "Results on the ESST system [9] are even worse with a WER of 54.1% which results from the fact that ESST is a highly specialized system trained on noise-free but spontaneous speech in the travel domain."

      "text": [
        "The BN acoustic models have been adapted to the meeting data thru Viterbi training, MLLR (Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression), and MAP (Maximum A Posteriori) adaptation.",
        "To improve the robustness towards the unseen channel conditions, speaking mode and training/test mismatch, we trained a system BN+ESST using a mixed training corpus.",
        "The comparison of the results indicate that the mixed system is more robust (44.2% 42.2%), without loosing the good performance on the original BN test set (18.5% vs. 18.4%).",
        "To tackle the lack of training corpus, we investigated linear interpolation of the BN and the meeting (MT) language model.",
        "Based on a cross-validation test we calculated the optimal interpolation weight and achieved a perplexity reduction of 21.5% relative compared to the MT-LM and more than 50% relative compared to the BN-LM.",
        "The new language model gave a significant improvement decreasing the word error rate to 38.7%.",
        "Overall the error rate was reduced by relative (44.2% 38.7%) compared to the BN baseline system."

        "Frequently however this assumption does not apply.",
        "We have also carried out experiments aimed at producing robust recognition when microphones are positioned at varying distances from the speaker.",
        "In this case data, specific for the microphone distance and SNR found in the test condition is unavailable.",
        "We therefore apply a new method, Model Combination based Acoustic Mapping (MAM) to the recognition of speech at different distances.",
        "MAM was originally pro posed for recognition in different car noise environments, please refer to [10, 11] for details.",
        "MAM estimates an acoustic mapping on the log-spectral domain in order to compensate for noise condition mismatches between training and test.",
        "During training, the generic acoustic models and a variable noise model are estimated.",
        "Then, model combination is applied to get new generic models , which correspond to noisy speech.",

        "We applied MAM to data that was recorded simultaneously by an array of microphones positions at different distances from the speaker.",
        "Each speaker read several paragraphs of text from the Broadcast News corpus.",
        "The results of experiments with nine speakers (5 male, 4 female) are summarized in Table 2.",
        "Experiments suggest that MAM effectively models the signal condition found in the test resulting in substantial performance improvements.",
        "It outperforms unsupervised MLLR adaptation while requiring less computational effort."
