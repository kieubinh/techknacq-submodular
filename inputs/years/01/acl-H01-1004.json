This experiment explores how the amount and structure of information presented in complex lists influences the user experience and the ability of subjects to successfully complete a selection task. Presenting all the relevant information needed for a decision at once was the factor that most positively influenced successful task completion and the user experience. Subjects preferred hearing all of the relevant information about each flight, without initiating additional dialog with the system. Additionally, successful task completion rates improved when all of the flights were presented at once, without any intervening questions from the system. Keywords",

        "AT&T Communicator is a state-of-the-art spoken dialogue system that allows the end-user to select and reserve various travel related resources, in particular, airfare, hotel, and rental cars [2].",
        "One of its most challenging dialog modules is that for presenting information that allows the user to select a desired air travel itinerary.",
        "While selecting between multiple possible itineraries in a visual domain is a relatively simple task because most of the selection criteria are listed in a single scrollable page, the same task is likely to have a much higher cognitive load in an audio only domain [1, 3].",
        "The selection criteria for each candidate flight must be presented to the user serially, leading to higher cognitive demands that could result in errors in itinerary selection.",
        "A sample AT&T Communicator dialog with the prototype used in this experiment, showing the outbound flight only, follows.",
        "System: Hello, this is AT&T Communicator.",
        "How may I help with your travel plans?",
        "User: Yeah, Id like to fly from Newark to San Francisco.",
        "System: OK, a flight from Newark, New Jersey to San Francisco, California.",
        "And will this be a round trip?",
        "User: Yes, and I need to arrive in San Francisco by 4 PM on November 22nd.",
        "System: I found five outbound United Airlines flights.",
        "Option 1 is flight number 635.",
        "It has one stop; it departs at 10:15 A.M. and arrives at 2:42 P.M. <pause> Option 2 is flight number 7535.",
        "It has one stop; It departs at 12:20 P.M., and arrives at 4:37 P.M. <pause> Option 3 is flight number 837.",
        "It' s a non-stop flight; it departs at 2:00 P.M. and arrives at 5:01 P.M. <pause> Would you like to hold any of these flights?",
        "User:I guess Ill take option one.",
        "System: Got it.",
        "Note that the second to the last system utterance, in which a set of itineraries are presented to the user for selection, is by far the longest system utterance in the dialog.",
        "This utterance includes a complex list of information.",
        "Unlike a more simple list, each list item (option) contains a number of sub-items, for example flight number, number of stops, etc.",
        "In early dialog evaluations of the Communicator system, the selection of a single itinerary from such a complex list of flights was a source of substantial usability problems; users frequently became frustrated.",
        "In fact, many users dropped out of the dialog before successfully selecting an itinerary.",
        "This paper describes an experiment in which we vary the amount and structure of information presented about available itineraries.",
        "We predict that the amount and structure of information presented affects the ability of users to successfully select the optimal itinerary within a set, and influences subjective measures such as user satisfaction."

        "Subsequent steps in the flow of control could be skipped if multiple pieces of information were presented at a single dialog point.",

        "Also, based on subject comments, it appeared that at least some subjects in the Separate 3 condition were confused about the number of flights they had available to select between.",

        "It may be that a more difficult set of tasks would elicit stronger differences in both the objective and subjective measures for the levels of this factor.",
        "However, in absolute terms, the task completion rates with Separate 5 and Combined were both high (90% and 83%, respectively), relative to the Separate 1 and Separate 3 conditions (60% and 57%, respectively).",
        "Anecdotal evidence sheds some additional light on the issue of which condition (Separate 5 or Combined) is preferred by subjects.",
        "In the Verbose condition, the last 17 subjects run in the experiment were asked a few questions that provide evidence concerning their subjective impressions of the four levels of the number of flights before question factor.",

        "The Separate 5 and Combined conditions had similar task completion rates and were not significantly different.",
        "However, the Combined condition was the only condition considered worst by subjects.",
        "Thus, the condition that maximized both successful task completion and user experience was the Verbose Separate 5 condition.",
        "A major concern in the design of this experiment was that the audio presentation of lists of complex information, in this case lists of multiple airline flights each containing multiple pieces of information, would result in cognitive overload.",
        "These findings argue that, for this task, our concern about the increased cognitive load in an audio-only domain was unfounded.",
        "There are a couple of possible reasons that cognitive load did not appear to have the influence that we anticipated.",
        "First, users knew their constraints when listening to the flights.",
        "Some users may have used a strategy of only remembering the options that potentially matched their constraints.",
        "Second, many subjects apparently dealt with the increased cognitive load by taking notes, with flight times, etc., while completing the experimental tasks.",
        "Such behaviour is certainly common when making airline reservations with a human travel agent over the telephone.",
        "Further, it is anticipated that users would generally book flights in a hands-free environment, and would be able to take notes, when it is desirable.",
        "Although less ecologically valid, future experiments primarily concerned with the issue of cognitive load should explicitly preclude subjects from taking notes.",
        "From the above data, it appears that the standard user interface practices for Prompt & Collect (in which the system prompts the user for a specific piece of information and then collects their response) should be different than the standard practice for Selecting from a List.",
        "For Prompt & Collect, the standard UI practice is for the system to be as terse as possible when prompting the user.",
        "The user generally knows the information the system is asking for, they just need to be prompted so that they know what piece of information the system is currently ready to accept.",
        "When Selecting from a List, however, the level of knowledge of the system and user are very different.",
        "The system knows the possible items that can be selected.",
        "The user begins the interaction only knowing their own constraints (and their relative priority).",
        "The system must present all the relevant information so that the user can select the optimal item from the list based on their constraints and priorities.",
        "Consequently, when the user must select an item from a list, the system should be as verbose as necessary and present all the information relevant to their decision at once.",
        "For the task of selecting between multiple airline flights, the following information should definitely be presented to users about each flight: price, arrival time, departure time, number of stops and airline.",
        "While there was agreement between subjects on the important selection criteria for flights, there are also some individual differences.",
        "For example, some users like to fly only a particular airline or have strong preferences concerning the locations of layovers.",
        "This experiment indicates that users like to hear all of the information relevant to their decision at once.",
        "Therefore, if a user asks a question concerning information that is not by default presented by the system about each flight, the information presented to that user for each subsequent flight on that call, should include the information they have requested.",
        "For example, if after the first flight the user asks Where does that flight stop?, the information for all subsequent flights in that call should include the location of any stops.",
        "It thus appears likely that subjects in this experiment were using AT&T Communicator as a tool, rather than as a conversational or negotiating partner.",
        "That is, their goal was to use Communicator to quickly and efficiently select the single flight that best matched the criteria given to them in each task.",
        "Asking the system questions in order to get information relevant to this selection process, would decrease the speed and efficiency with which they were able to accomplish this task.",
        "So, subjects preferred the most verbose presentation of information in order to increase the speed and efficiency of the overall task.",
        "Nevertheless, eighty percent of the subjects stated that the most important criterion when personally selecting a flight was price.",
        "A number of subjects commented that they were willing to trade off other important criterion, e.g. airline, number of stops, in order to get a better price.",
        "In a more complex selection task, where the user is choosing a set of flights based on multiple, competing selection criteria, the user may wish to use AT&T Communicator as a negotiating partner in order to get the best flight available.",
        "Such a negotiation might lend itself well to exploring machine-user dialog in a natural language telephony based system."
