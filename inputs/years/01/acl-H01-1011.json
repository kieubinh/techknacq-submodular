        "In this paper, we implemented a set of title generation methods using training set of 21190 news stories and evaluated them on an independent test corpus of 1006 broadcast news documents, comparing the results over manual transcription to the results over automatically recognized speech.",
        "We use both F1 and the average number of correct title words in the correct order as metric.",
        "Overall, the results show that title generation for speech recognized news documents is possible at a level approaching the accuracy of titles generated for perfect text transcriptions."

        "To create a title for a document is a complex task.",
        "To generate a title for a spoken document becomes even more challenging because we have to deal with word errors generated by speech recognition.",
        "Historically, the title generation task is strongly connected to traditional summarization because it can be thought of extremely short summarization.",
        "Traditional summarization has emphasized the extractive approach, using selected sentences or paragraphs from the document to provide a summary.",
        "The weaknesses of this approach are inability of taking advantage of the training corpus and producing summarization with small ratio.",
        "Thus, it will not be suitable for title generation tasks.",
        "More recently, some researchers have moved toward “learning approaches” that take advantage of training data.",
        "Witbrock and Mittal [1] have used Naïve Bayesian approach for learning the document word and title word correlation.",
        "However they limited their statistics to the case that the document word and the title word are same surface string.",
        "Hauptmann and Jin [2] extended this approach by relaxing the restriction.",
        "Treating title generation problem as a variant of Machine translation problem, Kennedy and Hauptmann [3] tried the iterative Expectation-Maximization algorithm.",
        "To avoid struggling with organizing selected title words into human readable sentence, Hauptmann [2] used K nearest neighbour method for generating titles.",
        "In this paper, we put all those methods together and compare their performance over 1000 speech recognition documents.",
        "We decompose the title generation problem into two parts: learning and analysis from the training corpus and generating a sequence of title words to form the title.",
        "For learning and analysis of training corpus, we present five different learning methods for comparison: Naïve Bayesian approach with limited vocabulary, Naïve Bayesian approach with full vocabulary, K nearest neighbors, Iterative Expectation-Maximization approach, Term frequency and inverse document frequency method.",
        "More details of each approach will be presented in Section 2.",
        "For the generating part, we decompose the issues involved as follows: choosing appropriate title words, deciding how many title words are appropriate for this document title, and finding the correct sequence of title words that forms a readable title ‘sentence’.",
        "The outline of this paper is as follows: Section 1 gave an introduction to the title generation problem.",
        "The details of the experiment and analysis of results are presented in Section 2.",
        "Section 3 discusses our conclusions drawn from the experiment and suggests possible improvements."

      "heading": "2.2 Evaluation",
      "text": [
        "First, we evaluate title generation by different approaches using the F1 metric.",
        "For an automatically generated title Tauto, F1 is measured against corresponding human assigned title Thuman as follows: F 1 = 2×precision×recall / (precision + recall) Here, precision and recall is measured respectively as the number of identical words in Tauto and Thuman over the number of words in Tauto and the number of words in Thuman.",
        "Obviously the sequential word order of the generated title words is ignored by this metric.",
        "To measure how well a generated title compared to the original human generated title in terms of word order, we also measured the number of correct title words in the hypothesis titles that were in the same order as in the reference titles.",
        "We restrict all approaches to generate only 6 title words, which is the average number of title words in the training corpus.",
        "Stop words were removed throughout the training and testing documents and also removed from the titles."

        "The experiment was conducted both on the closed caption transcripts and automatic speech recognized transcripts.",
        "The F1 results and the average number of correct title word in correct order are shown in Figure 1 and 2 respectively.",
        "KNN works surprisingly well.",
        "KNN generates titles for a new document by choosing from the titles in the training corpus.",
        "This works fairly well because both the training set and test set come from CNN news of the same year.",
        "Compared to other methods, KNN degrades much less with speech-recognized transcripts.",
        "Meanwhile, even though KNN performance not as well as TF.IDF and NBL in terms of F1 metric, it performances best in terms of the average number of correct title words in the correct order.",
        "If consideration of human readability matters, we would expect KNN to outperform considerately all the other approaches since it is guaranteed to generate human readable title.",
        "NBF performs much worse than NBL.",
        "NBF performances much worse than NBL in both metrics.",
        "The difference between NBF and NBL is that NBL assumes a document word can only generate a title word with the same surface string.",
        "Though it appears that NBL loses information with this very strong assumption, the results tell us that some information can safely be ignored.",
        "In NBF, nothing distinguishes between important words and trivial words.",
        "This lets frequent, but unimportant words dominate the document-word-title-word correlation.",
        "Light learning approach TF.IDF performances considerably well compared with heavy learning approaches.",
        "Surprisingly, heavy learning approaches, NBL, NBF and EM algorithm didn’t out performance the light learning approach TF.IDF.",
        "We think learning the association between document words and title words by inspecting directly the document and its title is very problematic since many words in the document don’t reflect its content.",
        "The better strategy should be distilling the document first before learning the correlation between document words and title words.",

        "The fact that NBL out performances NBF and TF.IDF out performance NBL and suggests that we need to distinguish important document words from those trivial words."
