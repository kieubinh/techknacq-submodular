        "This paper describes a dialogue act tagging scheme developed for the purpose of providing finer-grained quantitative dialogue metrics for comparing and evaluating DARPA COMMUNICATOR spoken dialogue systems.",
        "We show that these dialogue act metrics can be used to quantify the amount of effort spent in a dialogue maintaining the channel of communication or, establishing the frame for communication, as opposed to actually carrying out the travel planning task that the system is designed to support.",
        "We show that the use of these metrics results in a 7% improvement in the fit in models of user satisfaction.",
        "We suggest that dialogue act metrics can ultimately support more focused qualitative analysis of the role of various dialogue strategy parameters, e.g. initiative, across dialogue systems, thus clarifying what development paths might be feasible for enhancing user satisfaction in future versions of these systems."

        "Recent research on dialogue is based on the assumption that dialogue acts provide a useful way of characterizing dialogue behaviors in human-human dialogue, and potentially in human-computer dialogue as well [16, 27, 11, 7, 1].",
        "Several research efforts have explored the use of dialogue act tagging schemes for tasks such as improving recognition performance [27], identifying important parts of a dialogue [12], and as a constraint on nominal expression generation [17].",
        "This paper reports on the development and use of a dialogue act tagging scheme for a rather different task: the evaluation and comparison of spoken dialogue systems in the travel domain.",
        "We call this scheme DATE: Dialogue Act Tagging for Evaluation.",
        "Our research on the use of dialogue act tagging for evaluation focuses on the corpus of DARPA COMMUNICATOR dialogues collected in the June 2000 data collection [28].",
        "This corpus consists of 662 dialogues from 72 users calling the nine different COMMUNICATOR travel planning systems.",
        "Each system implemented a log-file standard for logging system behaviors and calculating a set of core metrics.",
        "Each system utterance and each recognizer result was logged, and user utterances were transcribed and incorporated into the logfiles.",
        "The logfile standard supported the calculation of metrics that were hypothesized to potentially affect the user’s perception of the system; these included task duration, per turn measures, response latency measures and ASR performance measures.",
        "Each dialogue was also hand labelled for task completion.",
        "The hypothesis underlying our approach is that a system’s dialogue behaviors have a strong effect on the user’s perception of the system.",
        "Yet the core metrics that were collected via the logfile standard represent very little about dialogue behaviors.",
        "For example, the logging counts system turns and tallies their average length, but doesn’t distinguish turns that reprompt the user, or give instructions, from those that present flight information.",
        "Furthermore, each COMMUNICATOR system had a unique dialogue strategy and a unique way of achieving particular communicative goals.",
        "Thus, in order to explore our hypothesis about the differential effect of these strategies, we needed a way to characterize system dialogue behaviors that would capture such differences yet be applied uniformly to all nine systems.",
        "While some sites logged system dialogue behaviors using site-specific dialogue act naming schemes, there existed no scheme that could be applied across sites.",
        "Our goal was thus to develop a dialogue act tagging scheme that would capture important distinctions in this set of dialogues; these distinctions must be useful for testing particular hypotheses about differences among dialogue systems.",
        "We also believed that it was important for our tagging scheme to allow for multiple views of each dialogue act.",
        "This would allow us, for example, to investigate what part of the task an utterance contributes to separately from what speech act function it serves.",
        "A central claim of the paper is that these goals require a tagging scheme that makes distinctions within three orthogonal dimensions of utterance classification: (1) a SPEECH-ACT dimension; (2) a TASK-SUBTASK dimension; and (3) a CONVERSATIONAL-DOMAIN dimension.",
        "Figure 1 shows a COMMUNICATOR dialogue with each system utterance classified on these three dimensions.",
        "The labels on each utterance are fully described in the remainder of the paper.",
        "Sections 2, 3, and 4, describe the three dimensions of DATE.",
        "In these sections, we describe two aspects of our annotation scheme that are not captured in existing tagging schemes, which we believe are important for characterizing how much effort in a dialogue is devoted to the task versus different kinds of dialogue maintenance.",
        "Section 5 describes how the dialogue act labels are assigned to system utterances and section 6 discusses results showing that the DATE dialogue act metrics improve models of user satisfaction by an absolute 7% (an increase from 38% to 45%).",
        "The dialogueue act metrics that are important predictors of user satisfaction are various kinds of meta-dialogue, apologies and acts that may be landmarks for achieving particular dialogueue subtasks.",
        "In section 7 we summarize the paper, discuss our claim that a dialogue annotation .",
        "scheme is a partial model of a natural class of dialogues, and discuss the ways in which the DATE scheme may be generalizable to other dialogue corpora."

        "In the COMMUNICATOR corpus, many systems use a conservative strategy of providing feedback indicating the system’s understanding of the information provided by the user after each user turn.",
        "A typical example is the repetition of the origin and destination cities in Figures 1 and 6.",
        "This type of repetition is the IMPLICIT-CONFIRMATION speech-act (see Section 3 below).",
        "Some systems used a variable confirmation strategy where some information items may be confirmed as they are understood, but the system requests explicit confirmation of all task parameters before searching the database for matching flights.",

        "These explicit confirmations have the goal of avoiding a costly database lookup, where the retrieval is conditioned on the wrong parameters.",

        "Examples of each speech-act type are in Figure 4.",

        "The PRESENT-INFO speech-acts also often pertain directly to the domain task of making travel arrangements: the system presents the user with a choice of itinerary (There are several flights from Dallas Fort Worth to Salisbury Maryland which depart between eight in the morning and noon on October fifth.",
        "You can fly on American departing at eight in the morning or ten thirty two in the morning, or on US Air departing at ten thirtyfive in the morning.",
        "), as well as a ticket price (Ticketprice is 495 dollars), or hotel or car options.",

        "They typically occur after the prerequisite travel information has been obtained, and choices have been retrieved from the database.",

        "I will book this leg or I am making the reservation.",

        "The speech-act inventory also includes two types of speech acts whose function is to confirm information that has already been provided by the caller.",
        "In order to identify and confirm the parameters of the trip, systems may ask the caller direct questions, as in SYS3 and SYS4 in Figure 2.",
        "These EXPLICIT-CONFIRM speech acts are sometimes triggered by the system’s belief that a misunderstanding may have occurred.",
        "A typical example is Are you traveling to Dallas?.",
        "An alternative form of the same EXPLICIT-CONFIRM speech-act type asserts the information the system has understood and asks for confirmation in an immediately following question: I have you arriving in Dallas.",
        "Is that correct?",
        "In both cases, the caller is intended to provide a response.",
        "A less intrusive form of confirmation, which we tag as IMPLICIT-CONFIRM, typically presents the user with the system’s understanding of one travel parameter immediately before asking about the next parameter.",
        "Depending on the site, implicit information can either precede the new request for information, as in Flying to Tokyo.",
        "What day are you leaving?, or can occur within the same utterance, as in What day do you want to leave London?",
        "More rarely, an implicit confirmation is followed by PRESENT-INFO: a flight on Monday September 25.",
        "Delta has a flight departing Atlanta at nine thirty.",
        "One question about the use of implicit confirmation strategy is whether the caller realizes they can correct the system when necessary [10].",
        "Although IMPLICIT-CONFIRMS typically occur as part of a successful sequence of extracting trip information from the caller, they can also occur in situations where the system is having trouble understanding the caller.",
        "In this case, the system may attempt to instruct the user on what it is doing to remediate the problem in between an IMPLICIT-CONFIRM and a REQUEST-INFO: So far, I have you goingfrom Tokyo.",
        "I am trying to assemble enough information to pick aflight.",
        "Right now I need you to tell me your destination.",
        "We have observed that INSTRUCTIONS are a speech-act type that distinguishes these human-computer travel planning dialogues from corresponding human-human travel planning dialogues.",
        "Instructions sometimes take the form of a statement or an imperative, and are characterized by their functional goal of clarifying the system’s own actions, correcting the user’s expectations, or changing the user’s future manner of interacting with the system.",
        "Dialogue systems are less able to diagnose a communication problem than human travel agents, and callers are less familiar with the capabilities of such systems.",
        "As noted above, some systems resort to explicit instructions about what the system is doing or is able to do, or about what the user should try in order to assist the system: Try asking for flights between two major cities; or You can cancel the San Antonio, Texas, to Tampa, Florida flight request or change it.",
        "To change it, you can simply give new information such as a new departure time.",
        "Note that INSTRUCTIONS, unlike the preceding dialogue act types, do not directly involve a domain task.",
        "Like the INSTRUCTION speech-acts, APOLOGIES do not address a domain task.",
        "They typically occur when the system encounters problems, for example, in understanding the caller (I’m sorry, I’m having trouble understanding you), in accessing the database (Something is wrong with theflight retrieval), or with the connection (Sorry, we seem to have a bad connection.",
        "Can you please call me back later?).",

        "This session is now over.",
        "We distinguish these utterances from other dialogue acts, but we do not tag openings separate from closings because they have a similar function, and can be distinguished by their position in the discourse.",

        "However, we leave the inference of discourse structure as a topic for future work because the multifunctionality of many utterances suggests that the correspondence between task structure and dialogue structure may not be as straightforward as has been proposed in Grosz’s work [30].",
        "There are also differences in how each site’s dialogue strategy reflects it conceptualization of the travel planning task.",
        "For example, some systems ask the user explicitly for their airline preferences whereas others do not (the systems illustrated in Figures 1 and 6 do not, wherase the one in Figure 2 does).",
        "Another difference is whether the system asks the user explicitly whether s/he wants a round-trip ticket.",
        "Some systems ask this information early on, and search for both the outbound and the return flights at the same time.",
        "Other systems do not separately model round-trip and multi-leg trips.",
        "Instead they ask the user for information leg by leg, and after requesting the user to select an itinerary for one leg of the flight, they ask whether the user has an additional destination.",

        "On interpretation of many of the significant predictors is that they are landmarks in the dialogue for achievement of particular subtasks.",
        "However the predictors based on the core metrics included a ternary task completion metric that captures succinctly whether any task was achieved or not, and whether the exact task that the user was attempting to accomplish was achieved.",
        "A plausible explanation for the increase in the model fits is that user satisfaction is sensitive to exactly how far through the task the user got, even when the user did not in fact complete the task.",
        "The role of the other significant dialogue metrics are plausibly interpreted as acts important for error minimization.",
        "As with the task-related dialogue metrics, there were already metrics related to ASR performance in the core set of metrics.",
        "However, several of the important metrics count explicit confirmations, one of the desired date of travel, and the other of all information before searching the database, as in utterances SYS3 and SYS4 in Figure 2."

      "text": [
        "This paper has presented DATE, a dialogue act tagging scheme developed explicitly for the purpose of comparing and evaluating spoken dialogue systems.",
        "We have argued that such a scheme needs to make three important distinctions in system dialogue behaviors and we are investigating the degree to which any given type of dialogue act belongs in a single category or in multiple categories.",
        "We also propose the view that a tagging scheme be viewed as a partial model of a natural class of dialogues.",
        "It is a model to the degree that it represents claims about what features of the dialogue are important and are sufficiently well understood to be operationally defined.",
        "It is partial in that the distributions of the features and their relationship to one another, i.e., their possible manifestations in dialogues within the class, are an empirical question.",
        "The view that a dialogue tagging scheme is a partial model of a class of dialogues implies that a preexisting tagging scheme can be reused on a different research project, or by different researchers, only to the degree that it models the same natural class with respect to similar research questions, is sufficient for expressing observations about what actually occurs within the current dialogues of interest, and is sufficiently well-defined that high reliability within and across research sites can be achieved.",
        "Thus, our need to modify existing schemes was motivated precisely to the degree that existing schemes fall short of these requirements.",
        "Other researchers who began with the goal of re-utilizing existing tagging schemes have also found it necessary to modify these schemes for their research purposes [11, 18, 7].",
        "The most substantial difference between our dialogue act tagging scheme and others that have been proposed is in our expansion of the two-way distinction between dialogue tout simple vs. meta-dialogue, into a three-way distinction among the immediate dialogue goals, meta-dialogue utterances, and meta-situation utterances.",
        "Depending on further investigation, we might decide these three dimensions have equal status within the overall tagging scheme (or within the overall dialogue-modeling enterprise), or that there are two types of meta-dialogue: utterances devoted to maintaining the channel, versus utterances devoted to establishing/maintaining the frame.",
        "Further, in accord with our view that a tagging scheme is a partial model, and that it is therefore necessarily evolving as our understanding of dialogue evolves, we also believe that our formulation of any one dimension, such as the speech-act dimension, will necessarily differ from other schemes that model a speech-act dimension.",
        "Furthermore, because human-computer dialogue is at an early stage of development, any such tagging scheme must be a moving target, i.e., the more progress is made, the more likely it is we may need to modify along the way the exact features used in an annotation scheme to characterize what is going on.",
        "In particular, as system capabilities become more advanced in the travel domain, it will probably be necessary to elaborate the task model to capture different aspects of the system’s problem solving activities.",
        "For example, our task model does not currently distinguish between different aspects of information about an itinerary, e.g. between presentation of price information and presentation of schedule information.",
        "We also expect that some domain-independent modifications are likely to be necessary as dialogue systems become more successful, for example to address the dimension of ”face”, i.e. the positive politeness that a system shows to the user [5].",
        "As an example, consider the difference between the interpretation of the utterance, There are no flights from Boston to Boston, when produced by a system vs. when produced by a human travel agent.",
        "If a human said this, it would be be interpretable by the recipient as an insult to their intelligence.",
        "However when produced by a system, it functions to identify the source of the misunderstanding.",
        "Another distinction that we don’t currently make which might be useful is between the initial presentation of an item of information and its representation in a summary.",
        "Summaries arguably have a different communicative function [29, 7].",
        "Another aspect of function our representation doesn’t capture is rhetorical relations between speech acts [20, 21].",
        "While we developed DATE to answer particular research questions in the COMMUNICATOR dialogues, there are likely to be aspects of DATE that can be applied elsewhere.",
        "The task dimension tagset reflects our model of the domain task.",
        "The utility of a task model may be general across domains and for this particular domain, the categories we employ are presumably typical of travel tasks and so, may be relatively portable.",
        "The speech act dimension includes categories typically found in other classifications of speech acts, such as REQUEST-INFO, OFFER, and PRESENT-INFO.",
        "We distinguish information presented to the user about the task, PRESENT-INFO, from information provided to change the user’s behavior, INSTRUCTION, and from information presented in explanation or apology for an apparent interruption in the dialogue, STATUS-REPORT.",
        "The latter has some of the flavor of APOLOGIES, which have an interpersonal function, along with OPENINGS/CLOSINGS.",
        "We group GREETINGS and SIGN-OFFS into the single category of OPENINGS/CLOSINGS on the assumption that politeness forms make less contribution to perceived system success than the system’s ability to carry out the task, to correct misunderstandings, and to coach the user.",
        "Our third dimension, conversational-domain, adds a new category, ABOUT-SITUATION-FRAME, to the more familiar distinction between utterances directed at a task goal vs. utterances directed at a maintaining the communication.",
        "This distinction supports the separate classification of utterances directed at managing the user’s assumptions about how to interact with the system on the air travel task.",
        "As we mention above, the ABOUT-SITUATION-FRAME utterances that we find in the human-computer dialogues typically did not occur in human-human air travel dialogues.",
        "In addition, as we note above, one obvious difference in the dialogue strategies implemented at different sites had to do with whether these utterances occurred upfront, within the dialogue, or both.",
        "In order to demonstrate the utility of dialogue act tags as metrics for spoken dialogue systems, we show that the use of these metrics in the application of PARADISE [31] improves our model of user satisfaction by an absolute 7%, from 38% to 45%.",
        "This is a large increase, and the fit of these models are very good for models of human behavior.",
        "We believe that we have only begun to discover the ways in which the output of the dialogue parser can be used.",
        "In future work we will examine whether other representations derived from the metrics we have applied, such as sequences or structural relations between various types of acts might improve our performance model further.",
        "We are also collaborating with other members of the COMMUNICATOR community who are investigating the use of dialogue act and initiative tagging schemes for the purpose of comparing human-human to human-computer dialogues [1]."
