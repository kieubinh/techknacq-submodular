        "Speech-to-speech translation has made significant advances over the past decade, with several high-visibility projects (C-STAR, Verb-mobil, the Spoken Language Translator, and others) significantly advancing the state-of-the-art.",
        "While speech recognition can currently effectively deal with very large vocabularies and is fairly speaker independent, speech translation is currently still effective only in limited, albeit large, domains.",
        "The issue of domain portability is thus of significant importance, with several current research efforts designed to develop speech-translation systems that can be ported to new domains with significantly less time and effort than is currently possible.",
        "This paper reports on three experiments on portability of a speech-to-speech translation system between semantic domains.",
        "The experiments were conducted with the JANUS system [5, 8, 12], initially developed for a narrow travel planning domain, and ported to the doctor-patient domain and an extended tourism domain.",
        "The experiments cover both rule-based and statistical methods, and handwritten as well as automatically learned rules.",
        "For rule-based systems, we have investigated the re-usability of rules and other knowledge sources from other domains.",
        "For statistical methods, we have investigated how much additional training data is needed for each new domain.",
        "We are also experimenting with combinations of handwritten and automatically learned components.",
        "For speech recognition, we have conducted studies of what parameters change when a recognizer is ported from one domain to another, and how these changes affect recognition performance."

        "The first two experiments concern the analysis component of our interlingua-based MT system.",

        "We use a task-oriented interlingua [4, 3] based on domain actions.",
        "Examples of domain actions are giving information about the onset of a symptom (e.g., I have a headache) or asking a patient to perform some action (e.g., wiggle your fingers).",
        "The interlingua, shown in the example below, has five main components: (1) a speaker tag such as a : for doctor (agent) and c : for a patient (customer), (2) a speech act, in this case, give-information (3) some concepts (+body- s tat e and+existence), and(4)some arguments (body-state-spec= and body-location=), and (5) some sub-arguments (identifiability=no and inside=head).",

        "Experiment 1 concerns extension of the coverage of semantic grammars in the medical domain.",
        "Semantic grammars are based on semantic constituents such as request information phrases (e.g., I was wondering ... ) and location phrases (e.g., in my right arm) rather than syntactic constituents such as noun phrases and verb phrases.",
        "In other papers [12, 5], we have described how our modular grammar design enhances portability across domains.",
        "The portable grammar modules are the cross-domain module, containing rules for things like greetings, and the shared module, containing rules for things like times, dates, and locations.",
        "Figure 1 shows a parse tree for the sentence How long have you had this pain?",
        "XDM indicates nodes that were produced by cross-domain rules.",
        "MED indicates nodes that were produced by rules from the new medical domain grammar.",
        "The preliminary doctor-patient grammar focuses on three medical situations: give-information+existence – giving information about the existence of a symptom (I have been getting headaches); give-information+onset – giving information about the onset of a symptom (The headaches started three months ago); and give-information+occurrence – giving information about the onset of an instance of the symptoms (The headaches start behind my ears).",
        "Symptoms are expressed as body-state (e.g., pain), body-object (e.g., rash), and body-event (e.g., bleeding).",
        "Our experiment on extendibility was based on a hand written seed grammar that was extended by hand and by automatic learning.",
        "The seed grammar covered the domain actions mentioned above, but did not cover very many ways to phrase each domain action.",
        "For example, it might have covered The headaches started three months ago but not I started getting the headaches three months ago.",
        "The seed grammar was extended by hand and by automatic learning to cover a development set of 133 utterances.",
        "The result was two new grammars, a human-extended grammar and a machine-learned grammar, referred to as the extended and learned grammars in Table 1.",
        "The two new grammars were then tested on 132 unseen sentences in order to compare generality of the rules.",
        "Results are reported only for 83 of the 132 sentences which were covered by the current interlingua design.",

        "Results are shown in Table 1.",
        "The parsed test sentences were scored in comparison to a hand coded correct interlingua representation.",
        "Table 1 separates results for six components of the interlingua: speech act, concepts, top level arguments, top-level values, sub-level arguments, and sub level values, in addition to the total interlingua, and the domain action (speech act and concepts combined).",

      "text": [
        "We are in the process of developing a new alternative analysis approach for our interlingua-based speech-translation systems that combines rule-based and statistical methods and we believe inherently supports faster porting into new domains.",
        "The main aspects of the approach are the following.",
        "Rather than developing complete semantic grammars for analyzing utterances into our interlingua (either completely manually, or using grammar induction techniques), we separate the task into two main levels.",
        "We continue to develop and maintain rule-based grammars for phrases that correspond to argument-level concepts of our interlingua representation (e.g., time expressions, locations, symptom-names, etc.).",
        "However, instead of developing grammar rules for assembling the argument-level phrases into appropriate domain actions, we apply machine learning and classification techniques [1] to learn these mappings from a corpus of interlingua tagged utterances.",
        "(Earlier work on this task is reported in [6].)",
        "We believe this approach should prove to be more suitable for fast porting into new domains for the following reasons.",
        "Many of the required argument-level phrase grammars for a new domain are likely to be covered by already existing grammar modules, as can be seen by examining the XDM (cross-domain) nodes in Figure 1.",
        "The remaining new phrase grammars are fairly fast and straightforward to develop.",
        "The central questions, however, are whether the statistical methods used for classifying strings of arguments into domain actions are accurate enough, and what amounts of tagged data are required to obtain reasonable levels of performance.",
        "To assess this last question, we tested the performance of the current speech-act and concept classifiers for the expanded travel-domain when trained with increasing amounts of training data.",
        "The results of these experiments are shown in Figure 3.",
        "We also report the performance of the domain-action classification derived from the combined speech-act and concepts.",
        "As can be seen, performance reaches a relative plateau at around 4000-5000 utterances.",
        "We see these results as indicative that this approach should indeed prove to be significantly easier to port to new domains.",
        "Creating a tagged database of this order of magnitude can be done in a few weeks, rather than the months required for complete manual grammar development time."
