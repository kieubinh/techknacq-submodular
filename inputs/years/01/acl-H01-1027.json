        "By following threads across the fact and entity tables, the user can determine, for example, other people who work at the same organization as a given speaker.",

        "No application code resides on the client.",
        "contains section, paragraph, or topic markup, this markup is preserved.",
        "Name finding: BBN's IdentiFinderâ„¢ (Bikel et al., 1999), a statistical name finder, is used to mark name mentions of the three semantic types.",

        "Parsing: Constrained syntactic parsing is performed, using a lexicalized probabilistic context free grammar (Miller, et al., 2000).",
        "BBN's statistical parser is trained on the UPenn Treebank and run in a constrained mode that ensures that the constituent brackets that it identifies will not conflict with the base name mentions previously found by IdentiFinder.",
        "Parse merging: The name information from IdentiFinder is merged into the syntactic parses, which sometimes involves inserting additional nodes into the parse tree.",
        "Since the parser follows Treebank style, it produces relatively flat parses for NPs.",
        "For example, a name with premodifiers like \"small town America\" system introduces a new node covering just the name portion.",
        "Futhermore, if the name is that of a Person and the premodifiers include what appears to be a title, as in \"Microsoft President Bill Gates\", the system also introduces an NP node over the title, making it available for descriptor finding in the next stage.",
        "nodes in the parse trees, in order to identify those that are probable descriptors of persons or organizations.",
        "The model is based on the head word of the NP, the head word of its parent constituent, and any left modifier.",
        "The model is trained on newswire data in which the descriptor types were marked by hand.",
        "The resulting descriptors are referred to as base descriptor mentions and are appropriately labeled in the parse.",
        "the base name and a description can be recognized with high reliability.",
        "For example, NPs that contain appositives or that referenced with the description.",
        "Document-level name co-reference: The system finds non-local codocument.",
        "Rules specific to the name's type are used to generate a list of possible alternate or abbreviated forms for each name.",
