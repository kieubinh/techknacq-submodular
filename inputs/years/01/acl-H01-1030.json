        "The goal of TDT is to monitor and reorganize a stream of broadcast news stories in such a way as to help a user recognize and explore different news events that have occurred in the data set.",
        "First story detection (or online new event detection [1]) is one aspect of the detection problem which constitutes one of the three technical tasks defined by the TDT initiative (the other two being segmentation and tracking).",
        "Given a stream of news stories arriving in chronological order, a detection system must group or cluster articles that discuss distinct news events in the data stream.",
        "The TDT initiative has further clarified the notion of topic detection by differentiating between classification in a retrospective (Event Clustering) and an online environment (First Story Detection).",
        "In FSD the system must identify all stories in the data stream that discuss novel news events.",
        "This classification decision is made by considering only those documents that have arrived prior to the current document being evaluated, forcing the system to adhere to the temporal constraints of a real-time news stream.",
        "In other words the system must make an irrevocable classification decision (i.e. either the document discusses a new event or previously detected event) as soon as the document arrives on the input stream.",
        "The goal of event clustering on the other hand is to partition the data stream into clusters of related documents that discuss distinct events.",
        "This decision can be made after the system has considered all the stories in the input stream.",
        "In addition to defining three research problems associated with broadcast news, the TDT initiative also attempted to formally define an event with respect to how it differs from the traditional IR notion of a subject or a topic as defined by the TREC community.",
        "An event is defined as something that happens at some specific time and place (e.g. an assassination attempt, or a volcanic eruption in Greece).",
        "A topic on the other hand is a seminal event or activity along with all directly related events and activities (e.g. an investigation or a political campaign) [1].",
        "Initial TDT research into event tracking and detection focused on developing a classification algorithm to address this subtle distinction between an event and a topic.",
        "For example successful attempts were made to address the temporal nature of news stories1 by exploiting the time between stories when determining their similarity in the detection process [1].",
        "However current research is now focusing on the use of NLP techniques such as language modeling [2, 3], or other forms of feature selection like the identification of events based on the domain dependencies between words [4], or the extraction of certain word classes from stories i.e. noun phrases, noun phrases heads [5].",
        "All these techniques offer a means of determining the most informative features about an event as opposed to classifying documents based on all the words in the document.",
        "The aim of our research is also based on this notion of feature selection.",
        "In this paper we investigate if the use of lexical chains to classify documents can better encapsulate this notion of an event.",
        "In particular we look at the effect on FSD when a composite document representation (using a lexical chain representation and free text representation) is used to represent events in the TDT domain.",
        "1 Stories closer together on the input stream are more likely to discuss the same event than stories further apart on this stream.",
        "In sections 2 and 3 we describe the first component of our composite document representation derived from lexical chains, with a subsequent description of FSD classification based on our data fusion strategy in Section 4.",
        "The remaining sections of this paper give a detailed account of our experimental results, concluding with a discussion of their significance in terms of two general criteria for successful data fusion."

      "text": [
        "A lexical chain is a set of semantically related words in a text.",
        "For example in a document concerning cars a typical chain might consist of the following words {vehicle, engine, wheel, car, automobile, steering wheel}, where each word in the chain is directly or indirectly related to another word by a semantic relationship such as holonymy, hyponymy, meronymy and hypernymy.",
        "When reading any text it is obvious that it is not merely made up of a set of unrelated sentences, but that these sentences are in fact connected to each other in one of two ways cohesion and coherence.",
        "As Morris and Hirst [6] point out cohesion relates to the fact that the elements of a text tend to hang together.",
        "Whilst coherence refers to the fact that there is sense in the text.",
        "Obviously coherence is a semantic relationship and needs computationally expensive processing for identification, however cohesion is a surface relationship and is hence more accessible.",
        "As indicated by Halliday and Hasan [7] cohesion can be roughly classified into three distinct classes, reference, conjunction and lexical cohesion.",
        "Conjunction is the only class, which explicitly shows the relationship between two sentences, I have a cat and his name is Felix.",
        "Reference and lexical cohesion on the other hand indicate sentence relationships in terms of two semantically same or related words.",
        "In the case of reference, pronouns are the most likely means of conveying referential meaning.",
        "For example in the following sentences, Get inside now!",
        "shouted the teacher.",
        "When nobody moved, he was furious.",
        "In order for the reader to understand that the teacher is being referred to by the pronoun he in the second sentence, they must refer back to the first sentence.",
        "Lexical cohesion on the other hand arises from the selection of vocabulary items and the semantic relationships between them.",
        "For example, I parked outside the library, and then went inside the building to return my books, where cohesion is represented by the semantic relationship between the lexical items library, building and books.",
        "For automatic identification of these relationships it is far easier to work with lexical cohesion than reference because less underlying implicit information is needed to discover the relationship between the above pronoun and the word it references.",
        "Hence lexical cohesion is used as a linguistic device for investigating the discourse structure of texts and lexical chains have been found to be an adequate means of exposing this discourse structure.",
        "These lexical chains have many practical applications in IR and computational linguistics such as hypertext construction [8], automatic document summarization [9], the detection of malapropisms within text [10], as a term weighting technique capturing the lexical cohesion in a text [11], as a means of segmenting text into distinct blocks of self contained text [12].",
        "For the purpose of this project we exploit three such applications:",
        "1.",
        "We use lexical chains as a means of exploring and presenting the most prevalent topics discussed in news stories.",
        "2.",
        "A valuable side effect of lexical chain creation is that the words of a text are automatically disambiguated.",
        "3.",
        "Because lexical chains disambiguate words based on",
        "the context in which they occur, lexical chains also address two linguistic problems synonymy and polysemy, which hinder the effectiveness of traditional IR systems such as the vector space model."

        "In general the first task of an IR system is to execute a set of text operations (e.g. stemming, removal of stopwords) to reduce the complexity of a full text representation of a document into a more manageable set of index terms.",
        "Although these index terms are a subset of the original representation, their purpose is to adequately represent the semantic content of the original document in a more concise manner.",
        "This is a difficult NLP task, as natural language frequently does not obey the principle of compositionality where the meaning of the whole can be strictly determined from its parts.",
        "So in order to derive the correct representation of a text, we need to determine the interpretation of a word or phase in the context in which it occurs i.e. before the original text is manipulated into a set of index terms.",
        "The creation of lexical chains which is described below, aims to capture this additional textual information while still maintaining a manageable representation size.",
        "Firstly each term contained in a particular document is dealt with in chronological order.",
        "Then each subsequent word is added to an existing lexical chain or becomes the seed of a new chain, in much the same manner as the clustering of documents.",
        "A stronger criterion than simple semantic similarity is imposed on the addition of a term to a chain, where terms must be added to the most recently updated (semantically related) chain.",
        "This favors the creation of lexical chains containing words that are in close proximity within the text, prompting the correct disambiguation of a word based on the context in which it was used.",
        "We use WordNet to determine the semantic relatedness between a candidate word and the words of a chain.",
        "If we view WordNet as a large semantic network of nodes (meanings) interrelated by semantic relations (meronymy, hyponymy, etc.",
        "), then finding a relationship between two words in the chaining process involves activating the network of one node and observing the activity of the other in this activated network."

        "In WordNet, nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are arranged into synsets (group of synonymous words e.g. cat, feline, tabby), which are further organized into a set of lexical source files by syntactic category.",

        "So each word in a particular document is searched for in the noun index file, if it is not found then we make the assumption that this word is not a noun and hence will play no further part in the chaining process.",
        "If the word is found then it will be represented by a unique set of synset numbers, where each synset number represents a particular sense associated with that word.",
        "Each synset number points to the position in the noun data file where words related to this sense of the word are stored with a gloss, and sample sentence using this word.",
        "Words related to a particular sense are associated with it by several different semantic relations, such as hyponymy (kind-of, lorry/vehicle), hypernymy (is-a, vehicle/car), holonymy (has-part, tree/branch) and meronymy (part-of, engine/car).",
        "As shown in Figure 1, each sense associated with a word is expanded using WordNet (in reality these senses and senses related to them are represented by synset numbers).",
        "This example of the chain formation process shows us that the word car is related to the word trunk by the fact that car trunk, one of the senses of trunk, is a meronymy of automobile which is a possible sense of car.",
        "In this way both words have been successfully disambiguated so all redundant senses belonging to each word are eliminated and car is added to the chain containing trunk.",
        "This chain may also contain other semantically related words pertaining to the topic of an automobile e.g. {car, trunk, engine, vehicle...}.",
        "The chain formation process is continued in this way until all the words in a particular document (in our case nouns) have been chained.",
        "Any words that remain unchained or ambiguous after this chaining process are eliminated from our chain word representation based on the following hypothesis: `The occurrence of words in a text which fail to participate in the overall cohesive structure of a text (i. e. remain unchained) is purely coincidental.",
        "Consequently these words are considered irrelevant in describing the general topic of a document.'",
        "This implies that our lexical chaining strategy also provides us with an automatic means of selecting the most salient features of a particular news story.",
        "So when all redundant words have been removed in this manner, all remaining chains are then merged into a single chain containing all the synset numbers from each individual chain involved in this process.",
        "This representation is a semantic representation as opposed to a syntactic representation (in the case of a bag of words representation) because it contains concepts (i.e. synset numbers) rather than simple terms to represent the content of a document."
