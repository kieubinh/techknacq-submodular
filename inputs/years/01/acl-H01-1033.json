        "Dictionaries provide reliable evidence, but often lack translation preference information.",
        "Corpora, by contrast, are often a better source for translations of slang or newly coined terms, but the statistical analysis through which the translations are extracted sometimes produces erroneous results.",

        "Benefits of the approachinclude simplicity and modularitynotice that a lexicon containing ranked translations is the only requirement, and in particular that there is no need for access to the internals of the IR system or to the document collection in order to 2 http://www.clsp.jhu.edu/ws99/projects/mt/ perform computations on term frequencies or weights.",
        "In addition, the approach is an effective one: in previous experiments we have found that this balanced translation strategy significantly outperforms the usual (unbalanced) technique of including all known translations [3].",

Thus, although both sources of evidence were weighted equally in the voting, STRAND-only evidence received lower precedence in the merged ranking. For French terms that appeared in only one tralex, we included those entries unchanged in the merged tralex.

        "Merging the tralexes provided no improvement over using the WebDict tralex alone, but our backoff strategy produced a statistically significant 12% improvement in mean average precision (at p < 0.01) over the next best tralex (WebDict alone).",
        "As Figure 1 shows, the improvement is remarkably consistent, with only four of the 34 topics adversely affected and only one topic showing a substantial negative impact.",
        "Breaking down the backoff results by stage (Table 2), we find that the majority of query-to-document hits are obtained in the first stage, i.e. matches of the terms surface form in the document to a translation of the surface form in the dictionary.",
        "However, the back off process improves by-token coverage of terms in documents by 8%, and gives a 3% relative improvement in retrieval results; it also contributed additional translations to the top-2 set in approximately 30% of the cases, leading to the statistically significant 12% relative improvement in mean average precision as compared to the baseline using WebDict alone with 4-stage backoff."

        "In future work we plan to explore other combinations of merging and backoff and other merging strategies, including post-retrieval merging of the ranked lists.",
        "In addition, parallel corpora can be exploited for more than just the extraction of a non-contextualized translation lexicon.",
        "We are currently engaged in work on lexical selection methods that take advantage of contextual information, in the context of our research on machine translation, and we expect that CLIR results will be improved by contextually-informed scoring of term translations."
