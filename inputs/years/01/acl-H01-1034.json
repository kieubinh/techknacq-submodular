        "There has been a great deal of research on applying natural language processing (NLP) techniques to text-based sources of written language data, such as newspaper and newswire data.",
        "Most NLP approaches to spoken language data, such as broadcast news and telephone conversations, have consisted of applying text-based systems to the output of an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system; research on improving these approaches has focused on either improving the ASR accuracy or improving the text based system (or both).",
        "However, applying text-based systems to ASR output ignores the fact that there are fundamental differences between written texts and ASR transcriptions of spoken language: the style is different between written and spoken language, the transcription conventions are different, and, most importantly, there are errors in ASR transcriptions.",
        "In this work, we focus on the third problem: handling errors by explicitly modeling uncertainty in ASR transcriptions.",
        "The idea of explicit error handling in information extraction (IE) from spoken documents was introduced by Grishman in [1], where a channel model of word insertions and deletions was used with a deterministic pattern matching system for information extraction.",
        "While the use of an error model resulted in substantial performance improvements, the overall performance was still quite low, perhaps because the original system was designed to take advantage of orthographic features.",
        "In looking ahead, Grishman suggests that a probabilistic approach might be more successful at handling errors.",
        "The work described here provides such an approach, but introduces an acoustically-driven word confidence score rather than the word-based channel model proposed in [1].",
        "More specifically, we provide a unified approach to predicting and using uncertainty in processing spoken language data, focusing on the specific IE task of identifying named entities (NEs).",
        "We show that by explicitly modeling multiple types of errors in the ASR output, we can improve the performance of an IE system, which benefits further from improved error prediction using new features derived from multi-pass processing.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we describe our error modeling, including explicit modeling of multiple ASR error types.",
        "New features for word confidence estimation and the resulting performance improvement is given in Section 3.",
        "Experimental results for NE recognition are presented in Section 4 using Broadcast News speech data.",
        "Finally, in Section 5, we summarize the key findings and implications for future work."

        "(Note that titles, such as President and Mr., are good indicators of transition to a name state.)",
        "This IE model, described further in [2], is similar to other statistical approaches [3, 4] in the use of state dependent bigrams, but uses a different smoothing mechanism and state topology.",

        "To explicitly model errors in the IE system, we introduce new notation for the hypothesized word sequence, , which may differ from the actual word sequence , and a sequence of error indicator variables , wherewhen is an error and when is correct.",

        "Of course, the errors are not independent, which we take advantage of in our post-processing of confidence estimates, described in Section 3.",

        "Training this language model requires data that contains -tokens, which can be obtained by aligning the reference data and the ASR output.",
        "In fact, we train the language model with a combination of the original reference data and a duplicate version with tokens replacing error words.",
        "Because of the conditional independence assumptions behind equations 1 and 4, there is an efficient algorithm for solving equation 3, which combines steps similar to the forward and Viterbi algorithms used with HMMs.",
        "The search is linear with the length of the hypothesized word sequence and the size of the state space (the product space of NE states and error states).",
        "The forward component is over the error state (parallel branches in the lattice), and the Viterbi component is over the NE states.",
        "If the goal is to find the words that are in error (e.g. for subsequent correction) as well as the named entities, then the objective is",
        "which simply involves finding the best path through the lattice in Figure 1.",

        "The sequence can help us define a new word sequence that contains -tokens: if , and if .",
        "Joint error and named entity decoding results in a small degradation in named entity recognition performance, since only a single error path is used.",

        "In this work, we focus particularly on distinguishing out-of-vocabulary (OOV) errors from in-vocabulary (IV) errors, due to the large percentage of OOV words that are names (57% of OOVs occur in named entities).",
        "Looking at the data another way, the percentage of name words that are OOV is an order of magnitude larger than words in the other phrase category, as described in more detail in [6].",
        "As it turns out, since OOVs are so infrequent, it is difficult to robustly estimate the probability of IV vs. OOV errors from standard acoustic features, and we simply use the relative prior probabilities to scale the single error probability."

        "An essential component of our error model is the word level confidence score, , so one would expect that better confidence scores would result in better error modeling performance.",
        "Hence, we investigated methods for improving the confidence estimates, focusing specifically on introducing new features that might complement the features used to provide the baseline confidence estimates.",
        "The baseline confidence scores used in this study were provided by Dragon Systems.",
        "As described in [7], the Dragon confidence predictor used a generalized linear model with six inputs: the word duration, the language model score, the fraction of times the word appears in the top 100 hypotheses, the average number of active HMM states in decoding for the word, a normalized acoustic score and the log of the number of recognized words in the utterance.",
        "We investigated several new features, of which the most useful are listed below.",
        "First, we use a short window of the original confidence scores: ,and .",
        "Note that the post-processing paradigm allows us to use non-causal features such as fidence score for a word is less likely to indicate a word error if the average confidence for the entire document is also low.",
        "We hypothesized that words occurring frequently in a large window would be more likely to be correct, again assuming that the ASR system would make errors randomly from a set of possibilities.",
        "Therefore, we define features based on how many times the hypothesis word occurs in a window for , 10, 25, 50, and 100 words.",
        "Finally, we also use the relative frequency of words occurring as an error in the training corpus, again looking at a window of around the current word.",
        "Due to the close correlation between names and errors, we would expect to see improvement in the error modeling performance by including information about which words are names, as determined by the NE system.",
        "Therefore, in addition to the above set of features, we define a new feature: whether the hypothesis word is part of a location, organization, or person phrase.",
        "We can determine the value of this feature directly from the output of the NE system.",
        "Given this additional feature, we can define a multi-pass processing cycle consisting of two steps: confidence re-estimation and information extraction.",
        "To obtain the name information for the first pass, the confidence scores are re-estimated without using the name features, and these confidences are used in a joint NE and error decoding system.",
        "The resulting name information is then used, in addition to all the features used in the previous pass, to improve the word confidence estimates.",
        "The improved confidences are in turn used to further improve the performance of the NE system.",
        "We investigated three different methods for using the above features in confidence estimation: decision trees, generalized linear models, and linear interpolation of the outputs of the decision tree and generalized linear model.",
        "The decision trees and generalized linear models gave similar performance, and a small gain was obtained by interpolating these predictions.",
        "For simplicity, the results here use only the decision tree model.",
        "A standard method for evaluating confidence prediction [8] is the normalized cross entropy (NCE) of the binary correct/error predictors, that is, the reduction in uncertainty in confidence prediction relative to the ASR system error rate.",
        "Using the new features in a decision tree predictor, the NCE score of the binary confidence predictor improved from 0.195 to 0.287.",
