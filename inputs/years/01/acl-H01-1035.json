        "Simple direct annotation projection is quite noisy, however, even with optimal alignments.",
        "Thus this paper presents noise-robust tagger, bracketer and lemmatizer training procedures capable of accurate system bootstrapping from noisy and incomplete initial projections.",
        "Performance of the induced standalone part-of-speech tagger applied to French achieves 96% core part-of-speech (POS) tag accuracy, and the corresponding induced noun-phrase bracketer exceeds 91 % F-measure.",
        "The induced morphological analyzer achieves over 99% lemmatization accuracy on the complete French verbal system.",
        "This achievement is particularly noteworthy in that it required absolutely no hand-annotated training data in the given language, and virtually no language-specific knowledge or resources beyond raw text.",
        "Performance also significantly exceeds that obtained by direct annotation projection."

        "To show the broad potential of our approach and methods, this paper will investigate four fundamental language analysis tasks: POS tagging, base noun phrase (baseNP) bracketing, named entity tagging, and inflectional morphological analysis, as illustrated in Figures 1 and 2.",
        "These bedrock tools are important components of the^ language analysis pipelines for many applications, and their low cost extension to new languages, as described here, can serve as a broadly useful enabling resource."

        "Previous research on the word alignment of parallel corpora has tended to focus on their use in translation model training for MT rather than on monolingual applications.",
        "One exception is bilingual parsing.",
        "Wu (1995, 1997) investigated the use of concurrent parsing of parallel corpora in a transduction inversion framework, helping to resolve attachment ambiguities in one language by the coupled parsing state in the second language.",
        "Jones and Havrilla (1998) utilized similar joint parsing techniques (twisted-pair grammars) for word reordering in target language generation.",
        "However, with these exceptions in the field of parsing, to our knowledge no one has previously used linguistic annotation projection via aligned bilingual corpora to induce traditional standalone monolingual text analyzers in other languages.",
        "Thus both our proposed projection and induction methods, and their application to multilingual POS tagging, named-entity classification and morphological analysis induction, appears to be highly novel.",
        "with additional distinctions in verb tense, noun number and pronoun type as captured in the English tagset inventory.",
        "Although impoverished relative to some languages, and incapable of resolving details such as grammatical gender, this Brown-corpus-based tagset granularity is sufficient for many applications.",
        "Furthermore, many finer-grained part-of-speech distinctions are resolved primarily by morphology, as handled in Section 7.",
        "Finally, if one desires to induce a finer-grained tagging capability for case, for example, one should project from a reference language such as Czech, where case is lexically marked.",
        "Figure 3 illustrates six scenarios encountered when projecting POS tags from English to a language such as French.",
        "The first two show straightforward 1-to-1 projections, which are encountered in roughly two-thirds of English words.",
        "Phrasal (1-to-N) alignments offer greater challenges, as typically only a subset of the aligned words accept the English tag.",
        "To distinguish these cases, we initially assign position-sensitive phrasal parts-of-speech via subscripting (e.g. Les/NNS lois/NNS ), and subsequently learn a probablistic mapping to core, non-phrasal parts of speech (e.g. P DT NNS ) that is used along with tag sequence and lexical prior models to re-tag these phrasal POS projections."
