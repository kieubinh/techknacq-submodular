        "Many people believe that describing the architecture is the key step in building and information system.",
        "However, if the ideas about components and interconnections are vague or incomplete, then the architecture step is actually best developed using a hypothesis and test process.",

        "The third step is to identify and make plans to reuse components that one will depend on during the IFE.",
        "This step is critical for the technology teams because many of the components to be used come from years of development and experimentation.",
        "With mature components populating a large share of the architecture, the development teams are then free to experiment with new components that are considered to be necessary for end-to-end processing.",
        "Moreover, the developers can experiment with data flow and interconnection strategies.",
