      "text": [
        "The CCLINC parsing module, TINA [16], implements the top-down chart parsing and the best-first search techniques, driven by context free grammars rules compiled into a recursive transition network augmented by features, [8].",
        "The following properties of Korean induce a great degree of ambiguity in the grammar: (i) relatively free word order for arguments --- given a sentence with three arguments, subject, object, indirect object, all 6 logical word order permutations are possible in reality, (ii) frequent omissions of subjects and objects, and (iii) the strict verb finality, [10].",
        "Due to the free word order and argument omissions, the first word of an input sentence can be many way ambiguous --- it can be a part of a subject, an object, and any other post-positional phrases.",
        "The ambiguity introduced by the first input word grows rapidly as the parser processes subsequent input words.",
        "Verbs, which usually play a crucial role in reducing the ambiguity in English by the subcategorization frame information, are not available until the end, [1,3,11].",
        "Our solution to the ambiguity problem lies in a novel grammar writing technique, which reduces the ambiguity of the first input word.",
        "We hypothesize that (i) the initial symbol in the grammar (i.e.",
        "Sentence) always starts with the single category generic_np, the grammatical function (subject, object) of which is undetermined.",
        "This ensures that the ambiguity of the first input word is reduced to the number of different ways the category generic_np can be rewritten.",
        "(ii) The grammatical function of the generic_np is determined after the parser processes the following case marker via a trace mechanism.3 Figure 2 illustrates a set of sample context free grammar rules, and Figure 3 (on the next page) is a sample parse tree for the input sentence “URi Ga EoRyeoUn MunJe Reul PulEox Da (We solved a difficult problem).”4",
        "(i) sentence generic_np clause sentence _marker (ii) clause subject generic_np object verbs (iii) subject subj_marker np_trace",
        "2 Post-positional phrases in Korean correspond to prepositional phrases in English.",
        "We use the term post-positional phrase to indicate that the function words at issue are located after the head noun.",
        "3 The hypothesis that all sentences start with a single category generic_np is clearly over simplified.",
        "We can easily find a sentence starting with other elements such as coordination markers which do not fall under generic_np.",
        "For the sentences which do not start with the category generic_np, we discard these elements for parsing purposes.",
        "And this method has proven to be quite effective in the overall design of the translation system, especially due to the fact that most of non generic_np sentence initial elements (e.g. coordination markers, adverbs, etc.)",
        "do not contribute to the core meaning of the input sentence.",
        "4 Throughout this paper, “subj_marker” stands for “subject marker”, and “obj_marker”, “object marker”.",
        "The generic_np dominated by the initial symbol sentence in (i) of Figure 2 is parsed as an element moved from the position occupied by np_trace in (iii), and therefore corresponds to the category np_trace dominated by subject in Figure 3 (placed on the next page for space reasons).",
        "All of the subsequent generic_np’s, which are a part of a direct object, an indirect object, a post-positional phrase, etc.",
        "are unitarily handled by the same trace mechanism.",
        "By hypothesizing that all sentences start with generic_np, the system can parse Korean robustly and efficiently.",
        "The trace mechanism determines the grammatical function of generic_np by repositioning it after the appropriate case marker.",
        "Utilization of overt case markers to improve the parsing efficiency precisely captures the commonly shared intuition for parsing relatively free word order languages with overt case markers such as Korean and Japanese, compared with parsing relatively strict word order languages with no overt case markers such as English: In languages like English, the verb of a sentence plays the crucial role in reducing the ambiguity via the verb subcategorization frame information on the co-occuring noun phrases, [1,3,11].",
        "In languages like Korean, however, it is typically the case marker which identifies the grammatical function of the co-occuring noun phrase, assuming the role similar to that of verbs in English.",
        "The current proposal is the first explicit implementation of this intuition, instantiated by the novel idea that all noun phrases are moved out of the case marked phrases immediately following them."

        "The CCLINC Korean-to-English translation system achieves high quality translation by (i) robust mapping of the parsing output into the semantic frame, and (ii) word sense disambiguation on the basis of the selection preference between two grammatical relations (verb-object, subject-verb, head-modifier) easily identifiable from the semantic frame, [13].",
        "The former facilitates the accurate word order generation of various target language sentences, and the latter, the accurate choice of the target language word given multiple translation candidates for the same source language word.",
        "Given the parsing output in Figure 3, the system produces the semantic frame in Figure 4:5 5 Strictly speaking, the meaning representation in Figure 4 is not truly language neutral in that the terminal vocabularies are represented in Korean rather than in interlingua vocabulary.",
        "It is fairly straightforward to adapt our system to produce the meaning representation with the terminal vocabularies specified by an interlingua.",
        "However, we have made a deliberate decision to leave the Korean vocabularies in the representation largely (1) to retain the system efficiency for mapping parsing output into meaning representation, and (2) for unified execution of automation algorithms for both Korean-to-English and English-to-Korean translation.",
        "And we would like to point out that this minor compromise in meaning representation still ensures the major benefit of interlingua approach to machine translation, namely, 2 x N sets of grammar rules for N language pairs, as opposed to 2N.",
        "The semantic frame captures the core predicate-argument structure of the input sentence in a hierarchical manner, [9,10] (i.e. the internal argument, typically object, is embedded under the verb, and the external argument, typically subject, is at the same hierarchy as the main predicate, i.e. verb phrase in syntactic terms).",

        "To overcome the knowledge bottleneck for robust translation and efficient system porting in an interlingua-based system [7], we have developed a technique for automated acquisition of grammar rules which leads to a simultaneous acquisition of rules for (i) the parser, (ii) the mapper between the parser and the semantic frame, and (iii) the generator.",
        "The technique utilizes a list of words and their corresponding parts-of-speech in the corpus as the knowledge source, presupposes a set of knowledge-based rules to be derived from a word and its part-of-speech pair, and gets executed according to the procedure given in Figure 5.",
        "The rationale behind the technique is that (i) given a word and its part-of-speech, most of the syntactic rules associated with the word can be automatically derived according to the projection principle (the syntactic representation must observe the subcategorization properties of each lexical item) and the X-bar schema (major syntactic categories such as N, V, Adj, Adv project to the same syntactic structures) in linguistic theories, [2], and (ii) the mapping from the syntactic structure to the semantic frame representation is algorithmic.",
        "The specific rules to be acquired for a language largely depend on the grammar of the language for parsing.",
        "Some example rules acquired for the verb BaiChiHa (arrange) in Korean consistent with the parsing technique discussed in Section 2.1 are given in (4) through (7).",

        "are possible prefixes and suffixes to be attached to the verb stem, illustrating a fairly complex verb morphology in this language.",
        "The rules for the generation grammar in (7) are the subcategorization frames for the verb arrange in English, which is the translation of the Korean verb baichiha_v, as given in (6).",
        "The current technique is quite effective in expanding the system’s capability when there is no large syntatically annotated corpus available from which we can derive and train the grammar rules, [14], and applicable across languages in so far as the notion of part-of-speech, the projection principle and the X-bar schema is language independent.",
        "With this technique, manual acquisition of the knowledge database for the overall translation system is reduced to the acquisition of (i) the bilingual lexicon, and (ii) the corpus specific top-level grammar rules which constitute less than 20% of the total grammar rules in our system.",
        "And this has enabled us to produce a fairly large-scale interlingua-based translation system within a short period of time.",
        "One apparent limitation of the technique, however, is that it still requires the manual acquisition of corpus-specific rules (i.e. the patterns which do not fall under the linguistic generalization).",

        "In a very recent evaluation, we have found out that evaluations on sentences decrease the overall translation score about by 15.",
        "Nevertheless, the translation quality is still good enough for content understanding with some effort.",
        "The primary cause for the lower translation scores when the evaluation unit is a sentence as opposed to a clause is due to either an incorrect clause boundary identification, or some information (e.g. missing arguments in embedded clauses) which cannot be easily recovered after a sentence is fragmented into clauses.",
