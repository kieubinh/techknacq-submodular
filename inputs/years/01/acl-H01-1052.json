        "A significant amount of work in empirical natural language processing involves developing and refining machine learning techniques to automatically extract linguistic knowledge from on-line text corpora.",
        "While the number of learning variants for various problems has been increasing, the size of training sets such learning algorithms use has remained essentially unchanged.",
        "For instance, for the much-studied problems of part of speech tagging, base noun phrase labeling and parsing, the Penn Treebank, first released in 1992, remains the de facto training corpus.",
        "The average training corpus size reported in papers published in the ACL-sponsored Workshop on Very Large Corpora was essentially unchanged from the 1995 proceedings to the 2000 proceedings.",
        "While the amount of available on-line text has been growing at an amazing rate over the last five years (by some estimations, there are currently over 500 billion readily accessible words on the web), the size of training corpora used by our field has remained static.",
        "Confusable word set disambiguation, the problem of choosing the correct use of a word given a set of words with which it is commonly confused, (e.g. {to, too, two}, {your, you’re}), is a prototypical problem in NLP.",
        "At some level, this task is identical to many other natural language problems, including word sense disambiguation, determining lexical features such as pronoun case and determiner number for machine translation, part of speech tagging, named entity labeling, spelling correction, and some formulations of skeletal parsing.",
        "All of these problems involve disambiguating from a relatively small set of tokens based upon a string context.",
        "Of these disambiguation problems, lexical confusables possess the fortunate property that supervised training data is free, since the differences between members of a confusion set are surface-apparent within a set of well-written text.",
        "To date, all of the papers published on the topic of confusion set disambiguation have used training sets for supervised learning of less than one million words.",
        "The same is true for most if not all of the other disambiguation-in-string-context problems.",
        "In this paper we explore what happens when significantly larger training corpora are used.",
        "Our results suggest that it may make sense for the field to concentrate considerably more effort into enlarging our training corpora and addressing scalability issues, rather than continuing to explore different learning methods applied to the relatively small extant training corpora."

        "Several methods have been presented for confusion set disambiguation.",
        "The more recent set of techniques includes multiplicative weight-update algorithms [4], latent semantic analysis [7], transformation-based learning [8], differential grammars [10], decision lists [12], and a variety of Bayesian classifiers [2,3,5].",
        "In all of these papers, the problem is formulated as follows: Given a specific confusion set (e.g. {to, two, too}), all occurrences of confusion set members in the test set are replaced by some marker.",
        "Then everywhere the system sees this marker, it must decide which member of the confusion set to choose.",
        "Most learners that have been applied to this problem use as features the words and part of speech tags appearing within a fixed window, as well as collocations surrounding the ambiguity site; these are essentially the same features as those used for the other disambiguation-in-string-context problems."

        "Figure 1 shows a learning curve we generated for our task of word-confusable disambiguation, in which we plot test classification accuracy as a function of training corpus size using a version of winnow, the best-performing learner reported to date for this well-studied task [4].",
        "This curve was generated by training on successive portions of the 1-million word Brown corpus and then testing on 1-million words of Wall Street Journal text for performance averaged over 10 confusion sets.",
        "The curve might lead one to believe that only minor gains are to be had by increasing the size of training corpora past 1 million words.",

        "The first question impacts how best to devote resources in order to improve natural language technology.",
        "If there is still much to be gained from additional data, we should think hard about ways to effectively increase the available training data for problems of interest.",
        "The second question allows us to study failures due to inherent weaknesses in learning methods and features rather than failures due to insufficient data.",
        "Since annotated training data is essentially free for the problem of confusion set disambiguation, we decided to explore learning curves for this problem for various machine learning algorithms, and then analyze residual errors when the learners are trained on all available data.",
        "The learners we used were memory-based learning, winnow, perceptron,1 transformation-based learning, and decision trees.",
        "All learners used identical features2 and were used out-of-the-box, with no parameter tuning.",
        "Since our point is not to compare learners we have refrained from identifying the learners in the results below.",
        "We collected a 1-billion-word training corpus from a variety of English texts, including news articles, scientific abstracts, government transcripts, literature and other varied forms of prose.",
        "Using this collection, which is three orders of magnitude greater than the largest training corpus previously used for this task, we trained the five learners and tested on a set of 1 million words of Wall Street Journal text.3 In Figure 2 we show learning curves for each learner, for up to one billion words of training data.4 Each point in the graph reflects the average performance of a learner over ten different confusion sets which are listed in Table 1.",
        "Interestingly, even out to a billion words, the curves appear to be log-linear.",
        "Note that the worst learner trained on approximately 20 million words outperforms the best learner trained on 1 million words.",
        "We see that for the problem of confusable disambiguation, none of our learners is close to asymptoting in performance when trained on the one million word training corpus commonly employed within the field.",
        "The graph in Figure 2 demonstrates that for word confusables, we can build a system that considerably outperforms the current best results using an incredibly simplistic learner with just slightly more training data.",
        "In the graph, Learner 1 corresponds to a trivial memory-based learner.",
        "This learner simply keeps track of all <wi-1, wi+1>, < wi-1> and <wi+1> counts for all occurrences of the confusables in the training set.",
        "Given a test set instance, the learner will first check if it has seen <wi-1,wi+1> in the training set.",
        "If so, it chooses the confusable word most frequently observed with this tuple.",
        "Otherwise, the learner backs off to check for the frequency of <wi-1>; if this also was not seen then it will back off to <wi+1>, and lastly, to the most frequently observed confusion",
        "set member as computed from the training corpus.",
        "Note that with 10 million words of training data, this simple learner outperforms all other learners trained on 1 million words.",
        "Many papers in empirical natural language processing involve showing that a particular system (only slightly) outperforms others on one of the popular standard tasks.",
        "These comparisons are made from very small training corpora, typically less than a million words.",
        "We have no reason to believe that any comparative conclusions drawn on one million words will hold when we finally scale up to larger training corpora.",
        "For instance, our simple memory based learner, which appears to be among the best performers at a million words, is the worst performer at a billion.",
        "The learner that performs the worst on a million words of training data significantly improves with more data.",
        "Of course, we are fortunate in that labeled training data is easy to locate for confusion set disambiguation.",
        "For many natural language tasks, clearly this will not be the case.",
        "This reality has sparked interest in methods for combining supervised and unsupervised learning as a way to utilize the relatively small amount of available annotated data along with much larger collections of unannotated data [1,9].",
