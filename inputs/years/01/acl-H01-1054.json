        "Although recent years has seen increased and successful research efforts in the areas of single-document summarization, multidocument summarization, and information extraction, very few investigations have explored the potential of merging summarization and information extraction techniques.",

        "Following [10], we hypothesize that IE-supported summarization will enable the generation of more accurate and targeted summaries in specific domains than is possible with current domain-independent techniques.",
        "In the sections below, we describe the initial implementation and evaluation of the RIPTIDES IE-supported summarization system.",

        "The user optionally provides filters and preferences on the scenario template slots, specifying what information s/he wants to be reported in the summary.",
        "RIPTIDES next applies its Information Extraction subsystem to generate a database of extracted events for the selected domain and then invokes the Summarizer to generate a natural language summary of the extracted information subject to the user’s constraints.",

        "The domain for the initial IE-supported summarization system and its evaluation is natural disasters.",
        "Very briefly, a top-level natural disasters scenario template contains: document-level information (e.g. docno, date-time); zero or more agent elements denoting each person, group, and organization in the text; and zero or more disaster elements.",
        "Agent elements encode standard information for named entities (e.g. name, position, geopolitical unit).",
        "For the most part, disaster elements also contain standard event-related fields (e.g. type, number, date, time, location, damage sub-elements).",
        "The final product of the RIPTIDES system, however, is not a set of scenario templates, but a user-directed multidocument summary.",
        "This difference in goals influences a number of template design issues.",
        "First, disaster elements must distinguish different reports or views of the same event from multiple sources.",
        "As a result, the system creates a separate disaster event for each such account.",
        "Disaster elements should also include the reporting agent, date, time, and location whenever possible.",
        "In addition, damage elements (i.e. human and physical effects) are best grouped according to the reporting event.",
        "Finally, a slight broadening of the IE task was necessary in that extracted text was not constrained to noun phrases.",
        "In particular, adjectival and adverbial phrases that encode reporter confidence, and sentences and clauses denoting relief effort progress appear beneficial for creating informed summaries.",
        "Figure 2 shows the scenario template for one of 25 texts tracking the 1998 earthquake in Afghanistan (TDT2 Topic 89).",
        "The texts were also manually annotated for noun phrase coreference; any phrase involved in a coreference relation appears underlined in the running text.",
        "The RIPTIDES system for the most part employs a traditional IE architecture [4].",
        "In addition, we use an in-house implementation of the TIPSTER architecture [8] to manage all linguistic annotations.",
        "A preprocessor first finds sentences and tokens.",
        "For syntactic analysis, we currently use the Charniak [5] parser, which creates Penn Treebank-style parses [9] rather than the partial parses used in most IE systems.",
        "Output from the parser is converted automatically into TIPSTER parse and part-of-speech annotations, which are added to the set of linguistic annotations for the document.",
        "The extraction phase of the system identifies domain-specific relations among relevant entities in the text.",
        "It relies on Autoslog-XML, an XSLT implementation of the Autoslog-TS system [12], to acquire extraction patterns.",
        "Autoslog-XML is a weakly supervised learning system that requires two sets of texts for training – one set comprises texts relevant to the domain of interest and the other, texts not relevant",
        "to the domain.",
        "Based on these and a small set of extraction pattern templates, the system finds a ranked list of possible extraction patterns, which a user then annotates with the appropriate extraction label (e.g. victim).",
        "Once acquired, the patterns are applied to new documents to extract slot fillers for the domain.",
        "Selectional restrictions on allowable slot fillers are implemented using WordNet [6] and BBN’s Identifinder [3] named entity component.",
        "In the current version of the system, no coreference resolution is attempted; instead, we rely on a very simple set of heuristics to guide the creation of output templates.",
        "The disaster scenario templates extracted for each text are provided as input to the summarization component along with all linguistic annotations accrued in the IE phase.",
        "No relief slots are included in the output at present, since there was insufficient annotated data to train a reliable sentence categorizer."

        "To merge related damage information, we first calculate the numeric specificity of the estimate as one of the values NONE, VAGUE, RANGE, SPECIFIC, or INCOMPARABLE, based on the presence of a small set of trigger words and phrases (e.g. several, as many as, from ... to).",

        "In the summary generation stage, a handful of text planning rules are used to organize the text for these derived units, highlighting agreement and disagreement across sources.",

        "In particular, note that the lowest estimate of 140 dead attributed to ABC is actually a report about the number of school children killed in a particular town.",
        "Since no location was given for this estimate by the IE system, the Summarizer’s simple heuristic for localized damaged reports – namely, to consider a damage report to be localized if a location is given that is not in the same sentence as the initial disaster description – did not work here.",
        "The summary in Figure 3 also suffered from some problems with merging: the inclusion of a paragraph about thousands killed in Afghanistan is due to an incorrect classification of this report as a localized one (owing to an error in sentence boundary detection), and the discussion of the number of villages damaged should have included a report of at least 80 towns or villages damaged.",
        "Besides the problems related to slot extraction and merging mentioned above, the summaries shown in Figures 3 and 4 suffer from relatively poor fluency.",

        "Each document was annotated manually with the natural disaster scenario templates that comprise the desired output of the IE system.",
        "In addition, treebank-style syntactic structure annotations were added automatically using the Charniak parser.",

        "All annotations are in XML.",
        "The manual and automatic annotations were automatically merged, leading to inaccurate annotation extents in some cases.",
        "Next, the Topic 89 texts were split into a development corpus and a test corpus.",
        "The development corpus was used to build the summarization system; the evaluation summaries were generated from the test corpus.",
        "We report on three different variants of the RIPTIDES system here: in the first variant (RIPTIDES-SIM1), an earlier version of the Summarizer uses the simulated output of the IE system as its input, including the relief annotations; in the second variant (RIPTIDES-SIM2), the current version of the Summarizer uses the simulated output of the IE system, without the relief annotations; and in the third variant (RIPTIDES-IE), the Summarizer uses the actual output of the IE system as its input.2 Summaries generated by the RIPTIDES variants were compared to a Baseline system consisting of a simple, sentence-extraction multidocument summarizer relying only on document position, recency, and word overlap clustering.",
        "(As explained in the previous section, we have found that word overlap clustering provides a bare bones way to help determine what information is repeated in multiple articles, thereby indicating importance to the document set as a whole, as well as to help reduce redundancy in the resulting summaries.)",
        "In addition, the RIPTIDES and Baseline system summaries were compared against the summaries of two human authors.",
        "All of the summaries were graded with respect to content, organization, and readability on an A-F scale by three graduate students, all of whom were unfamiliar with this project.",
        "Note that the grades for RIPTIDES-SIM1, the Baseline system, and the two human authors were assigned during a first evaluation in October, 2000, whereas the grades for RIPTIDES-SIM2 and RIPTIDES-IE were assigned by the same graders in an update to this evaluation in April, 2001.",
        "Each system and author was asked to generate four summaries of different lengths and emphases: (1) a 100-word summary of the May 30 and May 31 articles; (2) a 400-word summary of all test articles, emphasizing specific, factual information; (3) a 200-word summary of all test articles, focusing on the damage caused by the quake, and excluding information about relief efforts, and (4) a 200-word summary of all test articles, focusing on the relief efforts, and highlighting the Red Cross’s role in these efforts.",
        "The results are shown in Tables 1 and 2.",
        "Table 1 provides the overall grade for each system or author averaged across all graders and summaries, where each assigned grade has first been converted to a number (with A=4.0 and F=0.0) and the average converted back to a letter grade.",
        "Table 2 shows the mean and standard deviations of the overall, content, organization, and readability scores for the RIPTIDES and the Baseline systems averaged across all graders and summaries.",
        "Where the differences vs. the Baseline system are significant according to the t-test, the p-values are shown.",
        "Given the amount of development effort that has gone into the system to date, we were not surprised that the RIPTIDES variants fared poorly when compared against the manually written summaries, with RIPTIDES-SIM2 receiving an average grade of C, vs. A and B+ for the human authors.",
        "Nevertheless, we were pleased to find that RIPTIDES-SIM2 scored a full grade ahead of the Baseline summarizer, which received a D, and that 2 Note that since the summarizers for the second and third variants did not have access to the relief sentence categorizations, we decided to exclude from their input the two articles (one training, one test) classified by TDT2 Topic 89 as only containing brief mentions of the event of interest, as otherwise they would have no means of excluding the largely irrelevant material in these documents.",
        "RIPTIDES-IE managed a slightly higher grade of D+, despite the immature state of the IE system.",
        "As Table 2 shows, the differences in the overall scores were significant for all three RIPTIDES variants, as were the scores for organization and readability, though not for content in the cases of RIPTIDES-SIM1 and RIPTIDES-IE."

        "The RIPTIDES system is most similar to the SUMMONS system of Radev and McKeown [10], which summarized the results of MUC-4 IE systems in the terrorism domain.",
        "As a pioneering effort, the SUMMONS system was the first to suggest the potential of combining IE with NLG in a summarization system, though no evaluation was performed.",
        "In comparison to SUMMONS, RIPTIDES appears to be designed to more completely summarize larger input document sets, since it focuses more on finding the most relevant current information, and since it includes extracted sentences to round out the summaries.",
        "Another important difference is that SUMMONS sidestepped the problem of comparing reported numbers of varying specificity (e.g. several thousand vs. anywhere from 2000 to 5000 vs. up to 4000 vs. 5000), whereas we have implemented rules for doing so.",
        "Finally, we have begun to address some of the difficult issues that arise in merging information from multiple documents into a coherent event-oriented view, though considerable challenges remain to be addressed in this area.",
        "The sentence extraction part of the RIPTIDES system is similar to the domain-independent multidocument summarizers of Goldstein et al.",
        "[7] and Radev et al.",
        "[11] in the way it clusters sentences across documents to help determine which sentences are central to the collection, as well as to reduce redundancy amongst sentences included in the summary.",
        "It is simpler than these systems insofar as it does not make use of comparisons to the centroid of the document set.",
        "As pointed out in [2], it is difficult in general for multidocument summarizers to produce coherent summaries, since it is less straightforward to rely on the order of sentences in the underlying documents than in the case of single-document summarization.",
        "Having also noted this problem, we have focused our efforts in this area on attempting to balance coherence and informativeness in selecting sets of sentences to include in the summary.",
        "In ongoing work, we are investigating techniques for improving merging accuracy and summary fluency in the context of summarizing the more than 150 news articles we have collected from the web about each of the recent earthquakes in Central America and India (January, 2001).",
        "We also plan to investigate using tables and hypertext drill-down as a means to help the user verify the accuracy of the summarized information.",
        "By perusing the web collections mentioned above, we can see that trying to manually extricate the latest damage estimates from 150+ news articles from multiple sources on the same natural disaster would be very tedious.",
        "Although estimates do usually converge, they often change rapidly at first, and then are gradually dropped from later articles, and thus simply looking at the latest article is not satisfactory.",
        "While significant challenges remain, we suggest that our initial system development and evaluation shows that our approach has the potential to accurately summarize damage estimates, as well as identify other key story items using shallower techniques, and thereby help alleviate information overload in specific domains."
