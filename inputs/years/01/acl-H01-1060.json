        "We accomplish this using term-by-term translation, in which the basic data structure is a simple hash table lookup.",
        "Any translation requires some source of translation knowledge – we use a bilingual term list containing English translation(s) for each foreign language term.",
        "We typically construct these term lists by harvesting Internet-available translation resources, so the foreign language terms for which translations are known are typically an eclectic mix of root and inflected forms.",
