        "Starting with the Bayes decision rule as in speech recognition, we show how the required probability distributions can be structured into three parts: the language model, the alignment model and the lexicon model.",
        "We describe the components of the system and report results on the Verbmobil task.",
        "The experience obtained in the Verbmobil project, in particular a large-scale end-to-end evaluation, showed that the statistical approach resulted in significantly lower error rates than three competing translation approaches: the sentence error rate was 29% in comparison with 52% to 62% for the other translation approaches."

        "In comparison with written language, speech and especially spontaneous speech poses additional difficulties for the task of automatic translation.",
        "Typically, these difficulties are caused by errors of the recognition process, which is carried out before the translation process.",
        "As a result, the sentence to be translated is not necessarily well-formed from a syntactic point-of-view.",
        "Even without recognition errors, speech translation has to cope with a lack of conventional syntactic structures because the structures of spontaneous speech differ from that of written language.",
        "The statistical approach shows the potential to tackle these problems for the following reasons.",
        "First, the statistical approach is able to avoid hard decisions at any level of the translation process.",
        "Second, for any source sentence, a translated sentence in the target language is guaranteed to be generated.",
        "In most cases, this will be hopefully a syntactically perfect sentence in the target language; but even if this is not the case, in most cases, the translated sentence will convey the meaning of the spoken sentence.",
        "Whereas statistical modelling is widely used in speech recognition, there are so far only a few research groups that apply statistical modelling to language translation.",

        "The use of statistics in computational linguistics has been extremely controversial for more than three decades.",

        "This statement was considered to be true by the majority of experts from artificial intelligence and computational linguistics, and the concept of statistics was banned from computational linguistics for many years.",
        "What is overlooked in this statement is the fact that, in an automatic system for speech recognition or text translation, we are faced with the problem of taking decisions.",
        "It is exactly here where statistical decision theory comes in.",
        "In speech recognition, the success of the statistical approach is based on the equation:",
        "For the low-level description of speech and image signals, it is widely accepted that the statistical framework allows an efficient coupling between the observations and the models, which is often described by the buzz word subsymbolic processing.",
        "But there is another advantage in using probability distributions in that they offer an explicit formalism for expressing and combining hypothesis scores: The probabilities are directly used as scores: These scores are normalized, which is a desirable property: when increasing the score for a certain element in the set of all hypotheses, there must be one or several other elements whose scores are reduced at the same time.",
        "It is straightforward to combine scores: depending on the task, the probabilities are either multiplied or added.",
        "Weak and vague dependencies can be modelled easily.",
