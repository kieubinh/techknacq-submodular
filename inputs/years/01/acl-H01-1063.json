        "This model often attains high task completion rates, but the user is bound by many constraints throughout the interaction.",
        "Conversely, the user-initiative model offers maximum flexibility to the user in determining the preferred course of interaction.",
        "However this model often has lower task completion rates relative to the system-initiative model, especially when the users request falls beyond the system's competence level.",
        "To strike a balance between these two models, the mixed-initiative dialog model allows both the user and the system to influence the course of interaction.",
