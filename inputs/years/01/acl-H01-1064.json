        "Increasing amounts ofpublic, corporate, and private audio present a major challenge to speech, information retrieval, and human-computer interaction research: how can we help people to take advantage of these resources when current techniques for navigating them fall far short of text-based search methods?",

        "In SCANMail, messages are first retrieved from a voicemail server, then processed by the ASR server that provides a transcription.",
        "The message audio and/or transcription are then passed to the IE, IR, Email, and CallerId servers.",
        "The acoustic and language model of the recognizer, and the IE and IR servers are trained on 60 hours of a 100 hour voicemail corpus, transcribed and hand labeled for telephone numbers, caller names, times, dates, greetings and closings.",
        "The corpus includes approximately 10,000 messages from approximately 2500 speakers.",
        "About 90% of the messages were recorded from regular handsets, the rest from cellular and speaker-phones.",
        "The corpus is approximately gender balanced and approximately 12% of the messages were from non-native speakers.",
        "The mean duration of the messages was 36.4 seconds; the median was 30.0 seconds."

        "The baseline ASR system is a decision-tree based state-clustered triphone system with 8k tied states.",
        "The emission probabilities of the states are modeled by 12 component Gaussian mixture distributions.",
        "The system uses a 14k vocabulary, automatically generated by the AT&T Labs NextGen Text To Speech system.",
        "The language model is a Katz-style backoff trigram trained on 700k words from the transcriptions of the 60 hour training set.",
        "The word-error rate of this system on a 40 hour test set is 34.9%.",
        "Since the messages come from a highly variable source both in terms of speaker as well as channel characteristics, transcription accuracy is significantly improved by application of various normalization techniques, developed for Switchboard evaluations [9].",
        "The ASR server uses Vocal Tract Length Normalization (VTLN) [5], Constrained Modelspace Adaptation (CMA) [3], Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression (MLLR) [6] and Semi-Tied Covariances (STC) [4] to obtain progressively more accurate acoustic models and uses these in a rescoring framework.",
        "In contrast to Switchboard, voicemail messages are generally too short too allow direct application of the normalization techniques.",
        "A novel message clustering algorithm based on MLLR likelihood [1] is used to guarantee sufficient data for normalization.",
        "The final transcripts, obtained after 6 recognition passes, have a word error rate of 28.7% – a 6.2% accuracy improvement.",
        "Gender dependency provides 1.6% of this gain.",
        "VTLN then additively improves accuracy with 1.0% when applied only on the test data and an additional 0.3% when subsequently applied with a VTLN trained model.",
        "The use of STC further improves accuracy with 1.2%.",
        "Finally CMA and MLLR provide additive gains of 1.5% and 0.6% respectively.",
        "The ASR",
        "server, running on a 667 MHz 21264 Alpha processor, produces the final transcripts in approximately 20 times real-time."

        "The caller identification capability is based on text independent speaker recognition techniques applied to the processed speech in the voicemail messages.",
        "A user may elect to label a message he/she has reviewed with a caller name for the purpose of creating a speaker model for that caller.",
        "When the cumulative duration of such user-labeled messages is sufficient, a caller model is constructed.",
        "Subsequent messages will be processed and scored against this caller model and models for other callers the user may have designated.",
        "If the best matching model score for an incoming message exceeds a decision threshold, a caller name hypothesis is sent to the GUI client; if there is no PBX-supplied identification (i.e. caller name supplied from the owner of the extension for calls internal to the PBX), the CallerId hypothesis is presented in the message header, for either accepting or editing by the user; if there is a PBX identification, the CallerId hypothesis appears as the first item in a user ’contact menu’, together with all previously id’d callers for that user.",
        "To optimize the use of the available speech data, and to speed model-building, caller models are shared among users.",

        "Eight subjects performed a series of fact-finding, relevance ranking, and summarization tasks on artificial mailboxes of twenty messages each, using either SCANMail or phone access.",
        "SCANMail showed advantages for fact-finding and relevance ranking tasks in quality of solution normalized by time to solution, for fact-finding in time to solution and in overall user preference.",
        "Normalized performance scores are higher when subjects employ IR searches that are successful (i.e. the queries they choose contain words correctly recognized by the recognizer) and for subjects who listen to less audio and rely more upon the transcripts.",
        "However, we also found that SCANMail’s search capability can be misleading, causing subjects to assume that they have found all relevant documents when in fact some are NOT retrieved, and that when subjects rely upon the accuracy of the ASR transcript, they can miss crucial but unrecognized information.",
        "A trial of 10 friendly users is currently underway, with modifications to access functionality suggested by our subject users.",
        "A larger trial of the system is being prepared, for more extensive testing of user behavior with their own mailboxes over time."
