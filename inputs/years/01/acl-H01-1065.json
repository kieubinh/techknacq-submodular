        "Multidocument summarization poses a number of new challenges over single document summarization.",
        "Researchers have already investigated issues such as identifying repetitions or contradictions across input documents and determining which information is salient enough to include in the summary [1, 3, 6, 11, 15, 19].",
        "One issue that has received little attention is how to organize the selected information so that the output summary is coherent.",
        "Once all the relevant pieces of information have been selected across the input documents, the summarizer has to decide in which order to present them so that the whole text makes sense.",
        "In single document summarization, one possible ordering of the extracted information is provided by the input document itself.",
        "However, [10] observed that, in single document summaries written by professional summarizers, extracted sentences do not retain their precedence orders in the summary.",
        "Moreover, in the case of multiple input documents, this does not provide a useful solution: information may be drawn from different documents and therefore, no one document can provide an ordering.",
        "Furthermore, the order between two pieces of information can change significantly from one document to another.",
        "We investigate constraints on ordering in the context of multidocument summarization.",
        "We first describe two naive ordering algorithms, used in several systems and show that they do not yield satisfactory results.",
        "The first, Majority Ordering, is critically linked to the level of similarity of the information ordering across the input texts.",
        "But many times input texts have different structure, and therefore, this algorithm is not acceptable.",
        "The second, Chronological Ordering, can produce good results when the information is event-based and can, therefore, be ordered based on temporal occurence.",
        "However, texts do not always refer to events.",
        "We have conducted experiments to identify additional constraints using a manually built collection of multiple orderings of texts.",
        "These experiments show that cohesion as an important constraint.",
        "While it is recognized in the generation community that cohesion is a necessary feature for a generated text, we provide an operational way to automatically ensure cohesion when ordering sentences in an output summary.",
        "We augment the Chronological Ordering algorithm with a cohesion constraint, and compare it to the naive algorithms.",
        "Our framework is the MultiGen system [15], a domain independent multidocument summarizer which has been trained and tested on news articles.",
        "In the following sections, we first give an overview of MultiGen.",
        "We then describe the two naive ordering algorithms and evaluate them.",
        "We follow this with a study of multiple orderings produced by humans.",

        "Typically, in single document summarization, the order of sentences in the output summary is determined by their order in the input text.",
        "This strategy can be adapted to multidocument summarization.",
        "Consider two themes, Th1 and Th2; if sentences from Th1 preceed sentences from Th2 in all input texts, then presenting Th1 before Th2 is an acceptable order.",
        "But, when the order between sentences from Th1 and Th2 varies from one text to another, this strategy is not valid anymore.",
        "One way to define the order between Th1 and Th2 is to adopt the order occuring in the majority of the texts where Th1 and Th2 occur.",
        "This strategy defines a pairwise order between themes.",
        "However, this pairwise relation is not transitive; for example, given the themes Th1 and Th2 occuring in a text, Th2 and Th3 occuring in another text, and Th3 and Th1 occuring in a third text, there is a conflict between the orders (Th1 , Th2, Th3) and (Th3, Th1).",
        "Since transitivity is a necessary condition for a relation to be called an order, this relation does not form a global order.",
        "We, therefore, have to expand this pairwise relation to a global order.",
        "In other words, we have to find a linear order between themes which maximizes the agreement between the orderings imposed by the input texts.",

        "Stating this problem in terms of a directed graph where nodes are themes, and a vertex from Thi to Th; has for weight C~j, we are looking for a path with maximal weight which traverses each node exactly once.",
        "Unfortunately this problem is NP-complete; this can be shown by reducing the traveling salesman problem to this problem.",
        "Despite this fact, we still can apply this ordering, because typically the length of the output summary is limited to a small number of sentences.",
        "For longer summaries, the approximation algorithm described in [4] can be applied.",
        "Figures 1 and 2 show examples of produced summaries.",
        "The main problem with this strategy is that it can produce several orderings with the same weight.",
        "This happens when there is a tie between two opposite orderings.",
        "In this situation, this strategy does not provide enough constraints to determine one optimal ordering; one order is chosen randomly among the orders with maximal weight.",

        "A Fair summary is a text which makes sense but reordering of some sentences can yield a better readability.",
        "Finally, a summary which cannot be further improved by any sentence reordering is considered a Good summary.",

        "In our experiments, judges had strong agreement; they never gave three different grades to a summary.",
        "The MO algorithm produces a small number of Good summaries, but most of the summaries were graded as Fair.",
        "For instance, the summary graded Good shown in Figure 1 orders the information in a natural way; the text starts with a sentence summary of the event, then the outcome of the trial is given, a reminder of the facts that caused the trial and a possible explanation of the facts.",
        "Looking at the Good summaries produced by MO, we found that it performs well when the input articles follow the same order when presenting the information.",
        "In other words, the algorithm produces a good ordering if the input articles orderings have high agreement.",
        "On the other hand, when analyzing Poor summaries, as in Figure 2, we observe that the input texts have very different orderings.",

      "text": [
        "Finding an acceptable ordering has not been studied before in summarization.",
        "In single document summarization,",
        "summary sentences are typically arranged in the same order that they were found in the full document (although [10] reports that human summarizers do sometimes change the original order).",
        "In multidocument summarization, the summary consists of fragments of text or sentences that were selected from different texts.",
        "Thus, there is no complete ordering of summary sentences that can be found in the original documents.",
        "The ordering task has been extensively investigated in the generation community [14, 17, 9, 2, 16].",
        "One approach is top-down, using schemas [14] or plans [5] to determine the organizational structure of the text.",
        "This appproach postulates a rhetorical structure which can be used to select information from an underlying knowledge base.",
        "Because the domain is limited, an encoding can be developed of the kinds of propositional content that match rhetorical elements of the schema or plan, thereby allowing content to be selected and ordered.",
        "Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) allows for more flexibility in ordering content.",
        "The relations occur between pairs of propositions.",
        "Constraints based on intention (e.g., [17]), plan-like conventions [9], or stylistic constraints [2] are used as preconditions on the plan operators containing RST relations to determine when a relation is used and how it is ordered with respect to other relations.",
        "MultiGen generates summaries of news on any topic.",
        "In an unconstrained domain like this, it would be impossible to enumerate the semantics for all possible types of sentences which could match the elements of a schema, a plan or rhetorical relations.",
        "Furthermore, it would be difficult to specify a generic rhetorical plan for a summary of news.",
        "Instead, content determination in MultiGen is opportunistic, depending on the kinds of similarities that happen to exist between a set of news documents.",
        "Similarly, we describe here an ordering scheme that is opportunistic and bottom up, depending on the coherence and temporal connections that happen to exist between selected text.",
        "Our approach is similar to the use of basic blocks [16] where a bottom-up technique is used to group together stretches of text in a long, generated document by finding propositions that are related by a common focus.",
        "Since this approach was developed for a generation system, it finds related propositions by comparisons of proposition arguments at the semantic level.",
        "In our case, we are dealing with a surface representation, so we find alternative methods for grouping text fragments.",
        "7.",
        "CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK In this paper we investigated information ordering constraints in multidocument summarization.",
        "We analyzed two naive ordering algorithms, the Majority Ordering (MO) and the Chronological Ordering (CO).",
        "We show that the MO algorithm performs well only when all input texts follow similar presentation of the information.",
        "The CO algorithm can provide an acceptable solution for many cases, but is not sufficient when summaries contain information that is not event based.",
        "We report on the experiments we conducted to identify other constraints contributing to ordering.",
        "We show that cohesion is an important factor, and describe an operational way to incorporate it in the CO algorithm.",
        "This results in a definite improvement of the overall quality of automatically generated summaries.",
        "In future work, we first plan to extend our collection of multiple orderings, so that we can extract more regularities and understand better how human order information to produce a readable and fluent text.",
        "Even though we did not encounter any misleading inferences introduced by reordering MultiGen output, we plan to do an extended study of the side effects caused by reorderings.",
        "We also plan to investigate whether the MO algorithm can be improved by applying it on cohesive blocks of themes, rather than themes."
