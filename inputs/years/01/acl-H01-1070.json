        "For Thai users, there are always two annoyances while typing Thai-English bilingual documents, which are usual for Thais.",
        "The first is when the users want to switch from typing Thai to English, they have to input a special key to tell the operating system to change the language mode.",
        "Further, if the language-switching key is ignored, they have to delete the token just typed and retype that token after language switching.",
        "The second is that Thai has more than 100 alphabets, to input about half of all Thai characters, the user has to use combinations of two keys (shift key + another key) to input them.",
        "Some of the other Asian users also have the same problem.",
        "It will be wonderful, if there is a intelligent keyboard system that is able to perform these two tasks –switching language and shifting key– automatically.",
        "This paper proposes a practical solution for these disturbances by applying trigram character probabilistic model and error-correction rules.",
        "To optimize number of the generated error-correction rules, we propose a rule reduction approach using mutual information.",
        "More than 99 percent of key prediction accuracy results are reported."

        "In the traditional Thai keyboard input system, a key button with the help of language-switching key and the shift key can output 4 different characters.",
        "For example, in the Thai keyboard the ‘a’-key button can represent 4 different characters in different modes as shown in Table 1.",
        "However, using NLP technique, the Thai-English keyboard system which can predict the key users intend to type without the language-selection key and the shift key, should be efficiently implemented.",
        "We propose an intelligent keyboard system to solve this problem and have implemented with successful result.",
        "To solve this problem, there are basically two steps: language identification and Thai key prediction.",
        "Figure 1 shows how the system works."

        "The following example illustrates the disturbance of language switching.",
        "In the Thai input mode, typing a word “language” will result “” .",
        "It is certain that the user has to delete sequence “aw5 wJ ” and then switches to the English mode before retyping the key sequence to get the correct result of “language”.",
        "Therefore an intelligent system to perform language switching automatically is helpful in eliminating the annoyance.",
        "In general, different languages are not typed connectedly without spaces between them.",
        "The language-identification process starts when a non-space character is typed after a space.",
        "Many works in language identification, [3] and [5], have claimed that the n-gram model gives a high accuracy on language identification.",
        "After trying both trigrams and bigrams, we found that bigrams were superior.",

        "In some cases of Thai character sequence, the trigram model fails to predict the correct key.",

        "2) Similarly, If the Lm(xyz) is less than 1.20 then pattern xyz is reduced to yz.",
        "3) Rules 1 and 2 are applied recursively until the considered pattern cannot be shortened anymore.",
        "After all patterns are shortened, the following rules are applied to eliminate the redundant patterns.",
        "1) All duplicate rules are unified.",
        "2) The rules that contribute less 0.2 per cent of error corrections are eliminated.",
        "There are three steps in applying the error-correction rules:",
        "1) Search the error patterns in the text being typed.",
        "2) Replace the error patterns with the correct patterns.",
        "3) If there are more than one pattern matched, the longest pattern will be selected.",
        "In order to optimize the speed of error-correction processing and correct the error in the real time, the finite-automata pattern matching ([4] and [6]) is applied to search error sequences.",
