        "Topic segmentation in the paradigm used in this study and others (Allan et al.",
        "1998) proceeds in two phases.",
        "In the first phase, the input is divided into contiguous strings of words assumed to belong to the same topic.",
        "We refer to this step as chopping.",
        "For example, in textual input, the natural units for chopping are sentences (as can be inferred from punctuation and capitalization), since we can assume that topics do not change in mid sentence.'",
        "For continuous speech input, the choice of chopping criteria is less obvious; we compare several possibilities in our experimental evaluation.",
        "Here, for simplicity, we will use \"sentence\" to refer to units of chopping, regardless of the criterion used.",
        "In the second phase, the sentences are further grouped into contiguous stretches belonging to one topic, i.e., the sentence boundaries are classified into topic boundaries and nontopic boundaries.'",

        "The job of the prosodic model is to estimate the posterior probability (or, alternatively, likelihood) of a topic change at a given word boundary, based on prosodic features extracted from the data.",
        "For the prosodic model to be effective, one must devise suitable, automatically extractable features.",
        "Feature values extracted from a corpus can then be used in training probability estimators and to select a parsimonious subset of features for modeling purposes.",
        "We discuss each of these steps in turn in the following sections.",
        "3.1.1 Features.",
        "We started with a large collection of features capturing two major aspects of speech prosody, similar to our previous work (Shriberg, Bates, and Stolcke 1997): Duration features: duration of pauses, duration of final vowels and final rhymes, and versions of these features normalized both for phone durations and speaker statistics.3 Pitch features: fundamental frequency (FO) patterns preceding and following the boundary, FO patterns across the boundary, and pitch range relative to the speaker's baseline.",
        "We processed the raw FO estimates (obtained with ESPS signal processing software from Entropic Research Laboratory [1993]), with robustness-enhancing techniques developed by Stinmez et al.",
        "(1998).",
        "We did not use amplitude or energy-based features since exploratory work showed these to be much less reliable than duration and pitch and largely redundant given the above features.",
        "One reason for omitting energy features is that, unlike duration and pitch, energy-related measurements vary with channel characteristics.",
        "Since channel properties vary widely in broadcast news, features based on energy measures can correlate with shows, speakers, and so forth, rather than with the structural locations in which we were interested.",
        "We included features that, based on the descriptive literature, should reflect breaks in the temporal and intonational contour.",
        "We developed versions of such features that could be defined at each interword boundary, and that could be extracted by completely automatic means (no human labeling).",
        "Furthermore, the features were designed to be as independent of word identities as possible, for robustness to imperfect recognizer output.",
        "A brief characterization of the informative features for the segmentation task is given with our results in Section 4.6.",
        "Since the focus here is on computational modeling we refer the reader to a companion paper (Shriberg et al.",
        "2000) for a detailed description of the acoustic processing and prosodic feature extraction.",
        "exponential models, or naive Bayes networks) could be used as posterior probability estimators.",

        "The foremost reason for our preference for decision trees, however, is that the learned models can be inspected and diagnosed by human investigators.",
        "This ability is crucial for understanding what features are used and how, and for debugging the feature extraction process itself.4 Let F, be the features extracted from a window around the ith potential topic boundary (chopping boundary), and let B, be the boundary type (boundary/no-boundary) at that position.",
        "We trained decision trees to predict the ith boundary type, i.e., to estimate P(B,IF,, W).",
        "The decision is only weakly conditioned on the word sequence W, insofar as some of the prosodic features depend on the phonetic alignment of the word models (which we will denote with We).",
        "We can thus expect the prosodic model estimates to be robust to recognition errors.",

        "The greedy nature of the decision tree learning algorithm implies that larger initial feature sets can give worse results than smaller subsets.",

        "For this purpose we developed an iterative feature selection \"wrapper\" algorithm (John, Kohavi, and Pfleger 1994) that finds useful, task-specific feature subsets.",
        "The algorithm combines elements of a brute-force search with previously determined heuristics about good groupings of features.",
        "The algorithm proceeds in two phases: In the first phase, the number of features is reduced by leaving out one feature at a time during tree construction.",
        "A feature whose removal increases performance is marked as to be avoided.",
        "The second phase then starts with the reduced feature set and performs a beam search over all possible subsets to maximize tree performance.",
        "We used entropy reduction in the overall tree (after cross-validation pruning) as a metric for comparing alternative feature subsets.",
        "Entropy reduction is the difference in entropy between the prior class distribution and the posterior distribution estimated by the tree, as measured on a held-out set; it is a more fine-grained metric than classification accuracy, and is also more relevant to the model combination approach described later.",

        "The recent TDT2 evaluation used a different set of broadcast news data that postdated the material we used, and was generated by a different speech recognizer (although with a similar word error rate) (Cieri et al.",
        "1999).",
        "Nevertheless we have attempted to calibrate our results with respect to these TDT2 results.'",
        "We have not tried to compare our results to research outside the TDT evaluation framework.",
        "In fact, other evaluation methodologies differ too much to allow meaningful quantitative comparisons across publications.",
        "We wanted to ensure that the TDT2 evaluation test set was comparable in segmentation difficulty to our test set drawn from the 1997 BN corpus, and that the TDT2 metrics behaved similarly on both sets.",
        "To this end, we ran an early version of our words-only segmenter on both test sets.",
        "As shown in Table 4, not only are the results on recognized words quite close, but the optimal false alarm/miss trade-off is similar as well, indicating that the two corpora have roughly similar topic granularities.",
        "While the full prosodic component of our topic segmenter was not applied to the TDT2 test corpus, we can compare the performance of a simplified version of SRI's segmenter to other evaluation systems (Fiscus et al.",
        "1999).",
        "The two best-performing systems in the evaluation were those of CMU (Beeferman, Berger, and Lafferty 1999) with Cseg = 0.1463, and Dragon (Yamron et al.",
        "1998; van Mulbregt et al.",
        "1999) with Cseg = 0.1579.",
        "The SRI system achieved Cseg = 0.1895.",
        "All systems in the evaluation, including ours, used only information from words and pause durations determined by a speech recognizer.",
        "A good reference to calibrate our performance is the Dragon system, from which we borrowed the lexical HMM segmentation framework.",
        "Dragon made adjustments in its lexical modeling that account for the improvements relative to the basic HMM structure on which our system is based.",
        "As described by van Mulbregt et al.",
        "(1999), a significant segmentation error reduction was obtained from optimizing the number of topic clusters (kept fixed at 100 in our system).",
        "Second, Dragon introduced more supervision into the model training by building separate LMs for segments that had been hand-labeled as not related to news (such as sports and commercials) in the TDT2 training corpus, which also resulted in substantial improvements.",
        "Finally, Dragon used some of the TDT2 training data for tuning the model to the specifics of the TDT2 corpus.",
        "In summary, the performance of our combined lexical-prosodic system with Cseg = 0.1438 is competitive with the best word-based systems reported to date.",
        "More importantly, since we found the prosodic and lexical knowledge sources to complement each other, and since Dragon's improvements for TDT2 were confined to a better modeling of the lexical information, we would expect that adding these improvements to our combined segmenter would lead to a significant improvement in the state of the art.",
        "11 Since our study was conducted, a third round of TDT benchmarks (TDT3) has taken place (NIST 1999).",
        "However, for TDT3, the topic segmentation evaluation metric was modified and the most recent results are thus not directly comparable with those from TDT2 or the present study.",

        "Results so far indicate that prosodic information provides an excellent source of information for automatic topic segmentation, both by itself and in conjunction with lexical information.",
        "Pause duration, a simple prosodic feature that is readily available as a by-product of speech recognition, proved highly effective in the initial chopping phase, and was the most important feature used by prosodic decision trees.",
        "Additional, pitch-based prosodic features are also effective as features in the decision tree.",
        "The results obtained with recognized words (at 30% word error rate) did not differ greatly from those obtained with correct word transcripts.",
        "No significant degradation was found with the words-only segmentation model, while the best combined model exhibited about a 5% error increase with recognized words.",
        "The lack of degradation on the words-only model may be partly due to the fact that the recognizer generally outputs fewer words than contained in the correct transcripts, biasing the segmenter toward a lower false alarm rate.",
        "Still, part of the appeal of prosodic segmentation is that it is inherently robust to recognition errors.",
        "This characteristic makes it even more attractive for use in domains with higher error rates due to poor acoustic conditions or more conversational speaking styles.",
        "It is especially encouraging that the prosody-only segmenter achieved competitive performance.",
        "It was fairly straightforward to modify the original Dragon HMM segmenter (Yamron et al.",
        "1998), which is based purely on topical word usage, to incorporate discourse cues, both lexical and prosodic.",
        "The addition of these discourse cues proved highly effective, especially in the case of prosody.",
        "The alternative knowledge source combination approach, using HMM posterior probabilities as decision tree inputs, was also effective, although less so than the HMM-based approach.",
        "Note that the HMM-based integration, as implemented here, makes more stringent assumptions about the independence of lexical and prosodic cues.",
        "The combined decision tree, on the other hand, has some ability to model dependencies between lexical and prosodic cues.",
        "The fact that the HMM-based combination approach gave the best results is thus indirect evidence that lexical and prosodic knowledge sources are indeed largely independent.",
        "Apart from the question of probabilistic independence, it seems that lexical and prosodic models are also complementary in the errors they make.",
        "This is manifested in the different distributions of miss and false alarm errors discussed in Section 4.5.",
        "It is also easy to find examples where the two models make complementary errors.",
        "Figure 8 shows two topic boundaries that are missed by one model but not the other.",
        "Several aspects of our model are preliminary or suboptimal in nature and can be improved.",
        "Even when testing on recognized words, we used parameters optimized on forced alignments.",
        "This is suboptimal but convenient, since it avoids the need to run word recognition on the relatively large training set.",
        "Since results on recognized words are very similar to those on true words, we can conclude that not much was lost with this expedient.",
        "Also, we have not yet optimized the chopping stage relative to the combined model (only relative to the words-only segmenter).",
        "The use of prosodic features other than pause duration for chopping should further improve the overall performance.",
        "The improvement obtained with source-dependent topic switch penalties and posterior thresholds suggests that more comprehensive source-dependent modeling would be beneficial.",
        "In particular, both prosodic and lexical discourse cues are likely to be somewhat source specific (e.g., because of different show formats and different speakers).",
        "Given enough training data, it is straightforward to train source-dependent models.",
