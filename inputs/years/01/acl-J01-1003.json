        "Since language informants are not expected or required to be well-versed in computational linguistics in general, or in recent approaches to building morphological analyzers (e.g., Kosken-niemi 1983; Antworth 1990; Karttunen, Kaplan, and Zaenen 1992; Karttunen 1994) and the operation of state-of-the-art finite-state tools (e.g., Karttunen 1993; Karttunen and Beesley 1992; Karttunen et al.",
        "1996; Mohri, Pereira, and Riley 1998; van Noord 1999; van Noord and Gerdemann 1999) in particular, the generation of the morphological analyzer component has to be accomplished semiautomatically.",
        "The informant will be guided through a knowledge elicitation procedure using the elicitation component of Expedition, the Boas system.",
        "As this task is not easy, we expect that the development of the morphological analyzer will be an iterative process, whereby the human informant will revise and/or refine the information previously elicited based on the feedback from test runs of the nascent analyzer.",
        "The work reported in this paper describes the process of building and refining morphological analyzers using data elicited from human informants and machine learning.",
        "The main use of machine learning in our current approach is in the automatic learning of formal rewrite or replace rules for morphographemic changes derived from the examples provided by the informant.",
        "The subtask of accounting for morphographemic changes is perhaps one of the more complicated aspects of building an analyzer; by automating it, we expect to improve productivity.",
        "After a review of related work, we very briefly describe the Boas project, of which the current work is a part.",
        "Subsequent sections describe the details of the approach, the architecture of the morphological analyzer, the elicited descriptive data, and the computational processes performed on this data, including segmentation and the induction of morphographemic rules.",
        "We then provide a detailed example of applying this approach to developing a morphological analyzer for Polish.",

        "Machine learning techniques are widely employed in many aspects of language processing.",
        "The availability of large, annotated corpora has fueled a significant amount of work in the application of machine learning techniques to language processing problems, such as part-of-speech tagging, grammar induction, and sense disambiguation, as witnessed by recent workshops and journal issues dedicated to this topic.'",
        "The current work attempts to contribute to this literature by describing a human-supervised machine learning approach to the induction of morphological analyzers – a problem that, surprisingly, has received little attention.",
        "There have been a number of studies on inducing morphographemic rules from a list of inflected words and a root word list.",
        "Johnson (1984) presents a scheme for inducing phonological rules from surface data, mainly in the context of studying certain aspects of language acquisition.",
        "The premise is that languages have a finite number of alternations to be handled by morphographemic rules and a fixed number of contexts in which they appear; so if there is enough data, phonological rewrite rules can be generated to account for the data.",
        "Rules are ordered by some notion of \"surfaciness\", and at each stage the most surfacy rule – the rule with the most transparent context – is selected.",
        "Golding and Thompson (1985) describe an approach for inducing rules of English word formation from a corpus of root forms and the corresponding inflected forms.",
        "The procedure described there generates a sequence of transformation rules,' each specifying how to perform a particular inflection.",
        "More recently, Theron and Cloete (1997) have presented a scheme for obtaining two-level morphology rules from a set of aligned segmented and surface pairs.",
        "They use the notion of string edit sequences, assuming that only insertions and deletions are applied to a root form to get the inflected form.",
        "They determine the root form associated with an inflected form (and consequently the suffixes and prefixes) by exhaustively matching the inflected form against all root words.",
        "The motivation is that \"real\" suffixes will appear frequently in the corpus of inflected forms.",
        "Once common suffixes and prefixes are identified, the segmentation for an inflected word can be determined by choosing the segmentation with the most frequently occurring affix segments; the remainder is then considered the root.",
        "While this procedure seems to",
        "be reasonable for a small root word list, the potential for \"noisy\" or incorrect alignments is quite high when the corpus of inflected forms is large and the procedure is not given any prior knowledge of possible segmentations.",
        "As a result, automatically selecting the \"correct\" segmentation becomes nontrivial.",
        "An additional complication is that allomorphs show up as distinct affixes and their counts in segmentations are not accumulated, which might lead to actual segmentations being missed due to fragmentation.",
        "The rules are not induced via a learning scheme: aligned pairs are compressed into a special data structure and traversals over this data structure generate morphographemic rules.",
        "Theron and Cloete have experimented with pluralization in Afrikaans, and the resulting system has shown about 94% accuracy on unseen words.",
        "Goldsmith (1998) has used an unsupervised learning method based on the minimum description length principle to learn the \"morphology\" of a number of languages.",
        "What is learned is a set of root words and affixes, and common inflectional-pattern classes.",
        "The system requires just a corpus of words in a language.",
        "In the absence of any root word list to use as a scaffolding, the shortest forms that appear frequently are assumed to be roots, and observed surface forms are then either generated by the concatenative affixation of suffixes or by rewrite rules.3 Since the system has no notion of what the roots and their part-of-speech values really are, and what morphological information is encoded by the affixes, this information needs to be retrofitted manually by a human, who has to weed through a large number of noisy rules.",
        "We feel that this approach, while quite novel, can be used to build real-world morphological analyzers only after substantial modifications are made."

        "So, the whole process is an iterative one, with convergence to a wide-coverage analyzer coming slowly at the beginning (where morphological phenomena and lexicon abstractions are being defined and tested), but significantly speeding up once wholesale lexical acquisition starts.",
        "Since the generation of the operational content (data files to be used by the morphological analyzer engine) from the elicited descriptions is expected to take only a few minutes, feedback on operational performance can be provided very quickly.",
        "Human languages have many diverse morphological phenomena and it is not our intent at this point to have a universal architecture that can accommodate any and all phenomena.",

        "Thus, in a reverse lookup, a given surface form may be interpreted in multiple ways, if applicable.",

        "We have tested the rule learning component above on several other languages including Turkish, an agglutinating language, using an example base with lexical forms produced by a variant of the two-level morphology-based finite-state morphological analyzer described in Oflazer (1994).",
        "The lexical representation for Turkish also involved meta symbols (such as H for high vowels, D for dentals, etc.",
        "), which would be resolved with the appropriate surface symbol by the rules learned.",
        "For instance, vowel harmony rules would learn to resolve H as one of 1, i , u, u in the appropriate context.",
        "Furthermore, the version of the rule learning (sub)system used for Turkish also made use of context-bound morphophonological distinctions that are not elicited in Boas, such as high vowels, low unrounded vowels, dentals, etc.",
        "The rules generated were the most general set of rules that did not conflict with the example base.",
        "There were many examples in the example base that involved multiple suffixes, not just one, as in the inflecting languages we address in this paper.",
        "It was quite satisfying to observe that the system could learn rules for dealing with vowel harmony, devoicing, and so on.",
        "A caveat is that if there were too many examples and too many morphophonological classes, the number of candidate rules to be tried increased exponentially.",
        "This could be alleviated to a certain extent by a careful selection of the example base.",
        "Thus, the rule-learning component is applicable to agglutinative, and also to in-fixing and circumfixing languages, provided there is a proper representation of the lexical and surface forms.",
        "However, for infixing languages it could be very problem",
        "atic to have a linear representation of the infixation, with the lexical root being split in two and the morphotactics picking up the first part, the infix, and the second part.",
        "To prevent overgeneration, the infix lexicon might have to be replicated for each root, to enforce the fact that the two parts of the stem go together.'",
        "The case for circumfix-ation is simpler since the number of such morphemes is assumed to be much smaller than the number of stems, so the circumfixing morphemes can be split up into two lexicons and treated as a prefix-suffix combination.",
        "The co-occurrence restrictions for the respective pairs can then be manually enforced with finite-state constraints that can be added to the lexical and surfacy constraints section of the analyzer (see Figure 2).",
        "Thus, in all three cases, learning the rules is not a problem provided the example base is in the requisite linear representation.",
        "On the other hand, this approach as such is inapplicable to languages like Arabic, which have radically different word formation processes (for which a number of other finite-state approaches have been proposed; (see, for example, Beesley [1996] and Kiraz [2000]).",

        "Also, in languages that have a phenomenon like vowel harmony, such as Turkish, even if all harmonic allomorphs of a certain suffix are somehow automatically grouped into a lexicon without any further abstraction, severe overgeneration would result, unless the all root and suffix lexicons were split or replicated along vowel lines.",
        "In such cases, a human informant (who possesses a certain familiarity with morphographemics and issues of overgeneration) may have to resort to manual abstraction of the morpheme representations.",

      "text": [
        "We have presented the highlights of our approach for automatically generating finite-state morphological analyzers from information elicited from human informants.",
        "Our approach uses transformation-based learning to induce morphographemic rules from examples and combines these rules with the lexicon information elicited to compile the morphological analyzer.",
        "There are other opportunities for using machine learning in this process.",
        "For instance, one of the important issues in wholesale acquisition of",
        " open-class items is that of determining which paradigm a given citation form belongs to.",
        "From the examples given during the acquisition phase, it is possible to induce a classifier that can perform this selection to aid the language informant.",
        "We believe that we have presented a viable approach to the automatic generation of a natural language processor.",
        "Since this approach involves a human informant working in an elicit-generate-test loop, the noise and opaqueness of other induction schemes can be avoided.",
        "We also feel that the task of analyzing a set of incorrectly generated forms and automatically offering a diagnosis of what may have gone wrong and what additional examples can be supplied as remedies is, in itself, an important aspect of this work.",
        "Although we have only scratched the surface of this topic here, we consider it a fruitful extension of the work described in this paper."
