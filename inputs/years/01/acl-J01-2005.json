        "In an effort to formalize the common elements of unification-style grammars, Shieber (1992) developed a logic for describing them, and used this logic to define an abstract parsing algorithm.",
        "The algorithm uses the same set of operations as Earley's (1970) algorithm for context-free grammars, but modified for unification grammars.",
        "In this paper, we show that, under certain conditions, Shieber's algorithm produces unintended, spurious parses in addition to the intended ones.",
        "We call these spurious parses nonminimal derivations (or nonminimal parse trees), because they contain extra features which are not in the productions that license the parse.'",
        "We claim that such nonminimal derivations are invalid.",
        "The basis of our claim is that the unification operation as set union preserves minimality; thus any correct unification-based parsing algorithm should produce parses that contain all and only features from the licensing productions (i.e., minimal derivations or minimal parse trees).",
        "Nonminimal derivations are also undesirable in practice because, given a parse tree, we cannot tell whether a particular feature should be in the model or not unless we reconstruct the whole tree.",

However, automatic detection of such features (i.e., automatic derivation of p) is undecidable for the same reason as the prediction nontermination problem (caused by left recursion) for unification grammars (Shieber 1985).",
