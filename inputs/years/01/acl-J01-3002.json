        "English speech lacks the acoustic analog of blank spaces that people are accustomed to seeing between words in written text.",
        "Discovering words in continuous spoken speech is thus an interesting problem and one that has been treated at length in the literature.",
        "The problem of identifying word boundaries is particularly significant in the parsing of written text in languages that do not explicitly include spaces between words.",
        "In addition, if we assume that children start out with little or no knowledge of the inventory of words the language possesses identification of word boundaries is a significant problem in the domain of child language acquisition.'",
        "Although speech lacks explicit demarcation of word boundaries, it is undoubtedly the case that it nevertheless possesses significant other cues for word discovery.",
        "However, it is still a matter of interest to see exactly how much can be achieved without the incorporation of these other cues; that is, we are interested in the performance of a bare-bones language model.",
        "For example, there is much evidence that stress patterns (Jusczyk, Cutler, and Redanz 1993; Cutler and Carter 1987) and phonotactics of speech (Mattys and Jusczyk 1999) are of considerable aid in word discovery.",
        "But a bare-bones statistical model is still useful in that it allows us to quantify precise improvements in performance upon the integration of each specific cue into the model.",
        "We present and evaluate one such statistical model in this paper.'",
        "The main contributions of this study are as follows: First, it demonstrates the applicability and competitiveness of a conservative, traditional approach for a task for which nontraditional approaches have been proposed even recently (Brent 1999; Brent and Cartwright 1996; de Marcken 1995; Elman 1990; Christiansen, Allen, and Seiden-berg 1998).",
        "Second, although the model leads to the development of an algorithm that learns the lexicon in an unsupervised fashion, results of partial supervision are presented, showing that its performance is consistent with results from learning theory.",
        "Third, the study extends previous work to higher-order n-grams, specifically up to"

        "While there exists a reasonable body of literature regarding text segmentation, especially with respect to languages such as Chinese and Japanese that do not explicitly include spaces between words, most of the statistically based models and algorithms tend to fall into the supervised learning category.",
        "These require the model to be trained first on a large corpus of text before it can segment its input.'",
        "It is only recently that interest in unsupervised algorithms for text segmentation seems to have gained ground.",
        "A notable exception in this regard is the work by Ando and Lee (1999) which tries to infer word boundaries from character n-gram statistics of Japanese Kanji strings.",
        "For example, a decision to insert a word boundary between two characters is made solely based on whether character n-grams adjacent to the proposed boundary are relatively more frequent than character n-grams that straddle it.",
        "This algorithm, however, is not based on a formal statistical model and is closer in spirit to approaches based on transitional probability between phonemes or syllables in speech.",
        "One such approach derives from experiments by Saffran, Newport, and Aslin (1996) suggesting that young children might place word boundaries between two syllables where the second syllable is surprising given the first.",
        "This technique is described and evaluated in Brent (1999).",
        "Other approaches not based on explicit probability models include those based on information theoretic criteria such as minimum description length (Brent and Cartwright 1996; de Marcken 1995) and simple recurrent networks (Elman 1990; Christiansen, Allen, and Seidenberg 1998).",
        "The maximum likelihood approach due to Olivier (1968) is probabilistic in the sense that it is geared toward explicitly calculating the most probable segmentation of each block of input utterances (see also Batchelder 1997).",
        "However, the algorithm involves heuristic steps in periodic purging of the lexicon and in the creation in the lexicon of new words.",
        "Furthermore, this approach is again not based on a formal statistical model.",
        "Model Based Dynamic Programming, hereafter referred to as MBDP-1 (Brent 1999), is probably the most recent work that addresses exactly the same issue as that considered in this paper.",
        "Both the approach presented in this paper and Brent's MBDP-1 are unsupervised approaches based on explicit probability models.",

        "It is assumed that the entire input corpus, consisting of a concatenation of all utterances in sequence, is a single event in probability space and that the best segmentation of each utterance is implied by the best segmentation of the corpus itself.",
        "The model thus focuses on explicitly calculating probabilities for every possible segmentation of the entire corpus, and subsequently picking the segmentation with the maximum probability.",
        "More precisely, the model attempts to calculate",
        "for each possible segmentation of the input corpus where the left-hand side is the exact probability of that particular segmentation of the corpus into words dim = wi w2 Wm; and the sums are over all possible numbers of words n, in the lexicon, all possible lexicons L, all possible frequencies f, of the individual words in this lexicon and all possible orders of words s, in the segmentation.",
        "In practice, the implementation uses an incremental approach that computes the best segmentation of the entire corpus up to step i, where the ith step is the corpus up to and including the ith utterance.",
        "Incremental performance is thus obtained by computing this quantity anew after each segmentation i - 1, assuming however, that segmentations of utterances up to but not including i are fixed.",
        "There are two problems with this approach.",
        "First, the assumption that the entire corpus of observed speech should be treated as a single event in probability space appears rather radical.",
        "This fact is appreciated even in Brent (1999), which states \"From a cognitive perspective, we know that humans segment each utterance they hear without waiting until the corpus of all utterances they will ever hear becomes available\" (p. 89).",
        "Thus, although the incremental algorithm in Brent (1999) is consistent with a developmental model, the formal statistical model of segmentation is not.",
        "Second, making the assumption that the corpus is a single event in probability space significantly increases the computational complexity of the incremental algorithm.",
        "The approach presented in this paper circumvents these problems through the use of a conservative statistical model that is directly implementable as an incremental algorithm.",

        "However, note that the model proposed in this paper has been developed entirely along conventional lines and has not made the somewhat radical assumption that the entire observed corpus is a single event in probability space.",
        "Assuming that the corpus consists of a single event, as Brent does, requires the explicit calculation of the probability of the lexicon in order to calculate the probability of any single segmentation.",
        "This calculation is a nontrivial task since one has to sum over all possible orders of words in L. This fact is recognized in Brent (1999, Appendix), where the expression for P(L) is derived as an approximation.",
        "One can imagine then that it would be correspondingly more difficult to extend the language model in Brent (1999) beyond the case of unigrams.",
        "In practical terms, recalculating lexicon probabilities before each segmentation increases the running time of an implementation of the algorithm.",
        "Although all the algorithms discussed tend to complete within one minute on the reported corpus, MBDP-1's running time is quadratic in the number of utterances, while the language models presented here enable computation in almost linear time.",
        "The typical running time of MBDP-1 on the 9790-utterance corpus averages around 40 seconds per run on a 300 MHz i686 PC while the 1-gram, 2-gram, and 3-gram models average around 7, 10, and 14 seconds, respectively.",
        "Furthermore, the language models presented in this paper estimate probabilities as relative frequencies, using commonly used back-off procedures, and so they do not assume any priors over integers.",
        "However, MBDP-1 requires the assumption of two distributions over integers, one to pick a number for the size of the lexicon and another to pick a frequency for each word in the lexicon.",
        "Each is assumed such that the probability of a given integer P(i) is given by We have since found some evidence suggesting that the choice of a particular prior does not offer any significant advantage over the choice of any other prior.",
        "For example, we have tried running MBDP-1 using P(i) = 2' and still obtained comparable results.",
        "It should be noted, however, that no such subjective prior needs to be chosen in the model presented in this paper.",
        "The other important difference between MBDP-1 and the present model is that MBDP-1 assumes a uniform distribution over all possible word orders.",
        "That is, in a corpus that contains nk distinct words such that the frequency in the corpus of the ith",
        "because the number of unique orderings is precisely the reciprocal of the above quantity.",

        "When it does infer a word boundary, it is likely to be correct.",
        "This contributes to its relatively higher precision since precision is a measure of the proportion of inferred boundaries that were correct.",

        "Poorer lexicon precision is likewise explained.",
        "Because the 3-gram model is more conservative, it infers new words only when there is strong evidence for them.",

        "Some preliminary results we have obtained in this regard appear to be encouraging.",
        "With regard to estimation of word probabilities, a fruitful avenue we are exploring involves modification of the model to address the sparse data problem using interpolation such that P(Wi Wi-2, W1-1) = A3f (Wi IWi-2, Wi-1) A2f(Wi Wi-1) Alf (Wi) where the positive coefficients satisfy A + A2 + A3 = 1 and can be derived so as to maximize P(W).",
        "Taking the lead from Brent (1999), attempts to model more complex distributions for unigrams such as those based on template grammars, as well as the systematic incorporation of prosodic, stress, and phonotactic constraint information into the model, are both subjects of current interest.",
        "Unpublished results already obtained suggest that biasing the segmentation such that every word must have at least one vowel in it dramatically increases segmentation precision from 67.7% to 81.8%, and imposing a constraint that words can begin or end only with permitted clusters of consonants increases precision to 80.65%.",
