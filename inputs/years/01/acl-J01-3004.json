        "The former allows us to ensure broad consistency of perspective and informational organization across elements presented using different mediae.g., across diagram and text; the latter allows us to draw closer to the kind of sophisticated layout that is observable in human-produced presentations.",

        "that are expressively adequate, but not over-expressive, for that dataset.",
        "The theoretical basis of these methods is given in detail in Kamps (1997; 1998).",
        "They rest on a new application of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) (Wille 1982).",
        "FCA is an applied mathematical discipline based on a formal notion of concepts and concept hierarchies and allowing the exploitation of mathematical reasoning for conceptual data analysis and processing.",
        "In particular, FCA permits the efficient construction of dependency lattices that effectively represent the functional and set-valued dependencies established among the domains of some data relation.",
        "Such dependency lattices can then motivate the differential selection of appropriate graphical presentations.",
        "FCA starts from the notion of a formal context (G, M, I) representing a dataset in which G is a set of objects, M is a set of attributes, and I establishes a binary relation between the two sets.",
        "I(g, m) is read object g has property m where g E G and m E M. Such a context is called a one-valued context.",
        "For illustration, we draw on the domain of the DArtin, system that we discuss below: an example of a one-valued context corresponding to the attribute Profession for a set of artists is shown in the table to the left of Figure 1.",
        "Concepts in FCA are defined in accordance with the",
        "traditional theory of concepts, and consist of an extension and an intension.",
        "The extension is a subset A of the set of objects G and the intension is a subset B of the set of attributes M. We call the pair (A, B) a formal concept if each object of the extension has all the properties of the intension.",
        "Thus, for the data shown in Figure 1, the pair ({Gropius, Breuer}, {Urban Planner, Architect}) represents a formal concept: each of the members of the extension possesses all the attributes mentioned in the intension.",
        "The set of all concepts for some formal context can be computed effectively using the Next Closure algorithm developed by Canter and Wille (1996).",
        "The main theorem of concept analysis then shows that the set of concepts for a formal context can be organized into a complete lattice structure under the following definition of the subconcept relation: a concept (A, B) is a subconcept of (A*, B\") if and only if A c A* <=> B* c B (Wille 1982).",
        "The concept lattice may be constructed by starting from the top concept (the one that has no superconcepts) and proceeding top-down recursively.",
        "In each step we compute the set of direct subcon-cepts and link them to the respective superconcept until we reach the greatest lower bound of the lattice itself (the existence of which is always guaranteed for finite-input data structures).",
        "An efficient implementation of this algorithm is given in Kamps (1997).",
        "The lattice corresponding to our example one-valued context is given to the right of Figure 1.",
        "This lattice shows the full labeling of formal concepts in order to ease comparison with the originating table.",
        "Much of this information is redundant, however, and so we generally use variations on the abbreviated, more concise, form shown in Figure 2.",
        "Such lattices naturally capture similarities and differences between the values of the specified attributes of objects: each concept of the lattice indicates objects with some set of values in common.",
        "Moreover, the generalizations are organized by subsumption, which supports the selection of most-specific subtypes.",
        "When considering datasets in general, we typically need to express more information than that of single attributes and for this we require multivalued contexts.",
        "An example of a multivalued context is shown in Table 1, which includes our previous one-valued context as one of its columns; for ease of discussion, however, we will for the present restrict the Profession attribute so that each artist has only one profession.",

        "For example, the node labeled simply Gropius, Breuer corresponds to the full form ({Gropius, Breuer}, {Architect, Urban Planner}) since both Gropius and Breuer are newly added to the extension at that node, while no new elements are added to the intension'Architect' and 'Urban Planner' are both inherited from above.",

        "To identify the value w E W of attribute m E M for an object g e G, we adopt the notation m(g) = w and read this as attribute m of object g has value w. Kamps (1997) renders multivalued contexts amenable to the techniques for dependency-lattice construction by deriving a one-valued context that captures the functional dependencies of the original multivalued context.",
        "To see how this works, we first note that a functional dependency in a relation table is established when the following implication is always true: for two arbitrary objects g, h E G and two domain sets D, D* E M, then D(g) D(h) D* (g) D* (h).",
        "This implication suggests the following construction for an appropriate one-valued dependency context: for the set of objects take the set of subsets of two elements of the given multivalued context P2 (G); for the set of attributes take the set of domains M; and for the connecting incidence relation take IN ({g, h} , m) :r' m(g) = m(h).",
        "The required dependency context is then represented by the triple (P2 (G), M, IN).",
        "This is illustrated in the table to the left of Figure 3, which shows the one-valued context corresponding to the multivalued context of Table 1.",

        "Example dependency context and corresponding lattice.",
        "value for both the facts identified in the object labels of the leftmost column: for example, g1 and g2 share the values of their Profession and School attributes.",
        "This provides a wholistic view of the dependency structure of the original data and is, moreover, computationally simple to achieve.",
        "It is then straightforward to construct a dependency lattice as described above; this is shown to the right of Figure 3.",
        "The arcs in this lattice now represent the functional dependencies between the involved domains, and the equalities (e.g., m(g1)=--m(g2)) represent the redundancies present in the data.",
        "For example, the lower left node labeled Period indicates not only that the third and fourth-row entries under Period (g3 and g4) are identical but also, following the upward arc, that these entries are equal with respect to School; similarly, following upward arcs, the middle node (m(g1)=m(g2)) indicates that the first and second-row entries (e.g., g1 and g2) are equal with respect to both School and Profession.",
        "The lattice as a whole indicates that there are functional relationships from the set of persons into the set of professions, the set of periods, and the set of schools.",
        "A further functional relationship exists from the set of periods into the set of schools.",
        "Once such a lattice has been constructed, we also have as a consequence a set of classifications of the original relational input, or dataset.",
        "This can directly drive visualization as follows.",
        "For graphics generation, it is important that all domains of the relation become graphically encoded: this means the encoding is complete.",
        "Kamps (1997) proposes a corresponding graphical encoding algorithm that starts encoding the bottom domain and walks up the lattice employing a bottom-up/left-to-right strategy for encoding the upper domains.",
        "The idea of this model, much abbreviated, is that the cardinality of the bottom domain is the largest, whereas the domains further up in the lattice contain fewer elements.",
        "Thus, the bottom domain is graphically encoded using so-called graphical elements (rectangle, circle, line, etc.",
        "), whereas the upper domains are encoded using graphical attributes (color, width, radius) and set-valued attributes that must be attached to graphical elements.",
        "In general, it is preferable to maximize graphical attributes over set-valued attributes as this keeps graphical complexity moderate.",
        "Figure 4 shows two example diagrams that are produced from the dataset of Table 1 via the dependency lattice shown to the right of Figure 3.",
        "Informally, from the lattice we can see directly that artists (Person) can be classified on the one hand according to work period (following the lefthand arc upwards) and, on the other hand, jointly according to school and profession (following the vertical arc).",
        "The algorithm first allocates the attribute Person, indicated in the lowest node of the lattice, to the basic graphical element rectangle; the individual identities of the set members are given by a graphical attachment: a string giving the artist's name.",
        "The functional relationship between the set of persons and the set of time periods is then represented by the further",
        "Example diagrams generated for the example data.",
        "Alternatives are produced by two distinct traversals of the aggregation lattice.",
        "graphical attribute of the length of the rectangle.",
        "This is motivated by the equivalence of the properties of temporal intervals in the data and the properties of the graphical relationship of spatial intervals on the page.",
        "Two paths are then open: following the functional relationship first to either a set of schools or to a set of professions.",
        "Diagram (a) in Figure 4 adopts the first path and encodes the school relationship by means of the further graphical attribute of the color of the rectangle, followed by a nesting rectangle for the relationship to Professions; diagram (b) illustrates the second path, in which the selection of graphical encodings is reversed.",
        "Both the selection of color and of nesting rectangles are again motivated by the correspondence between the formal properties of the graphical relations and those of the dependencies observed in the data.",
        "Reinstating the multiple professions of Gropius and Breuer mentioned in Figure 1 gives rise to a rather different dependency lattice in which the second solution is no longer possible.",
        "All of these mechanisms were implemented and used extensively for visualization in the context of an Editor's Workbench for supporting editorial decisions during the design of large-scale publications such as encyclopedias (Rostek, Mohr, and Fischer 1994; Kamps et al.",

        "For automatic information presentation we also require a representation of the communicative intentions to be fulfilled by a presentation.",
        "For this, we adopt \"standard\" rhetorical structure theory (RST) as set out in Mann and Thompson (1986).",
        "RST is selected for two reasons: first, it is one of the most elaborated and widely used forms of analysis of communicative intentions and has been applied to a wide variety of texts; and second, it is well established in NLG and has already been applied to multimodal information presentation (cf., Andre and Rist ).",
        "Originally, RST sought to describe the recursive structure of any text in terms of rhetorical relations which hold between the segments (called spans) of the text.",
        "Rhetorical relations are either symmetric (multinuclear), in which case the text spans related are considered of equal importance for the text, or assymetric, in which case one text segment among those related by a relation is singled out as being more essential to the writer's purposes (the nucleus) than the others (the satellites).",
        "RST defines itself as a functional theory, in that the segments related are functional rather than textuali.e., a rhetorical relation need not have any specific grammatical or lexical",
        "Bateman, Kamps, Kleinz and ReichenbergerConstructive Page Generation There are many reasons that the Bauhaus movement spread to the U.S. For example, more people became aware of their work in magazines.",
        "Also, Bauhaus-designed objects came onto the market in increasing numbers.",
        "But there were two main reasons.",
        "First, many ex-Bauhaus members emigrated to the U.S. And second, they started teaching Bauhaus methods in U.S. colleges.",

        "realization.",
        "RST's functional orientation supported a further reinterpretation of RST in which rhetorical relations become plan operators for text construction (cf., Moore and Paris ; Hovy ).",
        "From this perspective, rhetorical structures represent a plan for achieving some goal via linguistic means.",
        "The information maintained at the leaves of such RST text plan structures is thus not preexisting text, but rather chunks of information that are to receive textual realizations.",
        "If, as is common in NLG, we consider the information-presentation task to involve the expression, or realization, of a text plan expressed according to RST and, further, we see the layout used in that information presentation as one of the decisions that needs to be made, then we face the question as to whether the text plan can also motivate the necessary layout decisions.",
        "In Figure 6, we show a simple invented text fragment and a corresponding RST analysis.",
        "We will use this text in two ways: First, it stands as a shorthand for a set of propositions from the knowledge base or domain model during NLG, and following text planning, the rhetorical structure is as shown but the leaves identify the propositions indicated rather than textual elements.",
        "Second, the text stands as one possible result of the subsequent NLG process, where the propositions grouped in the text plan have already received their linguistic realization.",
        "This double use is harmless because we do not use the textual version to motivate any of the decisions taken during the NLG process whose task it is to produce it.",
        "The RST structure states that the text divides into two main segments, span (1-3) and span (4-6), and that these are related by the rhetorical relation concession.",
        "This indicates that the main allegiance and point of the writer lies with the nucleus (span 4 6), but that, at the same time, the writer does not claim that the seemingly contradictory information in the satellite (span 1-3) does not hold.",
        "The principal purpose of using an RST-concession relationship is to strengthen one's own argument by showing that one is aware of a possible objection but are already able to dismiss it.",
        "Common linguistic markers of concession are however, although and, as adopted here, but.",
        "In the embedded trees, the satellite tree involves an RST justify relationship between a (relative) nucleus (1) and the span (2-3), the nucleus tree involves an elaboration relationship between a (relative) nucleus (4) and the span (5-6).",
        "Both spans (2-3) and (5-6) are examples of the RST joint schema: this simply combines the connected propositions into a set without assigning any difference in nuclearity among them.",
        "A justify relationship holds when the satellite gives information intended to justify the writer's right to",
        "Computational LinguisticsVolume 27, Number 3 present the information in the nucleus (i.e., in this case, the claim that there are many reasons for the Bauhaus spreading is backed up by the examples offered in (2) and (3)); and the elaboration relationship holds when further specifying information concerning some aspect of the nucleus is given.",
        "There are approximately 25 RST relations in the standard set and space precludes giving more details of them here: their definitions and examples of use are given, however, in numerous places in both the computational and (text-)linguistic literature.",
        "The realization of an RST structure as a natural language text involves many important issues which we will also not address here.",
        "Instead, we focus on the relationship between an RST-style presentation plan, and layout decisions; in particular, given our goal of determining a layout structure that can then be rendered as a physical page layout, we ask how the information in a rhetorical structure may be placed in correspondence with appropriate layout structures.",
        "In the text of the previous figure, for example, one layout decision that could be made is that there is no particular layout to be donethis is then equivalent to a straightforward, monomodal NLG system producing text only.",
        "The text in the figure is already an example.",
        "Another possible decision, lying at the opposite extreme, is to say that every node of the RST structure should find some direct correspondence in a node of the layout structure.",
        "This would be to require that the entire constituency structure of the RST tree be signaled visually in the layout.",
        "While both options are possible, it should be clear that there are many others.",
        "For example, span (1-3) could be represented as a single layout element (i.e., a single visual block consisting of a text paragraph) with span (4-6) breaking down into, perhaps, a single layout element for the nucleus (6) and two further layout elements, one for each of the members of the satellite.",
        "The situation is made yet more complex by the presence of a steady trade-off between information expressed via layout and information expressed via text.",
        "For example, if the spans (1-3) and (4-6) are allocated to distinct layout units, allowing them to vary independently of one another in terms of microtypography and physical placement, then it is considerably less likely that the RST concession relationship will be preserved linguistically.",
        "Similar considerations arise within the two spans: the more the RST structure is decomposed, resulting in typographical distinctions, the less use is made of explicit linguistic discourse marking.",
        "A compelling illustration of this can be seen in the complex graphic-text combination discussed in Kerpedjiev et al.",
        "(1998) in which a text fragment is re-expressed graphically.",
        "This variability needs to be brought under motivated control.",
        "Information presented together, or in similar styles, is perceived as related regardless of whether this was intended by the page designer or not; conversely, information presented in different styles, or separated widely on the page, is interpreted as unrelated.",
        "Critical work in professional document design demonstrates that failure to respect such entailments of layout makes a page or diagram difficult to interpret and possibly misleading: see, for example, Schriver (1996) and the numerous references cited there.",
        "But it is also well known that not all of the possible details of document structure are normally presented in layout: the relationship is substantially more flexible.",

        "A reader should be able to recover this information from reading the text but it is not supported by an explicit layout encoding; we return to this issue below.",

        "Such problems are identical to those arising in the NLG task: when more flexibility of expression/presentation is made availablefor example, by considering generation with respect to a grammar with broader coverageit is essential to control this flexibility appropriately in order to avoid wrong decisions.",
        "The problematic nature of the layout of Figure 10(b) can be succinctly stated: it violates our initial hypothesis concerning the desired correspondence between RST structure and layout structure: the constituency structure of the layout and that of the RST tree are in direct opposition at several points.",
        "For example, there is no distinction drawn in type face between page elements introducing the game and describing the rules (which are relatively more nuclear), and elements describing some of the variants, whereas other variants are presented as a separate element with a larger, more prominent type face; these decisions are not, therefore, motivatable on the basis of the RST structure.",
        "Most serious, however, is the way in which the division into two elements describing the game variants has been done: these elements involve segments which do not correspond to RST-subtrees at all.",

        "In most documents, however, layout decomposition occurs, and so the layout structure has to be grown further.",
        "This is achieved by partitioning the set of RST-structure segments available at the current level of RST structure (segments are indicated in RST diagrams by the horizontal lines: cf., Figures 6 and 9) into those that are to be accepted into the current layout unit and those that are not.",
        "When any segment is not accepted, the RST relational link is cut at that point, the accepted segments are added to the current layout unit (which remains open), and the cut segment is added to a new, closed layout unit inserted parallel to the original layout unit.",
        "The accepted partition must include at least the nucleus at that level of RST structure; this means that it is not possible to include satellites in the current layout unit and then exclude the nucleusthis would correspond to the unnatural division shown in Figure 11 above.",
        "Crucially, it is quite possible for all of the segments to be accepted and for recursive descent to continue without having closed the current layout unit.",
        "Both closed and open layout units are then further developed according to the recursive structure of their respective RST segments.",
        "When a decision is made to cut an RST link, and the segments to be partitioned belong to a multinuclear relation or joint schema, then all the related segments are extracted and associated with sibling layout units.",
        "The layout units thus introduced are also annotated with type-equivalence links, while reference annotations are added between pictures and text within single RST-structure segments.",
        "The weight annotations are allocated in direct proportion to the nucleus and satellite distinctions: the nucleus receives the highest weight, with the remaining distributed over the satellites (see Section 3).",
        "We have not yet been able to explore appropriate weightings in any sophisticated manner, and so their effect on alternative layouts remains a subject for further investigation.",
        "In summary, the process of recursive descent of the RST tree can be seen broadly as one of deciding where to break RST links.",

        "This can therefore lead to a significant loss of structure resulting from the fact that the dominance relations holding in the RST structure are not maintained in the layout structure.",
        "The core translation procedure thus results in a steady reduction in the complexity of the structure being constructed compared to the RST structure from which it derives.",
        "In the Unihoc original page, this is the situation with the segment (Unihoc variants): this satellite is broken out of its potential embedding within the dominating segment -412-31J and appears instead as a layout sibling of the remaining Intro unit that realizes R-61423-31].",
        "This action has two common consequences: first, the layout weight of the broken-out unit is reduced and, second, the fact that a layout unit has been severed from its functionally motivated parent (i.e., the nucleus) appears in many text types sufficient grounds for introducing a further layout unit that has the task of explicitly signalling what the relation was.",
        "This additional layout unit appears as a header or title (e.g., the Alle Formen sind mOglich(all forms are possibleof the original page).",
        "A header is then the layout equivalent of a discourse marker.",
        "However, since headers cannot typically function as relationally as discourse markers (because they cannot readily point back to their point of origin), they tend instead to give sufficient information for the reader to make a connectionfor example, by summarizing the nucleus of their segments.",
        "While we currently attribute the reduction in layout weight to the core translation, the provision of headers again appears to be a genre-specific concern and so we keep this as a heuristic.",
        "Removing structure can, if unconstrained, lead to some very undesirable layouts: for example, we could take the entire RST structure of the Unihoc constructed text apart from the last satellite of the Equipment subtree to produce two parallel layout units: the rest of the text and the fact that one can get information about the Equipment by telephoning the given number.",
        "Our translation process partially avoids this situation by employing media-allocation (i.e., whether layout units are to be realized textually, graphically, pictorially, etc.)",

        "The rule serves to avoid insignificant satellites being giving a prominent layout status by increasing the likelihood that prior decomposition will have already taken place.",
        "Moreover, we have observed two further forces that restrict objectionable layouts of this kind: first, whenever a collection of layout units are constructed as siblings, their relative weights need to be ascertainedthe further down (vertically and in terms of nucleus-satellite status) in the RST structure, the lower relative weight an associated layout unit receives.",
        "Second, we add a heuristic that disprefers isolating relatively insignificant satellites that lack substantial substructure of their own.",
        "The strength of this heuristic appears to vary significantly according to the genre of the information being presented: for example, newspapers now appear to be considerably more willing to promote lower subtrees to the status of layout siblings than are the pages that were the subject of our empirical investigation.",
        "We will return to this aspect of layout variation in the conclusion.",
        "Finally, although we cannot pursue this theme further here, the gradual reduction in structural complexity proposed has several suggestive similarities with what happens when monomodal, linear text is produced from an underlying RST-like structure.",
        "There too, structural complexity is replaced by explicit linguistic coding operating linearly from one clause or utterance to the next.",

        "Making both sets of decisions dependent on a single, shared representation of regularities in a dataset provides a straightforward way of achieving consistency in the perspec444 Bateman, Kamps, Kleinz and ReichenbergerConstructive Page Generation tives presented in the differing media: diagrams and texts then mutually reinforce one another by applying common information groupings.",
        "We have also argued that a message is provided by the physical layout of information on a page: relations of similarity, difference, and connection are commonly expressed by layout.",
        "In designing a page, therefore, layout relations must be made consistent with the overall communicative intent of the page.",
        "We have shown how consistency between layout and communicative intent can be achieved by deriving the former (layout structure) from a representation of the latter (rhetorically organized presentation plan).",
        "We have discussed both how such a derivation can be motivated and how it can be used for automatic page generation.",
        "Our study of the relationship between the communicative structure of a page of information and the coherent layout of that information demonstrates that layout needs to be treated as an integral and complex part of the overall generation process; it can in no way be treated as a final piece of postprocessing.",
        "Many of the decisions required for segmenting a text effectively (e.g., into thematic paragraphs, into rhetorically related segments, etc.)",
        "also have correlates in the decisions that produce a coherent layout structure.",
        "This entails several areas of trade-off between layout and text: segmentation and grouping information may be expressed in language, in layout, or in some mixture of the two.",
        "By treating language expressions and layout as arising ultimately from a common source, we expect that potentially costly constraint-resolution at a local level (i.e., between arbitrary segments) can be avoided, or reduced, by enforcing consistent layout-language decisions for the layout structure of a page as a whole.",
        "The last five years have seen rapid growth in the awareness of the importance of consistent and functional style selections: notions of style sheets from professional publishing have made their way into the mainstream of web-based document design including consistent presentation formatting using Cascaded Style Sheets and flexible document rendering using, for example, the Document Style Semantics and Specification Language (DSSSL, ISO /IEC 10179) and the Extensible Stylesheet Language's Formatting Objects (XSL:FO; W3C).",
        "Professional bodies concerned with the closely related theme of Information Designthe application of processes of design (that is, planning) to the communication of information (its content and language as well as its form) (Waller 1996)have also grown considerably both in number and membership.",
        "Moreover, the importance of some notion of rhetoric for professional design and layout is increasingly accepted (cf., Schriver ).",
        "Less clear in such work is precisely how to characterize and teach useful notions of rhetoric.",
        "Our work on the rhetorical basis of layout interfaces directly with these developments, and establishes a new bridge between options for consistent microtypography at one end, right through to high-level communicative goal-based text design at the other.",
        "Concretely, our work has highlighted the importance of further rounds of detailed empirical investigation, interlocked with critical evaluation.",
        "Our general mechanism for assigning the material of a rhetorical structure to a layout is highly non-deterministicat virtually all points we need to appeal to heuristics to make a final decision.",
        "Our investigations so far indicate, however, that this is not a weakness in our formulation: the nondeterminism arises instead from the fact that the layout process is just as flexible as we describe it.",
        "The further restriction of the process so as to produce \"appropriate\" layouts can only proceed by establishing more motivated heuristics and these heuristics will depend crucially on the particular applications, document types, target audiences, and informational content concerned.",
        "The rather heterogeneous set of heuristics currently adopted within the DArtb,,, system, for example, will need to be replaced by a framework of empirically motivated constraints; some of this work has now been started (Bateman, Delin, and Allen 2000; Delin, Bateman, and",
        "Computational LinguisticsVolume 27, Number 3 Allen, forthcoming).",
        "The layouts produced will then need detailed evaluationboth from design experts and from usersas Schriver et al.",
