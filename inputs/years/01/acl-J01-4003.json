        "While manual evaluations have the advantage of allowing the researcher to examine the data closely, they are problematic because they can be time consuming, generally making it difficult to process corpora that are large enough to provide reliable, broadly based statistics.",
        "With a system that can run various pronoun resolution algorithms, one can easily and quickly analyze large amounts of data and generate more reliable results.",
        "In this study, this ability to alter an algorithm slightly and test its performance is central.",
        "We first show the attractiveness of the Left-Right Centering algorithm (henceforth LRC) (Tetreault 1999) given its incremental processing of utterances, psycholinguistic plausibility, and good performance in finding the antecedents of pronouns.",
        "The algorithm is tested against three other leading pronoun resolution algorithms: Hobbs's naive algorithm (1978), S-list (Strube 1998), and BFP (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987).",
        "Next we use the conclusions from two psycholinguistic experiments on ranking the Cf-list, the salience of discourse entities in prepended phrases (Gordon, Grosz, and Gilliom 1993) and the ordering of possessor and possessed in complex NPs (Gordon et al.",
        "1999), to try to improve the performance of LRC.",
        "We begin with a brief review of the four algorithms to be compared (Section 2).",
        "We then discuss the results of the corpus evaluation (Sections 3 and 4).",
        "Finally, we show that the results from two psycholinguistic experiments, thought to provide a better ordering of the Cf-list, do not improve LRC's performance when they are incorporated (Section 5)."
