        "In particular, information extraction (IE) systems like those built in the DARPA Message Understanding Conferences (Chinchor 1998; Sundheim 1995) have revealed that coreference resolution is such a critical component of IE systems that a separate coreference subtask has been defined and evaluated since MUC-6 (MUC-6 1995).",
        "In this paper, we focus on the task of determining coreference relations as defined in MUC-6 (MUC-6 1995) and MUC-7 (MUC-7 1997).",
        "Specifically, a coreference relation denotes an identity of reference and holds between two textual elements known as markables, which can be definite noun phrases, demonstrative noun phrases, proper names, appositives, subnoun phrases that act as modifiers, pronouns, and so on.",
        "Thus, our coreference task resolves general noun phrases and is not restricted to a certain type of noun phrase such as pronouns.",
        "Also, we do not place any restriction on the possible candidate markables; that is, all markables, whether they are \"organization,\" \"person,\" or other entity types, are considered.",

        "A prerequisite for coreference resolution is to obtain most, if not all, of the possible markables in a raw input text.",
        "To determine the markables, a pipeline of natural language processing (NLP) modules is used, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "They consist of to-kenization, sentence segmentation, morphological processing, part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase identification, named entity recognition, nested noun phrase extraction, and semantic class determination.",
        "As far as coreference resolution is concerned, the goal of these NLP modules is to determine the boundary of the markables, and to provide the necessary information about each markable for subsequent generation of features in the training examples.",
        "Our part-of-speech tagger is a standard statistical tagger based on the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (Church 1988).",
        "Similarly, we built a statistical HMM-based noun phrase identification module that determines the noun phrase boundaries solely based on the part-of-speech tags assigned to the words in a sentence.",
        "We also implemented a module that recognizes MUC-style named entities, that is, organization, person, location, date, time, money, and percent.",
        "Our named entity recognition module uses the HMM approach of Bikel, Schwartz, and Weischedel (1999), which learns from a tagged corpus of named entities.",
        "That is, our part-of-speech tagger, noun phrase identification module, and named entity recognition module are all based on HMMs and learn from corpora tagged with parts of speech, noun phrases, and named entities, respectively.",
        "Next, both the noun phrases determined by the noun phrase identification module and the named entities are merged in such a way that if the noun phrase overlaps with a named entity, the noun phrase boundaries will be adjusted to subsume the named entity.",
        "Soon, Ng, and LimCoreference Resolution The nested noun phrase extraction module subsequently accepts the noun phrases and determines the nested phrases for each noun phrase.",
        "The nested noun phrases are divided into two groups: 1.Nested noun phrases from possessive noun phrases.",
        "Consider two possessive noun phrases marked by the noun phrase module, his long-range strategy and Eastern's parent.",
        "The nested noun phrase for the first phrase is the pronoun his, while for the second one, it is the proper name Eastern.",
        "2.Nested noun phrases that are modifier nouns (or prenominals).",
        "For example, the nested noun phrase for wage reductions is wage, and for Union representatives, it is Union.",
        "Finally, the markables needed for coreference resolution are the union of the noun phrases, named entities, and nested noun phrases found.",
        "For markables without any named entity type, semantic class is determined by the semantic class determination module.",
        "More details regarding this module are given in the description of the semantic class agreement feature.",
        "To achieve acceptable recall for coreference resolution, it is most critical that the eligible candidates for coreference be identified correctly in the first place.",
        "In order to test our system's effectiveness in determining the markables, we attempted to match the markables generated by our system against those appearing in the coreference chains annotated in 100 SGML documents, a subset of the training documents available in MUC-6.",
        "We found that our system is able to correctly identify about 85% of the noun phrases appearing in coreference chains in the 100 annotated SGML documents.",
        "Most of the unmatched noun phrases are of the following types: 1.Our system generated a head noun that is a subset of the noun phrase in the annotated corpus.",
        "For example, Saudi Arabia, the cartel's biggest producer was annotated as a markable, but our system generated only Saudi Arabia.",
        "2.Our system extracted a sequence of words that cannot be considered as a markable.",

        "McCarthy and Lehnert (1995) describe how RESOLVE was tested on the MUC5 English Joint Ventures (EJV) corpus.",
        "It used a total of 8 features, 3 of which were specific to the EJV domain.",
        "For example, the feature JV-CHILD-i determined whether i referred to a joint venture formed as the result of a tie-up.",
        "McCarthy (1996) describes how the original RESOLVE for MUC-5 EJV was improved to include more features, 8 of which were domain specific, and 30 of which were domain independent.",
        "Fisher et al.",
        "(1995) adapted RESOLVE to work in MUC-6.",
        "The features used were slightly changed for this domain.",
        "Of the original 30 domain-independent features, 27 were used.",
        "The 8 domain-specific features were completely changed for the MUC-6 task.",
        "For example, JV-CHILD-i was changed to CHILD-i to decide whether i is a \"unit\" or a \"subsidiary\" of a certain parent company.",
        "In contrast to RESOLVE, our system makes use of a smaller set of 12 features and, as in Aone and Bennett's (1995) system, the features used are generic and applicable across domains.",
        "This makes our coreference engine a domain-independent module.",
        "Although Aone and Bennett's (1995) system also made use of decision tree learning for coreference resolution, they dealt with Japanese texts, and their evaluation focused only on noun phrases denoting organizations, whereas our evaluation, which dealt with English texts, encompassed noun phrases of all types, not just those denoting organizations.",
        "In addition, Aone and Bennett evaluated their system on noun phrases that had been correctly identified, whereas we evaluated our coreference resolution engine as part of a total system that first has to identify all the candidate noun phrases and has to deal with the inevitable noisy data when mistakes occur in noun phrase identification and semantic class determination.",
        "The contribution of our work lies in showing that a learning approach, when evaluated on common coreference data sets, is able to achieve accuracy competitive with that of state-of-the-art systems using nonlearning approaches.",
        "It is also the first machine learning-based system to offer performance comparable to that of nonlearning approaches.",
        "Finally, the work of Cardie and Wagstaff (1999) also falls under the machine learning approach.",
        "However, they used unsupervised learning and their method did not require any annotated training data.",
        "Their clustering method achieved a balanced F-measure of only 53.6% on MUC-6 test data.",
        "This is to be expected: supervised learning in general outperforms unsupervised learning since a supervised learning algorithm",
        "Soon, Ng, and LimCoreference Resolution has access to a richer set of annotated data to learn from.",
        "Since our supervised learning approach requires only a modest number of annotated training documents to achieve good performance (as can be seen from the learning curves), we argue that the better accuracy achieved more than justifies the annotation effort incurred."
