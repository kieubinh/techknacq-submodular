        "For example, in some strategies just one kind of knowledge becomes the main selector for identifying the antecedent, with other kinds of knowledge being used merely to confirm or reject the proposed antecedent.",
        "In such cases, the typical kind of knowledge used as the selector is that of discourse structure.",
        "Centering theory, as employed by Strube and Hahn (1999) or Okumura and Tamura (1996), uses this type of approach.",
        "Other approaches, however, give equal",

        "Whereas constraints tend to be absolute and therefore discard possible antecedents, preferences tend to be relative and require the use of additional criteria (e.g., the use of heuristics that are not always satisfied by all antecedents).",
        "Nakaiwa and Shirai (1996) use this sort of resolution model, which involves the use of semantic and pragmatic constraints, such as constraints based on modal expressions, or constraints based on verbal semantic attributes or conjunctions.",
        "Our approach to anaphora resolution belongs in the latter category, since it combines different kinds of knowledge and no knowledge based on discourse structure is included.",
        "We choose to ignore discourse structure because obtaining this kind of knowledge requires not only an understanding of semantics but also knowledge about world affairs and the ability to almost perfectly parse any text under discussion (Az-zam, Humphreys, and Gaizauskas 1998).",
        "Still other approaches to anaphora resolution are based either on machine learning techniques (Connolly, Burger, and Day 1994; Yamamoto and Sumita 1998; Paul, Yamamato, and Sumita 1999) or on the principles of uncertainty reasoning (Mitkov 1995).",
        "Computational processing of semantic and domain information is relatively expensive when compared with other kinds of knowledge.",
        "Consequently, current anaphora resolution methods rely mainly on constraint and preference heuristics, which employ morpho-syntactic information or shallow semantic analysis (see, for example, Mitkov [1998]).",

        "The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of an algorithm for anaphora resolution for Spanish.",
        "In our work, we have undertaken an exhaustive study of the importance of each kind of knowledge in anaphora resolution for Spanish.",
        "Moreover, we have developed a definition of syntactic conditions of NP-pronoun noncoreference in Spanish with partial parsing.",
        "We have also adapted our anaphora resolution algorithm to the problem of partial syntactic knowledge, that is to say, when partial parsing of the text is accomplished.",
        "For unrestricted texts, our approach is somewhat less accurate, since semantic information is not taken into account.",
        "For such texts, we are dealing with the output of a POS tagger, which does not provide this sort of knowledge.",
        "In order to test our approach with texts of different genres by different authors, we have worked with two different Spanish corpora, literary texts (the Lexesp corpus) and technical texts (the Blue Book), containing a total of 1,677 pronoun occurrences.",
        "The algorithm successfully identified the antecedent of the pronoun for 76.8% of these pronoun occurrences.",
        "Other algorithms usually work with different kinds of knowledge, different texts, and different languages.",
        "In order to make a more valid comparison of our algorithm with others, we adapted the other algorithms so that they would operate using only partial-parsing knowledge.",
        "In this evaluation, our algorithm has always obtained better results.",
        "Moreover, based on the results on our study of the importance of each kind of knowledge, we can emphasize that constraints are very important for resolving anaphora successfully, since they considerably reduce the number of possible candidates.",
        "In future studies, we will attempt to evaluate the importance of semantic information in unrestricted texts for anaphora resolution in Spanish texts (Saiz-Noeda, Suarez, and Peral 1999).",
        "This information will be obtained from a lexical tool (e.g., Spanish WordNet), which can be automatically consulted (since the tagger does not provide this information)."
