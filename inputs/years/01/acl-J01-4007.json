        "What Is Centering?",
        "Centering theory (henceforth CT) is a theory of local discourse structure that models the interaction of referential continuity and salience of discourse entities in the internal organization of a text.",
        "The main assumptions of the theory as presented by Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1995) (GJW) and Walker, Joshi, and Prince (1998) can be summarized as follows: 1.",
        "For each utterance in a discourse there is precisely one entity that is the center of attention.",
        "2.",
        "There is a preference, formalized as Rule 2, (1) for consecutive utterances within a discourse segment to keep the same entity as the center of attention, and (2) for the entity most prominently realized in an utterance to be identified as the center of attention.",
        "3.",
        "The center of attention is the entity that is most likely to be pronominalized: this preference is formalized as Rule 1.",
        "These principles are more precisely explicated in Section 2.",
        "An entity may become prominent as a referential link between successive utterances, or it may deliberately be made prominent, for example, through a less oblique grammatical role or by being mentioned early in a sentence.",
        "An attraction for natural language processing practitioners has been that CT's predictions are based on easily computable structural properties of utterances rather than costly content-based reasoning.",
        "Standard expositions of CT hold that there is a total preference ordering over types of transitions between utterances defined in terms of the tests mentioned in Point 2 above and formulated as Rule 2 in Table 1.",
        "I argue in what follows that the standard",
        "Centering constraints and rules (adapted from Walker, Joshi, and Prince [1998, pages 3-4]).",
        "Constraints",

        "There is precisely one Cb.",
        "C2.",
        "Every element of Cf(Un) must be realized in Lin.",
        "C3.",
        "Cb(Un) is the highest-ranked element of Cf(Un_i) that is realized in Un.",
        "Rules R1.",
        "If some element of Cf(Un_i) is realized as a pronoun in Un, then so is Cb(Un).",
        "R2.",
        "Continue is preferred over Retain, which is preferred over Smooth Shift, which is preferred over Rough Shift.",
        "account of CT both over and undergenerates.",
        "On the one hand, the stipulated preference for Retain over Smooth Shift has not been confirmed by empirical evidence, and cannot be naturally incorporated in standard generation architectures.",
        "On the other hand, there is no mechanism within the theory to predict specific cases where a Retain or a Shift may be preferred over a Continue transition, as in the Retain-Shift pattern that has been argued to signal the introduction of a new discourse topic (Brennan, Friedman, and Pollard 1987 [BFP]; Strube and Hahn 1999).",
        "I aim to overcome these difficulties under an analysis that gives a partial ordering of the classic transitions, incorporating a \"streamlined\" version of Strube and Hahn's notion of \"cheapness\" to handle the Retain-Shift pattern.",
        "I do not claim to offer new empirical results; the aim is rather to consolidate existing results in a more economic and principled formulation of Rule 2 itself.",
        "Finally, given that CT addresses local rather than global coherence, we need to consider the question, How local is \"local\"?",
        "Two possible notions of local coherence are (1) overall coherence of a multi-utterance discourse segment (as in the original GJW model, which stipulates preferences for coherent sequences of transitions) – this has been called \"not psychologically plausible from a speaker's perspective\" (Brennan 1998, page 231); (2) coherence between immediately adjacent utterances, as in the BFP algorithm, which replaces the original preference for sequences of transitions with a preference ordering on transitions.",
        "In this paper, I explore an intermediate position put forward by Strube and Hahn (1999), which is a preference over pairs of transitions or triples of utterances, which may or may not cross segment boundaries."

        "Cb(Un) is defined as the highest-ranked member of Cf(Un_1) that is realized in Un.",
        "Cp(Un) is the highest-ranked member of Cf(11,), and is predicted to be Cb(Un+i)• The ranking of Cf by grammatical role has been widely adopted in the literature following BFP, though it is questioned by some researchers including Strube and",

        "Hahn (1999), who propose a ranking based on \"functional information structure,\" a combination of degrees of \"givenness\" and left-to-right order.",
        "They note that the BFP ranking is not appropriate for German, which they say is a free-word-order language (page 310); more accurately, relative order of NPs within a clause is not determined by grammatical role to the extent that it is in English.",
        "For the purposes of this paper, there is no need to commit to either BFP's or Strube and Hahn's rankings, or to go into the details of the latter's \"functional centering\" model, as both make the same predictions for the examples considered.",
        "Strube and Hahn themselves (page 334) state that the grammatical and functional analyses achieved consistent results for all examples in GJW.",

        "For the sake of convenience and concision, I refer to the first of these tests as cohesion and the second as salience; it is important to keep in mind that I use the terms in these defined and limited ways, and to disregard (for the time being) other uses of the terms in the literature.",
        "There are four possible combinations, which are displayed in Table 2, resulting in the named transitions Continue, Retain, Smooth Shift, and Rough Shift.",

        "Walker, Joshi, and Prince (1998), following BFP, stipulate that Retain is preferred over Smooth Shift, which implies that cohesion is a stronger requirement than salience.",

        "), and Passoneau (1998, pages 338ff.)",

        "We may conclude that not only does corpus evidence fail to confirm the canonical ordering, but in fact corpus analysis itself is not sufficient to evaluate the claims of CT without taking into account the underlying semantic content of a text.",
        "That is, statistics about the relative frequency of occurrences of different transition types do not in themselves tell us much about which transitions are preferred in particular situations since they do not take account of the choices available to an author.' A more promising approach is that of Brennan (1998), who gave subjects the controlled narrative task of providing a running commentary on a video recording of a basketball game, and used the videotape itself to construct a \"propositional script\" listing the sequence of events and their participants, and identifying players who were likely to continue as the center of attention over a sequence of incidents."

        "I have argued elsewhere (Kibble 1999) that if CT is to be implemented in an NLG system, the principles I call \"salience\" and \"cohesion\" belong to different tasks within this scheme: \"salience\" is a matter for sentence planning, choosing a verb form or some other construction that makes the Cb prominent within a clause or sentence, while \"cohesion\" – ordering propositions in a text to maintain referential continuity – is a matter for text planning.",
        "So there may be no single point in the generation process where the system has a choice between Retain and Shift, for instance: rather, the terms retain and shift describe the composite results of choices made at different stages of the generation task.",

        "(Walker, Joshi, and Prince 1998, page 3) It turns out that this informally stated aspect of the Cp is not actually made explicit in the rules and constraints of CT: transitions (Un, L141) are defined in terms of the Cp of Un±i and the Cbs of Un and Un+1, but no definition mentions the Cp of U. Strube and Hahn's \"cheapness\" principle can be seen as the \"missing link\" of CT, making explicit the prediction represented by the Cp.",

        "In fact, it seems that the way this principle is presented is unnecessarily complicated, and on closer examination it appears to be rather weak.",
        "First, if cheapness is the only criterion considered, CT would have nothing to say about texts such as Example 1 that have no cheap transition pairs.",
        "So it appears unwise to simply abandon the canonical ordering altogether.",
        "Second, the constraint on transition pairs can be stated more economically in terms of triples of utterances.",
        "If it is the preferred case that for every transition pair in a discourse ((lin-1, tin), (Un, Un+1)), Cb(Un+i) = Cp(Un), then this equation also holds for each triple (14_1, Un+i) and vice versa.",
