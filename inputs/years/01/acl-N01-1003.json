        "Figure 9 shows some of the rules that were learned on the training data, that were then applied to the alternative sentence plans in each test set of each fold in order to rank them.",
        "We include only a subset of the rules that had the largest impact on the score of each sp-tree.",
        "We discuss some particular rule examples here to help the reader understand how SPoTs SPR works, but leave it to the reader to examine the thresholds and feature values in the remainder of the rules and sum the increments and decrements.",
        "Rule (1) in Figure 9 states that an implicit confirmation as the first leaf of the sp-tree leads to a large (.94) increase in the score.",
        "Thus all three of our alternative sp-trees accrue this ranking increase.",
        "Rules (2) and (5) state that the occurrence of 2 or more PRONOUN nodes in the DSyntS reduces the ranking by 0.85, and that 3 or more PRONOUN nodes reduces the ranking by an additional 0.34.",
        "Alternative 8 is above the threshold for both of these rules; alternative 5 is above the threshold for Rule",
        "(2) and alternative 0 is always below the thresholds.",
        "Rule (6) on the other hand increases only the scores of alternatives 0 and 5 by 0.33 since alternative 8 is below the",
        "threshold for that feature.",
        "Note also that the quality of the rules in general seems to be high.",
        "Although we provided multiple instantiations of features, some of which included parameters or lexical items that might identify particular discourse contexts, most of the learned rules utilize general properties of the sp-tree and the DSyntS.",
        "This is probably partly due to the fact that we eliminated features that appeared fewer than 10 times in the training data, but also partly due to the fact that boosting algorithms in general appear to be resistant to overfitting the data (Freund et al., 1998)."

        "Previous work in sentence planning in the natural language generation (NLG) community uses handwritten rules to approximate the distribution of linguistic phenomena in a corpus (see (Shaw, 1998) for a recent example with further references).",
        "This approach is difficult to scale due to the nonrobustness of rules and unexpected interactions (Hovy and Wanner, 1996), and it is difficult to develop new applications quickly.",
        "Presumably, this is the reason why dialog systems to date have not used this kind of sentence planning.",
        "Most dialog systems today use template-based generation.",
        "The template outputs are typically concatenated to produce a turn realizing all the communicative goals.",
        "It is hard to achieve high quality output by concatenating the template-based output for individual communicative goals, and templates are difficult to develop and maintain for a mixed-initiative dialog system.",
        "For these reasons, Oh and Rudnicky (2000) use n-gram models and Ratna-parkhi (2000), maximum entropy to choose templates, using handwritten rules to score different candidates.",
        "But syntactically simplistic approaches may have quality problems, and more importantly, these approaches only deal with inform speech acts.",
        "And crucially, these approaches suffer from the need for training data.",
        "In general there may be no corpus available for a new application area, or if there is a corpus available, it is a transcript of human-human dialogs.",
        "Human-human dialogs, however, may not provide a very good model of sentence planning strategies for a computational system because the sentence planner must plan communicative goals such as implicit confirmation which are needed to prevent and correct errors in automatic speech recognition but which are rare in human-human dialog.",
        "Other related work deals with discourse-related aspects of sentence planning such as cue word placement (Moser and Moore, 1995), clearly a crucial task whose integration into our approach we leave to future work.",

        "We have presented SPoT, a trainable sentence planner.",
        "SPoT re-conceptualizes the sentence planning task as consisting of two distinct phases: (1) a very simple sentence plan generator SPG that generates multiple candidate sentence plans using weighted randomization; and (2) a sentence plan ranker SPR that can be trained from examples via human feedback, whose job is to rank the candidate sentence plans and select the highest ranked plan.",
        "Our results show that: SPoTs SPR selects sentence plans that on average are only 5% worse than the sentence plan(s) selected as the best by human judges.",
        "SPoTs SPR selects sentence plans that on average are 36% better than a random SPR that simply selects randomly among the candidate sentence plans.",
        "We validated these results in an independent experiment in which 60 subjects evaluated the quality of different realizations for a given turn.",
        "(Recall that our trainable sentence planner was trained on the scores of only two human judges.)",
        "This evaluation revealed that the choices made by SPoT were not statistically distinguishable from the choices ranked at the top by the two human judges.",
        "More importantly, they were also not distinguishable statistically from the current hand-crafted template-based output of the AT&T Communicator system, which has been developed and fine-tuned over an extended period of time (whereas SPoT is based on judgments that took about three person-days to make).",
        "SPoT also was rated better than two rule-based versions of our SPG which we developed as baselines.",
        "All systems outperformed the random choice.",
        "We will report on these results in more detail in a future publication.",
        "In future work, we intend to build on the work reported in this paper in several ways.",
        "First, we believe that we could utilize additional features as predictors of the quality of a sentence plan.",
        "These include features based on the discourse context, and features that encode relationships between the sp-tree and the DSyntS.",
        "We will also expand the capabilities of the SPG to cover additional sentence planning tasks in addition to sentence scoping, and duplicate the methods described here to retrain SPoT for our extended SPG."
