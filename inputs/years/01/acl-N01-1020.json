        "Translation lexicons for arbitrary distant language pairs are then generated by a combination of these intrafamily translation models and one or more cross-family on-line dictionaries.",
        "Up to 95% exact match accuracy is achieved on the target vocabulary (30-68% of inter-family test pairs).",
        "Thus substantial portions of translation lexicons can be generated accurately for languages where no bilingual dictionary or parallel corpora may exist.",
        "1 Translation Lexicons, Cognates, and Bridge Languages A translation lexicon is a mapping from words in one language (the source) to words in another language (the target).",
        "For each word in the source , this dictionary provides one or more words in the target which might be appropriate translations in some context.",
        "Such a lexicon is the foundation of any machine translation system.",
        "Translation lexicons are available on-line for many of the world's major langauges, but they are often quite limited and may have intellectual property constraints.",
        "For lower-density languages, translation lexicons typically exist only as a hard-copy dictionary (if at all).",
        "Creating a translation lexicon from scratch requires time-consuming work by experts trained in both languages.",
        "Automatic methods to generate even partial dictionaries would significantly decrease the human effort needed to build machine translation systems for less heavily supported languages.",
        "In this paper, we explore algorithms for building lexicons between arbitrary languages using models of cognate pairs and cognate distance.",
        "We define a cognate pair as a translation pair where words from two languages share both meaning and a similar surface form.",
        "Cognate pairs usually arise when both words are derived from an ancestral root form (e.g. \"neveu\" [Fr.",
        "], \"nephew\" [Eng.])",
        "(Buck,",
        "1949).",
        "Obviously, not all translations are cognates (e.g. \"eau\" [Fr.",
        "]-+ \"water\" [Eng.",
        "]), and other translations, while historically related, are distant enough to be challenging to model (e.g. \"pere\" [Fr.",
        "]-+ \"father\" [Eng.]).",
        "Depending on how closely two languages are related, they may share more or fewer cognate pairs.",
        "We show that languages are often close enough to others within their language family so that cognate pairs between the two are common, and significant portions of the translation lexicon can be induced with high accuracy.",
        "Statistical models of cognate surface similarity are trained and used to detect cognate pairs and produce mappings in a translation lexicon (Section 3).",
        "To connect arbitrary distant languages, we use a two-step model via bridge languages (as shown in Figure 1 and Section 5).",
        "Existing available on-line dictionaries between the source language and one representative of a language family can be combined with intrafamily cognate models to yield translation lexicons from the source to the bridge language's entire family.",
        "Finally, we demonstrate how the perfor",
        "mance of bridge models can be improved by using multiple bridge languages, increasing coverage and accuracy.",
        "Note that in all cases the induced lexicons are symmetric and for the purposes of machine translation can be used in either direction, not limited to the source/target terms used in the algorithm description."

        "The induction algorithm we propose relies on a method of determining the cognate string edit distance between two words.",
        "This distance should be low for cognates pairs, and high for non-cognates.",
        "Formally: given two languages S and T, where cognate indicates that a pair is cognate, a good distance function D : S x T -+ R is one such that:",
        "Given such a distance, we can apply it in creating translations for new languages by mapping each source word to the nearest target (with respect to the distance D).",
        "Formally: Vs c S choose t ï¿½c T: t= argmin D(s, t) tET We investigated three different distance functions: Levenshtein distance, a cost function learned by using stochastic transducers and one learned by using a hidden Markov model.",
        "There are significant differences between the Levenshtein distance function and the two probabilistic methods: the former is a static metric which requires no training, while the latter are adaptive metrics which need to be trained for a particular data set.",
        "Levenshtein distance (L) is defined as the minimum sum of the costs of edit operations required to transform one string into another.",
        "Inserting a character, deleting a character, and replacing a character with another are the only edit operations.",
        "Traditionally, the cost for all edit operations is 1, but these costs could conceivably be any positive real number.",
        "The use of stochastic transducers (S) for learning string edit distance is a problem which has been studied by Ristad and Yianilos (1998).",
        "They use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to estimate a probabilistic cost for each possible edit operation from the training data such that the cost of transforming source words into the corresponding target words is minimized.",
        "Unlike the Levenshtein distance metric which sums up the individual edit costs, these probabilistic costs are multiplied, and the resulting distance is the sum of all edit paths that transform one string into its translation.",
        "The hidden Markov model (H) used here is a fenonic base form model', with each character having separate edit operation parameters (Jelinek, 1997).",
        "The probabilities of all possible edit sequences sum to one.",
        "In addition, unlike the stochastic transducer model, the atomic edit operations for each character also sum to one.",
        "The use here is inspired by the hidden Markov models used in speech recognition for modeling pronunciation variation in individual words.",
        "Clearly, these methods are not designed to discover translation pairs having no surface form relationships.",
        "They are, however, applicable for translation pairs with orthographically realized historical or phonological similarity.",
        "Strictly for the purposes of distinguishing this target-language vocabulary, a translation pair is assumed to be a cognate pair if its Levenshtein distance is less than 3.",
        "This arbitrary threshold avoids the need to make historical linguistic judgements about cognate relationships but it appears to identify a useful, though somewhat conservative, subset of the target vocabulary with few false positives.",
        "In this paper, we report results both on the subset of hypothesized cognate pairs and on the whole set.",

        "The Spanish-Portuguese dictionary contained 1000 word pairs, while the others contained 900 pairs.",
        "10(9)- fold cross-validation experiments were performed in each case.",
        "The number of training pairs for the adaptive methods which remained after filtering out unlikely cognate pairs ranged from 621 (for Spanish) to 232 (for Romanian).",
        "For the purpose of evaluation, we constrained the candidate test set to have exactly one translation per source word.",
        "However, this property was not used to improve candidate alignment (e.g. via the pigeonhole principle).",
        "Table 1 shows results for different candidate distance functions for Spanish-Portuguese and French-Portuguese translation induction.",
        "The metrics depicted in the first three lines, namely Levenshtein distance (L), the HMM fenonic model (H), and the stochastic transducer (S), were previously described in Section 2.",
        "The other three methods are variants of Levenshtein distance where the costs for edit operations have been modified.",
        "In L-V, the substitution operations between vowels are changed from 1 to 0.5.",
        "Two adaptively trained variants, LS and L-A, are shown in the last two lines of Table 1.",
        "The weights in these two systems were produced by filtering the probabilities obtained from the stochastic transducer into three weight classes: 0.5, 0.75, and 1.",
        "Identity substitutions were assigned a cost of zero.",
        "For L-S, the cost matrix was separately trained for each language pair, and for L-A, it was trained collectively over all the Romance languages.",
        "Table 2 shows some of the highest probability consonant-to-consonant edit operations computed by the stochastic transducer (S).",
        "Most of these top-ranking derived transformations have been observed to be relatively low distance by either linguistic analysis of historical sound changes or by phonological classification, notably: nasal sonorants (\"n\" , \"m\" ), unvoiced stops (\"p\", \"f\"), and voiced stops (\"c\", \"W', \"t\", \"d\") .",
        "Other pairs are derivationally reasonable: (\"b\" , \"v\" ), (\"x\" , \"s\") and (\"s\" , \"c\" ); while some may be noise: (\"g\", \"n\") and (\"g\" , ï¿½v\").",
        "Not shown are vowel-to-vowel substitutions which in general were the most highly ranked; also not shown are tight correspondences between accented and unaccented vowel variants which were also learned by the stochastic transducer.",
        "As can be observed from Table 1, pure Levenshtein distance (L) works surprisingly well.",
        "Dynamic adaptation via the stochastic transducers (S) also gives a notable boost on French-Portuguese (increasing cognate accuracy from 66% to 79%) but offer little improvement for Spanish-Portuguese (perhaps because pure Levenshtein needs no diffusion for relatively close languages while more complex mappings benefit from training).",
        "Similarly, a slight improvment is observed for Romanian-Portuguese under S, but no improvement for Italian-Portuguese.",
        "Also, empirical evidence suggests that the best method is achieved through learning weights with stochastic transducers and then using these weights in the LS framework.",
        "In light of the results reported by Ristad and Yianilos (1998) of an error rate reduction of as much as 1/6 over pure Levenshtein distance (on a different task), it is surprising that S did not consistently outperform L in these experiments.",
        "This surprise is mitigated when a number of other factors were considered:",
        "â¢ The training size in Ristad and Yianilos (1998) is significantly larger than used here, on the order of tens of thousands rather than several hundred pairs.",
        "The shortage of potential training data here undoubtedly hinders the performance of the adaptive system.",
        "â¢ Ristad and Yianilos (1998) used training and test sets which are more tightly related - the test set contained words from the training set, with possibly different pronunciations.",
        "In our task, however, the words in the training and test sets are disjoint.",
        "â¢ They trained on a hand-crafted pronunciation dictionary which listed pronunciations for each word form.",
        "In contrast, we used existing resources which were built for a different task and was therefore much noisier.",
        "As a further illustration of the effect of the quality of the data on performance, Ristad and Yianilos (1998) also described an experiment where corpus-derived noisy data were used, and in that experiment stochastic transducers also did not outperform pure Levenshtein distance.",
        "This finding is consistent with our current results.",
        "Table 3 gives the mean rank of the correct translation in the complete ordering of alignment candidates.",
        "This measure may be indicative of the usefulness of the translation candidate ordering to human translators.",
        "Even in the case of the unrestricted vocabulary which includes many non-cognates the correct translation appears on average in the top 10-11.",
        "Performance is also clearly sensitive to the relative similarity between the source and target languages.",
        "Table 4 shows that performance and cognate coverage (for a Portuguese source language) are highest for the most similar language (Spanish), and drop roughly in order of historical distance within the Romance language family.",
        "Table 10 also shows that performance decrease is roughly correlated with language distance (for the Slavic and Romance languages), and indeed clustering languages by such measures may yield insights regarding historical language distance, although space precludes such an analysis here."

The distance-based scoring method selects the hypothesized target word with the smallest distance from a translation in any of the bridge languages.",
