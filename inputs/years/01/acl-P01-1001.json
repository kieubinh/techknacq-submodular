        "The 3 billion base pair sequence of the human genome is now available, and attention is focusing on annotating it to extract biological meaning.",
        "I will discuss what we have obtained, and the methods that are being used to analyse biological sequences.",
        "In particular I will discuss approaches using stochastic grammars analogous to those used in computational linguistics, both for gene finding and protein family classification."
