        "where hi = wl ... wi_1, which is usually known as the history of wi.",
        "The effort in the language modeling techniques is usually directed to the estimation of p (wi I hi) .",
        "The language model defined by the expression p(wilhi) is named the conditional language model.",
        "In principle, the determination of the conditional probability in (1) is expensive, because the possible number of word sequences is very great.",
        "Traditional conditional language models assume that the probability of the word wi does not depend on the entire history, and the history is limited by an equivalence relation 0, and (1) is rewritten as:",
        "The most commonly used conditional language model is the n-gram model.",
        "In the n-gram model, the history is reduced (by the equivalence relation) to the last n – 1 words.",
        "The power of the n-gram model resides in: its consistence with the training data, its simple formulation, and its easy implementation.",
        "However, the n-gram model only uses the information provided by the last n – 1 words to predict the next word and so only makes use of local information.",
        "In addition, the value of n must be low (< 3 ) because for n > 3 there are problems with the parameter estimation.",
        "Hybrid models have been proposed, in an attempt to supplement the local information with long-distance information.",
        "They combine different types of models, like n-grams, with long-distance information, generally by means of linear interpolation, as has been shown in (Belle",
        "garda, 1998; Chelba and Jelinek, 2000; Bened´ı and S´anchez, 2000).",
        "A formal framework to include long-distance and local information in the same language model is based on the Maximum Entropy principle (ME).",
        "Using the ME principle, we can combine information from a variety of sources into the same language model (Berger et al., 1996; Rosen-feld, 1996).",
        "The goal of the ME principle is that, given a set of features (pieces of desired information contained in the sentence), a set of functions fl, ... fy,,, (measuring the contribution of each feature to the model) and a set of constraints1 , we have to find the probability distribution that satisfies the constraints and minimizes the relative entropy (Divergence ofKullback-Leibler) D(pI I po), with respect to the distribution po.",
        "The general Maximum Entropy probability distribution relative to a prior distribution po is given by the expression:",
        "where Z is the normalization constant and Ai are parameters to be found.",
        "The Ai represent the contribution of each feature to the distribution.",
        "From (3) it is easy to derive the Maximum Entropy conditional language model (Rosenfeld, 1996): if X is the context space and W is the vocabulary, then XxW is the states space, and if",
        "where z(x) is the normalization constant depending on the context x.",
        "Although the conditional ME language model is more flexible than n-gram models, there is an important obstacle to its general use: conditional ME language models have a high computational cost (Rosenfeld, 1996), specially the evaluation of the normalization constant (5).",
        "Although we can incorporate local information (like n-grams) and some kinds of long-distance information (like triggers) within the conditional ME model, the global information contained in the sentence is poorly encoded in the ME model, as happens with the other conditional models.",
        "There is a language model which is able to take advantage of the local information and at the same time allows for the use of the global properties of the sentence: the Whole Sentence Maximum Entropy model (WSME) (Rosenfeld, 1997).",
        "We can include classical information such us n-grams, distance n-grams or triggers and global properties of the sentence, as features into the WSME framework.",
        "Besides the fact that the WSME model training procedure is less expensive than the conditional ME model, the most important training step is based on well-developed statistical sampling techniques.",
        "In recent works (Chen and Rosenfeld, 1999a), WSME models have been successfully trained using features of n-grams and distance n-grams.",
        "In this work, we propose adding information to the WSME model which is provided by the grammatical structure of the sentence.",
        "The information is added in the form of features by means of a Stochastic Context-Free Grammar (SCFG).",
        "The grammatical information is combined with features of n-grams and triggers.",
        "In section 2, we describe the WSME model and the training procedure in order to estimate the parameters of the model.",

        "The MCMC sampling methods have been used in the parameter estimation of the WSME language models, specially the Independence Metropolis-Hasting (IMH) and the Gibb’s sampling algorithms (Chen and Rosenfeld, 1999a; Rosenfeld, 1997).",
        "The best results have been obtainded using the (IMH) algorithm.",
        "Although MCMC performs well, the distribution from which the sample is obtained is only an approximation of the target sampling distribution.",
        "Therefore samples obtained from such distributions may produce some bias in sample statistics, like sampling mean.",
        "Recently, another sampling technique which is also based on Markov Chains has been developed by Propp and Wilson (Propp and Wilson, 1996), the Perfect Sampling (PS) technique.",
        "PS is based on the concept of Coupling From the Past.",
        "In PS, several paths of the Markov chain are running from the past (one path in each state of the chain).",
        "In all the paths, the transition rule of the Markov chain uses the same set of random numbers to transit from one state to another.",
        "Thus if two paths coincide in the same state in time t, they will remain in the same states the rest of the time.",
        "In such a case, we say that the two paths are collapsed.",
        "Now, if all the paths collapse at any given time, from that point in time, we are sure that we are sampling from the true target distribution p. The Coupling From the Past algorithm, systematically goes to the past and then runs paths in all states and repeats this procedure until a time T has been found.",
        "Once T has been found, the paths that begin in time – T all paths collapse at time t = 0.",
        "Then we run a path of the chain from the state at time t = – T to the actual time (t = 0), and the last state arrived is a sample from the target distribution.",
        "The reason for going from past to current time is technical, and is detailed in (Propp and Wilson, 1996).",
        "If the state space is huge (as is the case where the state space is the set of all sentences), we must define a stochastic order over the state space and then run only two paths: one beginning in the minimum state and the other in the maximum state, following the same mechanism described above for the two paths until they collapse.",
        "In this way, it is proved that we get a sample from the exact target distribution and not from an approximate distribution as in MCMC algorithms (Propp and Wilson, 1996).",
        "Thus, we hope that in samples generated with perfect sampling, statistical parameter estimators may be less biased than those generated with MCMC.",
        "Recently (Amaya and Bened´ı, 2000), the PS was successfully used to estimate the parameters of a WSME language model .",
        "In that work, a comparison was made between the performance of WSME models trained using MCMC and WSME models trained using PS.",
        "Features of n-grams and features of triggers were used In both kinds of models, and the WSME model trained with PS had better performance.",
        "We then considered it appropriate to use PS in the training procedure of the WSME.",
        "The model parameters were completed with the estimation of the global normalization constant Z.",
        "Using (7), we can deduce that Z = Epo [R(s)] and thus estimate Z using the sampling expectation.",

        "To capture the grammatical information, we use Stochastic Context-Free Grammars (SCFG).",
        "Over the last decade, there has been an increasing interest in Stochastic Context-Free Grammars (SCFGs) for use in different tasks (K., 1979; Jelinek, 1991; Ney, 1992; Sakakibara, 1990).",
        "The reason for this can be found in the capability of SCFGs to model the long-term dependencies established between the different lexical units of a sentence, and the possibility to incorporate the stochastic information that allows for an adequate modeling of the variability phenomena.",
        "Thus, SCFGs have been successfully used on limited-domain tasks of low perplexity.",
        "However, SCFGs work poorly for large vocabulary, general-purpose tasks, because the parameter learning and the computation of word transition probabilities present serious problems for complex real tasks.",
        "To capture the long-term relations and to solve the main problem derived from the use of SCFGs in large-vocabulary complex tasks,we consider the proposal in (Bened´ı and S´anchez, 2000): define a category-based SCFG and a probabilistic model of word distribution in the categories.",
        "The use of categories as terminal of the grammar reduces the number of rules to take into account and thus, the time complexity of the SCFG learning procedure.",
        "The use of the probabilistic model of word distribution in the categories, allows us to obtain the best derivation of the sentences in the application.",
        "Actually, we have to solve two problems: the estimation of the parameters of the models and their integration to obtain the best derivation of a sentence.",
        "The parameters of the two models are estimated from a training sample.",
        "Each word in the training sample has a part-of-speech tag (POStag) associated to it.",
        "These POStags are considered as word categories and are the terminal symbols of our SCFG.",
        "Given a category, the probability distribution of a word is estimated by means of the relative frequency of the word in the category, i.e. the relative frequency which the word w has been labeled with a POStag (a word w may belong to different categories).",
        "To estimate the SCFG parameters, several algorithms have been presented (K. and S.J., 1991; Pereira and Shabes, 1992; Amaya et al., 1999; S´anchez and Bened´ı, 1999).",
        "Taking into account the good results achieved on real tasks (S´anchez and Bened´ı, 1999), we used them to learn our category-based SCFG.",
        "To solve the integration problem, we used an algorithm that computes the probability of the best derivation that generates a sentence, given the category-based grammar and the model of word distribution into categories (Bened´ı and S´anchez, 2000).",
        "This algorithm is based on the well-known Viterbi-like scheme for SCFGs.",

A Stochastic Context-Free Gramar GS is a pair (G, p) where G is a context-free grammar and p is a probability distribution over the grammar rules.",

        "As mentioned above, we can compute the best derivation of the sentence s, using the defined SCFG and obtain the parse tree of the sentence.",
        "Once we have the parse tree of all the sentences in the training corpus, we can collect the set of all the production rules used in the derivation of the sentences in the corpus.",
        "Formally: we define the set E(s)",
        "is the set of all grammatical rules used in the derivation of s. To include the rules of the form A --� v, where A E N and v E E, in the set E(s), we make use of a special symbol $ which is not in the terminals nor in the non-terminals.",
        "If a rule of the form A --� u occurs in the derivation tree of s, the corresponding element in E(s) is written as (A, u, $).",
        "The set E = U,cQE(s) (where Q is the corpus), is the set of grammatical features.",
