        "Consider the following examples discovered in a corpus of queries submitted to the Electric Knowledge search engine 12, the successor of the On Point natural language search system described in Cooper (1997).",
        "Each consists of a query, a response (not shown), and then a follow-up query.",
        "(1) What is the drinking age in Afghanistan?",
        "What is the drinking age in other countries?",
        "(2) Where can I find web browsers for download?",
        "Where can I find other web browsers than Netscape for download?",
        "(3) Where can I find a list of all the shoe manufacturers in the world?",
        "Where can I find shoes made by Buffalino, such as the Bushwackers?",
        "(4) Where are online auctions indexed?",
        "Are there other auction search engines besides BidFind?",
        "In each case, particular words are used to constrain the space of appropriate answers: e.g. such (as), other (than), and besides.",
        "I call these words, and others like them, alternative markers, and alternative markers along with their syntactic argument (e.g. other countries), I call alternative phrases.",
        "Alternative phrases that are closely bound to the noun phrase to which they refer, like those above, I call connected alternative phrases (modeled after similar terminology in Hoeksema (1995)).",
        "There are also free alternative phrases, such as Other than Fido, every dog likes going for walks, which are not discussed here but are discussed in depth in Bierner (2001).",
        "I have found queries containing all these forms despite the fact that no current NLIR system can handle them, either ignoring the alternative phrase or, worse, treating the queries as if the alternative marker were absent.",
        "The fact that these phrases define the space of correct answers makes it absolutely necessary to correctly interpret them in an IR application.",
        "The user requires countries that are not Afghanistan, web browsers that are not Netscape, shoes with similar properties to Bushwackers, and auction search engines that are not BidFind.",
        "Answers that do not conform are wrong.",
        "Another feature of alternative markers are their presuppositions.",
        "Through these presuppositions, alternative markers can provide a rich source of knowledge about the world, as Hearst (1992) has already recognized.",
        "For example, these queries imply that Afghanistan is a country, Netscape is a web browser, Bushwackers are shoes, and BidFind is an auction search engine.",
        "Anaphoric resolution can sometimes be critical for these inferences.",
        "In (1), for instance, other countries anaphorically depends on Afghanistan in the previous query.",
        "While not as obviously important to natural language information retrieval, this property of alternative phrases can be used to improve future queries (see Section 4.1).",
        "The purpose of this paper is, first, to briefly provide a well-founded semantic analysis for alternative phrases that is amenable to computation.",
        "The main thrust is then to show that a motivated approximation of this analysis can dramatically improve the results of a practical natural language application – in particular, a natural language search engine.",
        "The value of this two-step approach is that as the operational semantics of practical applications are gradually extended, progressively more extensive approximations can be transparently incorporated."

        "This technique is adequate for the purpose of acquiring hyponyms from large corpora because the goal is to take advantage of easily available information, not to handle a wide variation of linguistic phenomena.",
        "Handling a full range of natural language queries requires a deeper approach.",
        "For example, pattern matching alone cannot account for anaphoric reference such as in (1) or examples where discourse knowledge invalidates the hyponym relation as in (6).",
        "(6) John’s pet dog, Fido, was sick.",
        "So John and the other dogs went for a walk.",
        "In contrast, von Fintel (1993) and Hoeksema (1995) provide in-depth semantic analyses of a limited class of alternative phrases; namely they focus entirely on exceptive phrases (ways of referring to exceptions) illustrated by the lexical items but and except (for).",
        "The thrust of their analyses is directed towards how these words interact with quantifiers to determine the final set of entities.",
        "Since in queries, quantifiers rarely interact with alternative phrases in the manner discussed in Hoeksema and von Fintel’s work, their analyses have not been carried over into the present work."

        "My analyses of alternative phrases uses the relation alts(p, q) which, intuitively, specifies that the two sets of entities denoted by p and q can be found together in at least one alternative set in the knowledge base.",
        "The description component of the alternative set (i.e.",
        "the property) need not be known.",
        "It is important to note that although here I focus on unifying such structures, I also make use of the fact that alts is a relation that is symmetric and reflexive, but not transitive.",
        "The alternative phrases I have analyzed fall into two classes: those that assemble a set from elements and those that excise a set from a larger set (as in exceptive phrases).",
        "In either case, one particular set of elements is of interest, the figure.",
        "With assembly words, the figure is either admitted into the set or combined with a complement to form a set.",

        "The presupposition set in Figure 2 is the union of the presuppositions of other and than, as bound during the derivation.",
        "The remaining variable, f, can be determined solely from the derivation’s presupposition set using the old AI planning heuristic “use existing objects” (Sacer-doti, 1977) to avoid inventing new objects when others are already available.",
        "In particular, we can unify alts(f, λx.browser(x) ∧ ¬ f (x)) and alts(netscape, λx.browser(x) ∧ ¬ f (x)), discovering that f, the figure, is netscape.",

        "In the next section I show that practical applications such as natural language search engines can benefit from appropriate approximations of this kind of analysis.",

        "The question is filtered through a hierarchy of regular expressions, and hand-crafted rules are used to extract information from the question into Boolean expressions.",
        "The regular expression matching is aided by an ISA hierarchy such that generalizations of keywords can be captured.",
        "As mentioned in Section 1, the fact that the presuppositions of alternative phrases encode hyponym information can be useful in augmenting this aspect of systems like the EK search engine.",
        "This technique suffers from the fact that, in order to be tractable, this set of patterns is limited and important information in the query can be lost.",
        "In particular, the Electric Knowledge search engine does not have patterns that attempt to associate alternative phrases with appropriate pieces of boolean query.",
        "To overcome this, an appropriate approximation of the semantic result of my analysis that is compatible with the back end search system must be found.",
        "For the Electric Knowledge search engine (similar approaches are certainly possible for other NLIR systems), a hybrid query has been introduced to account for alternative phrases, which combines a natural language query with further restrictions added in a system-specific language.",

        "The restrictions specify that the answer to the query must not be near to certain words.",
        "The hybrid query in (8), for example, is a transformation of the original query What are some other web browsers than Netscape?.",
