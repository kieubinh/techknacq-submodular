        "Given the state of the art of current language and speech technology, communication problems are unavoidable in present-day spoken dialogue systems.",
        "The main source of these problems lies in the imperfections of automatic speech recognition, but also incorrect interpretations by the natural language understanding module or wrong default assumptions by the dialogue manager are likely to lead to confusion.",
        "If a spoken dialogue system had the ability to detect communication problems on-line and with high accuracy, it might be able to correct certain errors or it could interact with the user to solve them.",
        "For instance, in the case of communication problems, it would be beneficial to change from a relatively natural dialogue strategy to a more constrained one in order to resolve the problems (see e.g., Litman and Pan 2000).",
        "Similarly, it has been shown that users switch to a ‘marked’, hyperarticulate speaking style after problems (e.g., Soltau and Waibel 1998), which itself is an important source of recognition errors.",
        "This might be solved by using two recognizers in parallel, one trained on normal speech and one on hyperarticulate speech.",
        "If there are communication problems, then the system could decide to focus on the recognition results delivered by the engine trained on hyperarticulate speech.",
        "For such approaches to work, however, it is essential that the spoken dialogue system is able to automatically detect communication problems with a high accuracy.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the usefulness for problem detection of the word graph and the history of system question types.",
        "These features are present in many spoken dialogue systems and do not require additional computation, which makes this a very cheap method to detect problems.",
        "We shall see that on the basis of the previous and the current word graph and the six most recent system question types, communication problems can be detected with an accuracy of 91%, which is a significant improvement over the relevant baseline.",
        "This shows that spoken dialogue systems may use these features to better predict whether the ongoing dialogue is problematic.",
        "In addition, the current work is interesting from a machine learning perspective.",
        "We apply two machine learning techniques: the memory-based IB 1-IG algorithm (Aha et al.",
        "1991, Daelemans et al.",
        "1997) and the RIPPER rule induction algorithm (Cohen 1996).",
        "As we shall see, some interesting differences between the two approaches arise."

        "Recently there has been an increased interest in developing automatic methods to detect problematic dialogue situations using machine learning techniques.",
        "For instance, Litman et al.",
        "(1999) and Walker et al.",
        "(2000a) use RIPPER (Cohen 1996) to classify problematic and unproblematic dialogues.",
        "Following up on this, Walker et al.",
        "(2000b) aim at detecting problems at the utterance level, based on data obtained with AT&Ts How May I Help You (HMIHY) system (Gorin et al.1997).",
        "Walker and co-workers apply RIPPER to 43 features which are automatically generated by three modules of the HMIHY system, namely the speech recognizer (ASR), the natural language understanding module (NLU) and the dialogue manager (DM).",
        "The best result is obtained using all features: communication problems are detected with an accuracy of 86%, a precision of 83% and a recall of 75%.",
        "It should be noted that the NLU features play first fiddle among the set of all features.",
        "In fact, using only the NLU features performs comparable to using all features.",
        "Walker et al.",
        "(2000b) also briefly compare the performance of RIPPER with some other machine learning approaches, and show that it performs comparable to a memory-based (instance-based) learning algorithm (IB, see Aha et al.",
        "1991).",
        "The results which Walker and co-workers describe show that it is possible to automatically detect communication problems in the HMIHY system, using machine learning techniques.",
        "Their approach also raises a number of interesting follow-up questions, some concerned with problem detection, others with the use of machine learning techniques.",
        "(1) Walker et al.",
        "train their classifier on a large set of features, and show that the set of features produced by the NLU module are the most important ones.",
        "However, this leaves an important general question unanswered, namely which particular features contribute to what extent?",
        "(2) Moreover, the set of features which the NLU module produces appear to be rather specific to the HMIHY system and indicate things like the percentage of the input covered by the relevant grammar fragment, the presence or absence of context shifts, and the semantic diversity of subsequent utterances.",
        "Many current day spoken dialogue systems do not have such a sophisticated NLU module, and consequently it is unlikely that they have access to these kinds of features.",
        "In sum, it is uncertain whether other spoken dialogue systems can benefit from the findings described by Walker et al.",
        "(2000b), since it is unclear which features are important and to what extent these features are available in other spoken dialogue systems.",
        "Finally, (3) we agree with Walker et al.",
        "(and the machine learning community at large) that it is important to compare different machine learning techniques to find out which techniques perform well for which kinds of tasks.",
        "Walker et al.",
        "found that RIPPER does not perform significantly better or worse than a memory-based learning technique.",
        "Is this incidental or does it reflect a general property of the problem detection task?",
        "The current paper uses a similar methodology for on-line problem detection as Walker et al.",
        "(2000b), but (1) we take a bottom-up approach, focussing on a small number of features and investigating their usefulness on a per-feature basis and (2) the features which we study are automatically available in the majority of current spoken dialogue system: the sequence of system question types and the word graphs corresponding to the respective user utterances.",
        "A word graph is a lattice of word hypotheses, and we conjecture that various features which have been shown to cue communication problems (prosodic, linguistic and ASR features, see e.g., Hirschberg et al.",
        "1999, Krahmer et al.",
        "1999 and Swerts et al.",
        "2000) have correlates in the word graph.",
        "The sequence of system question types is taken to model the dialogue history.",
        "Finally, (3) to gain further insight into the adequacy of various machine learning techniques for problem detection we use both RIPPER and the memory-based IB 1-IG algorithm."

        "3.1 Data and Labeling The corpus we used consisted of 3739 question-answer pairs, taken from 444 complete dialogues.",
        "The dialogues consist of users interacting with a Dutch spoken dialogue system which provides information about train time tables.",
        "The system prompts the user for unknown slots, such as departure station, arrival station, date, etc., in a series of questions.",
        "The system uses a combination of implicit and explicit verification strategies.",
        "The data were annotated with a highly limited set of labels.",
        "In particular, the kind of system question and whether the reply of the user gave rise to communication problems or not.",
        "The latter feature is the one to be predicted.",
        "The following labels are used for the system questions.",
        "O open questions (“From where to where do you want to travel?”) I implicit verification (“When do you want to travel from Tilburg to Schiphol Airport?”) E explicit verification (“So you want to travel from Tilburg to Schiphol Airport?”) Y yes/no question (“Do you want me to repeat the connection?”) M Meta-questions (“Can you please correct me?”) The difference between an explicit verification and a yes/no question is that the former but not the latter is aimed at checking whether what the system understood or assumed corresponds with what the user wants.",
        "If the current system question is a repetition of the previous question it asked, this is indicated by the suffix R. A question only counts as a repetition when it has the same contents as the previous system question.",
        "Of the user inputs, we only labeled whether they gave rise to a communication problem or not.",
        "A communication problem arises when the value which the system assigns to a particular slot (departure station, date, etc.)",
        "does not coincide with the value given for that particular slot by the user in his or her most recent contribution to the dialogue or when the system makes an incorrect default assumption (e.g., the dialogue manager assumes that the date slot should be filled with the current date, i.e., that the user wants to travel today).",
        "Communication problems are generally easy to label since the spoken dialogue system under consideration here always provides direct feedback (via verification questions) about what it believes the user intends.",
        "Consider the following exchange.",
        "U: I want to go to Amsterdam.",
        "S: So you want to go to Rotterdam?",
        "As soon as the user hears the explicit verification question of the system, it will be clear that his or her last turn was misunderstood.",
        "The problem-feature was labeled by two of the authors to avoid labeling errors.",
        "Differences between the two annotators were infrequent and could always easily be resolved.",
        "3.2 Baselines Of the 3739 user utterances 1564 gave rise to communication problems (an error rate of 41.8%).",
        "The majority class is thus formed by the unproblematic user utterances, which form 58.2% of all user utterances.",
        "This suggests that the baseline for predicting communication problems is obtained by always predicting that there are no communication problems.",
        "This strategy has an accuracy of 58.2%, and a recall of 0% (all problems are missed).' The precision is not defined,2 and consequently neither is the F�3_1.3 This baseline is misleading, however, when we are interested in predicting whether the previous user utterance gave rise to communication problems.",
        "There are cases when the dialogue system is itself clearly aware of communication problems.",
        "This is in particular the case when the system repeats the question (labeled with the suffix R) or when it asks a meta-question (M).",
        "In the corpus under investigation here this happens 1024 times.",
        "It would not be 'For definitions of accuracy, precision and recall see e.g., Manning and Sch¨utze (1999:268-269).",
        "very illuminating to develop an automatic error detector which detects only those problems that the system was already aware of.",
        "Therefore we take the following as our baseline strategy for predicting whether the previous user utterance gave rise to problems, henceforth referred to as the system-knows-baseline: if the Q(t) is repetition or meta-question, then predict user utterance t-1 caused problems, else predict user utterance t-1 caused no problems.",
        "This ‘strategy’ predicts problems with an accuracy of 85.6% (1024 of the 1564 problems are detected, thus 540 of 3739 decisions are wrong), a precision of 100% (of 1024 predicted problems 1024 were indeed problematic), a recall of 65.5% (1024 of the 1564 problems are predicted to be problematic) and thus an F,3-1 of 79.1.",
        "This is a sharp baseline, but for predicting whether the previous user utterance caused problems or not the system-knows-baseline is much more informative and relevant than the majority-class-baseline.",

        "It should be kept in mind that in general the word graph is much more complex than the recognized string.",

        "One important property of many other rules is that they explicitly combine pieces of information from the three main sources of information (the system questions, the current word graph and the previous word graph).",
        "Moreover, it is interesting to note that the words which crop up in the RIPPER rules are primarily function words.",
        "Another noteworthy feature of the RIPPER rules is that they reflect certain properties which have been claimed to cue communication problems.",
        "For instance, Krahmer et al.",
        "(1999), in their descriptive analysis of dialogue problems, found that repeated material is often an indication of problems, as is the use of a marked vocabulary.",
        "The rules 2, 3 and 7 are examples of the former cue, while the occurrence of the somewhat archaic “vanuit” instead of the ordinary “van” is an example of the latter."

        "We have investigated two approaches to problem detection.",
        "The first approach is aimed at testing whether a user utterance, captured in a noisy$ word graph, and/or the recent history of system utterances, would be predictive of whether the utterance itself would be misrecognised.",
        "The results, which basically represents a signal quality test, show that problematic cases could be discerned with an accuracy of about 65%.",
        "Although this is somewhat above the baseline of 58% decision accuracy when no problems would be predicted, signalling recognition problems with word graph features and previous system question types as predictors is a hard task.",
        "As other studies suggest (e.g., Hirschberg et al.1999), confidence scores and acoustic/prosodic features could be of help.",
        "The second approach tested whether the word graph for the current user utterance and/or the recent history of system question types could be employed to predict whether the previous user",
        "utterance caused communication problems.",
        "The underlying assumption is that users will signal problems as soon as they become aware of them through the feedback provided by the system.",
        "Thus, in a sense, this second approach represents a noisy channel filtering task: the current utterance has to be decoded as signalling a problem or not.",
        "As the results show, this task can be performed at a surprisingly high level: about 91% decision accuracy (which is an error reduction of 38%), with an F,3-1 of the problem category of 89.",
        "This result can only be obtained using a combination of features; neither the word graph features in isolation nor the system question types in isolation offer enough predictive power to reach above the sharp baseline of 86% accuracy and an F,3_1 on the problem category of 79.",
        "Keeping information sources isolated or combining them directly influences the relative performances of the memory-based IB 1-IG algorithm versus the RIPPER rule induction algorithm.",
        "When features are of the same type, accuracies of the memory-based and the rule-induction systems do not differ significantly (with one exception).",
        "In contrast, when features from different sources (e.g., words in the word graph and question type features) are combined, RIPPER profits more than IB 1-IG does, causing RIPPER to perform significantly more accurately.",
        "The feature independence assumption of memory-based learning appears to be the harming cause: by its definition, IB 1-IG does not give extra weight to apparently relevant interactions of feature values from different sources.",
        "In contrast, in nine out of the twelve rules that RIPPER produces, word graph features and system questions type features are explicitly integrated as joint left-hand side conditions.",
        "The current results show that for on-line detection of communication problems at the utterance level it is already beneficial to pay attention only to the lexical information in the word graph and the sequence of system question types, features which are present in most spoken dialogue system and which can be obtained with little or no computational overhead.",
        "An approach to automatic problem detection is potentially very useful for spoken dialogue systems, since it gives a quantitative criterion for, for instance, changing the dialogue strategy (initiative, verification) or speech recognition engine (from one trained on normal speech to one trained on hyperarticulate speech)."
