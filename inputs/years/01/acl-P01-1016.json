        "This paper provides empirical support for the relationship between posture shifts and discourse structure, and then derives an algorithm for generating posture shifts in an animated embodied conversational agent from discourse states produced by the middleware architecture known as Collagen [18].",
        "Other nonverbal behaviors have been shown to be correlated with the underlying conversational structure and information structure of discourse.",
        "For example, gaze shifts towards the listener correlate with a shift in conversational turn (fromtheconversationalparticipants perspective, they can be seen as a signal that the floor is available).",
        "Gestures correlate with rhematic content in accompanying language (from the conversational participants perspective, these behaviors can be seen as a signal that accompanying speech is of high interest).",
        "A better understanding of the role of nonverbal behaviors in conveying discourse structures enables improvements in the naturalness of embodied dialogue systems, such as embodied conversational agents, as well as contributing to algorithms for recognizing discourse structure in speech-understanding systems.",
        "Previous work, however, has not addressed major body shifts during discourse, nor has it addressed the nonverbal correlates of topic shifts."

      "text": [
        "Only recently have computational linguists begun to examine the association of nonverbal behaviors and language.",
        "In this section we review research by non-computational linguists and discuss how this research has been employed to formulate algorithms for natural language generation or understanding.",
        "About three-quarters of all clauses in descriptive discourse are accompanied by gestures [17], and within those clauses, the most effortful part of gestures tends to co-occur with or just before the phonologically most prominent syllable of the accompanying speech [13].",
        "It has been shown that when speech is ambiguous or in a speech situation with some noise, listeners rely on gestural cues [22] (and, the higher the noise-to-signal ratio, the more facilitation by gesture).",
        "Even when gestural content overlaps with speech (reported to be the case in roughly 50% of utterances, for descriptive discourse), gesture often emphasizes information that is also focused pragmatically by mechanisms like prosody in speech.",
        "In fact, the semantic and pragmatic compatibility in the gesture-speech relationship recalls the interaction of words and graphics in multimodal presentations [11].",
        "On the basis of results such as these, several researchers have built animated embodied conversational agents that ally synthesized speech with animated hand gestures.",
        "For example, Lester et al.",
        "[15] generate deictic gestures and choose referring expressions as a function of the potential ambiguity and proximity of objects referred to.",
        "Rickel and Johnson [19]'s pedagogical agent produces a deictic gesture at the beginning of explanations about objects.",
        "Andr et al.",
        "[1] generate pointing gestures as a sub-action of the rhetorical action of labeling, in turn a sub-action of elaborating.",
        "Cassell and Stone [3] generate either speech, gesture, or a combination of the two, as a function of the information structure status and surprise value of the discourse entity.",
        "Head and eye movement has also been examined in the context of discourse and conversation.",
        "Looking away from ones interlocutor has been correlated with the beginning of turns.",
        "From the speakers point of view, this look away may prevent an overload of visual and linguistic information.",
        "On the other hand, during the execution phase of an utterance, speakers look more often at listeners.",
        "Head nods and eyebrow raises are correlated with emphasized linguistic items such as words accompanied by pitch accents [7].",
        "Some eye movements occur primarily at the ends of utterances and at grammatical boundaries, and appear to function as synchronization signals.",
        "That is, one may request a response from a listener by looking at the listener, and suppress the listeners response by looking away.",
        "Likewise, in order to offer the floor, a speaker may gaze at the listener at the end of the utterance.",
        "When the listener wants the floor, s/he may look at and slightly up at the speaker [10].",
        "It should be noted that turn taking only partially accounts for eye gaze behavior in discourse.",
        "A better explanation for gaze behavior integrates turn taking with the information structure of the propositional content of an utterance [5].",
        "Specifically, the beginning of themes are frequently accompanied by a look-away from the hearer, and the beginning of rhemes are frequently accompanied by a look-toward the hearer.",
        "When these categories are co-temporaneous with turn construction, then they are strongly predictive of gaze behavior.",
        "Results such as these have led researchers to generate eye gaze and head movements in animated embodied conversational agents.",
        "Takeuchi and Nagao, for example, [21] generate gaze and head nod behaviors in a talking head.",
        "Cassell et al.",
        "[2] generate eye gaze and head nods as a function of turn taking behavior, head turns just before an utterance, and eyebrow raises as a function of emphasis.",
        "To our knowledge, research on posture shifts and other gross body movements, has not been used in the design or implementation of computational systems.",
        "In fact, although a number of conversational analysts and ethnomethodologists have described posture shifts in conversation, their studies have been qualitative in nature, and difficult to reformulate as the basis of algorithms for the generation of language and posture.",
        "Nevertheless, researchers in the non-computational fields have discussed posture shifts extensively.",
        "Kendon [13] reports a hierarchy in the organization of movement such that the smaller limbs such as the fingers and hands engage in more frequent movements, while the trunk and lower limbs change relatively rarely.",
        "A number of researchers have noted that changes in physical distance during interaction seem to accompany changes in the topic or in the social relationship between speakers.",
        "For example Condon and Osgton [9] have suggested that in a speaking individual the changes in these more slowly changing body parts occur at the boundaries of the larger units in the flow of speech.",
        "Scheflen (1973) also reports that posture shifts and other general body movements appear to mark the points of change between one major unit of communicative activity and another.",
        "Blom & Gumperz (1972) identify posture changes and changes in the spatial relationship between two speakers as indicators of what they term \"situational shifts\" -- momentary changes in the mutual rights and obligations between speakers accompanied by shifts in language style.",
        "Erickson (1975) concludes that proxemic shifts seem to be markers of 'important' segments.",
        "In his analysis of college counseling interviews, they occurred more frequently than any other coded indicator of segment changes, and were therefore the best predictor of new segments in the data.",
        "Unfortunately, in none of these studies are statistics provided, and their analyses rely on intuitive definitions of discourse segment or major shift.",
        "For this reason, we carried out our own empirical study."

        "), and 3) when they would work on it.",
        "Subjects stood in both conditions and were told to perform their tasks in 5-10 minutes.",
        "The pseudo-monologue condition (pseudo- because there was in fact an interlocutor, although he gave backchannel feedback only and never took the turn) allowed us to investigate the relationship between discourse structure and posture shift independent of turn structure.",

        "This, together with the fact that the majority of time was spent within discourse segments and within turns (rather than between segments), led us to normalize our posture shift data for comparison purposes.",
        "For relatively brief intervals (inter-discourse-segment and inter-turn) normalization by number of inter-segment occurrences was sufficient (ps/int), however, for long intervals (intra-discourse segment and intra-turn) we needed to normalize by time to obtain meaningful comparisons.",
        "For this normalization metric we looked at posture-shifts-per-second (ps/s).",

        "Conclusion and Further work",
        "We have demonstrated a clear relationship between nonverbal behavior and discourse state, and shown how this finding can be incorporated into the generation of language and nonverbal behaviors for an embodied conversational agent.",
        "Speakers produce posture shifts at 53% of discourse segment boundaries, more frequently than they produce those shifts discourse segment-internally, and with more motion energy.",
        "Furthermore, there is a relationship between discourse structure and conversational structure such that when speakers initiate a new segment at the same time as starting a turn (the most frequent case by far), they are more likely to produce a posture shift; while when they end a discourse segment and a turn at the same time, their posture shifts last longer than when these categories do not co-occur.",
        "Although this paper reports results from a limited number of monologues and dialogues, the findings are promising.",
        "In addition, they point the way to a number of future directions, both within the study of posture and discourse, and more generally within the study of nonverbal behaviors in computational linguistics.",
        "Figure 6.2: Rea demonstrating a low and high energy posture shift First, given the relationship between conversational and information structure in [5], a natural next step is to examine the three-way relationship between discourse state, conversational structure (turns), and information structure (theme/rheme).",
        "For the moment, we have demonstrated that posture shifts may signal boundaries of units; do they also signal the information content of units?",
        "Next, we need to look at finer segmentations of the discourse, to see whether larger and smaller discourse segments are distinguished through non-verbal means.",
        "Third, the question of listener posture is an important one.",
        "We found that a number of posture shifts were produced by the participant who was not speaking.",
        "More than half of these shifts were produced at the same time as a speaker shift, suggesting a kind of mirroring.",
        "In order to interpret these data, however, a more sensitive notion of turn structure is required, as one must be ready to define when exactly speakers and listeners shift roles.",
        "Also, of course, evaluation of the importance of such nonverbal behaviors to user interaction is essential.",
        "In a user study of our earlier Gandalf system [4], users rated the agent's language skills significantly higher under test conditions in which Gandalf deployed conversational behaviors (gaze, head movement and limited gesture) than when these behaviors were disabled.",
        "Such an evaluation is also necessary for the Rea-posture system.",
        "But, more generally, we need to test whether generating posture shifts of this sort actually serves as a signal to listeners, for example to initiative (f) structure in task and dialogue [8].",
        "These evaluations form part of our future research plans."
