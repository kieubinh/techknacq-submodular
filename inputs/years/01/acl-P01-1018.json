        "“How much strong generative power can be squeezed out of a formal system without increasing its weak generative power?” This question, posed by Joshi (2000), is important for both linguistic description and natural language processing.",
        "The extension of tree adjoining grammar (TAG) to tree-local multicomponent TAG (Joshi, 1987), or the extension of context free grammar (CFG) to tree insertion grammar (Schabes and Waters, 1993) or regular form TAG (Rogers, 1994) can be seen as steps toward answering this question.",
        "But this question is difficult to answer with much finality unless we pin its terms down more precisely.",
        "First, what is meant by strong generative power?",
        "In the standard definition (Chomsky, 1965) a grammar G weakly generates a set of sentences L(G) and strongly generates a set of structural descriptions Σ(G); the strong generative capacity of a formalism Fis then {Σ(G) | F provides G}.",
        "There is some vagueness in the literature, however, over what structural descriptions are and how they can reasonably be compared across theories (Miller (1999) gives a good synopsis).",
        "The approach that Vijay-Shanker et al.",
        "(1987) and Weir (1988) take, elaborated on by Becker et al.",
        "(1992), is to identify a very general class of formalisms, which they call linear context-free rewriting systems (CFRSs), and define for this class a large space of structural descriptions which serves as a common ground in which the strong generative capacities of these formalisms can be compared.",
        "Similarly, if we want to talk about squeezing strong generative power out of a formal system, we need to do so in the context of some larger space of structural descriptions.",
        "Second, why is preservation of weak generative power important?",
        "If we interpret this constraint to the letter, it is almost vacuous.",
        "For example, the class of all tree adjoining grammars which generate context-free languages includes the grammar shown in Figure 1a (which generates the language {a, b}∗).",
        "We can also add the tree shown in Figure 1b without increasing the grammar’s weak generative capacity; indeed, we can add any trees we please, provided they yield only as and bs.",
        "Intuitively, the constraint of weak context-freeness has little force.",
        "This intuition is verified if we consider that weak context-freeness is desirable for computational efficiency.",
        "Though a weakly context-free TAG might be recognizable in cubic time (if we know the equivalent CFG), it need not be parsable in cubic time – that is, given a string, to compute all its possible structural descriptions will take O(n6) time in general.",
        "If we are interested in computing structural descriptions from strings, then",
        "we need a tighter constraint than preservation of weak generative power.",
        "In Section 3 below we examine some restrictions on tree adjoining grammar which are weakly context-free, and observe that their parsers all work in the same way: though given a TAG G, they implicitly parse using a CFG G' which derives the same strings as G, but also their corresponding structural descriptions under G, in such a way that preserves the dynamic-programming structure of the parsing algorithm.",
        "Based on this observation, we replace the constraint of preservation of weak generative power with a constraint of simulability: essentially, a grammar G' simulates another grammar G if it generates the same strings that G does, as well as their corresponding structural descriptions under G (see Figure 2).",
        "So then, within the class of context-free rewriting systems, how does this constraint of simulability limit strong generative power?",
        "In Section 4.1 we define a formalism called multicomponent multifoot TAG (MMTAG) which, when restricted to a regular form, characterizes precisely those CFRSs which are simulable by a CFG.",
        "Thus, in the sense we have set forth, this formalism can be said to squeeze as much strong generative power out of CFG as is possible.",
        "Finally, we generalize this result to formalisms beyond CFG."

        "just as in the CKY parser for CFG.",
        "In effect the parser dynamically converts the TSG, TIG, or RF-TAG into an equivalent CFG – each parser rule of the above form corresponds to the rule schema Z → XY.",
        "More importantly, given a grammar G and a string w, a parser can reconstruct all possible derivations of w under G by storing inside each chart item how that item was inferred.",
        "If we think of the parser as dynamically converting G into a CFG G', then this CFG is likewise able to compositionally reconstruct TSG, TIG, or RF-TAG derivations – we say that G' simulates G. Note that the parser specifies how to convert G into G', but G' is not itself a parser.",
        "Thus these three formalisms have a special relationship to CFG that is independent of any particular parsing algorithm: for any TSG, TIG, or RF-TAG G, there is a CFG that simulates G. We make this notion more precise below."

        "We have proposed a more constrained version of Joshi’s question, “How much strong generative power can be squeezed out of a formal system without increasing its weak generative power,” and shown that within these constraints, a variant of TAG called MMTAG characterizes the limit of how much strong generative power can be squeezed out of CFG.",
        "Moreover, using the notion of a meta-level grammar, this result is extended to formalisms beyond CFG.",
        "It remains to be seen whether RF-MMTAG, whether used directly or for specifying meta-level grammars, provides further practical benefits on top of existing “squeezed” grammar formalisms like tree-local MCTAG, tree insertion grammar, or regular form TAG.",
        "This way of approaching Joshi’s question is by no means the only way, but we hope that this work will contribute to a better understanding of the strong generative capacity of constrained grammar formalisms as well as reveal more powerful formalisms for linguistic analysis and natural language processing."
