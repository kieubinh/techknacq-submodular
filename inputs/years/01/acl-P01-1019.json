        "But there are problems.",
        "The operations are only specified in terms of the TFS logic: the interpretation relies on an intuitive correspondence with a conventional logical representation, but this is not spelled out.",
        "Furthermore the operations on the semantics are not tightly specified or constrained.",
        "For instance, although HPSG has the Semantics Principle (Pollard and Sag, 1994) this does not stop the composition process accessing arbitrary pieces of structure, so it is often not easy to conceptually disentangle the syntax and semantics in an HPSG.",
        "Nothing guarantees that the grammar is monotonic, by which we mean that in each rule application the semantic content of each daughter subsumes some portion of the semantic content of the mother (i.e., no semantic information is dropped during composition): this makes it impossible to guarantee that certain generation algorithms will work effectively.",
        "Finally, from a theoretical perspective, it seems clear that substantive generalizations are being missed.",
        "Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS: Copestake et al. (1999), see also Egg (1998)) tightens up the specification of composition a little.",
        "It enforces monotonic accumulation of EPs by making all rules append the EPs of their daughters (an approach which was followed by Sag and Wasow (1999)) but it does not fully spec",

        "We attempt to rectify these problems, by developing an algebra which gives a general way of expressing composition.",
        "The semantic algebra lets us specify the allowable operations in a less cumbersome notation than TFSs and abstracts away from the specific feature architecture used in individual grammars, but the essential features of the algebra can be encoded in the hierarchy of lexical and constructional type constraints.",

        "Since the constraints need not be checked at runtime, it seems better to regard them as metalevel conditions on the description of the grammar, which can anyway easily be checked by code which converts the TFS into the algebraic representation.",
        "Because the ERG is large and complex, we have not yet fully completed the exercise of retrospectively implementing the constraints throughout.",
