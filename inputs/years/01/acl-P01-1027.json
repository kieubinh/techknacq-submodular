        "This additional information could be:",
        "• Simple context information: information of the words surrounding the word pair; • Syntactic information: part-of-speech information, syntactic constituent, sentence mood; • Semantic information: disambiguation information (e.g. from WordNet), current/previous speech or dialog act.",
        "To include this additional information within the statistical framework we use the maximum entropy approach.",
        "This approach has been applied in natural language processing to a variety of tasks.",
