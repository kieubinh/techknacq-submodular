        "We take the axiomatic view of language and show that it yields an interestingly new perspective on the tactical generation task i.e. the task of producing from a given semantics 0 a string with semantics 0.",
        "As (Cornell and Rogers, To appear) clearly shows, there has recently been a surge of interest in logic based grammars for natural language.",
        "In this branch of research sometimes referred to as “Model Theoretic Syntax”, a grammar is viewed as a set of axioms defining the well-formed structures of natural language.",
        "The motivation for model theoretic grammars is initially theoretical: the use of logic should support both a more precise formulation of grammars and a different perspective on the mathematical and computational properties of natural language.",
        "But eventually the question must also be addressed of how such grammars could be put to work.",
        "One obvious answer is to use a model generator.",
        "Given a logical formula 0, a model generator is a program which builds some of the models satisfying this formula.",
        "Thus for parsing, a model generator can be used to enumerate the (minimal) model(s), that is, the parse trees, satisfying the conjunction of the lexical categories selected on the basis of the input string plus any additional constraints which might be encoded in the grammar.",
        "And similarly for generation, a model generator can be used to enumerate the models satisfying the bag of lexical items selected by the lexical look up phase on the basis of the input semantics.",
        "How can we design model generators which work efficiently on natural language input i.e. on the type of information delivered by logic based grammars?",
        "(Duchier and Gardent, 1999) shows that constraint programming can be used to implement a model generator for tree logic (Back-ofen et al., 1995).",
        "Further, (Duchier and Thater, 1999) shows that this model generator can be used to parse with descriptions based grammars (Ram-bow et al., 1995; Kallmeyer, 1999) that is, on logic based grammars where lexical entries are descriptions of trees expressed in some tree logic.",
        "In this paper, we build on (Duchier and Thater, 1999) and show that modulo some minor modifications, the same model generator can be used to generate with description based grammars.",
        "We describe the workings of the algorithm and compare it with standard existing top-down and bottom-up generation algorithms.",
        "In specific, we argue that the change of perspective offered by the constraint-based, axiomatic approach to processing presents some interesting differences with the more traditional generative approach usually pursued in tactical generation and further, that the combination of this static view with a TAG-like grammar and a flat semantics results in a system which combines the positive aspects of both top-down and bottom-up generators.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 presents the grammars we are working with namely, Description Grammars (DG), Section 3 summarises the parsing model presented in (Duchier and Thater, 1999) and Section 4 shows that this model can be extended to generate with DGs.",
        "In Section 5, we compare our generator with top-down and bottom-up generators, Section 6 reports on a proof-of-concept implementation and Section 7 concludes with pointers for further research."

        "There is a range of grammar formalisms which depart from Tree Adjoining Grammar (TAG) by taking as basic building blocks tree descriptions rather than trees.",

        "Like all these frameworks, DG uses tree descriptions and thereby benefits first, from the extended domain of locality which makes TAG particularly suitable for generation (cf. (Joshi,1987)) and second, from the monotonicity which differentiates descriptions from trees with respect to ad-junction (cf. (Vijay-Shanker, 1992)).",
        "DG differs from DTG and TDG however in that it adopts an axiomatic rather than a generative view of grammar: whereas in DTG and TDG, derived trees are constructed through a sequence of rewriting steps, in DG derived trees are models satisfying a conjunction of elementary tree descriptions.",
        "Moreover, DG differs from Interaction Grammars in that it uses a flat rather than a Montague style recursive semantics thereby permitting a simple syntax/semantics interface (see below).",

        "The labels of the nodes abbreviate a feature structure, e.g. the label NP:x represents the feature structure { cat: np, idx:x}, while the anchor represents the phon value in the feature structure of the immediately dominating node variable.",
        "Node variables can have positive, negative or neutral polarity which are represented by black, white and gray nodes respectively.",
        "Intuitively, a negative node variable can be thought of as an open valency which must be filled exactly once by a positive node variable while a neutral node variable is a variable that may not be identified with any other node variable.",
        "Formally, polarities are used to define the class of saturated models.",
        "A saturated model M for a tree description r (written M [--S -r) is a model in which each negative node variable is identified with exactly one positive node variable, each positive node variable with exactly one negative node variable and neutral node variables are not identified with any other node variable.",
        "Intuitively, a saturated model for a given tree description is the smallest tree satisfying this description and such that all syntactic valencies are filled.",
        "In contrast, a free model M for r (written, M �_ – F -r) is a model such that every node in that model interprets exactly one node variable in -r. In DG, lexical tree descriptions must obey the following conventions.",
        "First, the polarities are used in a systematic way as follows.",
        "Roots of",
        "fragments (fully specified subtrees) are always positive; except for the anchor, all leaves of fragments are negative, and internal node variables are neutral.",
        "This guarantees that in a saturated model, tree fragments that belong to the denotation of distinct tree descriptions do not overlap.",
        "Second, we require that every lexical tree description has a single minimal free model, which essentially means that the lexical descriptions must be tree shaped.",
        "Semantic representation.",

        "A free variable is instantiated as follows: each free variable labels a syntactic node variable n and is unified with the label of any node variable identified with n. For the purpose of this paper, a simple semantic representation language is adopted which in particular, does not include “handles” i.e. labels on propositions.",

        "To circumvent this problem, we take advantage of the TAG extended domain of locality to avoid having such entries in the grammar.",

        "We have shown that modulo some minor changes, the constraint-based approach to parsing presented in (Duchier and Thater, 1999) could also be used for generation.",
        "Furthermore, we have argued that the resulting generator, when combined with a TAG-like grammar and a flat semantics, had some interesting features: it exhibits the lexicalist aspects of bottom-up approaches thereby avoiding the non-termination problems connected with top-down approaches; it includes enough Example CP Time The cat likes a fox 1 1.2s The little brown cat likes a yellow fox 2 1.8s The fierce little brown cat likes a yellow fox 2 5.5s The fierce little brown cat likes a tame yellow fox 3 8.0s",
        "top-down guidance from the TAG trees to avoid typical bottom-up shortcomings such as the requirement for grammar semantic monotonicity and by implementing an axiomatic view of grammar, it supports a near-deterministic treatment of intersective modifiers.",
        "It would be interesting to see whether other axiomatic constraint-based treatments of grammar could be use to support both parsing and generation.",
        "In particular, we intend to investigate whether the dependency grammar presented in (Duchier, 1999), once equipped with a semantics, could be used not only for parsing but also for generating.",
        "And similarly, whether the description based treatment of discourse parsing sketched in (Duchier and Gardent, 2001) could be used to generate discourse."
