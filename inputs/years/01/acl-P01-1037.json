        "(Q&A), as defined by the TREC competitions1, is the task of identifying in large collections of documents a text snippet where the answer to a natural language question lies.",
        "The answer is constrained to be found either in a short (50 bytes) or a long (250 bytes) text span.",
        "Frequently, keywords extracted from the natural language question are either within the text span or in its immediate vicinity, forming a text paragraph.",
        "Since such paragraphs must be identified throughout voluminous collections, automatic and autonomous Q&A systems incorporate an index of the collection as well as a paragraph retrieval mechanism.",
        "Recent results from the TREC evaluations ((Kwok et al., 2000) (Radev et al., 2000) (Allen",
        "workshops organized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), designed to advance the state-of-the-art in information retrieval (IR) et al., 2000)) show that Information Retrieval (IR) techniques alone are not sufficient for finding answers with high precision.",
        "In fact, more and more systems adopt architectures in which the semantics of the questions are captured prior to paragraph retrieval (e.g. (Gaizauskas and Humphreys, 2000) (Harabagiu et al., 2000)) and used later in extracting the answer (cf. (Abney et al., 2000)).",
        "When processing a natural language question two goals must be achieved.",
        "First we need to know what is the expected answer type; in other words, we need to know what we are looking for.",
        "Second, we need to know where to look for the answer, e.g. we must identify the question keywords to be used in the paragraph retrieval.",
        "The expected answer type is determined based on the question stem, e.g. who, where or how much and eventually one of the question concepts, when the stem is ambiguous (for example what), as described in (Harabagiu et al., 2000) (Radev et al., 2000) (Srihari and Li, 2000).",
        "However finding question keywords that retrieve all candidate answers cannot be achieved only by deriving some of the words used in the question.",
        "Frequently, question reformulations use different words, but imply the same answer.",
        "Moreover, many equivalent answers are phrased differently.",
        "In this paper we argue that the answer to complex natural language questions cannot be extracted with significant precision from large collections of texts unless several lexico-semantic feedback loops are allowed.",
        "In Section 2 we survey the related work whereas in Section 3 we describe the feedback loops that refine the search for correct answers.",

        "Mechanisms for open-domain textual Q&A were not discovered in the vacuum.",
        "The 90s witnessed a constant improvement of IR systems, determined by the availability of large collections of texts and the TREC evaluations.",
        "In parallel, Information Extraction (IE) techniques were developed under the TIPSTER Message Understanding Conference (MUC) competitions.",
        "Typically, IE systems identify information of interest in a text and map it to a predefined, target representation, known as template.",
        "Although simple combinations of IR and IE techniques are not practical solutions for open-domain textual Q&A because IE systems are based on domain-specific knowledge, their contribution to current open-domain Q&A methods is significant.",
        "For example, state-of-the-art Named Entity (NE) recognizers developed for IE systems were readily available to be incorporated in Q&A systems and helped recognize names of people, organizations, locations or dates.",
        "Assuming that it is very likely that the answer is a named entity, (Srihari and Li, 2000) describes a NE-supported Q&A system that functions quite well when the expected answer type is one of the categories covered by the NE recognizer.",
        "Unfortunately this system is not fully autonomous, as it depends on IR results provided by external search engines.",
        "Answer extractions based on NE recognizers were also developed in the Q&A presented in (Abney et al., 2000) (Radev et al., 2000) (Gaizauskas and Humphreys, 2000).",
        "As noted in (Voorhees and Tice, 2000), Q&A systems that did not include NE recognizers performed poorly in the TREC evaluations, especially in the short answer category.",
        "Some Q&A systems, like (Moldovan et al., 2000) relied both on NE recognizers and some empirical indicators.",
        "However, the answer does not always belong to a category covered by the NE recognizer.",
        "For such cases several approaches have been developed.",
        "The first one, presented in (Harabagiu et al., 2000), the answer type is derived from a large answer taxonomy.",
        "A different approach, based on statistical techniques was proposed in (Radev et al., 2000).",
        "(Cardie et al., 2000) presents a method of extracting answers as noun phrases in a novel way.",
        "Answer extraction based on grammatical information is also promoted by the system described in (Clarke et al., 2000).",
        "One of the few Q&A systems that takes into account morphological, lexical and semantic alternations of terms is described in (Ferret et al., 2000).",
        "To our knowledge, none of the current open-domain Q&A systems use any feedback loops to generate lexico-semantic alternations.",

        "Before initiating the search for the answer to a natural language question we take into account the fact that it is very likely that the same question or a very similar one has been posed to the system before, and thus those results can be used again.",
        "To find such cached questions, we measure the similarity to the previously processed questions and when a reformulation is identified, the system returns the corresponding cached correct answer, as illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "When no reformulations are detected, the search for answers is based on the conjecture that the eventual answer is likely to be found in a text paragraph that (a) contains the most representative question concepts and (b) includes a textual concept of the same category as the expected answer.",
        "Since the current retrieval technology does not model semantic knowledge, we break down this search into a boolean retrieval, based on some question keywords and a filtering mechanism, that retains only those passages containing the expected answer type.",
        "Both the question keywords and the expected answer type are identified by using the dependencies derived from the question parse.",
        "By implementing our own version of the publicly available Collins parser (Collins, 1996), we also learned a dependency model that enables the mapping of parse trees into sets of binary relations between the headword of each constituent and its sibling-words.",

        "For the parse of question Q210 the propagation is: S (pull) When the propagation is over, head-modifier relations are extracted, generating the following dependency structure, called question semantic form in (Harabagiu et al., 2000).",
        "COUNT dogspullsledIditarod In the structure above, COUNT represents the expected answer type, replacing the question stem how many.",
        "Few question stems are unambiguous (e.g. who, when).",
        "If the question stem is ambiguous, the expected answer type is determined by the concept from the question semantic form that modifies the stem.",
        "This concept is searched in an ANSWER TAXONOMY comprising several tops linked to a significant number of WordNet noun and verb hierarchies.",

        "PERSON, PRODUCT, NUMERICAL VALUE, COUNT, LOCATION).",
        "We encoded a total of 38 possible answer types.",
        "In addition, the question keywords used for paragraph retrieval are also derived from the question semantic form.",
        "The question keywords are organized in an ordered list which first enumerates the named entities and the question quotations, then the concepts that triggered the recognition of the expected answer type followed by all adjuncts, in a left-to-right order, and finally the question head.",
