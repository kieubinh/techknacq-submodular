        "In this paper we address the problem of extracting key pieces of information from voicemail messages, such as the identity and phone number of the caller.",
        "This task differs from the named entity task in that the information we are interested in is a subset of the named entities in the message, and consequently, the need to pick the correct subset makes the problem more difficult.",
        "Also, the callers identity may include information that is not typically associated with a named entity.",
        "In this work, we present three information extraction methods, one based on hand-crafted rules, one based on maximum entropy tagging, and one based on probabilistic transducer induction.",

        "In recent years, the task of automatically extracting information from data has grown in importance, as a result of an increase in the number of publicly available archives and a realization of the commercial value of the available data.",
        "One aspect of information extraction (IE) is the retrieval of documents.",
        "Another aspect is that of identifying words from a stream of text that belong in predefined categories, for instance, named entities such as proper names, organizations, or numerics.",
        "Though most of the earlier IE work was done in the context of text sources, recently a great deal of work has also focused on extracting information from speech sources.",
        "Examples of this are the Spoken Document Retrieval (SDR) task (NIST, 1999), named entity (NE) extraction (DARPA, 1999; Miller et al., 2000; Kim and Woodland, 2000).",
        "The SDR task focused on Broadcast News and the NE task focused on both Broadcast News and telephone conversations.",
        "In this paper, we focus on a source of conversational speech data, voicemail, that is found in relatively large volumes in the real-world, and that could benefit greatly from the use of IE techniques.",
        "The goal here is to query ones personal voicemail for items of information, without having to listen to the entire message.",
        "For instance, who called today?, or what is Xs phone number?.",
        "Because of the importance of these key pieces of information, in this paper, we focus precisely on extracting the identity and the phone number of the caller.",
        "Other attempts at summarizing voicemail have been made in the past (Koumpis and Renals, 2000), however the goal there was to compress a voicemail message by summarizing it, and not to extract the answers to specific questions.",
        "An interesting aspect of this research is that because a transcription of the voicemail is not available, speech recognition algorithms have to be used to convert the speech to text and the subsequent IE algorithms must operate on the transcription.",
        "One of the complications that we have to deal with is the fact that the state-of-the-art accuracy of speech recognition algorithms on this type of data 1 is only in the neighborhood of 60- 70% (Huang et al., 2000).",
        "The task that is most similar to our work is named entity extraction from speech data (DARPA, 1999).",
        "Although the goal of the named entity task is similar - to identify the names of persons, locations, organizations, and temporal and numeric expressions - our task is different, and in some ways more difficult.",
        "There are two main reasons for this: first, caller and number information constitute a small fraction of all named entities.",
        "Not all person-names belong to callers, and not all digit strings specify phone-numbers.",
        "In this sense, the algorithms we use must be more precise than those for named entity detection.",
        "Second, the callers identity may include information that is not typically found in a named entity, for example, Joe on the third floor, rather than simply Joe.",
        "We discuss our definitions of caller and number in Section 2.",
        "To extract caller information from transcribed speech text, we implemented three different systems, spanning both statistical and non-statistical approaches.",
        "We evaluate these systems on manual voicemail transcriptions as well as the output of a speech recognizer.",
        "The first system is a simple rule-based system that uses trigger phrases to identify the information-bearing words.",
        "The second system is a maximum entropy model that tags the words in the transcription as belonging to one of the categories, callers identity, phone number or other.",
        "The third system is a novel technique based on automatic stochastic-transducer induction.",
        "It aims to learn rules automatically from training data instead of requiring hand-crafted rules from experts.",
        "Although the results with this system are not yet as good as the other two, we consider it highly interesting because the technology is new and still open to significant advances.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the database we are using; Section 3 contains a description of the baseline system; Section 4 describes the maximum entropy model and the associated features; Section 1 The large word error rate is due to the fact that the speech is spontaneous, and characterized by poor grammar, false starts, pauses, hesitations, etc.",
        "While this does not pose a problem for a human listener, it causes significant problems for speech recognition algorithms.",
        "5 discusses the transducer induction technique; Section 6 contains our experimental results and Section 7 concludes our discussions."

        "Our work focuses on a database of voicemail messages gathered at IBM, and made publicly available through the LDC.",
        "This database and related speech recognition work is described fully by (Huang et al., 2000).",
        "We worked with approximately 5, 000 messages, which we divided into 3, 700 messages for training, 500 for development test set, and 800 for evaluation test set.",
        "The messages were manually transcribed 2, and then a human tagger identified the portions of each message that specified the caller and any return numbers that were left.",
        "In this work, we take a broad view of what constitutes a caller or number.",
        "The caller was defined to be the consecutive sequence of words that best answered the question who called?.",
        "The definition of a number we used is a sequence of consecutive words that enables a return call to be placed.",
        "Thus, for example, a caller might be Angelafrom P.C.",
        "Labs, or Peggy Cole Reed Ballas secretary.",
        "Similarly, a number may not be a digit string, for example: tieline eight oh five six, or pager one three five.",

        "In voicemail messages, people often identify themselves and give their phone numbers in highly stereotyped ways.",
        "So for example, someone might say, Hi Joe its Harry... or Give me a call back at extension one one eight four.",
        "Our baseline system takes advantage of this fact by enumerating a set of transduction rules - in the form of aflex program - that transduce out the key information in a call.",
        "The baseline system is built around the notion of trigger phrases.",
        "These hand-crafted phases are patterns that are used in the flex program to recognize callers identity and phone numbers.",
        "2 The manual transcription has a 3% word error rate Examples of trigger phrases are Hi this is, and Give me a call back at.",
        "In order to identify names and phone numbers as generally as possible, our baseline system has defined classes for person-names and numbers.",
        "In addition to trigger phrases, trigger suffixes proved to be useful for identifying phone numbers.",
        "For example, the phrase thanks bye frequently occurs immediately after the callers phone number.",
        "In general, a random sequence of digits cannot be labeled as a phone number; but, a sequence of digits followed by thanks bye is almost certainly the callers phone number.",
        "So when the flex program matches a sequence of digits, it stores it; then it tries to match a trigger suffix.",
        "If this is successful, the digit string is recognized a phone number string.",
        "Otherwise the digit string is ignored.",
        "Our baseline system has about 200 rules.",
        "Its creation was aided by an automatically generated list of short, commonly occurring phrases that were then manually scanned, generalized, and added to the flex program.",
        "It is the simplest of the systems presented, and achieves a good performance level, but suffers from the fact that a skilled person is required to identify the rules."
