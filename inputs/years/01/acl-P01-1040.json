        "It is widely recognized that the proliferation of annotation schemes runs counter to the need to reuse language resources, and that standards for linguistic annotation are becoming increasingly mandatory.",
        "In particular, there is a need for a general framework for linguistic annotation that is flexible and extensible enough to accommodate different annotation types and different theoretical and practical approaches, while at the same time enabling their representation in a pivotformat that can serveerve as the basis for comparative evaluation of parser output, such as PARSEVAL (Harrison, et al., 1991), as well as the development of reusable editing and processing tools.",
        "To answer this need, we have developed a representation framework comprised of an abstract model for a variety of different annotation types (e.g., morpho-syntactic tagging, syntactic annotation, co-reference annotation, etc.",
        "), which can be instantiated in different ways depending on the annotators s approach and goals.",
        "We have implemented both the abstract model and various instantiations using XML schemas (Thompson, et al., 2000), the Resource Definition Framework (RDF) (Lassila and Swick, 2000) and RDF schemas (Brickley and Guha, 2000), which enable description and definition of abstract data models together with means to interpret, via the model, information encoded according to different conventions.",
        "The results have been incorporated into XCES (Ide, et al., 2000a), part of the EAGLES Guidelines developed by the Expert Advisory Group on Language Engineering Standards (EAGLES)1.",
        "The XCES provides a ready-made, standard encoding format together with a data architecture designed specifically for linguistically annotated corpora.",
        "In this paper we provide an overview of our representation framework and demonstrate its applicability to syntactic annotation.",
        "The framework has been applied to the representation of terminology (Terminological Markup Framework2, ISO project n.16642) and computational lexicons (Ide, et al., 2000b), thus demonstrating its general applicability for a variety of linguistic annotation types.",

        "• Category information: labeling of components based on syntactic category (e.g., noun phrase, prepositional phrase), syntactic role (subject, object), etc.",
        "; • Dependency information: relations among",
        "components, including constituency relations, grammatical role relations, etc.",
        "For example, the annotation in Figure 1, drawn from the Penn Treebank II3 (hereafter, PTB), uses LISP-like list structures to specify constituency relations and provide syntactic category labels for constituents.",
        "Some grammatical roles (subject, object, etc.)",
        "are implicit in the structure of the encoding: for instance, the nesting of the NP the front roomm[] implies that the NP is the object of the prepositional phrase, whereas the position of the NP himfollowing and aat the same level as the the VP node implies that this NP is the grammatical object.",
        "Additional processing (or human intervention) is required to render these relations explicit.",

        "Relationsons among non-contiguous elements demand a special numbering mechanism to enable cross-reference, as in the specification of the NP-SBJ of the embedded sentence by reference to the earlier NP-SBJ-1 node.",
        "Although they differ in the labels and in some cases the function of various nodes in the tree, most annotation schemes provide a similar constituency-based representation of relations among syntactic components (see Abeille, forthcoming, for a comprehensive survey of syntactic annotation schemes).",

        "The goal in the XCES is to provide a framework for annotation that is theory and tagset independent.",
        "We accomplish this by treating the description of any specific syntactic annotation scheme as a process involving several knowledge sources that interact at various levels.",
        "The process allows one to specify, on the one hand, the informational properties of the scheme (i.e., its capacity to represent a given piece of information), and, on the other, the way the scheme can be instantiated (e.g., as an XML document).",
        "Figure 3 shows the overall architecture of the XCES framework for syntactic annotation.",
        "4 So-called hybrid systems(e.g., Basili, et al., 199; Grefenstette, 1999) combine constituency analysis and functional dependencies, usually producing a shallow constituent parse that brackets major phrase types and identifying the dependencies between heads of constituents.",
        "Two knowledge sources are used define the abstract model: Data Category Registry: Within the framework of the XCES we are establishing an inventory of data categories for syntactic annotation, initially based on the EAGLES Recommendations for Syntactic Annotation of Corpora (Leech et al., 1996).",
        "Data categories are defined using RDF descriptions that formalize the properties associated with each.",
        "The categories are organized in a hierarchy, from general to specific.",
        "For example, a general dependent relation may be defined, which may have one of the possible values argument or modifier; argument in turn may have the possible values subject, object, or complement; etc.5 Note that RDF descriptions function much like class definitions in an object-oriented programming language: they provide, effectively, templates that describe how objects may be instantiated, but do not constitute the objects themselves.",
        "Thus, in a document containing an actual annotation, several objects with the type argument may be instantiated, each with a different value.",
        "The RDF schema ensures that each instantiation of argument is recognized as a subclass of dependent and inherits the appropriate properties.",

        "The structural skeleton for syntactic annotations is described below in section 12.1.",
        "Two other knowledge sources are used to define a project-specific format for the annotation scheme, in terms of its expressive power and its instantiation in XML: Data Category Specification (DCS): describes the set of data categories that can be used within a given annotation scheme, again using RDF schema.",
        "The DCS defines constraints on each category, including restrictions on the values they can take (e.g., \"text with markup\"; a \"picklist\" for grammatical gender, or any of the data types defined for XML), restrictions on where a particular data category can appear (level in the structural hierarchy).",
        "The DCS may include a subset of categories from the DCR together with application-specific categories additionally defined in the DCS.",
        "The DCS also indicates a level of granularity based on the DCR hierarchy.",

        "The specifications may include:",
        "• Data category instantiation styles: Data categories may be realized in a project-specific scheme in any of a variety of formats.",
        "For example, if there exists a data category NounPhrase, this may be realized as an <NounPhrase> element (possibly containing additional elements), a typed element (e.g. <cat type=NounPhrase>), tag content (e.g., <cat>NounPhrase</cat>), etc.",
        "• Data category vocabulary styles: Project-specific formats can utilize names different from those in the Data Category Registry; for instance, a DCR specification for NounPhrase can be expressed as NPor or SN( syntagme nominal) in the project-specific format, if desired.",
        "• Expansion structures: A project-specific format may alter the structure of the annotation as expressed using the structural skeleton.",
        "For example, it may be desirable for processing or other reasons to create two sub-nodes under a given <struct> node, one to group features and one to group relations.",
        "The combination of the structural skeleton and the DCS defines a virtual annotation markup language (AML).",
        "Any information structure that corresponds to a virtual AML has a canonical expression as an XML document; therefore, the interoperability of different AMLs is dependent only on their compatibility at the virtual level.",
        "As such, virtual AML is the hub of the annotation framework: it defines a lingua franca for syntactic annotations that can be used to compare and merge annotations, as well as enable design of generic tools for visualization, editing, extraction, etc.",
        "The combination of a virtual AML with the Dialect Specification provides the information necessary to automatically generate a concrete AML representation of the annotation scheme, which conforms to the project-specific format provided in the Dialect Specification.",

        "For syntactic annotation, we can identify a general, underlying model that informs current practice: specification of constituency relations (with some set of application-specific names and properties) among syntactic or grammatical components (also with a set of application-specific names and properties), whether this is modeled with a tree structure or the relations are given explicitly.",
        "Because of the common use of trees in syntactic annotation, together with the natural tree-structure of markup in XML documents, we provide a structural skeleton for syntactic markup following this model.",

        "The xlink attribute uses the XML Path Language (XPath) (Clark & DeRose, 1999) to specify the location of the relevant data in the primary document.",
        "• ref : refers to a node defined elsewhere, used instead of xlink.",
        "• rel˚: specifies a type of relation (e.g., subj)j 11) • head : specifies the node corresponding to the head of the relation • dependent : specifies the node corresponding to the dependent of the relation • introducer : specifies the node corresponding to an introducing word or phrase • initial : gives a thematic or semantic role of a component, e.g., subjfor the object of aof a by-phrase in a passive sentence.",
        "The hierarchy of <struct> elements corresponds to the nodes in a phrase structure analysis; each <struct> element is typed accordingly.",
        "The grammar underlying the annotation therefore specifies constraints on embedding that can be instantiated in an XML schema, which can then be used to prevent or detect tree structures that do not conform to the grammar.",
        "Conversely, the grammar rules implicit in annotated treebanks, which are typically not annotated according to a formal grammar, can be easily extracted from the abstract structural encoding.",
        "The skeleton also includes a <feat> (feature) element, which can be used to provide additional information (e.g., gender, number) that is attached to the node in the tree represented by the enclosing <struct> element.",
