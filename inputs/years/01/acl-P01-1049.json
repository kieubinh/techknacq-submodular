        "More formally, given a set of n topics together with a collection of documents, the task is to determine for each document the probability that one or more topics is present in the document.",
        "Topic spotting may be used to automatically assign subject codes to newswire stories, filter electronic emails and online news, and pre-screen document in information retrieval and information extraction applications.",
        "Topic spotting, and its related problem of text categorization, has been a hot area of research for over a decade.",
        "A large number of techniques have been proposed to tackle the problem, including: regression model, nearest neighbor classification, Bayesian probabilistic model, decision tree, inductive rule learning, neural network, on-line learning, and, support vector machine (Yang & Liu, 1999; Tzeras & Hartmann, 1993).",
        "Most of these methods are word-based and consider only the relationships between the features and topics, but not the relationships among features.",
        "It is well known that the performance of the word-based methods is greatly affected by the lack of linguistic understanding, and, in particular, the inability to handle synonymy and polysemy.",
        "A number of simple linguistic techniques has been developed to alleviate such problems, ranging from the use of stemming, lexical chain and thesaurus (Jing & Tzoukermann, 1999; Green, 1999), to word-sense disambiguation (Chen & Chang, 1998; Leacock et al., 1998; Ide & Veronis, 1998) and context (Cohen & Singer, 1999; Jing & Tzoukermann, 1999).",
        "The connectionist approach has been widely used to extract knowledge in a wide range of information processing tasks including natural language processing, information retrieval and image understanding (Anderson, 1983; Lee & Dubin, 1999; Sarkas & Boyer, 1995; Wang & Terman, 1995).",
        "Because the connectionist approach closely resembling human cognition process in text processing, it seems natural to adopt this approach, in conjunction with linguistic analysis, to perform topic spotting.",
        "However, there have been few attempts in this direction.",
        "This is mainly because of difficulties in automatically constructing the semantic networks for the topics.",
        "In this paper, we propose an approach to automatically build a semantic perceptron net (SPN) for topic spotting.",
        "The SPN is a connectionist model with hierarchical structure.",
        "It uses a combination of context, co-occurrence statistics and thesaurus to group the distributed but semantically related words to form basic semantic nodes.",

        "One subtopic may be about water supply, while the other is about water and environment protection, and so on.",
        "These subtopics may have some common attributes, such as the word water, and each subtopic may be further subdivided into finer subtopics, etc.",
        "The above points to a hierarchical topic representation, which corresponds to the hierarchy of document classes (Figure 1).",
        "In the model, the contents of the topics and subtopics (shown as circles) are modeled by a set of attributes, which is simply a group of semantically related words (shown as solid elliptical shaped bags or rectangles).",
        "The context (shown as dotted ellipses) is used to identify the exact meaning of a word.",
        "Hofmann (1998) presented a word occurrence based cluster abstraction model that learns a hierarchical topic representation.",
        "However, the method is not suitable when the set of training examples is sparse.",
        "To avoid the problem of automatically constructing the hierarchical model, Tong et al. (1987) required the users to supply the model, which is used as queries in the system.",
        "Most automated methods, however, avoided this problem by modeling the topic as a feature vector, rule set, or instantiated example (Yang & Liu, 1999).",
        "These methods typically treat each word feature as independent, and seldom consider linguistic factors such as the context or lexical chain relations among the features.",
        "As a result, these methods are not good at discriminating a large number of documents that typically lie near the boundary of two or more topics.",
        "In order to facilitate the automatic extraction and modeling of the semantic aspects of topics, we adopt a compromise approach.",
        "We model the topic as a tree of concepts as shown in Figure 1.",
        "However, we consider only one level of hierarchy built from groups of semantically related words.",
        "These semantic groups may not correspond strictly to subtopics within the domain.",

        "In Figure 2, node a contains the common feature set of the topic; while nodes b, c and d are related to subtopics on water supply, rainfall, and water and environment protection respectively.",
