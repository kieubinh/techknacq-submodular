        "Over the last decade, much progress has been made in the fields of example-based (EBMT) and statistical machine translation (SMT).",
        "EBMT systems work by modifying existing, human produced translation instances, which are stored in a translation memory (TMEM).",
        "Many methods have been proposed for storing translation pairs in a TMEM, finding translation examples that are relevant for translating unseen sentences, and modifying and integrating translation fragments to produce correct outputs.",
        "Sato (1992), for example, stores complete parse trees in the TMEM and selects and generates new translations by performing similarity matchings on these trees.",
        "Veale and Way (1997) store complete sentences; new translations are generated by modifying the TMEM translation that is most similar to the input sentence.",
        "Others store phrases; new translations are produced by optimally partitioning the input into phrases that match examples from the TMEM (Maruyana and Watanabe, 1992), or by finding all partial matches and then choosing the best possible translation using a multi-engine translation system (Brown, 1999).",
        "With a few exceptions (Wu and Wong, 1998), most SMT systems are couched in the noisy channel framework (see Figure 1).",
        "In this framework, the source language, lets say English, is assumed to be generated by a noisy probabilistic source.1 Most of the current statistical MT systems treat this source as a sequence of words (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "(Alternative approaches exist, in which the source is taken to be, for example, a sequence of aligned templates/phrases (Wang, 1998; Och et al., 1999) or a syntactic tree (Yamada and Knight, 2001).)",
        "In the noisy-channel framework, a monolingual corpus is used to derive a statistical language model that assigns a probability to a sequence of words or phrases, thus enabling one to distinguish between sequences of words that are grammatically correct and sequences that are not.",
        "A sentence-aligned parallel corpus is then used in order to build a probabilistic translation model",
        "and target languages according to the jargon specific to the noisy-channel framework.",

Once the parameters of the language and translation models are estimated using traditional maximum likelihood and EM techniques (Demp-ster et al., 1977), one can take as input any string in the target language f, and find the source e of highest probability that could have generated the target, a process called decoding (see Figure 1).",
        "It is clear that EBMT and SMT systems have different strengths and weaknesses.",
        "If a sentence to be translated or a very similar one can be found in the TMEM, an EBMT system has a good chance of producing a good translation.",
        "However, if the sentence to be translated has no close matches in the TMEM, then an EBMT system is less likely to succeed.",
        "In contrast, an SMT system may be able to produce perfect translations even when the sentence given as input does not resemble any sentence from the training corpus.",
        "However, such a system may be unable to generate translations that use idioms and phrases that reflect long-distance dependencies and contexts, which are usually not captured by current translation models.",

        "We suspect that using manually produced TMEMs can only increase the performance as such TMEMs undergo periodic checks for quality assurance.",
        "The work that comes closest to using a statistical TMEM similar to the one we propose here is that of Vogel and Ney (2000), who automatically derive from a parallel corpus a hierarchical TMEM.",

        "The transducers are automatically constructed: they reflect common patterns of usage at levels of abstractions that are higher than the words.",

        "From a theoretical perspective, it appears though that the two approaches are complementary: Vogel and Ney (2000) identify abstract patterns of usage and then use them during translation.",
        "This may address the data sparseness problem that is characteristic to any statistical modeling effort and produce better translation parameters.",
        "In contrast, our approach attempts to stir the statistical decoding process into directions that are difficult to reach when one relies only on the parameters of a particular translation model.",
        "For example, the two phrases il est mort and he kicked the bucket may appear only in one sentence in an arbitrary large corpus.",
        "The parameters learned from the entire corpus will very likely associate very low probability to the words kicked and bucket being translated into est and mort.",

        "However, if the two phrases are stored in the TMEM, producing such a translation becomes feasible.",
        "If optimal decoding algorithms capable of searching exhaustively the space of all possible translations existed, using TMEMs in the style presented in this paper would never improve the performance of a system.",
        "Our approach works because it biases the decoder to search in subspaces that are likely to yield translations of high probability, subspaces which otherwise may not be explored.",
        "The bias introduced by TMEMs is a practical alternative to finding optimal translations, which is NP-complete (Knight, 1999).",
        "It is clear that one of the main strengths of the TMEM is its ability to encode contextual, long-distance dependencies that are incongruous with the parameters learned by current context poor, reductionist channel models.",
        "Unfortunately, the criterion used by the decoder in order to choose between a translation produced starting from a gloss and one produced starting from a TMEM is biased in favor of the gloss-based translation.",
