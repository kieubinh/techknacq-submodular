        "We believe that this is the largest, most expensive, and perhaps most rigorous evaluation ever done of an NLG system; it was also a disappointing evaluation, as it showed that STOP letters in general were no more effective than control letters.",
        "The detailed results of the STOP evaluation have been presented elsewhere, in the medical literature (Lennox et al., 2001).",
        "The purpose of this paper is to discuss the clinical trial from an NLG evaluation perspective, in order to help future researchers decide when a clinical trial (or similar large-scale task effectiveness evaluation) would be an appropriate way to evaluate their systems."

        "Evaluation is becoming increasingly important in NLG, as in other areas of NLP; see Mellish and Dale (1998) for a summary of NLG evaluation.",
        "As Mellish and Dale point out, we can evaluate the effectiveness of underlying theories, general properties of NLG systems and texts (such as computational speed, or text understandability), or the effectiveness of the generated texts in an actual task or application context.",
        "Theory evaluations are typically done by comparing predictions of a theory to what is observed in a human-authored corpus (for example, (Yeh and Mellish, 1997)).",
        "Evaluations of text properties are typically done by asking human judges to rate the quality of generated texts (for example, (Lester and Porter, 1997)); sometimes human-authored texts are included in the rated set (without judges knowing which texts are human-authored) to provide a baseline.",
        "Task evaluations (for example, (Young, 1999)) are typically done by showing human subjects different texts, and measuring differences in an outcome variable, such as success in performing a task.",
        "However, despite the above work, we are not aware of any previous evaluation which has compared the effectiveness of NLG texts at meeting a communicative goal against the effectiveness of non-NLG control texts.",
        "Youngs task evaluation, which may be the most rigorous previous task evaluation of an NLG system, compared the effectiveness of texts generated by different NLG algorithms, while the IDAS task evaluation (Levine and Mellish, 1995) did not include a control text of any kind.",
        "Coch (1996) and Lester and Porter (1997) have compared NLG texts to human-written and (in Cochs case) mail-merge texts, but the comparisons were judgements by human domain experts, they did not measure the actual impact of the texts on users.",
        "Carenini and Moore (2000) probably came closest to a controlled evaluation of NLG vs non-NLG alternatives, because they compared the impact of NLG argumentative texts to a no-text control (where users had access to the underlying data but were not given any texts arguing for a particular choice).",
        "Task evaluations that compare the effectiveness of texts from NLG systems to the effectiveness of non-NLG alternatives (mail-merge texts, human-written texts, or fixed texts) are expensive and difficult to organise, but we believe they are essential to the progress of NLG, both scientifically and technologically.",
        "In this paper we describe such an evaluation which we performed on the STOP system.",
        "The evaluation was indeed expensive and time-consuming, and ultimately was disappointing in that it suggested STOP texts were no more effective than control texts, but we believe that this kind of evaluation was essential to the project.",
        "We hope that our description of the STOP clinical trial and what we learned from it will encourage other researchers to consider performing effectiveness evaluations of NLG systems against non-NLG alternatives."

        "The STOP system has been described elsewhere (Reiter et al., 1999).",
        "Very briefly, the system took as input a 4-page questionnaire about smoking history, habits, intentions, and so forth, and from this produced a small (4 pages of A5) personalised smoking cessation letter.",
        "All interactions with the smoker were paper-based; he or she filled out a paper questionnaire which was scanned into the computer system, and the resultant letter was printed out and posted back to the smoker.",
        "The first page of a typical questionnaire is shown in Figure 1, and part of the letter produced from this questionnaire is shown in Figure 2.1 We wish to emphasise that producing personalised health information letters is not a new idea, many previous researchers have worked in this area; see Lennox et al. (2001) for a comparison of STOP to previous work in this area.",
        "The STOP clinical trial, which is the focus of this paper, was organised as follows.",
        "We contacted 7427 smokers, and asked them to participate in the trial.",
        "2553 smokers agreed to participate, and filled out our smoking questionnaire.",
        "These smokers were randomly split among three groups: Tailored.",
        "These smokers received the letter generated by STOP from their questionnaire.",
        "Non-tailored.",
        "These smokers received a fixed (non-tailored) letter.",
        "The non-tailored letter was essentially the letter produced by STOP from a blank questionnaire, with some manual post-editing and tidying up.",
        "In other words, during the course of developing STOP we created a set of default rules for handling incomplete or inconsistent questionnaires; the non-tailored letter was produced by activating these default rules without any smoker data.",
        "Part of the non-tailored letter is shown in Figure 3.",
        "No-letter.",
        "These smokers just received a letter thanking them for participating in our study.",
        "After six months we sent a followup questionnaire asking participants if they had quit, and also other questions (for example, if they were intending to try to quit even if they had not actually done so yet).",
        "Smokers could also make free-text comments about the letter they received.",
        "2045 smokers responded to the followup questionnaire, of which 154 claimed to have quit.",
        "Because people do not always tell the truth about their smoking habits, we asked these 154 people to give saliva samples, which were tested in a lab for nicotine residues.",
        "99 smokers agreed to give such samples, and 89 of these were confirmed as non-smokers."

        "The STOP clinical trial took 20 months to run (of which the first 4 months overlapped software development), and cost about UK75,000 (US$110,000).",
        "We believe the STOP clinical trial was the longest and costliest evaluation ever done of an NLG system.",
        "The length and cost of the clinical trial were primarily due to the large numbers of subjects.",
        "Whereas Levine and Mellish (1995), Young (1999), and Carenini and Moore (2000) included 10, 26, and 30 subjects (respectively) in their task effectiveness evaluations, we had 2553 subjects in our clinical trial.",
        "The cost of the trial was partially stationary and postage (we sent out over 10000 mailings to smokers, each of which included a reply-paid envelope), but mostly staff costs to set up the trial, perform the mailings, process and analyse the returns from smokers, and handle various glitches in the trial.",
        "Another way of looking at the trial was that we spent about UK30 (US$45) per subject (including staff time as well as materials).",
        "Perhaps the trial could have been done a bit more cheaply, but any experiment involving 2553 subjects is bound to be expensive and time-consuming.",
        "The reason the trial needed to be so large was that we were measuring a binary outcome variable (laboratory-verified smoking cessation) with a very low positive rate (since smoking is a very difficult habit to quit).",
        "Young, in contrast, measured numerical variables (such as the number of mistakes made by a user when following textual instructions) with substantial standard deviations.",
        "Another complication was that we wanted to use a representative sample of smokers in our trial, which meant that we could not (as Young and Levine and Mellish did) just recruit students and acquaintances.",
        "Instead, we contacted a representative set of GPs in our area, and asked them for a list of smokers from their patient record systems.",

        "After adjusting for this fact, cessation rates were still higher in the non-tailored group than in the tailored group, but this difference was not statistically significant.",
        "We can see this if we look just at cessation rates in light smokers (few heavy smokers from any category managed to stop smoking): .4.3% (25 out of 563) of the light smokers in the tailored group stopped smoking .4.9% (31 out of 597) of the light smokers in the non-tailored group stopped smoking .2.7% (16 out of 582) of the light smokers in the no-letter group stopped smoking The overall conclusion is therefore that recipients of the non-tailored letters were more likely to stop than people who got no letter2 (p=.047 overall unadjusted; p=.069 overall after adjusting for differences between groups, such as heavy/light smoker split; p=.049 for light smokers).",
        "However, there was no evidence that the tailored letters were any better than the non-tailored ones in terms of increasing cessation rates.",
        "2 Note that while a 1% or 2% increase in cessation rates is small, it is medically useful if it can be achieved cheaply.",
        "See Law and Tang (1995) for a discussion of success rates and cost-effectiveness of various smoking-cessation techniques, and Lennox et al. (2001) for an analysis that shows that sending letters is very cost-effective compared to most other smoking-cessation techniques.",
        "There is some very weak evidence that the tailored letter may have been better than the non-tailored letter among smokers for whom quitting was especially difficult.",
        "For example, among discouraged smokers (people who wanted to quit but were not intending to quit, usually because they didnt think they could quit), cessation rates were 60% higher among recipients of tailored letters than recipients of non-tailored letters, but the numbers were too small to reach statistical significance, since (as with heavy smokers) very few such people managed to stop smoking.",
        "Furthermore, among heavy smokers, recipients of the tailored letter were 50% more likely than recipients of the non-tailored letters to show increased intention to quit (for example, say in their initial questionnaire that they did not intend to quit, but say in the followup questionnaire that they did intend to quit) (p=.059).",
        "It would be nice to test the hypothesis that tailored letters were effective among discouraged smokers or heavy smokers by running another clinical trial, but such a trial would need to be even bigger and more expensive than the STOP trial, in order to have enough validated quitters from these categories to make it possible to draw statistically significant conclusions.",
        "Recipients of the tailored letters were more likely than recipients of non-tailored letters to remember receiving the letter (67% vs 44%, significant at p<.01), to have kept the letter (30% vs 19%, significant at p<.01), and to make a free-text comment about the letter (20% vs 12%, significant at p<.01).",
        "However, there was no statistically significant difference in perceptions of the usefulness and relevance of the tailored and non-tailored letters.",

        "For example, we could argue for (1) on the basis that brief discussions about smoking with a doctor have about a 2% success rate (Law and Tang, 1995), and this may be an upper limit for the effectiveness of a brief letter from a doctor.",
        "If so, then letters cannot do much better that the 1.8% increase in cessation rates produced by the STOP non-tailored letter.",
        "Or we could argue for (2) by noting that when we asked smokers to comment on STOP letters in a small pilot study, many of their comments were very specific to their particular circumstances For example, a single mother mentioned that a previous attempt to stop failed because of stress caused by dealing with a childs tantrum, and an older woman discussed the various stop-smoking techniques she had tried in the past and how they failed.",
        "Perhaps tailoring according to such specific circumstances would add value to letters; but such tailoring would require much more information than can be obtained from a 4-page multiple-choice questionnaire.",

        "While many speech recognition and natural-language understanding applications can be tested by comparing their output to a human-produced gold standard (for example, speech recogniser output can be compared to a human transcription of a speech signal), this to date has been harder to do in NLG, especially in applications such as STOP where there are no human experts (Reiter et al., 2000) (there are many experts on personalised oral communication with smokers, but none on personalised written communication, because no one currently writes personalised letters to smokers).",
        "In such applications, the only way to test hypotheses about the effects of systems on human users may be to run a controlled task/effectiveness evaluation.",
        "In other words, theres probably no point in conducting a large-scale task/effectiveness evaluation of an NLG system if youre interested in formulating hypotheses instead of testing them, or if youre interested in theoretical instead of applied hypotheses.",
        "But if you want to test an applied hypothesis about the effect of an NLG system on human users, the most rigorous way of doing this is to conduct an experiment where you show some users your NLG texts and other users control texts, and measure the degree to which the desired effect is achieved in both groups.",
        "Large-scale evaluation exercises also have the benefit of forcing researchers and developers to make systems robust, and to face up to the messiness of real data, such as awkward boundary cases and noisy data.",
        "Indeed we suspect that STOP is one of the most robust non-commercial NLG systems ever built, because the clinical trial forced us to think about issues such as what we should do with inconsistent or improperly scanned questionnaires, or what we should say to unusual smokers.",
        "In conclusion, large-scale task/effectiveness evaluations are expensive, time-consuming, and a considerable hassle.",
        "But they are also an essential part of the scientific and technological process, especially in testing applied hypotheses about the effectiveness of systems on real users.",
        "We hope that more such evaluations are performed in the future, and that their results are reported whether they are positive or negative."
