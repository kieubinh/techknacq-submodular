        "A statistical translation model (TM) is a mathematical model in which the process of human-language translation is statistically modeled.",
        "Model parameters are automatically estimated using a corpus of translation pairs.",
        "TMs have been used for statistical machine translation (Berger et al., 1996), word alignment of a translation corpus (Melamed, 2000), multilingual document retrieval (Franz et al., 1999), automatic dictionary construction (Resnik and Melamed, 1997), and data preparation for word sense disambiguation programs (Brown et al., 1991).",
        "Developing a better TM is a fundamental issue for those applications.",
        "Researchers at IBM first described such a statistical TM in (Brown et al., 1988).",
        "Their models are based on a string-to-string noisy channel model.",
        "The channel converts a sequence of words in one language (such as English) into another (such as French).",
        "The channel operations are movements, duplications, and translations, applied to each word independently.",
        "The movement is conditioned only on word classes and positions in the string, and the duplication and translation are conditioned only on the word identity.",
        "Mathematical details are fully described in (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "One criticism of the IBM-style TM is that it does not model structural or syntactic aspects of the language.",
        "The TM was only demonstrated for a structurally similar language pair (English and French).",
        "It has been suspected that a language pair with very different word order such as English and Japanese would not be modeled well by these TMs.",
        "To incorporate structural aspects of the language, our channel model accepts a parse tree as an input, i.e., the input sentence is preprocessed by a syntactic parser.",
        "The channel performs operations on each node of the parse tree.",
        "The operations are reordering child nodes, inserting extra words at each node, and translating leaf words.",
        "Figure 1 shows the overview of the operations of our model.",
        "Note that the output of our model is a string, not a parse tree.",
        "Therefore, parsing is only needed on the channel input side.",
        "The reorder operation is intended to model translation between languages with different word orders, such as SVO-languages (English or Chinese) and SOV-languages (Japanese or Turkish).",
        "The word-insertion operation is intended to capture linguistic differences in specifying syntactic cases.",
        "E.g., English and French use structural position to specify case, while Japanese and Korean use case-marker particles.",
        "Wang (1998) enhanced the IBM models by introducing phrases, and Och et al.",
        "(1999) used templates to capture phrasal sequences in a sentence.",
        "Both also tried to incorporate structural aspects of the language, however, neither handles",
        "nested structures.",
        "Wu (1997) and Alshawi et al.",
        "(2000) showed statistical models based on syntactic structure.",
        "The way we handle syntactic parse trees is inspired by their work, although their approach is not to model the translation process, but to formalize a model that generates two languages at the same time.",
        "Our channel operations are also similar to the mechanism in Twisted Pair Grammar (Jones and Havrilla, 1998) used in their knowledge-based system.",
        "Following (Brown et al., 1993) and the other literature in TM, this paper only focuses the details of TM.",
        "Applications of our TM, such as machine translation or dictionary construction, will be described in a separate paper.",
        "Section 2 describes our model in detail.",
        "Section 3 shows experimental results.",
        "We conclude with Section 4, followed by an Appendix describing the training algorithm in more detail."
