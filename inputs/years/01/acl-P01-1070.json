        "The growth in popularity of the Internet highlights the importance of developing machinery for generating responses to queries targeted at large unstructured corpora.",
        "At the same time, the access of World Wide Web resources by large numbers of users provides opportunities for collecting and leveraging vast amounts of data about user activity.",
        "In this paper, we describe research on exploiting data collected from logs of users’ queries in order to build models that can be used to infer users’ informational goals from queries.",
        "We describe experiments which use supervised machine learning techniques to build statistical models of questions posed to the Web-based En-carta encyclopedia service.",
        "We focus on models and analyses of complete questions phrased in English.",
        "These models predict a user’s informational goals from shallow linguistic features of questions obtained from a natural language parser.",
        "We decompose these goals into (1) the type of information requested by the user (e.g., definition, value of an attribute, explanation for an event), (2) the topic, focal point and additional restrictions posed by the question, and (3) the level of detail of the answer.",
        "The long-term aim of this project is to use predictions of these informational goals to enhance the performance of information-retrieval and question-answering systems.",
        "In this paper, we report on different aspects of the predictive performance of our statistical models, including the influence of various training and testing factors on predictive performance, and examine the relationships among the informational goals.",

        "In Section 4, we discuss our predictive models.",

        "Our research builds on earlier work on the use of probabilistic models to understand free-text queries in search applications (Heckerman and Horvitz, 1998; Horvitz et al., 1998), and on work conducted in the IR arena of question answering (QA) technologies.",
        "Heckerman and Horvitz (1998) and Horvitz et al.",
        "(1998) used hand-crafted models and supervised learning to construct Bayesian models that predict users’ goals and needs for assistance in the context of consumer software applications.",
        "Heckerman and Horvitz’ models considered words, phrases and linguistic structures (e.g., capitalization and definite/indefinite articles) appearing in queries to a help system.",
        "Horvitz et al.’s models considered a user’s recent actions in his/her use of software, together with probabilistic information maintained in a dynamically updated user profile.",
        "QA research centers on the challenge of enhancing the response of search engines to a user’s questions by returning precise answers rather than returning documents, which is the more common IR goal.",
        "QA systems typically combine traditional IR statistical methods (Salton and McGill, 1983) with “shallow” NLP techniques.",
        "One approach to the QA task consists of applying the IR methods to retrieve documents relevant to a user’s question, and then using the shallow NLP to extract features from both the user’s question and the most promising retrieved documents.",
        "These features are then used to identify an answer within each document which best matches the user’s question.",
        "This approach was adopted in (Kupiec, 1993; Abney et al., 2000; Cardie et al., 2000; Moldovan et al., 2000).",
        "The NLP components of these systems employed hand-crafted rules to infer the type of answer expected.",
        "These rules were built by considering the first word of a question as well as larger patterns of words identified in the question.",
        "For example, the question “How far is Mars?” might be characterized as requiring a reply of type DISTANCE.",
        "Our work differs from traditional QA research in its use of statistical models to predict variables that represent a user’s informational goals.",
        "The variables under consideration include the type of the information requested in a query, the level of detail of the answer, and the parts-of-speech which contain the topic the query and its focus (which resembles the type of the expected answer).",
        "In this paper, we focus on the predictive models, rather than on the provision of answers to users’ questions.",
        "We hope that in the short term, the insights obtained from our work will assist QA researchers to fine-tune the answers generated by their systems."

        "Our models were built from questions identified in a log of Web queries submitted to the Encarta encyclopedia service.",
        "These questions include traditional WH-questions, which begin with “what”, “when”, “where”, “which”, “who”, “why” and “how”, as well as imperative statements starting with “name”, “tell”, “find”, “define” and “describe”.",
        "We extracted 97,640 questions (removing consecutive duplicates), which constitute about 6% of the 1,649,404 queries in the log files collected during a period of three weeks in the year 2000.",
        "A total of 6,436 questions were tagged by hand.",
        "Two types of tags were collected for each question: (1) tags describing linguistic features, and (2) tags describing high-level informational goals of users.",
        "The former were obtained automatically, while the latter were tagged manually.",
        "We considered three classes of linguistic features: word-based, structural and hybrid.",
        "Word-based features indicate the presence of specific words or phrases in a user’s question, which we believed showed promise for predicting components of his/her informational goals.",
        "These are words like “make”, “map” and “picture”.",
        "Structural features include information obtained from an XML-encoded parse tree generated for each question by NLPWin (Heidorn, 1999) – a natural language parser developed by the Natural Language Processing Group at Microsoft Research.",
        "We extracted a total of 21 structural features, including the number of distinct parts-of-speech (PoS) – NOUNs, VERBs, NPs, etc – in a question, whether the main noun is plural or singular, which noun (if any) is a proper noun, and the PoS of the head verb post-modifier.",
        "Hybrid features are constructed from structural and word-based information.",
        "Two hybrid features were extracted: (1) the type of head verb in a question, e.g., “know”, “be” or action verb; and (2) the initial component of a question, which usually encompasses the first word or two of the question, e.g., “what”, “when” or “how many”, but for “how” may be followed by a PoS, e.g., “how ADVERB” or “how ADJECTIVE.” We considered the following variables representing high-level informational goals: Information Need, Coverage Asked, Coverage Would Give, Topic, Focus, Restriction and LIST.",
        "Information about the state of these variables was provided manually by three people, with the majority of the tagging being performed under contract by a professional outside the research team.",
        "Information Need is a variable that represents the type of information requested by a user.",
        "We provided fourteen types of information need, including Attribute, IDentification, Process, Intersection and Topic Itself (which, as shown in Section 5, are the most common information needs), plus the additional category OTHER.",
        "As examples, the question “What is a hurricane?” is an IDentification query; “What is the color ofsand in the Kalahari?” is an Attribute query (the attribute is “color”); “How does lightningform?” is a Process query; “What are the biggest lakes in New Hampshire?” is an Intersection query (a type of IDentification, where the returned item must satisfy a particular Restriction – in this case “biggest”); and “Where can Ifind a picture ofa bay?” is a Topic Itself query (interpreted as a request for accessing an object directly, rather than obtaining information about the object).",
        "Coverage Asked and Coverage Would Give are variables that represent the level of detail in answers.",
        "Coverage Asked is the level of detail of a direct answer to a user’s question.",
        "Coverage Would Give is the level of detail that an information provider would include in a helpful answer.",
        "For instance, although the direct answer to the question “When did Lincoln die?” is a single date, a helpful information provider might add other details about Lincoln, e.g., that he was the sixteenth president of the United States, and that he was assassinated.",
        "This additional level of detail depends on the request itself and on the available information.",
        "However, here we consider the former factor, viewing it as an initial filter that will guide the content planning process of an enhanced QA system.",
        "The distinction between the requested level of detail and the provided level of detail makes it possible to model questions for which the preferred level of detail in a response differs from the detail requested by the user.",
        "We considered three levels of detail for both coverage variables: Precise, Additional and Extended, plus the additional category OTHER.",
        "Precise indicates that an exact answer has been requested, e.g., a name or date (this is the value of Coverage Asked in the above example); Additional refers to a level of detail characterized by a one-paragraph answer (this is the value of Coverage Would Give in the above example); and Extended indicates a longer, more detailed answer.",
        "Topic, Focus and Restriction contain a PoS in the parse tree of a user’s question.",
        "These variables represent the topic of discussion, the type of the expected answer, and information that restricts the scope of the answer, respectively.",
        "These variables take 46 possible values, e.g., NOUN , VERB and NP , plus the category OTHER.",
        "For each question, the tagger selected the most specific PoS that contains the portion of the question which best matches each of these informational goals.",
        "For instance, given the question “What are the main traditional foods that Brazilians eat?”, the Topic is NOUN (Brazilians), the Focus is ADJ +NOUN (traditional foods) and the restriction is ADJ (main).",
        "As shown in this example, it was sometimes necessary to assign more than one PoS to these target variables.",
        "At present, these composite assignments are classified as the category OTHER.",
        "LIST is a boolean variable which indicates whether the user is looking for a single answer (False) or multiple answers (True)."

        "However, for the other target variables, the performance obtained using decision trees is substantially better than that obtained using prior probabilities.",
        "Further, the predictive performance obtained for the set Good4 617 is only slightly better than that obtained for the set All5145.",

        "According to this distribution, over 90% of the queries have less than 11 words.",
        "The predictive performance of our decision trees broken down by query length is shown in Figure 5.",
        "As shown in this chart, for all target variables there is a downward trend in predictive accuracy as query length increases.",
        "Still, for queries of less than 11 words and all target variables except Topic, the predictive accuracy remains over 74%.",
        "In contrast, the Topic predictions drop from 88% (for queries of less than 5 words) to 57% (for queries of 8, 9 or 10 words).",
        "Further, the predictive accuracy for Information Need, Topic, Focus and Restriction drops substantially for queries that have 11 words or more.",
        "This drop in predictive performance may be explained by two factors.",
        "For one, the majority of the training data",
        "consists of shorter questions.",

        "The performance of the Predic-tionOnly model is comparable to that of BestResult, but the performance of the Mixed model seems slightly worse.",
        "This difference in performance may be attributed to the fact that the Pre-dictionOnly model is a “smoothed” version of the Mixed model.",
        "That is, the PredictionOnly model uses a consistent version of the target variables (i.e., predicted values) both for training and testing.",

        "We also propose to investigate predictive models which return more informative predictions than those returned by our current model, e.g., a distribution of the probable informational goals, instead of a single goal.",

        "As an example of query expansion, if Process was identified as the Information Need of a query, words that boost responses to searches for information relating to processes could be added to the query prior to submitting it to a search engine.",
        "Another envisioned enhancement would attempt to improve the initial recall of the document retrieval process by submitting queries which contain the content words in the Topic and Focus of a user’s question (instead of including all the content words in the question).",
