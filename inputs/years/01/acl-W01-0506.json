        "This paper presents an empirical evaluation of stacked generalization, a scheme for combining automatically induced classifiers, in the context of anti-spam filtering, a novel cost-sensitive application of text categorization.",
        "The increasing popularity and low cost of email have intrigued direct marketers to flood the mailboxes of thousands of users with unsolicited messages, advertising anything, from vacations to get-rich schemes.",
        "These messages, known as spam or more formally Unsolicited Commercial E-mail, are extremely annoying, as they clutter mailboxes, prolong dial-up connections, and often expose minors to unsuitable content (Cranor & Lamacchia, 1998).",
        "Legal and simplistic technical countermeasures, like blacklists and keyword-based filters, have had a very limited effect so far.",
        "The success of machine learning techniques in text categorization (Sebastiani, 2001) has recently led to alternative, learning-based approaches (Sahami, et al.",
        "1998; Pantel & Lin, 1998; Drucker, et al.",
        "1999).",
        "A classifier capable of distinguishing between spam and non-spam, hereafter legitimate, messages is induced from a manually categorized learning collection of messages, and is then used to identify incoming spam email.",
        "Initial results have been promising, and experiments are becoming more systematic, by exploiting recently introduced benchmark corpora, and cost-sensitive evaluation measures (Gomez Hidalgo, et al.",
        "2000; Androutsopoulos, et al.",
        "2000a, b, c).",
        "Stacked generalization (Wolpert, 1992), or stacking, is an approach for constructing classifier ensembles.",
        "A classifier ensemble, or committee, is a set of classifiers whose individual decisions are combined in some way to classify new instances (Dietterich, 1997).",
        "Stacking combines multiple classifiers to induce a higher-level classifier with improved performance.",
        "The latter can be thought of as the president of a committee with the ground-level classifiers as members.",
        "Each unseen incoming message is first given to the members; the president then decides on the category of the",
        "message by considering the opinions of the members and the message itself.",
        "Ground-level classifiers often make different classification errors.",
        "Hence, a president that has successfully learned when to trust each of the members can improve overall performance.",
        "We have experimented with two ground-level classifiers for which results on a public benchmark corpus are available: a Naïve Bayes classifier (Androutsopoulos, et al.",
        "2000a, c) and a memory-based classifier (Androutsopoulos, et al.",
        "2000b; Sakkis, et al.",
        "2001).",
        "Using a third, memory-based classifier as president, we investigated two versions of stacking and two different cost-sensitive scenarios.",
        "Overall, our results indicate that stacking improves the performance of the ground-level classifiers, and that the performance of the resulting anti-spam filter is acceptable for real-life applications.",
        "Section 1 below presents the benchmark corpus and the preprocessing of the messages; section 2 introduces cost-sensitive evaluation measures; section 3 provides details on the stacking approaches that were explored; section 4 discusses the learning algorithms that were employed and the motivation for selecting them; section 5 presents our experimental results followed by conclusions."

        "Moreover, recent experiments with an encoded user mailbox and a Naïve Bayes (NB) classifier (Androutsopoulos, et al.",
        "2000c) yielded results similar to those obtained with Ling-Spam (Androutsopoulos, et al.",
        "2000a).",
        "Therefore, experimentation with Ling-Spam can provide useful indicative results, at least in a preliminary stage.",
        "Furthermore, experiments with Ling-Spam can be seen as studies of anti-spam filtering of open unmoderated lists.",
        "Each message of Ling-Spam was converted into a vector x = x1 , x2 , x3, h , x„ , where x1,...,x„ are the values of attributes X1,...,X„ .",

        "To avoid treating forms of the same word as different attributes, a lemmatizer was applied, converting each word to its base form.",
        "To reduce the dimensionality, attribute selection was performed.",
