        "Morphological analysis is one ofthe basictech-niques used in Japanese sentence analysis.",
        "A morpheme is a minimal grammatical unit,such as a word or a suffix, and morphological analysis is the process segmenting a given sentence into a row of morphemes and assigning to each morpheme grammatical attributes such as a part-of-speech (POS) and an inflection type.",
        "One of the most important problems in morphological analysis is that posed by unknown words, which are words found in neither a dictionary nor a training corpus, and there have been two statistical approaches to this problem.",
        "One is to acquire unknown words from corpora and put them into a dictionary (e.g., (Mori and Nagao, 1996)), and the other is to estimate a model that can identify unknown words correctly (e.g., (Kashioka et al., 1997; Nagata, 1999)).",
        "We would like to be able to make good use of both approaches.",
        "If words acquired by the former method could be added to a dictionary and a model developed by the latter method could consult the amended dictionary, then the model could be the best statistical model which has the potential to overcome the unknown word problem.",
        "Mori and Nagao proposed a statistical model that can consult a dictionary (Mori and Nagao, 1998).",
        "In their model the probability that a string of letters or characters is a morpheme is augmented when the string is found in a dictionary.",
        "The improvement of the accuracy was slight, however, so we think that it is difficult to efficiently integrate the mechanism for consulting a dictionaryinto an n-gram model.",
        "In this paper we therefore describe a morphological analysis method based on amax-imum entropy (M.E.)",
        "model.",
        "This method uses a model that can not only consult a dictionary but can also identify unknown words by learning certain characteristics.",
        "To learn these characteristics, we focused on such information as whether or not a string is found in a dictionary and what types of characters are used in a string.",
        "The model estimates how likely a string is to be a morpheme according to the information on hand.",
        "When our method was used to identify morpheme segments in sentences in the Kyoto University corpus and to identify the major parts-of-speech of these morphemes, the recall and precision were respectively 95.80% and 95.09%."

        "This section describes a model which estimates how likely a string is to be a morpheme.",
        "We implemented this model within an M.E.",
        "framework.",
        "Given a tokenized test corpus, the problem of Japanese morphological analysis can be reduced to the problem of assigning one of two tags to each string in a sentence.",
        "A string is tagged with a 1 or a 0 to indicate whether or not it is a morpheme.",
        "When a string is a morpheme, a grammatical attribute is assigned to it.",
        "The 1 tag is thus divided into the number, n, of grammatical attributes assigned to morphemes, and the problem is to assign an attribute (from 0 to n) to every string in a given sentence.",

        "model, as well as other similar models, enables the computation of P(f Ih) for any future f from the space of possible futures, F, and for every history, h, from the space of possible histories, H. A \"history\" in M.E.",
        "is all of the conditioning data that enable us to make a decision in the space of futures.",
        "In the problem of morphological analysis, we can reformulate this in terms of finding the probability of f associated with the relationship at index t in the test corpus:",
        "The computation of P(f Ih) in any M.E.",

        "Like most current M.E.",
        "models in computational linguistics, our modelisrestrictedtoto those features which are binary functions ofthe history and future.",
        "For instance, one of our features is",
        "Here \"has(h,x)\" is a binary function that returns true if the history h has feature x.",
        "In our experiments, we focused on such information as whether or not a string is foundin adictionary, the length of the string, what types of characters are used in the string, and the part-of-speech of the adjacent morpheme.",
        "Given a set of features and some training data, the M.E.",
        "estimation process produces a model in which every feature g2 has an associated parameter a2.",
        "This enables us to compute the conditional probability as follows (Berger et al., 1996):",
        "The M.E.",
        "estimation process guarantees that for every feature g2, the expected value of g2 according to the M.E.",
        "model will equal the empirical expectation of g2 in the training corpus.",
        "In other words,",
        "Here P� is an empirical probability and PM.E.",
        "is the probability assigned by the model.",
        "We define part-of-speech and bunsetsu boundaries as grammatical attributes.",
        "Here a bunsetsu is a phrasal unit consisting of one or more morphemes.",
        "When there are m types of parts-of-speech, and the left-hand side of each morpheme may or may not be a bunsetsu boundary, the number, n, of grammatical attributes assigned to morphemesis 2 x m. 1 We propose a model which estimates the likelihood that a given string is a morpheme and has the grammatical attribute i(1 < i < n).",
        "We call it a morpheme model.",
        "This model is represented by Eq.",
        "(2), in which f can be one of (n + 1) tags from 0 to n. A given sentence is divided into morphemes, and a grammatical attribute is assignedto each morpheme so as to maximize thesentence probability estimated by our morpheme model.",
        "Sentence probability is defined as the product ofthe probabilities estimated for a particulardivision of morphemes in a sentence.",
        "We use the Viterbi algorithm to find the optimal set of morphemes in a sentence and we use the method proposed by Nagata (Nagata, 1994) to search for the N-best sets."

        "The part-of-speech categories that we used follow those of JUMAN (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1999).",
        "There are 53 categories covering all possible combinations of major and minor categories as defined in JUMAN.",
        "The number of grammatical attributes is 106 if we include the detection of whether or not the left side of a morpheme is a bunsetsu boundary.",

        "We used the Kyoto University text corpus (Version 2) (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1997), a tagged corpus of the Mainichi newspaper.",
        "For training, we used 7,958 sentences from newspaper articles appearing from January 1 to January 8, 1995, and for testing, we used 1,246 sentences from articles appearing onJanuary 9, 1995.",
        "Given a sentence, for every string consisting of five or less characters and every string appearing in the JUMAN dictionary (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1999), whether or not the string is a morpheme was determined and then the grammatical attribute of each string determined to be a morpheme was identified and assigned to that string.",
        "The maximum length was set at five because morphemes consisting of six or more characters are mostly compound words or words consisting of katakana characters.",
        "The stipulation that strings consisting ofsix or morecharacters appear in the JUMAN dictionary was set because long strings not present in the JUMAN dictionary were rarely found to be morphemes in our training corpus.",
        "Here we assume that compound words that do not appear in the JUMAN dictionary can be divided into strings consisting of five or less characters because compound words tend not to appear in dictionaries, and in fact, compound words which consist of six or more characters and do not appear in the dictionary were not found in our training corpus.",
        "Katakana strings that are not found in the JUMAN dictionary were assumed to be included in the dictionary as an entry having the part-of-speech \"Unknown (Major), Katakana(Minor).\" An optimal set of morphemes in a sentence is searched for by employing the Viterbi algorithm under the condition that connectivity rules defined between parts-of-speech in JUMAN must be met.",
        "The assigned part-of-speech in the optimal set is not always selected from the parts-of-speech attached to entries in the JUMAN dictionary, but may also be selected from the 53 categories of the M.E.",
        "model.",
        "It is difficult to select an appropriate category from the 53 when thereisislittle training data, so we assume that every entry in the JUMAN dictionary has all possible parts-of-speech, and the part-of-speech assigned to each morpheme is selected from those attached to the entry corresponding to the morphemestring.",
        "The features used in our experiments are listed in Table 1.",
        "Each row in Table 1 contains a feature type, feature values, and an experimental result that will be explainedlater Each feature consists of a type and a value.",
        "The features are basically some attributes of the morpheme itself or those of the morpheme to the left of it.",
        "We used the 31,717 features that were found three or more times in the training corpus.",
        "The notations \"(0)\" and \"(-1)\" used in the feature type column in Table 1 respectively indicate a target string and the morpheme on the left of it.",

        "The accuracy in segmentation and major POS tagging obtained with our method and that obtained with JUMAN were about 3% worse than that obtained with JUMAN plus KNP.",
        "We think the main reason for this was an insufficient amount of training data and feature sets and the inconsistency of the corpus.",
        "The number of sentences in the training corpus was only about 8,000, and we did not use as many combined features as were proposed in Ref.",
        "(Uchimoto et al., 1999).",
        "We were unable to use more training data or more featuresetsbe-cause every string consisting of five or less characters in our training corpus was used to train our model, so the amount of tokenized training data would have become too large and the training would not have been completed on the available machine if we had used more training data or more feature sets.",
        "The inconsistency of the corpus was due to the way the corpus was made.",
        "The Kyoto University corpus was made by manually correcting the output ofJU-MAN plus KNP, and it is difficult to manually correct all of the inconsistencies in the output.",
