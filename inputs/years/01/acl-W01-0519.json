        "In the last decade several machine learning algorithms have been developed and applied to various natural language processing (NLP) tasks.",
        "One of the most popular approaches to test the data-driven methods has been morphosyntac-tic disambiguation of running texts, also called Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagging.",
        "One of the reasons is the need of PoS annotated texts in natural language processing systems and applications.",
        "Another reason is that benchmark data, i.e. correctly annotated texts, are available for several languages, making the training and test procedure easily feasible.",
        "The data-driven PoS taggers used in this study are claimed to be both language and tagset-independent and easily applicable to new languages, given a set of correctly annotated training corpora.",
        "According to the literature, each tagger has been tested for English with an average accuracy of between 95% and 97%.",
        "However, the manner in which the taggers are evaluated by the researchers differs greatly, which makes it difficult to compare the performance of the systems.",
        "Several recent studies report comparisons of data-driven PoS taggers.",
        "However, the purpose of these studies has been primarily to attain higher tagging performance by means of different system combinations.",
        "Brill & Wu (1998) trained statistical un-igram and trigram, Maximum Entropy and Transformation-Based learning on the English Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal Corpus consisting of 1.1 million words.",
        "They showed that the Maximum Entropy framework as it was implemented by Ratnaparkhi (1996) achieved the highest accuracy in total and in the annotation of ambiguous and unknown words.",

        "(1998) included Maximum Entropy, Memory-Based, Statistical trigram, and Transformation-Based approaches in the ensemble of classifiers and trained on 80% of the LOB corpus consisting of 931062 tokens.",
        "Similarly to the results given by Brill & Wu (1998), the Maximum Entropy framework achieved highest accuracy.",
        "In contrast to the previous studies, Zavrel and Daelemans (2000) report that a statistical trigram approach, TNT (Brants, 2000) gave the best result over the Maximum Entropy, Memory-Based, and Transformation-Based approaches when trained on 90% and tested on 10% of the Spoken Dutch Corpus consisting of 5,000, 10,000 and 20,000 tokens respectively.",
        "However, the goal of these studies was not a systematic evaluation and comparison of the classifiers.",
        "De Pauw and Daelemans (2000) describe a systematic comparison between the Maximum Entropy framework and Memory-Based Learning performed on the LOB-corpus.",
        "They report that the overall tagging accuracy of the methods are similar, although Maximum Entropy succeeds better in tagging unknown words.",

        "There are some remarkable differences between the systems in their sensitivity to the size of the training data.",
        "ME shows most sensitivity, i.e. when increasing the training data from one thousand to five hundred thousand tokens, the error rate decreases by 88%.",
        "TBL, on the other hand, shows less sensitivity, the error rate is decreasing by 50%.",
        "This is due to the fact",

        "TBL can be put to use in the development of large corpora by applying a bootstrapping procedure.",
        "Since PoS tagging has two main purposes, namely the annotation of unknown words and the disambiguation of the known words according to their context, the error rates are presented separately for unknown and known tokens as well.",
        "Additionally, because a large lexicon may not be available in some cases or for some languages, results for TBL are also given when tagging is performed on the basis of a small lexicon derived from the training data only.",

        "TNT conquers TBL as well as the other systems in the correct annotation of unknown words when the size of the training corpus is 20k tokens or more.",
        "The success of TNT can be explained by the way the system handles unknown words; The tag probabilities are set on the basis of the word endings, i.e. suffix analysis up to ten final characters of a word.",
        "The other systems do not look at as many characters, which has an effect on the results because inflectional and agglutinative languages with a complex morphological structure have suffix combinations longer than four characters.",

        "The ME approach succeeds poorly when training on a small corpus compared to the other three systems.",
        "In the case of large training corpora (100k and above), the differences between the systems converge due to the similar linguistic information implemented in the systems.",
