        "A typical use of Machine Learning methods in the context of Natural Language Processing is in the domain of text classification.",
        "Unfortunately, several characteristics specific to text data make its classification a difficult problem to handle.",
        "In particular, the data is typically highly dimensional and it presents a large class imbalance, i.e., there, typically, are very few documents on the topic of interest while texts on unrelated subjects abound.",
        "Furthermore, although large amounts of texts are available on line, little of them are labeled.",
        "Because the class imbalance problem is known to negatively affect typical classifiers and because unlabeled data have no place in conventional supervised learning, using off-the-shelf supervised classifiers is likely not to be very successful in the context of text data.",
        "It is, instead, recommended to devise a classification method specifically tuned to the text classification problem.",
        "The purpose of this study is to target some of the characteristics of text data in the hope of improving the effectiveness of the classification process.",
        "The topics of finding a good representation for text data and dealing with its high dimensionality have been investigated previously with, for example, the use of Wordnet [e.g., (Scott & Matwin, 1999)] and Support Vector Machines [e.g., (Joachims, 1998)], respectively.",
        "We will not be addressing these problems here.",
        "The question that we will tackle in this paper, instead, is that of dealing with the class imbalance, and, in the process of doing so, that of finding a way to take advantage of the extra, albeit, unlabeled data that are often left unused in classification studies.1 Several approaches have previously been proposed to deal with the class imbalance problem including a simple and yet quite effective method: re-sampling [e.g., (Lewis & Gale, 1994), (Kubat & Matwin, 1997), (Domingos,1999)].",
        "This paper deals with the two different types of re-sampling approaches: methods that oversample the small class in order to make it reach a size close to that of the larger class and methods that undersample the large class in order to make it reach a size close to that of the smaller class.",
        "Because it is unclear whether oversampling is more effective than undersampling and which oversampling or undersampling rate should be used, we propose a",
        "method for combining a number of classifiers that oversample and undersample the data at different rates in a mixture of experts framework.",
        "The mixture-of-experts is constructed in the context of a decision tree induction system: C5.0, and all re-sampling is done randomly.",
        "This proposed combination scheme is, subsequently, evaluated on a a subset of the REUTERS-21578 text collection and is shown to be very effective in this case.",
        "The remainder of this paper is divided into four sections.",
        "Section 2 describes an experimental study on a series of artificial data sets to explore the effect of oversampling and undersampling and oversampling or undersampling at different rates.",
        "This study suggests a mixture-of-experts scheme which is described in Section 3.",

        "(This is",
        "a well-known fact often reported in the literature on the class-imbalance problem and which was illustrated in Figure 1, above).",
        "In order to deal with the first fact, we decided not to average the outcome of different classifiers by letting them vote on a given testing point, but rather to let a single “good enough” classifier make a decision on that point.",
        "The classifier selected for a single data point needs not be the same as the one selected for a different data point.",
        "In general, letting a single, rather than several classifiers decide on a data point is based on the assumption that the instance space may be divided into non-overlapping areas, each best classified by a different expert.",
        "In such a case, averaging the result of different classifiers may not yield the best solution.",
        "We, thus, created a combination scheme that allowed single but different classifiers to make a decision for each point.",
        "Of course, such an approach is dangerous given that if the single classifier chosen to make a decision on a data point is not reliable, the result for this data point has a good chance of being unreliable as well.",
        "In order to prevent such a problem, we designed an elimination procedure geared at preventing any unfit classifier present at our architecture’s classification level from participating in the decision-making process.",
        "This elimination program relies on our second fact in that it invalidates any classifier labeling too many examples as positive.",
        "Since the classifiers of the combination scheme have a tendency of being naturally biased towards classifying the examples as negative, we assume that a classifier making too many positive decision is probably doing so unreliably.",
        "In more detail, our combination scheme consists of a combination scheme applied to each expert at the expert level a combination scheme applied at the output level an elimination scheme applied to the classifier level The expert and output level combination schemes use the same very simple heuristic: if one of the non-eliminated classifiers decides that an example is positive, so does the expert to which this classifier belongs.",
        "Similarly, if one of the two experts decides (based on its classifiers’ decision) that an example is positive, so does the output level, and thus, the example is classified as positive by the overall system.",
        "The elimination scheme used at the classifier level uses the following heuristic: the first (most imbalanced) and the last (most balanced) classifiers of each expert are tested on an unlabeled data set.",
        "The number of positive classifications each classifier makes on the unlabeled data set is recorded and averaged and this average is taken as the threshold that none of the expert’s classifiers must cross.",
        "In other words, any classifier that classifies more unlabeled data points as positive than the threshold established for the expert to which this classifier belongs needs to be discarded.12 It is important to note that, at the expert and output level, our combination scheme is heavily biased towards the positive under-represented class.",
        "This was done as a way to compensate for the natural bias against the positive class embodied by the individual classifiers trained on the class imbalanced domain.",

        "The words in each document were then",
        "stemmed using the Lovins stemmer14 and the 500 most frequently occurring features were used as the dictionary for the bag-of-word vectors representing each documents.",
        "15 Finally, the data set was divided into 10 concept learning problems where each problem consisted of a positive class containing 100 examples sampled from a single top 10 Reuters topic class and a negative class containing the union of all the examples contained in the other 9 top 10 Reuters classes.",
        "Dividing the Reuters multi-class data set into a series of two-class problems is typically done because considering the problem as a straight multiclass classification problem causes difficulties due to the high class overlapping rate of the documents, i.e., it is not uncommon for a document to belong to several classes simultaneously.",
        "Furthermore, although the Reuters Data set contains more than 100 examples in each of its top 10 categories (see Table 1), we found it more realistic to use a restricted number of positive examples.16 Having restricted the number of positive examples in each problem, it is interesting to note that the class imbalances in these problems is very high since it ranges from an imbalance ratio of 1:60 to one of 1:100 in favour of the negative class."
