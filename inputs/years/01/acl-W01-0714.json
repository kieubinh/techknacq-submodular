        "While early work showed that small, artificial context-free grammars could be induced with the EM algorithm (Lari and Young, 1990) or with chunk-merge systems (Stolcke and Omohundro, 1994), studies with large natural language grammars have shown that these methods of completely unsupervised acquisition are generally ineffective.",
        "For instance, Charniak (1993) describes experiments running the EM algorithm from random starting points, which produced widely varying grammars of extremely poor quality.",
        "Because of these kinds of results, the vast majority of statistical parsing work has focused on parsing as a supervised learning problem (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2000).",
        "It remains an open problem whether an entirely unsupervised method can either produce linguistically sensible grammars or accurately parse free text.",
        "However, there are compelling motivations for unsupervised grammar induction.",
        "Building supervised training data requires considerable resources, including time and linguistic expertise.",
        "Furthermore, investigating unsupervised methods can shed light on linguistic phenomena which are implicitly captured within a supervised parser’s supervisory information, and, therefore, often not explicitly modeled in such systems.",
        "For example, our system and others have difficulty correctly attaching subjects to verbs above objects.",
        "For a supervised CFG parser, this ordering is implicit in the given structure of VP and S constituents, however, it seems likely that to learn attachment order reliably, an unsupervised system will have to model it explicitly.",
        "Our goal in this work is the induction of high-quality, linguistically sensible grammars, not parsing accuracy.",
        "We present two systems, one which does not do disambiguation well and one which does not do it at all.",
        "Both take tagged but unparsed Penn treebank sentences as input.1 To whatever degree our systems parse well, it can be taken as evidence that their grammars are sensible, but no effort was taken to improve parsing accuracy directly.",
        "There is no claim that human language acquisition is in any way modeled by the systems described here.",
        "However, any success of these methods is evidence of substantial cues present in the data, which could potentially be exploited by humans as well.",
        "Furthermore, mistakes made by these systems could indicate points where human acquisition is likely not being driven by these kinds of statistics."

        "At the heart of any iterative grammar induction system is a method, implicit or explicit, for deciding how to update the grammar.",
        "Two linguistic criteria for constituency in natural language grammars form the basis of this work (Radford, 1988):",
        "2.",
        "Substitutability: A constituent is a sequence of words with (simple) variants which can be substituted for that sequence.",
        "To make use of these intuitions, we use a distributional notion of context.",
        "Let be a part-of-speech tag sequence.",
        "Every occurence of will be in some context , where and are the adjacent tags or sentence boundaries.",
        "The distribution over contexts in which occurs is called its signature, which we denote by .",
        "Criterion 1 regards constituency itself.",
        "Consider the tag sequences IN DT NN and IN DT.",
        "The former is a canonical example of a constituent (of category PP), while the later, though strictly more common, is, in general, not a constituent.",
        "Frequency alone does not distinguish these two sequences, but Criterion 1 points to a distributional fact which does.",
        "In particular, IN DT NN occurs in many environments.",
        "It can follow a verb, begin a sentence, end a sentence, and so on.",
        "On the other hand, IN DT is generally followed by some kind of a noun or adjective.",
        "This example suggests that a sequence’s constituency might be roughly indicated by the entropy of its signature, .",
        "This turns out to be somewhat true, given a few qualifications.",
        "Figure 1 shows the actual most frequent constituents along with their rankings by several other measures.",
        "Tag entropy by itself gives a list that is not particularly impressive.",
        "There are two primary causes for this.",
        "One is that uncommon but possible contexts have little impact on the tag entropy value.",
        "Given the skewed distribution of short sentences in the treebank, this is somewhat of a problem.",
        "To correct for this, let be the uniform distribution over the observed contexts for .",
        "Using would have the obvious effect of boosting rare contexts, and the more subtle effect of biasing the rankings slightly towards more common sequences.",
        "However, while presumably converges to some sensible limit given infinite data, will not, as noise eventually makes all or most counts non-zero.",
        "Let be the uniform distribution over all contexts.",
        "The scaled entropy turned out to be a useful quantity in practice.",
        "Multiplying entropies is not theoretically meaningful, but this quantity does converge to given infinite (noisy) data.",
        "The list for scaled entropy still has notable flaws, mainly relatively low ranks for common NPs, which does not hurt system perfor",
        "mance, and overly high ranks for short subject-verb sequences, which does.",
        "The other fundamental problem with these entropy-based rankings stems from the context features themselves.",
        "The entropy values will change dramatically if, for example, all noun tags are collapsed, or if functional tags are split.",
        "This dependence on the tagset for constituent identification is very undesirable.",
        "One appealing way to remove this dependence is to distinguish only two tags: one for the sentence boundary (#) and another for words.",
        "Scaling entropies by the entropy of this reduced signature produces the improved list labeled “Boundary.” This quantity was not used in practice because, although it is an excellent indicator of NP, PP, and intransitive S constituents, it gives too strong a bias against other constituents.",
        "However, neither system is driven exclusively by the entropy measure used, and duplicating the above rankings more accurately did not always lead to better end results.",
        "Criterion 2 regards the similarity of sequences.",
        "Assume the data were truly generated by a categorically unambiguous PCFG (i.e., whenever a token of a sequence is a constituent, its label is determined) and that we were given infinite data.",
        "If so, then two sequences, restricted to those occurrences where they are constituents, would have the same signatures.",
        "In practice, the data is finite, not statistically context-free, and even short sequences can be categorically ambiguous.",
        "However, it remains true that similar raw signatures indicate similar syntactic behavior.",
        "For example, DT JJ NN and DT NN have extremely similar signatures, and both are common NPs.",
        "Also, NN IN and NN NN IN have very similar signatures, and both are primarily non-constituents.",
        "For our experiments, the metric of similarity between sequences was the Jensen-Shannon divergence of the sequences’ signatures: Where KL is the Kullback-Leibler divergence between probability distributions.",
        "Of course, just as various notions of context are possible, so are various metrics between signatures.",
        "The issues of tagset dependence and data skew did not seem to matter for the similarity measure, and unaltered Jensen-Shannon divergence was used.",
        "Given these ideas, section 4.1 discusses a system whose grammar induction steps are guided by sequence entropy and interchangeability, and section 4.2 discusses a maximum likelihood system where the objective being maximized is the quality of the constituent/non-constituent distinction, rather than the likelihood of the sentences."

        "Our current systems primarily attempt to address the first two points.",
        "Common objective functions include maximum likelihood (ML) which asserts that a good grammar is one which best encodes or compresses the given data.",
        "This is potentially undesirable for two reasons.",
        "First, it is strongly data-dependent.",
        "The grammar which maximizes depends on the corpus , which, in some sense, the core of a given language’s phrase structure should not.",
        "Second, and more importantly, in an ML approach, there is pressure for the symbols and rules in a PCFG to align in ways which maximize the truth of the conditional independence assumptions embodied by that PCFG.",
        "The symbols and rules of a natural language grammar, on the other hand, represent syntactically and semantically coherent units, for which a host of linguistic arguments have been made (Radford, 1988).",
        "None of these arguments have anything to do with conditional independence; traditional linguistic constituency reflects only grammatical possibilty of expansion.",
        "Indeed, there are expected to be strong connections across phrases (such as are captured by argument dependencies).",
        "For example, in the treebank data used, CD CD is a common object of a verb, but a very rare subject.",
        "However, a linguist would take this as a selectional characteristic of the data set, not an indication that CD CD is not an NP.",
        "Of course, it could be that the ML and linguistic criteria align, but in practice they do not always seem to, and one should not expect that, by maximizing the former, one will also maximize the latter.",
        "Another common objective function is minimum description length (MDL), which asserts that a good analysis is a short one, in that the joint encoding of the grammar and the data is compact.",
        "The “compact grammar” aspect of MDL is perhaps closer to some traditional linguistic argumentation which at times has argued for minimal grammars on grounds of analytical (Harris, 1951) or cognitive (Chomsky and Halle, 1968) economy.",
        "However, some CFGs which might possibly be seen as the acquisition goal are anything but compact; take the Penn treebank covering grammar for an extreme example.",
        "Another serious issue with MDL is that the target grammar is presumably bounded in size, while adding more and more data will on average cause MDL methods to choose ever larger grammars.",
        "In addition to optimizing questionable objective functions, many systems begin their search procedure from an extremely unfavorable region of the grammar space.",
        "For example, the randomly weighted grammars in Carroll and Charniak (1992) rarely converged to remotely sensible grammars.",
        "As they point out, and quite independently of whether ML is a good objective function, the EM algorithm is only locally optimal, and it seems that the space of PCFGs is riddled with numerous local maxima.",
        "Of course, the issue of initialization is somewhat tricky in terms of the bias given to the system; for example, Brill (1994) begins with a uniformly right-branching structure.",
        "For English, right-branching structure happens to be astonishingly good both as an initial point for grammar learning and even as a baseline parsing model.",

        "A possible criticism of this work is that it relies on part-of-speech tagged data as input.",
        "In particular, while there has been work on acquiring parts-of-speech distributionally (Finch et al., 1995; Sch¨utze, 1995), it is clear that manually constructed tag sets and taggings embody linguistic facts which are not generally detected by a distributional learner.",
        "For example, transitive and intransitive verbs are identically tagged yet distributionally dissimilar.",
        "In principle, an acquisition system could be designed to exploit non-distributionality in the tags.",
        "For example, verb subcategorization or selection could be induced from the ways in which a given lexical verb’s distribution differs from the average, as in (Resnik, 1993).",
        "However, rather than being exploited by the systems here, the distributional non-unity of these tags appears to actually degrade performance.",
        "As an example, the systems more reliably group verbs and their objects together (rather than verbs and their subjects) when transitive and intransitive verbs are given separate tags.",
        "Future experiments will investigate the impact of distributional tagging, but, despite the degradation in tag quality that one would expect, it is also possible that some current mistakes will be corrected."
