        "The ability to automatically distinguish between arguments and modifiers is necessary for the automatic acquisition of important lexical knowledge, such as subcategorisation frames and argument structures, which is used in parsing, generation, machine translation, information extraction (Srinivas and Joshi, 1999; Stede, 1998; Dorr, 1997; Riloff and Schmelzenbach, 1998).",
        "Yet, few attempts have been made to perform this distinction automatically.",
        "In this paper, we present results related to what has been found to be a particularly difficult instance of this problem: the case of prepositional phrases (PPs) attached to the verb.",
        "Previous work shows that this distinction is more difficult for PPs than for other parts of speech (Buch-holz, 1999), and also that attachment to a verb in general is less accurately performed than attachment to a noun (Hindle and Rooth, 1993).",
        "The core difficulty in this enterprise is to define the notion of argument precisely enough that it can be used automatically.",
        "There is a consensus in linguistics that arguments and modifiers are different both with respect to their function in the sentence and in the way they themselves are interpreted (Jackendoff, 1977; Marantz, 1984; Pollard and Sag, 1987; Grimshaw, 1990).",
        "With respect to their function, an argument fills a role in the relation described by its associated head, while a modifier predicates a separate property of its associate head or phrase.",
        "With respect to their interpretation, a complement is an argument if its interpretation depends exclusively on the head with which it is associated, while it is a modifier if its interpretation remains relatively constant when associating with different heads, (Grimshaw, 1990, 108).",
        "These semantic differences give rise, among others, to some observable distributional consequences: for a given interpretation, a modifier can co-occur with a relatively broad range of heads, while arguments are limited to co-occurrence with a (semantically restricted) class of heads (Pollard and Sag, 1987, 136).",
        "Restricting the discussion to PPs, these differences are illustrated in the following exam",
        "In example a), the head student implies that a subject is being studied.",
        "The sentence tells us only one property of Maria: that she is a student of physics.",
        "In example b) instead, the PP predicates a different property of the student, namely her geographical origin, which is not implied by the head student.",
        "In example a) the PP on Sunday can be construed without any reference to the preceding part of the sentence, and it preserves its meaning even when combining with different heads.",
        "This is, however, not the case for b).",
        "Here, the PP can only be properly understood in connection with the rest of the sentence: Sandy is the person on whom someone depends or the person on which the arson is blamed.",
        "These semantic distinctions surface in observable syntactic differences which can be used to elicit acceptability judgments.",
        "However, the linguistic diagnostics that are used to determine whether a PP is a modifier or an argument are not accurate in all circumstances, they often partition the set of the examples differently, and they give rise to relative, and not absolute, acceptability judgments.",
        "We propose a methodology that retains both the linguistic insight of the grammatical tests and the ability to effectively combine several gradient, partial diagnostics, typical of automatic induction methods.",
        "Specifically, we first find countable diagnostics for the argument-modifier distinction, which we approximate statistically and estimate using corpus counts.",
        "The diagnostics are then automatically combined in a decision tree induction algorithm.",
        "A detailed analysis of the behaviour of the classifier suggests that the diagnostic features do capture defining properties of arguments and modifiers.",
        "The Linguistic Diagnostics Many diagnostics for argumenthood have been proposed in the literature (Schu�tze, 1995).",
        "Some of them require complex syntactic manipulation of the sentence, such as copular paraphrases, pro-form replacement and wh-extraction.",
        "We choose four diagnostics that tap more directly into the semantic properties of the sentence and can be captured by simple statistical concepts, easily estimated in a corpus.",
        "The diagnostics are head dependence, optionality, it-erativity and ordering."

        "their lexical heads, because they form an integral part of the phrase.",
        "Modifiers do not.",
        "Consequently, PP-arguments can only appear with the specific verbal head by which they are lexically selected, while PP-modifiers can co-occur with a far greater range of different heads than arguments, as illustrated in the example sentences above.",
        "We capture this insight by counting the number of different verbs that co-occur with a given PP in a corpus, as indicated in (1).",
        "A low number indicates argument status, while a high number indicates modifier status.",
        "Optionality In most cases, PP-arguments are obligatory elements of a given sentence whose absence leads to ungrammaticality, while modifiers do not contribute to the semantics of",
        "any particular verb, hence they are optional, as illustrated in the following examples (PP-argument in bold): a) John put the book in the room.",
        "b) *John put the book.",
        "c) John saw/read the book in the room d) John saw/read the book.",
        "Thus we expect that the predictive power of a verb about its complements will be greater for arguments than for modifiers.",
        "This insight can be captured by the conditional probability of a PP given a particular verbal head, as indicated in (2).",
        "We expect to find larger values for arguments than for modifiers.",
        "Notice that this diagnostics can only be interpreted as a statistical tendency, and not as a strict test, because not all arguments are obligatory (but all modifiers are indeed optional).",
        "The best known descriptive exception to the criterion of optionality is the class of so-called object-drop verbs (Levin, 1993).",
        "Here a given verb may tolerate the omission of its argument.",
        "In other words, a transitive verb, such as kiss, can also act like an intransitive.",
        "With respect to PPs, instrumentals have been argued to be arguments (Schu�tze, 1995).",
        "While keeping these exceptions in mind, we maintain optionality as a valid diagnostic here.",
        "Iterativity and Ordering Arguments cannot be iterated and must be adjacent to the selecting lexical head, as illustrated below (arguments in bold):",
        "a) *Chris rented the gazebo to yuppies, to libertarians.",
        "b) Kim met Sandy in Baltimore in the hotel lobby in a corner.",
        "Consequently, in a sequence of several PPs only the first one can be an argument, while the others must be modifiers.",
        "The correlate of this test of iterativity and ordering, then, is simply whether a given PP is found in second (or higher) position in a corpus of multiple PP sequences.",
        "This would indicate a modifier status.",
        "In conclusion, the diagnostics of head dependence, optionality, iterativity and ordering are promising indicators of argumenthood as they make clearly different predictions for arguments and for modifiers, and they are approximated by an indicators which can be estimated in a sufficiently large corpus."

        "The testing is always done on the same 400 examples.",
        "Notice that this procedure is slightly different from the usual way of performing cross-validation, where all the data are used.",
        "In our case, it is necessary to always use a separate testing set because the 3692 examples in the training set were directly inspected to generate the values for some of the features, such as fl and f2.",
        "The testing set instead consists of examples that were never used during development.",
        "Results Table 1 indicates that the head dependence feature in all its variants is quite effective and gives much better performance than the other features.",
        "On the other hand, the iterativity features is not useful, perhaps because it was calculated using too small an auxiliary corpus of multiple PPs.",
        "The optionality feature is better than the default assignment, but not very",

        "For example, the difference between the first and third line is not significant.",
        "The best performance (line 1) is achieved by using a selection of the features, mixing some lexical information (the preposition), some general semantic information (the verb class and the PP-internal noun class derived from Wordnet) and only one of the variants of each of the diagnostic features about argumenthood (with minimal differences depending on which variant is chosen).",

        "Buchholz reports an accuracy of 77% for PPs, but she does not restrict the attachment site to verbs.",
        "The results reported above suggest that, like for part-of-speech tagging, simple frequencies of lexical items go a long way to solving the problem, while more sophisticated attempts improve the accuracy of a few percentage points.",
        "The significance of this work then resides in the exploration of the idea that the distinction between arguments and modifiers can be approached by capturing linguistic concepts statistically, and in the investigation of the relevant linguistic concepts.",
        "More specifically this work suggests two conclusions: First, while co-occurrence between individual words is very effective, sometimes co-occurrence between word classes is even more effective.",
        "Word classes capture syntactic and semantic regularities which help in disambiguation, while also providing an effective method to avoid sparse data.",
        "Second, this work supports the idea that complex distinctions, such as argument and modifier, are properly captured by a combination of linguistic diagnostics that measure both syntagmatic word co-occurrence - co-occurrence in the string -, such as optionality, and also dispersion across the set of words that can occur in a given position - paradigmatic co-occurrence -, such as head dependence.",
        "In discussing the fact that they obtain worse results for modifiers than for arguments, (Hin-dle and Rooth, 1993) already mention the possibility that their lexical association measure is not appropriate for modifiers.",
        "This conclusion is supported by the observation that one of the crucial properties of modifiers is indeed that they are not selected by a lexical head.",
        "A measure that captures this property is unlikely to be based on word co-occurrence.",
        "2 Thus, we pro2 We did in fact experiment with a measure of head dependence that calculated the conditional probability of a verb given a PP.",
        "This measure still captured the idea that in modifiers it is the PP that picks the verb, but it did not capture the idea of dispersion.",
        "This measure was not used as it does not perform as well as the other pose that word co-occurrence measures capture properties of arguments, such as our optionality, while the defining property of modifiers are captured by paradigmatic associations, such as head dependence.",
        "To verify that the diagnostic features do indeed capture these two dimensions of association between words, we performed some experiments, on a reduced set of features to see clearly the interaction of the features of interest.",
        "The logic is as follows.",
        "The measure of optionality is a measure of association of the verb and the PP, indicating how strongly the verb selects the PP.",
        "This measure will only show a statistical tendency.",
        "There could be cases of very high co-occurrences of certain verbal heads with certain PP modifiers, that are not due to the linguistic content of the sentence, but to non-linguistic, circumstantial influences.",
        "For example, take the sentence The stock market rose 57c on Monday.",
        "Sentences similar to this are very frequent in the Wall Street Journal.",
        "In this case, the optionality feature incorrectly classifies the PP as an argument.",
        "Thus, if the optionality measure really captures properties of arguments, we should find that for high values of the feature - indicating argument status - modifiers are misclassified as arguments.",
        "For the low values of the feature - which indicate modifier status - on the other hand, one should find the opposite tendency to misclassify arguments as modifiers.",
        "This difference in the classification due to optionality interacts with the head dependence feature.",
        "Consider again the example sentence above.",

        "terion, as on Monday can co-occur with many different classes of verbs.",
        "In the case of arguments incorrectly misclassified as modifiers, again head dependence will interact, separating the actual arguments (low value for head dependence) from the errors (high value for head dependence) .",
        "To verify these hypotheses, we created two new test sets, which differ in the range of values of the feature opt2.",
        "One test set contains only high values (greater than 0.5) and one contains only low values (lower than 0.2).",
        "We then performed two runs of experiments.",
        "First, we constructed the classifier using three features: prep, hdep3, opt2, and then using only prep, opt2.",
        "We tested both these classifiers with the high value and low value optionality test sets.",
        "The difference in the classification between the full set of feature and the set of features without head dependence will illustrate the contribution of the head dependence feature.",
        "We then repeated the experiments using only the hdep3, opt2 features, to create an even clearer experimental setting.",
        "The results of all these experiments are shown in the confusion matrices reported in Tables 3 and 4.",
        "In the two tables, the values assigned by the classifier are indicated vertically, while the actual values are indicated horizontally.",
        "Compare the first to the second panel in the High column in Table 3.",
        "These are examples where the optionality feature has a high value, and therefore should show an overestimation of arguments, as they do (see the lower panel, where the feature hdep3 is not used to classify).",
        "Adding the head dependence feature increases the assignment to modifiers in general, reducing the false positives for argument assignment, as expected.",
        "In the panels describing the examples with low optionality values, one can observe the opposite pattern.",
        "Here, it is the assignment to modifiers that is overestimated, in the case where head dependence is not used (40 assignments to modifier in total).",
        "This result is expected, because these are examples that have a low optionality value.",
        "Adding the feature indicating head dependence decreases the number of false positives for modifier assignment – the number of actual arguments that were incorrectly assigned modifier status, which go from 10 to 7 – but does not change the other results.",
        "Table 4 is even clearer.",
        "For high optionality values, the optionality feature alone assigns all examples to the argument status.",
        "Adding head dependence moves many of the argument assignments to modifier status.",
        "For the low optionality values, the optionality feature alone overestimates the modifier assignment and the addition of the head dependence feature moves many of the examples towards an argument assignment.",
        "Thus, we can conclude that the two features of optionality and head dependence show the pattern of errors which we would expect, if optionality were particularly sensitive to factors related to arguments, and head dependence were sensitive to modifiers.",

        "The maximum result of 86.5% over a baseline of 74% suggests that this investigation represents a successful attempt at translating linguistic knowledge into statistical measures.",
        "In particular, it shows that the best results are achieved by augmenting lexical and word class information with linguistic diagnostics that measure both syntag-matic word co-occurrence, such as optionality, but also paradigmatic dispersion, such as head dependence.",
        "Several areas for improvement and extensions remain.",
        "One observation that can be drawn from these experiments is that argumenthood features are useful, but not as useful as the lexical features.",
        "A possible explanation for this fact, which also constitute an indication for future research, is that the feature are calculated very naively.",
        "It is possible that with more sophisticated measure one would achieve better performance.",
        "In particular, the measure of iterativity could be improved by collecting a larger data set of multiple PPs.",
        "The measure of head dependence could be improved by using a more complex measure of dispersion, based on entropy.",
        "Since all measures seem to greatly benefit from grouping the nouns and verbs into classes, the classification would likely be more accurate if more sophisticated ways of creating these classes were used."
