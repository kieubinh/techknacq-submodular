        "Several studies rely on the linguistic intuition that the head of the noun phrase makes a greater contribution to the semantics of the nominal group than the modifiers.",
        "However, for some specific tasks in NLP , the head is not necessarily the most semantically important part of the noun phrase.",
        "In analyzing email messages from the perspective of finding salient NPs, we claim that the modifier(s) of the noun phrase - usually nominal modifiers(s), often have as much semantic content as the head.",
        "This opinion is also supported in the work of Strzalkowski et al.",
        "(1999), where syntactic NPs are captured for the goal of extracting their semantic content but are processed as an “ordered” string of words rather than a syntactic unit.",
