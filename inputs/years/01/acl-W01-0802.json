        "Content determination as the name indicates is the process responsible for determining the content of the texts generated by an NLG system (Reiter and Dale 2000).",
        "Although content-determination is probably the most important part of an NLG system from the end-user's perspective, there is little agreement in the NLG community as to how content-determination should be done, with different systems adapting widely varying approaches.",
        "Also, algorithms and architectures for content-determination seem to often be based on the intuitions of system developers, instead of on empirical observations, although detailed content determination rules are often based on corpus analysis and interaction with experts.",
        "In this paper we propose a general architecture for content determination in data summarisation systems which assumes that content determination happens in two stages: first a qualitative overview of the data is formed, and second the content of the actual summaries is decided upon.",
        "This model is based on extensive knowledge acquisition (KA) activies that we have carried out in the SUMTIME project (Sripada, 2001), and also matches observations made during KA activities carried out in the STOP project (Reiter et al. 2000).",
        "We have not yet implemented this model, and indeed one of the issues that we need to think about is to what degree a content-determination strategy used by human experts is also an appropriate one for a computer NLG system."

        "Content determination is the task of deciding on the information content of a generated text.",
        "In the three-stage pipeline model of Reiter and Dale (2000), content determination is part of the first stage, document planning, along with document structuring (determining the textual and rhetorical structure of a text).",
        "Content determination is extremely important to end users; in most applications users probably prefer a text which poorly expresses appropriate content to a text which nicely expresses inappropriate content.",
        "From a theoretical perspective content determination should probably be based on deep reasoning about the system's communicative goal, the user's intentions, and the current context (Allen and Perrault 1980), but this requires an enormous amount of knowledge and reasoning, and is difficult to do robustly in real applications.",
        "In recent years many new content determination strategies have been proposed, ranging from the use of sophisticated signal-processing techniques (Boyd 1997) to complex planning algorithms (Mittal et al. 1998) to systems which exploit cognitive models of the user (Fiedler 1998).",
        "However, most of these strategies have only been demonstrated in one application.",
        "Furthermore, as far as we can tell these strategies are usually based on the intuition and experiences of the developers.",
        "While realisation, microplanning, and document structuring techniques are increasingly based on analyses of how humans perform these tasks (including corpus analysis, psycholinguistic studies, and KA activities), most papers on content determination make little reference to how human experts determine the content of a text.",
        "Human experts are often consulted with regard to the details of content rules, especially when schemas are used for content determination (Goldberg et al. 1994, McKeown et al. 1994, Reiter et al. 2000); but they rarely seem to be consulted (as far as we can tell) when deciding on the general algorithm or strategy to use for content determination."

        "For example, newspapers regularly publish textual summaries of weather predictions, the results of polls and surveys, and stock market activity, instead of just showing numbers and graphs.",

        "A doctor rushing to the side of a patient who is suffering from a heart attack, for example, may not have time to examine a set of graphs of time-series data, and a newspaper reader may not have the statistical knowledge necessary to interpret raw poll results.",
        "Perhaps the major problem today with textual descriptions of time-series data is that they must be produced manually, which makes them expensive and also means they can not be produced instantly.",
