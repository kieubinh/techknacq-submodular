        "ITS3 (Wehrli, 1992; Etchegoyhen & Wehrli, 1998; L'haire & al, 2000) can now translate from French to English and vice versa.",
        "Modules for other languages such as German, Italian, are under development.",
        "ITS3 is a principle-based system, linguistically inspired by the Government & Binding (GB) theory.",
        "(See eg.",
        "Haegeman (1994) for an introduction to GB, Berwick & al (1991) for principle-based systems).",
        "The system chooses the classical analysis-transfer-generation approach of MT (see Hutchins & Sommers, 1992).",
        "ITS3 works on single isolated sentences.",
        "A sentence in the source language is analyzed into a logico-linguistic structure, called pseudo-semantic structure (PSS).",
        "After a lexical transfer phase, this PSS is passed to the generation phase, which finally produces the sentence in the target language.",
        "By default, ITS3 gives a unique solution, the best one.",
        "Let's take an example of French-English translation to illustrate the process.",
        "The analysis phase consists of two steps: GB-based syntax analysis and PSS construction.",
        "Syntax analysis is carried out by the IPS parser (Wehrli, 1992), which builds the X-bar structure of the sentence, using many filtering constraints (on thematic roles, on cases, etc.)",
        "to reduce overgeneration.",
        "(1) La maison a été vendue.",
        "(2) [TP [DP la [NP maison]]i [T' a [VP été [VP vendue [DP ei]]]]]",
        "A PSS is then derived from the syntax analysis results (Etchegoyhen & Wehrli, 1998).",
        "Components of the sentence are represented in corresponding frame-liked structures.",
        "For example, a clause gives rise to a PSS of type CLS, which contains the main verb or adjective (the Predicate slot) and other information on tense, mood, voice, etc., as well as the PSS's of its arguments and adjuncts (the Satellites).",
        "Similarly, a noun phrase gives rise to a PSS of type DPS, which contains, besides the main noun (the Property slot), its number, gender, referential index for binding resolution, etc.",
        "A PSS thus contains abstract linguistic values for \"closed\" features (tense, mood, voice, number, gender, etc.",
        "), and lexical values for \"open\" features (CLS Predicate, DPS Property, etc.",
        ").",
        "In the lexical transfer phase, the lexical units in the PSS are replaced by those in the target language, using frequency data for translation selection.",
        "In the generation phase, a generic engine called GBGEN (Etchegoyhen & Wehrle, 1998; Etchegoyhen & al, 1999) cooperates with language-specific modules to construct the output from the PSS in three steps.",
        "First, D-structure generation maps the PSS into an X-bar structure in a top-down fashion (see 3a).",
        "Next, S-structure generation carries out movements and bindings (3b).",
        "Finally, morphological realization is done (3c), and the result is output, as in (3d).",

        "Note that ITS3 does only lexical, and not structural, transfer.",
        "This approach can therefore be considered as half transfer half interlingual.",
        "It is not the purpose of this paper to discuss the pros and cons of the transfer and interlingual approaches in MT.",
        "See eg.",
        "Gdaniec (1998) for discussions about advantages of a particular transfer-based MT system, and Dorr (1993) for an interlingual one.",
        "The latter, also based on GB, concentrates on treating mismatches across languages, an issue less considered in ITS3.",
        "It needs however to use very complex representations for its interlingual approach, hence is not likely to become a practical system.",
        "As for the specification issue, ITS3 chooses to be purely procedural.",
        "All generic engines and language-specific modules are written in Modula-2.",
        "Procedure templates are designed so that one can fill in language-specific parameters when adding a new language.",
        "However, this is not always straightforward, as one will see in the integration of Vietnamese below.",
        "In general, any development requires to read, understand, and often modify some parts of the huge code.",
        "This is an important reason why a declarative approach would be preferred (see eg.",
        "Emele & al, 1992; Nicolov & Mellish, 2000).",
        "Unfortunately, we do not have at our disposal any declarative system with high-quality French analysis.",
        "Also, as best as we know, there are no parallel French-Vietnamese or English-Vietnamese corpora built so far to think of statistical or example-based MT approaches.",
        "ITS3 is one among few systems that can do French syntax analysis with large lexical and grammatical coverage.",
