        "Probably the most critical questions that need to be addressed when evaluating automatically generated texts are: does the text actually say what it’s supposed to say and is it fluent, coherent, clear and grammatical?",
        "The answers to these questions say something important about how good the target texts are and – perhaps more to the point – how good the system that generated them is.",
        "There is no a priori reason why the target texts should be any better or worse when they result from natural language generation (NLG) or from machine translation (MT): indeed, they could result from the same language generator.",
        "Given this, it may be natural to assume that NLG could appropriately adopt evaluation methods developed for its more mature sister, MT.",
        "However, while this holds true for issues related to intelligibility (the second critical question), it does not apply as readily to issues of fidelity (the first question).",
        "We go beyond our recent experience of evaluating the AGILE system for producing multilingual versions of software user manuals (Hartley, Scott et al., 2000; Kruijff et al., 2000) and raise some open questions about how best to evaluate the faithfulness of an output text with respect to its input specification."

        "The use of rating scales to assess the intelligibility of MT output has been widespread since the early days in the field.",
        "Typically, monolingual raters assign a score to each sentence in the output text.",
        "However, this does not amount to an agreed methodology, since the number of points on the scale and their definition have varied considerably.",
        "For example, Carroll (1966) used a nine-point scale where point 1 was defined as “hopelessly unintelligible” and point 9 as “perfectly clear and intelligible”; Nagao and colleagues (Nagao et al., 1985), in contrast, used a five-point scale, while Arnold and his colleagues (Arnold et al., 1994) suggest a four-point discrimination.",
        "In evaluating the intelligibility of the AGILE output, we asked professional translators and authors who were native speakers of the languages concerned – Bulgarian, Czech and Russian – to score individual text fragments on a four-point scale.",
        "The evaluators were also asked to give a summative assessment of the output’s suitability as the first draft of a manual.",
        "In a single pass, AGILE is capable of generating several types of text, each constituting a section of a typical software user manual – i.e., overview, short instructions, full instructions, and functional descriptions – and appearing in one of two styles (personal/direct or impersonal/indirect).",
        "We evaluated all of these text types using the same method.",
        "The intelligibility evaluation was complemented by an assessment of the grammaticality of the output, conducted by independent native speakers trained in linguistics.",
        "Following an approach widely used in MT (e.g., Lehrberger and Bourbeau, 1987), the judges referred to a list of error categories for their annotations."

      "heading": "3 Evaluating fidelity",
      "text": [
        "In MT, evaluating fidelity (or “accuracy”) entails a judgment about the extent to which two texts “say the same thing”.",
        "Usually, the two texts in question are the source (i.e., original) text and the (machine-)translated text and the judges are expert translators who are again invited to rate the relative information content of pairs of sentences on an anchored scale (e.g., Nagao et al., 1985).",
        "But others (e.g., Caroll, 1966) have also compared the informativeness of the machine translation and a human translation deemed to serve as a benchmark.",
        "Interestingly, both of these researchers found a high correlation between the intelligibility evaluations and the fidelity evaluations, which suggests that it may be possible to infer fidelity from the (less costly) evaluation of intelligibility.",
        "However, at the current state-of-the-art this approach does not guarantee to detect cases where the translation is perfectly fluent but also quite wrong.",
        "For NLG, the story is rather different.",
        "Lacking a source text, we are denied the relatively straightforward approach of detecting discrepancies between artifacts of the same type: texts.",
        "The question is, instead, whether the generated text “says the same thing” as the message – i.e., the model of the intended semantic content together with the pragmatic force of the utterance.",
        "The message is clearly only available through an external representation.",
        "In translation generally, this external representation is the source text and the task is commonly characterized as identifying the message – which originates in the writer’s mental model – in order to re-express it in the target language.",
        "In an NLG system, the one external representation that is commonly available is the particular domain model that serves as input to the generation system.",
        "This model may have been provided directly by an artificial agent, such as an expert system.",
        "Alternatively, it may have been constructed by a human agent as the intended instantiation of their mental model.",
        "Yet, whatever its origins, directly comparing this intermediate representation to the output text is problematic.",
        "A recent survey of complete NLG systems (Cahill et al., 1999) found that half of the 18 systems examined accepted input directly from another system1.",
        "A typical example is the Caption Generation System (Mittal et al., 1998), which produces paragraph-sized captions to accompany the complex graphics generated by SAGE (Roth et al., 1994).",
        "The input to generation includes definitions of the graphical constituents that are used to by SAGE to convey information: “spaces (e.g., charts, maps, tables), graphemes (e.g., labels, marks, bars), their properties (e.g., color, shape) and encoders – the frames of reference that enable their properties to be interpreted/translated back to data values (e.g., axes, graphical keys).”2 For obvious reasons, this does not readily lend itself to direct comparison with the generated text caption.",
        "In the remaining half of the systems covered, the domain model is constructed by the user (usually a domain expert) through a technique that has come to be known as symbolic authoring: the ‘author’ uses a specially-built knowledge editor to construct the symbolic source of the target text.",
        "These editors are interfaces that allow authors to build the domain model using a representation that is more ‘natural’ to them than the artificial language of the knowledge base.",
        "The purpose of these representations is to provide feedback intended to make the content of the domain model more available to casual inspection than the knowledge representation language of the",
        "domain model.",
        "As such, they are obvious candidates as the standard against which to measure the content of the texts that are generated from them.",
        "We first consider the case of feedback presented in graphical mode, and then the option of textual feedback, using the WYSIWYM technology (Power and Scott, 1998; Scott, Power and Evans, 1998).",
        "We go on to make recommendations concerning the desirable properties of the feedback text."

        "Once trained in the language of the interface, the domain specialist uses standard text-editing devices such as menu selection and navigation with a cursor, together with standard text-editing actions (e.g., select, copy, paste, delete) to create and edit the content specification of the text to be generated in one or several selected languages.",
        "The user of AGILE, conceived to be a specialist in the domain of the particular software for which the manual is required (i.e., CAD/CAM), models the procedures for how to use the software.",
        "AGILE’s graphical user interface (Hartley, Power et al., 2000) closely resembles the interface that was developed for an earlier system, DRAFTER, which generates software manuals in English and French (Paris et al., 1995).",
        "The design of the interface represents the components of the procedures (e.g., goals, methods, preconditions, sub-steps, side-effects) as differently coloured boxes.",

        "generate text from them in specified styles in their native language.",
        "Since the evaluation was not conducted in situ with real CAD/CAM system designers creating real draft manuals, we needed to find a way to describe to the evaluators what domain models we wanted them to build.",

        "• the desired model as it would appear to them in the interface (e.g., Figure 1); • the target text that would be produced from the model (e.g., Figure 2); • a ‘pseudo-text’ that described the model",

        "Therefore, it would shed no light on how users might be able to build a graphical model externalising their own mental model.",
        "We discarded the second because a text may not necessarily make any explicit linguistic distinction between different components of the model – for example, between a precondition on a method and the first step in a method consisting of several steps5.",

        "To measure the correspondence between the actual models and the desired/target models, we adopted the Generation String Accuracy (GSA) metric (Bangalore, Rambow and Whittaker, 2000; Bangalore and Rambow, 2000) used in evaluating the output of a NLG system.",
        "It extends the simple Word Accuracy metric suggested in the MT literature (Alshawi et al., 1998), based on the string edit distance between some reference text and the output of the system.",

        "Thus, corrections may involve reordering tokens.",

        "For example, it does not capture qualitative differences between the generated object and the reference object, that is, it does not distinguish trivial from serious mistakes.",
