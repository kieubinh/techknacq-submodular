        "Annotated corpora have become a vital tool for Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems, as they provide both a standard against which results can be evaluated and a resource from which to extract linguistic information e.g. lexicons.",
        "This is especially true in any NLP task that requires the annotation of examples, e.g. part-of-speech tagging, parsing and semantic annotation, where it is vital to have a correct standard against which to compare the results of systems attempting to solve the task.",
        "Similarly, it is crucial in a language learning context, where what is learned can be used to annotate examples e.g. syntax learning, lexical learning.",
        "In this case the learned artefact is used to annotate the examples, which can then be compared against the correctly annotated version.",
        "Hence, correctly annotated corpora are vital for the evaluation of a very large number of NLP tasks.",
        "Unfortunately, there are often no suitably annotated corpora for a given task.",
        "For example, the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993; Marcus et al., 1994; Bies et al., 1994) provides a large corpus of syntactically annotated examples mostly from the Wall Street Journal.",
        "It is an excellent resource for tasks dealing with the syntax of written English.",
        "However, if the annotation formalism (a phrase-structure grammar with some simple features) does not match that of one’s NLP system, it is of very little use.",
        "For example, suppose a parser using Categorial Grammar (Wood, 1993; Steedman, 1993) is developed and applied to the examples in the corpus.",
        "While the bracketing of the examples will bear a strong relationship to the bracketing of the treebank, the labelling of the lexical items and the inner nodes of the tree will be entirely different and no labelling evaluation will be possible.",
        "However, intuitively, plenty of syntactic information is available.",
        "In fact, for most evaluation, all the syntactic information required is available, but in the wrong form.",
        "It seems obvious that a system for translating the syntactic information between formalisms would be a useful tool.",
        "Here, we present a system that translates the annotation of the Penn Treebank from the standard phrase structure annotation to a Categorial Grammar (CG) annotation and in the process induces large scale CG lexicons.",
        "It is a data-driven multi-pass system that uses both predefined rules and machine learning techniques to translate the trees and in the process induce a large scale CG lexicon.",
        "The system was designed to produce the lexical annotations for the sentences without null elements (i.e. without movement) from the Penn Treebank, so that these could be used to evaluate the results produced by an unsupervised CG lexicon learner (Watkinson and Manandhar, 2000; Watkinson and Manandhar, 2001).",
        "The system has four major features.",
        "Firstly, there is significant control over how the treebank is annotated.",
        "This is vital if the results are to be used for evaluation.",
        "Secondly, the system prevents propagation of translation errors throughout the trees by being data-driven.",
        "Thirdly, the system deals elegantly with erroneous annotation, even providing a degree of self-correction.",
        "Finally, the approach is general enough to apply to other similar problems.",
        "The system is compared with a top-down alternative based on the algorithm of Hockenmaier et al. (Hockenmaier et al., 2000), which is currently the system which has been applied to the most similar task, although it is really for CG lexicon extraction.",
        "The comparison suggests that the algorithm presented here gives more compact and linguistically elegant solutions.",
        "Investigation also indicates that the corpus produced is effectively translated for its purpose.",
        "In Section 2 other work in the area is briefly reviewed.",
        "In Section 3 the precise translation task is described.",
        "This is followed in Section 4 with a detailed description of the algorithms used for this task and some discussion as to their appropriateness.",
        "The results from the experiments are in Section 5.",
        "Finally, in Section 6 the results are discussed along with the contributions of the work and some suggestions for future work."

        "The most appropriate work to consider within this context is the grammar extraction literature.",
        "Perhaps the earliest example is the approach of Char-niak (Charniak, 1996), who simply extracted a context-free grammar by reading off the production rules implied by the trees in the Penn Treebank.",
        "While not translating the formalism of the treebank, this has led to work extracting grammars of different formalisms.",
        "The majority of work is based on the most obvious extension of the Charniak approach, which is to extract subtree-based grammars e.g. the Data-Oriented Parsing (DOP) approach (Bod, 1995), or extracting Lexicalised Tree Adjoining Grammars (LTAGs), or more generally Lexicalised Tree Grammars (LTGs) (Neumann, 1998; Xia, 1999; Chen and Vijay-Shanker, 2000).",
        "Each approach involves a process that splits up the annotated trees in the treebank into a set of subtrees that define the grammar.",
        "These approaches still continue to work with the syntactic data in the same form as it is found in the corpora.",
        "A slightly different approach has been followed by Krotov et al. (Krotov et al., 1998), where they extract the grammar from the Penn Treebank like Charniak, but then compact it.",
        "This provides a smaller grammar of similar quality to a grammar that has not been compacted, when a linguistically motivated compaction is used.",
        "However, the formalism remains unchanged.",
        "Similarly, Johnson (Johnson, 1998) modifies the labelling of the Penn Treebank, but remains within a CFG framework.",
        "Hockenmaier et al. (Hockenmaier et al., 2000), although to some extent following the approach of Xia (Xia, 1999) where LTAGs are extracted, have pursued an alternative by extracting Com-binatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (Steedman, 1993; Wood, 1993) lexicons from the Penn Treebank.",
        "In this case the data in the treebank is truly translated into another formalism providing an entire CCG annotation for the corpus based on a top-down algorithm.",
        "The lexicon is built by reading off the lexical assignments made for each tree.",
        "This is the most closely related work to this research, especially as it translates into a formalism very closely related to CG.",
        "The algorithm presented by Hockenmaier et al. (Hockenmaier et al., 2000) has been used to build a top-down system against which to compare our data-driven system.",
        "The algorithms are both described in detail in Section 4."

        "The translated corpus is to be used as a standard against which to compare the lexical annotation (i.e. the categories assigned to the words) of the output of an unsupervised CG learner that annotated the words of the examples with CG categories and then extracts a probabilistic lexicon (see Watkinson and Manandhar (Watkinson and Manandhar, 2001) for details).",

        "To be exact, we are using the Treebank II version (Bies et al., 1994; Marcus et al., 1994), which attempts to address the problem of complement/adjunct distinction, which previous versions had ignored.",
        "While the documentation is clear that the complement/adjunct structure is not explicitly marked (Marcus et al., 1994), the annotation includes a set of labels that relate to the role of a particular constituent in the sentence.",
        "These labels are attached to the standard constituent label and it is possible to use heuristics to determine the probable complement/adjunct structure in the trees (Collins, 1999; Xia, 1999), which is obviously useful in translating the annotation.",
        "The full Penn Treebank is not being used.",
        "As mentioned already, the current research only uses sentences without null elements (i.e. without movement) from the treebank and does not include any of the sentence fragments.",
        "However, as Categorial Grammar formalisms do not usually change the lexical entries of words to deal with movement, but use further rules (Wood, 1993; Steedman, 1993; Hockenmaier et al., 2000), the lexicons learned here will be valid over corpora with movement.",

        "The current work uses this simple form of the grammar, which suffices for the syntactic annotation of the corpora currently being used.",

        "The direction of the “slash” functors indicates the position of the argument in the sentence i.e. a“/” indicates that a word or phrase with the category of the argument should immediately follow in the sentence.",

        "Hockenmaier et al. (Hockenmaier et al., 2000) do not provide the mapping, so it was built specially for this system.",
        "This mapping led to the inclusion",
        "of the pp category as shorthand for prepositional complements.",
        "It should make no difference to the annotation process, but could lead to the generation of a few more categories.",
        "The head child of a subtree is given the category of the parent plus the complements required, which are found by looking first to the left of the head and then to the right, and adding them in the order they should processed in.",
