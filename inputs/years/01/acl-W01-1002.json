        "Moreover, human language technologies promise to both enhance human’s access to information as well as to enhance their interaction with one another such as by increasing their awareness of knowledge artifacts or activities intersecting their interests.",

        "Human language technologies have already been applied to some key knowledge management areas (Bontcheva 2001).",
        "For example, Becerra-Fernandez (2001) reports on NASA’s expert finder.",
        "In our research we have created systems which automatically extract and correlate information from human created artifacts to create assessments of human expertise (Maybury, D’Amore, House, D., 2000).",
        "For example, Figure 1 illustrates the screen MITRE’s Expert Finder (also called People Finder) generates after a user types in the keywords “machine translation”.",
        "Expert Finder processes employee published resumes and documents as well as corporate newsletters that mention individual’s names in the context of this topic (using named entity extraction) to automatically create expertise profiles for each employee.",
        "Expert Finder then presents a rank-ordered list of employees whose expertise profile best matches this query.",
        "In spite of low inter-human agreement in determining expertise, an empirical evaluation comparing ten technical human resource managers’ performance with Expert Finder on five specialty areas (data mining, chemicals, human computer interaction, network security, and collaboration) demonstrated that Expert Finder performed at approximately 60% precision and 40% recall when appropriate data was available.",
        "This is sufficient performance to find an expert within one phone call, which was the original knowledge management objective.",
        "While we mentioned in Section 2.1 the value of taxonomic search engines, another area of preliminary success is in knowledge discovery.",
        "Several research groups are working to create more effective means to access multimedia information sources (Maybury 2000).",
        "Figure 2 illustrates MITRE’s Broadcast News Nagivator (BNN), the culmination of many years of research and an integration of multiple human language and other technologies (Merlino et al.",
        "1997).",
        "BNN applies speech, language, and image processing methods to segment, extract, and summarize broadcast news sources to enable personalized and targeted search of the news.",
        "Figure 2 shows the user querying stories from all sources for the last two weeks (19 April to 3 May 2001 at the time of writing) containing the keyword \"aegis\" and the location \"Taiwan\".",
        "People, organization, and locations menus are dynamically generated from extracted entities.",
        "9pm and 10 pm, CNN Headline News, CNN Morning Headline, CNN World Today, CNN World View, and CNN Moneyline).",
        "As shown in Figure 3, BNN presents a quick skim including a keyframe and the top 3 named entities for each retrieved story.",
        "Clicking on any of the keyframes brings the user to that story.",
        "Clicking on any of the named entities (people, places, organizations) brings the user to all stories mentioning that name.",
        "Using document clustering techniques, BNN further provides users with quick access to related stories.",
        "An extension of this system automatically mines correlations among named entities that appear across stories to detect and track novel topics."
