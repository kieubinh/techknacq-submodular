        "A better performance indicator would have been the number of users that access Ontology Server on a regular basis, but the authors mention that regular users are only a small percentage7.",
        "As remarked in Subsection 3.1.2, an objective evaluation of an Ontology as a standalone artifact is not feasible: the only possible success indicator is the (subjective) acceptance/rejection rate of the Ontology Engineer when inspecting the automatically extracted information.",
        "An Ontology can only be evaluated in a context in which many users of a community (e.g. Tourism operators in our application) access the Ontology on a regular basis and use this shared knowledge to increase their ability to communicate, access prominent information and documents, improve collaboration.",
        "Though a field evaluation of OntoTour is foreseen during the last months of the project, we believe that wide accessibility and a long-lasting monitoring of user behaviors would provide the basis for a sound evaluation of the OntoTour system.",
        "7 The system described by Farquhar and his colleagues, however, is not a specific Ontology, but a tool, Ontology Server, to help publishing, editing and browsing an Ontology."
