        "Conventional text retrieval systems respond to a user’s query by providing a (ranked) list of documents which potentially satisfy the information need.",
        "After having identified a number of documents which are actually relevant, the user reads some of those documents to get the information requested.",
        "To be sure to get a comprehensive account of a particular topic, the list of documents one has to read may be rather long, including a severe amount of redundancy; i.e., documents partially conveying the same information.",
        "Although this problems basically holds for any text retrieval situation, where comprehensiveness is relevant, it becomes particularly evident in the retrieval of news texts.",
        "News agencies, such as AP, BBC, CNN, or Reuters, often describe the same event differently.",
        "For instance, they provide different background information, helping the reader to situate the story, they interview different people to comment on an event, and they provide additional, conflicting or more accurate information, depending on their sources.",
        "To get a description of an event which is as comprehensive as possible and also as short as possible, a user has to compile his or her own description by taking parts of the original news stories, ignoring duplicate information.",
        "Typical users include journalists and intelligence analysts, for whom compiling and fusing information is an integral part of their work (Carbonell et al., 2000).",
        "Obviously, if done manually, this process can be rather laborious as it involves numerous comparisons, depending on the number and length of the documents.",
        "The aim of this paper is to describe an approach automatizing this process by fusing information stemming from different documents to generate a single comprehensive document, containing the information of all original documents without repeating information which is conveyed by two or more documents.",
        "The work described in this paper is closely related to the area of multi-document summarization (Barzilay et al., 1999; Mani and Bloedorn, 1999; McKeown and Radev, 1995; Radev, 2000), where related documents are analyzed to use frequently occurring segments for identifying relevant information that has to be included in the summary.",
        "Our work differs from the work on multi-document summarization as we focus on document fusion disregarding summarization.",
        "On the contrary, we are not aiming for the shortest description containing the most relevant information, but for the shortest description containing all information.",
        "For instance, even historic background information is included, as long as it allows the reader to get a more comprehensive description of an event.",
        "Although the techniques that are used for multi-document fusion and multi-document summarization are similar, the task of fusion is complementary to the summarization task.",
        "They differ in the way that, roughly speaking, multi-document summarization is the intersection of information within a topic, whereas multi-document fusion is the union of information.",
        "They are similar to the extent that in both cases nearly equivalent information stemming from different documents within the topic has to be identified as such.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the main components and challenges of implementing a document fusion system.",
        "Issues of evaluating document fusion and some preliminary evaluation of our system are presented in Section 3.",
        "In Section 4, some conclusions and prospects on future work are given."

        "Second, compiling paragraphs yields a better readability of the fused document.",
        "It should be noted that paragraphs are rather short in news stories, rarely being longer than three sentences.",
        "When putting together (fusing) pieces of text from different sources in a way that was not anticipated by the writers of the news stories, it can introduce information gaps.",
        "For instance, if a paragraph containing a pronoun is taken out of its original context and placed in a new context (the fused document), this can lead to dangling pronouns, which cannot be correctly resolved any-more.",
        "In general, this problem does not only hold for pronouns but for all kind of anaphoric expressions such as pronouns, definite noun phrases (e.g., the negotiations) and anaphoric adverbials (e.g., later).",
        "To cope with this problem simple segmentation is applied as a preprocessing step where paragraphs that contain pronouns or simple definite noun phrases are attached to the preceding paragraph.",
        "A more sophisticated approach to text segmentation is described in (Hearst, 1997).",
        "Obviously, it would be better to use an automatic anaphora resolution component to cope with this problem, see, e.g., (Kennedy and Bogu-raev, 1996; Kameyama, 1997), where anaphoric expressions are replaced by their antecedents, but at the moment, the integration of such a component remains future work."
