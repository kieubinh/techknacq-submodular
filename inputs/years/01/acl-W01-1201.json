        "When building a system to perform a task, the most important statistic is the performance on an end-to-end evaluation.",
        "For the task of open-domain question answering against text collections, there have been two large-scale end-to-end evaluations: (TREC-8 Proceedings, 1999) and (TREC-9 Proceedings, 2000).",
        "In addition, a number of researchers have built systems to take reading comprehension examinations designed to evaluate children’s reading levels (Charniak et al., 2000; Hirschman et al., 1999; Ng et al., 2000; Riloff and Thelen, 2000; Wang et al., 2000).",
        "The performance statistics have been useful for determining how well techniques work.",
        "However, raw performance statistics are not enough.",
        "If the score is low, we need to understand what went wrong and how to fix it.",
        "If the score is high, it is important to understand why.",
        "For example, performance may be dependent on characteristics of the current test set and would not carry over to a new domain.",
        "It would also be useful to know if there is a particular characteristic of the system that is central.",
        "If so, then the system can be streamlined and simplified.",
        "In this paper, we explore ways of gaining insight into question answering system performance.",
        "First, we analyze the impact of having multiple answer opportunities for a question.",
        "We found that TREC-8 Q/A systems performed better on questions that had multiple answer opportunities in the document collection.",
        "Second, we present a variety of graphs to visualize and analyze functions for ranking sentences.",
        "The graphs revealed that relative score instead of absolute score is paramount.",
        "Third, we introduce bounds on functions that use term overlap' to rank sentences.",
        "Fourth, we compute the expected score of a hypothetical Q/A system that correctly identifies the answer type for a question and correctly identifies all entities of that type in answer sentences.",
        "We found that a surprising amount of ambiguity remains because sentences often contain multiple entities of the same type.",

        "The answer candidates we consider are the sentences from the documents.",
        "The expected performance of a system that ranks all sentences using term overlap is 35% for the TREC-8 data.",
        "This number is an expected score because of ties: correct and incorrect candidates may have the same term overlap score.",
        "If ties are broken optimally, the best possible score (maximum) would be 54%.",
        "If ties are broken maximally suboptimally, the worst possible score (minimum) would be 24%.",
        "The corresponding scores on the CBC data are 58% expected, 69% maximum, and 51 % minimum.",

        "The probabilities are generated by normalizing the number of correct/incorrect answer candidates with a particular overlap score by the total number of correct/incorrect candidates, respectively.",
        "Figure 3 illustrates that the correct candidates for TREC-8 have term overlap scores distributed between 0 and 10 with a peak of 24% at an over",
        "lap of 2.",
        "However, the incorrect candidates have a similar distribution between 0 and 8 with a peak of 32% at an overlap of 0.",
        "The similarity of the curves illustrates that it is unclear how to use the score to decide if a candidate is correct or not.",
        "Certainly no static threshold above which a candidate is deemed correct will work.",
        "Yet the expected score of our TREC term overlap system was 35%, which is much higher than a random baseline which would get an expected score of less than 3% because there are over 40 sentences on average in newswire documents.6 After inspecting some of the data directly, we posited that it was not the absolute term overlap that was important for judging candidate but how the overlap score compares to the scores of other candidates.",
        "To visualize this, we generated new graphs by plotting the rank of a candidate’s score",
        "on the x-axis.",
        "For example, the candidate with the highest score would be ranked first, the candidate with the second highest score would be ranked second, etc.",

        "The ranked graphs are more revealing than the graphs of absolute scores: the probability of a high rank is greater for correct answers than incorrect ones.",

        "In addition, subset relations often hold between overlaps.",
        "A candidate whose overlap is a subset of a second candidate cannot score higher regardless of the weighting scheme.7 We formalize these overlap set relations and then calculate statistics based on them for the CBC and TREC data.",

        "However, we cannot generalize with respect to the relative scores of sentences containing Babe Belanger and those containing play amateur basketball because some terms may have higher weights than others.",
        "The most we can say is that the highest scoring candidate must be a member of {52, 541 or {531.",

        "Formally, the statistics for a set of questions Q are computed as: IQI1I{s Eo and sECq}I ∗X max q∈Qo∈M, The results for the TREC data are considerably lower than the results for the CBC data.",
        "One explanation may be that in the CBC data, only sentences from one document containing the answer are considered.",
        "In the TREC data, as in the TREC task, it is not known beforehand which documents contain answers, so irrelevant documents",
        "may contain high-scoring sentences that distract from the correct sentences.",
        "In Table 2, we present a detailed breakdown of the MaxOset results for the CBC data.",
        "(Note that the classifications overlap, e.g., questions that are in “there is always a chance to get it right” are also in the class “there may be a chance to get it right.”) 21% of the questions are literally impossible to get right using only term weighting because none of the correct sentences are in the MaxOsets.",
        "This result illustrates that maximal overlap sets can identify the limitations of a scoring function by recognizing that some candidates will always be ranked higher than others.",
        "Although our analysis only considered term overlap as a scoring function, maximal overlap sets could be used to evaluate other scoring functions as well, for example overlap sets based on semantic classes rather than lexical items.",
        "In sum, the upper bound for term weighting schemes is quite low and the lower bound is quite high.",
        "These results suggest that methods such as query expansion are essential to increase the feature sets used to score answer candidates.",
