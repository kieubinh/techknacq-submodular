        "textual Question/Answering (Q/A), represents the task of discovering the answer to an open-domain natural language question in large text collections.",
        "Answer mining became a topic of significant recent interest, partly due to the popularity of Internet Q/A services like AskJeeves and partly due to the recent evaluations of domain-independent Q/A systems organized in the context of the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC)1.",

        "evaluations of fully automatic Q/A systems specified two restrictions: (1) there is at least one document in the test collection that contains the answer to a test question; and (2) the answer length is either 50 contiguous bytes (short answers) or 250 contiguous bytes (long answers).",
        "These two requirements intentionally simplify the answer mining task, since the identification of the exact answer is left to the user.",
        "However, given that the expected information is recognized by inspecting text snippets of relatively small size, the TREC Q/A task took a step closer to information retrieval rather than document retrieval.",
        "Moreover, the techniques developed to extract text snippets where the answers might lie paved the way to a unified model for answer mining.",
        "To find the answer to a question several steps must be taken, as reported in (Abney et al., 2000) (Moldovan et al., 2000) (Srihari and Li, 2000): First, the question semantics needs to be captured.",
        "This translates into identifying (i) the expected answer type and (ii) the question keywords that can be used to retrieve text passages where the answer may be found.",
        "Secondly, the index of the document collection must be used to identify the text passages of interest.",
        "The retrieval method either employs special operators or simply modifies boolean or vector retrieval.",
        "Since the expected answer type is known at the time workshops organized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), designed to advance the state-of-the-art in information retrieval (IR) of the retrieval, the quality of the text passages is greatly improved by filtering out those passages where concepts of the same category as the answer type are not present.",
        "Thirdly, answer extraction takes place by combining several features that take into account the expected answer type.",
        "Since the expected answer type is the only information used in all the phases of textual Q/A, its recognition and usage is central to the performance of answer mining.",
        "For an open-domain Q/A system, establishing the possible answer types is a challenging problem.",
        "Currently, most of the systems recognize the answer type by associating the question stem (e.g. What, Who, Why or How) and one of the concepts from the question to a predefined general category, such as PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION, TIME, DATE, MONEY or NUMBER.",
        "Since many of these categories are represented in texts as named entities, their recognition as possible answers is enabled by state-of-the-art Named Entity (NE) recognizers, devised to work with high precision in Information Extraction (IE) tasks.",
        "To allow for NE-supported answer mining, a large number of semantic categories corresponding to various names must be considered, e.g. names of cars, names of diseases, names of dishes, names of boats, etc.",
        "Furthermore, a significant number of entities are not unique, therefore do not bear names, but are still potential answers to an open-domain question.",
        "Additionally, questions do not focus only on entities and their attributes; they also ask about events and their related entities.",
        "In this paper we introduce a model of answer types that accounts for answers to questions of various complexity.",
        "The model enables several different formats of the exact answer to open-domain questions and considers also the situation when the answer is produced from a number of different document sources.",
        "We define formally the answer types to open-domain questions and extend the recognition of answer types beyond the question processing phase, thus enabling several feedback mechanisms derived from the processing of documents and answers.",
        "The main contribution of the paper is in providing a unified model of answer mining from large collections of on-line documents that accounts for the processing of open-domain natural language questions of varied complexity.",
        "The hope is that a coherent model of the textual answer discovery could help developing better text mining methods, capable of acquiring and rapidly prototyping knowledge from the vast amount of on-line texts.",
        "Additionally, such a model enables the development of intelligent conversational agents that operate on open-domain tasks.",
        "We first present a background of Q/A systems and then define several classes of question complexity.",
        "In Section 3 we present the formal answer type model whereas in Section 4 we show how to recognize the answer type of open-domain questions and use it to mine the answer.",
        "Section 5 presents the evaluation of the model and summarizes the conclusions."

        "Furthermore, knowing the answer type and recognizing a text passage where the answer might be found is not sufficient for extracting the exact answer.",
        "We also need to know the dependencies between the answer type and the other concepts from the question or the answer.",
