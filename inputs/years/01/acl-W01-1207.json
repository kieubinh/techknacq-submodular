        "The Question Answering (QA) track at TREC8 and TREC9 is due to the recent need for more sophisticated paradigms in Information Retrieval (IR).",
        "Question answering generally refers to encyclopedic or factual questions that require concise answers.",
        "But current IR techniques do not yet enable a system to give precise answers to precise questions.",
        "Question answering is thus an area of IR that calls for Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques that can provide rich linguistic features as output.",
        "Such NLP modules should be deeply integrated in search and matching components so that answer selection can be performed on such linguistic features and take advantage of them.",
        "In addition, IR and NLP techniques have to collaborate in the resulting system in order to cope with large-scale and broad coverage text databases while deriving benefit from added knowledge.",
        "We developed a system for question answering, QALC, evaluated in the framework of the QA tracks at TREC8 and TREC9.",
        "The QALC system comprises NLP modules for multi-word term and named entity extraction with a specific concern for term conflation through variant recognition.",
        "Since named entity recognition has already been described extensively in other publications (Baluja 1999), we present the contribution of terminological variants to adding knowledge to our system.",
        "The two main activities involving terminology in NLP are term acquisition and term recognition.",
        "Basically, terms can be viewed as a particular type of lexical data.",
        "Term variation may involve structural, morphological, and semantic transformations of single or multi-words terms (Fabre and Jacquemin, 2000).",
        "In this paper, we describe how QALC uses high level indexes, made of terms and variants, to select among documents the most relevant ones with regard to a question, and then to match candidate answers with this question.",
        "In the selection process, the documents first retrieved by a search engine, are then postfiltered and ranked through a weighting scheme based on high level indexes, in order to retain the top ranked ones.",
        "Similarly, all systems that participated in TREC9 have a search engine component that firstly selects a subset of the provided database of about one million documents.",
        "Since a search engine produces a ranked list of relevant documents, systems then have to define the highest number of documents to retain.",
        "Indeed, having too many documents leads to a question processing time that is too long, but conversely, having too few documents reduces the possibility of obtaining the correct answer.",
        "For reducing the amount of text to process, one approach consists of keeping one or more relevant text paragraphs from each document retrieved.",
        "Kwok et al. (2000), for instance use an IR engine that retrieves the top 300 sub-documents of about 300-550 words and, on the other hand, the FALCON system (Harabagiu et all 2000) performs a paragraph retrieval stage after the application of a boolean retrieval engine.",
        "These systems work on the whole database and apply a bag-of-words technique to select passages whereas QALC first retains a large subset of documents, among which it then selects relevant documents by applying richer criteria based on the use of the linguistic structures of the words.",
        "QALC indexes, used for document selection, are made of single and multi-word terms retrieved by a 2-step procedure: (1) automatic term extraction from questions through part-of-speech tagging and pattern matching and (2) automatic document indexing through term recognition and variant conflation.",
        "As a result, linguistic variation is explicitly addressed through the exploitation of word paradigms, contrarily to other approaches like the one taken in COPSY (Schwarz 1988) where an approximate matching technique between the query and the documents implicitly takes it into account.",
        "Finally, terms acquired at step (1) and indexes from step (2) are also used by the matching procedure between a question and the relevant document sentences.",
        "In the next section, we describe the architecture of the QALC system.",
        "Then, we present the question processing for term extraction.",
        "We continue with the description of FASTR, a transformational shallow parser that recognizes and marks the extracted terms as well as their linguistic variants within the documents.",
        "The two following sections present the modules of the QALC system where terms and variants are used, namely the document selection and question/answer matching modules.",
        "Finally, we present the results obtained by the QALC system as well as an evaluation of the contribution of this NLP technique to the QA task through the use of the reference collections for the QA track.",
        "In conclusion, suggestions for more ambitious, but still realistic, developments using NLP are outlined."
