        "Information Extraction (IE) is an upcoming challenging research area to cope with the increasing volume of unwieldy distributed information resources, such as information over WWW.",
        "Among them, temporal information is regarded as an equally, if not more, important piece of information in domains where the task of extracting and tracking information over time occurs frequently, such as planning, scheduling and question-answering.",
        "It may be as simple as an explicit or direct expression in a written language, such as \"the company closed down in May, 1997\"; or it may be left implicit, to be recovered by readers from the surrounding texts.",
        "For example, one may know the fact that \"the company has closed down before the earthquake\", yet without knowing the exact time of the bankruptcy.",
        "Relative temporal knowledge such as this where the precise time is unavailable is typically determined by human.",
        "An information system which does not account for this properly is thus rather restrictive.",
        "It is hard to separate temporal information (in particular refers to temporal relations in this paper) discovery from natural language processing.",
        "In English, tenses and aspects reflected by different verb forms are important elements in a sentence for expressing temporal reference (Steed-man, 97) and for transforming situations into temporal logic operators (Bruce, 72).",
        "The pioneer work of Reichenbach (Reichenbach, 47) on tenses forms the basis of many subsequent research efforts in temporal natural language processing, e.g. the work of Prior in tense logic (Prior, 67), and of Hwang et al. in tense tree (Hwang 92) and temporal adverbial analysis (Hwang 94), etc.",
        "Reichenbach argued that the tense system provided predication over three underlying times, namely S (speech time), R (reference time), and E (event time).",
        "Later, a multiple temporal references model was introduced by Bruce (Bruce, 72).",
        "He defined the set (Sl, S2, ..., Sn), which is an element of a tense.",
        "S, corresponds to the time of speech.",
        "Each Si (i = 2,..., n – 1) is a time of reference, and Sn, the time of an event.",
        "To facilitate logic manipulation, Bruce proposed seven first order logic relations based on time intervals and a method to map nine English tenses into temporal first order logic expressions'.",
        "His work laid down the foundation of temporal logic in natural language.",
        "These relations were then gradually expanded to nine in (Allen, 81) and further to thirteen in (Allen, 83)2.",
        "In contrast, Chinese verbs appear in only one 'The seven relations are symbolized as R(A, B) for relation R and time intervals A and B, where R includes before, after, during, contains, same-time, overlaps or overlapped-by.",
        "zmeet, met-by, starts, started-by, finishes and finished-by are added into temporal relations.",
        "form.",
        "The lack of regular morphological tense markers renders Chinese temporal expressions complicated.",
        "For quite a long time, linguists argued whether tenses existed in Chinese; and if they did how are they expressed.",
        "We believe that Chinese do have tenses.",
        "But they are determined with the assistance of temporal adverbs and aspect auxiliary words.",
        "For example, A ... pJ (being), E, 4= ... 7 (was/been) and T ... (will be) express an ongoing action, a situation started or finished in the past, and a situation which will occur in the future, respectively.",
        "Therefore, the conventional theory to determine temporal information based on verb affixations is inapplicable.",
        "Over the past years, there has been considerable progress in the areas of information extraction and temporal logic in English (Antony, 87; Bruce, 72; Kaufmann, 97).",
        "Nevertheless, only a few researchers have investigated these areas in Chinese.",
        "The objective of our research is to design and develop a temporal information extraction system.",
        "For practical and cultural reason, the application target is on-line financial news in Chinese.",
        "The final system, referred to as TICS (Temporal Information-extraction from Chinese Sources), will accept a series of Chinese financial texts as input, analyze each sentence one by one to extract the desirable temporal information, represent each piece of information in a concept frame, link all frames together in chronological order based on inter or intra-event relations, and finally apply this linked knowledge to fulfill users' queries.",
        "In this paper, we introduce a fundamental model of TICS, which is designed to mine and organize temporal relations embedded in Chinese sentences.",
        "Three kinds of event expressions are accounted for, i.e. single event, multiple events and declared event(s).",
        "This work involved four major parts, (1) built temporal model; (2) constructed rules sets; (3) developed the algorithm; and (4) set up the experiments and performed the evaluation."
