        "This paper is concerned with the identification of two semantically close categories – temporal locating adverbials and time-denoting expressions.",
        "The dividing line between these categories is difficult to draw, inasmuch as there are several phrases that occur with the same surface form in the typical contexts of both of them (e.g. in adverbial position and as the complement of verbs like to date from).",
        "These ambivalent phrases include relatively simple expressions like yesterday or last week, but also – a fact that has gone practically unnoticed in the literature – structurally complex ones, like those headed by before, after, when or ago.",
        "In this paper, a uniform semantic categorisation of these phrases as mere time-denoting expressions is advocated and some of its consequences for the grammatical system are assessed.",
        "The analysis postulates a null locating preposition (with a value close to that of in) in the contexts where the ambivalent forms occur adverbially.",
        "A corollary is the partition of the set of particles traditionally classified as temporal locating into two sets: the truly locating ones – like in, during, since or until – and those that are mere heads of (structurally complex) time-denoting expressions – like before, after, between, when, ago, or from."

        "In this paper, Portuguese and English – chosen as examples of the Romance and Germanic families – will be the object languages in an attempt to draw a dividing line between two semantically close subcategories of temporal phrases – time-denoting expressions and temporal locating adverbials (henceforth TDEs and TLAs, respectively).",
        "Nevertheless, the advocated hypotheses are expected to apply to comparable expressions in other languages as well.",
        "The formal framework for analysis will be the Discourse Representation Theory (DRT).",
        "In general informal terms, the difference between TDEs and TLAs can be put as follows: the former include (direct or indirect1) representations of intervals, or sets of intervals, while the latter include phrases which locate entities (e.g. eventualities) on the time axis.",
        "Often, the distinction between them is unproblematic:",
        "(1) a. Portugal became a Republic [in [1910]].",
        "b.",
        "Several epidemics swept through",
        "Europe [during [the 14th century]].",
        "In these examples, the expressions within the inner brackets − 1910, the 14th century − are clearly TDEs, while the prepositional phrases that contain them as complements − in 1910,",
        "during the 14th century – are TLAs, which temporally locate the eventualities represented in the remainder of the clause.",
        "Sometimes, however, the dividing line between these two categories is unclear.",
        "This is due namely to the existence of expressions that can surface with exactly the same form in the typical contexts (to be defined below, in section 2) of both TDEs and TLAs, hence appearing to be ambivalent.",
        "This is the case of relatively simple expressions like English now, then, yesterday, and last week, for instance (or their approximate Portuguese counterparts agora, então, ontem, and a semana passada, respectively).",
        "See the following pairs of sentences, where the expressions in italics occur in a typical context of a TDE (namely as the complement of since or until) in the a sentences, and in a typical context of a TLA (namely in adverbial position) in b:",
        "(2) a. John has been in Paris since yesterday.",
        "b. John left the hospital yesterday.",
        "(3) a.",
        "Until then, John had been happy.",
        "b.",
        "Then, John felt very miserable.",
        "(4) a. John has been in Paris since last week.",
        "b. John left for Paris last week.",
        "More interestingly, this is also the case of relatively more complex expressions, which include a temporal preposition (or prepositional-like particle), such as English before, after, between, when, ago or from (or their approximate Portuguese counterparts antes, depois, entre, quando, há and de (...a) respectively):",
        "(5) a. John has been a clerk since before 1980. b. John graduated before 1980.",
        "(6) a. John was a clerk until three years ago.",
        "b. John graduated three years ago.",
        "This distribution raises a categorisation issue that I will try to tackle in this paper, namely whether this kind of apparently ambivalent phrases should be regarded as temporal locating adverbials, as time-denoting expressions or as both.",
        "My contention here will be that they should (all) be taken as mere time-denoting expressions, i.e. expressions that denote intervals, or sets of intervals, but that do not – just by themselves – locate eventualities on the time axis, therefore requiring the presence of an – explicit or implicit – temporal preposition like in, during, since, until, or the like, when used adverbially.",
        "Before proceeding to the arguments, let us briefly consider some basic semantic and syntactic properties of the categories under analysis.",
        "2 Basic semantic and syntactic characterisation The semantic characterisation of TDEs and TLAs, already briefly sketched above, is next formulated.",
        "Time-denoting expressions represent intervals or sets of intervals.",
        "They do not, just by themselves, locate the eventualities (or other entities) described in the structures to which they apply.",
        "Formally, within a DRT- framework, a given time-denoting expression TDE simply introduces a time discourse referent t, together with a condition of the form TDE (t).",
        "TDEs may (but need not) occur as part of a TLA – cf. Paulo died in 1980 vs. 1980 was a splendid year.",
        "Temporal locating adverbials contribute a more complex meaning.",
        "More specifically, I assume that they play two concurrent roles (cf. M6ia 2000a, for details): (i) they define the location time of the sentence – t – out of the interval represented by the complement TDE of the temporal preposition – tc – , i.e. that state that some relation R holds between the two intervals: R (t, tc); for instance, tc may coincide with t (with e.g. in or during-phrases), or set one of its boundaries (with e.g. since or until-phrases); (ii) they contribute to defining a relation R′ (e.g. overlap or inclusion) between the location time t and the located eventuality ev (which is described in the basic sentence) – R′ (ev, t).",
        "These differences in denotation go, quite naturally, on a par with differences in distribution.",
        "An obvious one involves the (im)possibility of direct combination with eventuality descriptions.",
        "Being mere designators of intervals, or sets of intervals, TDEs – as such – are expected not to combine directly with descriptions of eventualities, this combination requiring the presence of a locating particle, such as during or in.",
        "This clearly tells 1910 apart from in 1910, for instance: (7) Portugal became a Republic *(in) 1910.",
        "Conversely, other contexts are apparently exclusive to TDEs.",
        "In these contexts, temporal expressions headed by e.g. in, during, since or until cannot (in principle) occur.",
        "Four of such contexts are described as follows: (i) arguments of temporal nominal predicates like period, year, or month – cf. (8a) – or of non-temporal predicates (like terrible or disaster) representing properties that can be predicated of time stretches – cf. (8b); (ii) arguments of equative be, in constructions where the other member of the equation is an (undisputed) TDE – cf. (8c); (iii) (normally prepositioned) complements of temporal predicates, like schedule (for), date (from) or date back (to) – cf. (8d-e); (iv) complements of temporal prepositions like since or until:– cf. (8f):",

        "e. This bridge dates from (*in) the 12th century.",
        "f. Portugal has been a Republic since (*in) 1910.",
        "Many temporal expressions only occur in the typical contexts of TDEs, and can therefore, rather uncontroversially, be classified as such.",
        "Some examples in Portuguese and English are: o seculo XX / the 20th century, os anos 70 / the seventies, o anode 1910 / the year 1910, Janeiro / January, 11 de Outubro / October 11, as tres horas / three o’ clock, or o meio-dia / noon.",

        "In general, the (non-)mandatory character of the preposition in this type of constructions seems to be syntactically or lexically determined, varying from language to language for parallel expressions.",
        "Note, for instance, that the grammatical English equivalent of (9) is obligatorily non-prepositioned, while the counterpart of (10) is prepositioned.",
        "A second (larger) group of apparently ambivalent phrases includes expressions that systematically occur without any (explicit) temporal locating particle in adverbial position.",
        "English expressions like last week, or referentially dependent English and Portuguese adverbs like today / hoje, yesterday / ontem, tomorrow / amanhd, now / agora, and then / entdo belong in this group.",
        "Accordingly, the main difference with respect to the first one (mentioned above) is the ungrammaticality of the use of a temporal preposition like English in or Portuguese em in sentences where these expressions occur adverbially:",

        "The non-prepositioned adverbial cases illustrated in sentences (9)-(12) above are treated by many authors − regarding English and other languages − as involving a null preposition with a value close to that of in (or on or at, depending on the complement).",
        "Examples are Asher et al.",
        "(1995: 109) for the French adverbial hier [yesterday], and Kamp and Reyle (1993), for the English adverbials with last: “from a semantic viewpoint last Sunday functions rather like a prepositional phrase, with an empty preposition whose semantic contribution is the same as that of on in on Sunday.",
        "This is what we assume the syntax of the adverb last Sunday to be” (p. 623).",
        "At this point, it must be stressed that, under this “null preposition analysis”, the expressions at stake are not ambivalent: they are mere time-denoting phrases in all the contexts in which they occur.",
        "The property that distinguishes them from other “canonical” TDEs (like 1910) is the fact that they can − or must − occur with a null locating preposition, when they are used adverbially.",
        "I will embrace this analysis and will, furthermore, advocate – departing in this case from the analyses currently adopted in the semantic literature – that several other expressions that are normally treated as “canonical” TLAs should be put on a par with those just mentioned, i.e. they should also be treated as mere time-denoting expressions that in adverbial contexts occur with a null locating preposition.",
        "These are namely the structurally complex expressions headed by the English particles before, after, between, when, ago, or from (and possibly others, similar to them), and their counterparts in Portuguese, and possibly other languages (cf. Table 1 below).",

        "Spatial homonyms of temporal locating prepositions – e.g. English in, on, at, through(out), from... to, or Portuguese em, atraves, desde, a partir de, ate, de... a – clearly qualify as spatial locating particles.",
