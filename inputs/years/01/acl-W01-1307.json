        "It is well known that tense, grammatical and pred-icational aspect are very important clues in the process of temporal interpretation of sentences, and of texts (see (Kamp and Rohrer, 1983) among others).",
        "As far as discourse level is concerned, it has been shown that world knowledge and knowledge about discourse structure play a role in determining the text global temporal structure (Lascarides and Asher, 1993; Caenepeel and Moens, 1994).",
        "In this paper we want to focus on the role of connectives and their intersentential semantics.",
        "We want to give an account of the way some temporal connectives in French interact with discourse relations.",
        "We will examine differences in the behavior of two connectives, namely puis (then, afterwards) and un peu plus tard (a bit later), when different discourse relations hold.",
        "At first sight, the temporal contribution of these two connectives should show little or no difference.",
        "We will see that matters are not so simple.",
        "This direction of work is inspired by a study of puis showing differences in behaviour according to the discourse relation at stake (Bras et al., 2001).",
        "It is also grounded on previous studies of adverbials of temporal location and adverbials of spatial location and of their role to build the spatio-temporal structure of discourse (Asher et al., 1994; Asher et al., 1995a; Asher et al., 1995b; Asher et al., 2001).",
        "We showed that, in the context of trajectories, relational adverbials like un peu plus tard and its spatial counterpart un peu plus loin (a bit further) had symetric roles in the process of locating the eventualities in space and time, and could both be given the same spatio-temporal interpretation.",
        "We will tackle a comparative analysis of connectives within the framework of a theory of discourse structure and discourse relations.",
        "We have chosen Segmented Discourse Representation Theory (SDRT) for its effective methodology in investigating and formalizing how different linguistic clues interact at the semantic/pragmatic interface to recover the discourse structure of a text.",
        "We will first briefly present SDRT (section 2), and the Discourse Relations (section 3) that we will use for our contrastive analysis ofpuis and un peu plus tard with respect to Discourse Structure (section 4)."

        "This is what axiom (A1) expresses: A 1 Narration post pre (A1) aims at capturing the fact that narratives must cohere in the sense that the events linked together by Narration must fit consistently and without significant spatio-temporal gaps as expressed in (Asher, 1996) and observed in earlier work on temporal order in narratives (see for example (Caenepeel, 1989)).",
        "This doesn’t mean that there should be no interval of time between the two events and , but rather that no relevant event can occur during this interval.",

        "So we propose here an improved version of (A1), where denotes the “intersection” operator 4: A 2 Narration ✜post pre Narration has another semantic effect.",
        "It is motivated by the intuition that the elements of a Narration must belong to the “same story\", i.e., they must have some common subject matter.",

        "Now, how do we infer Narration?",
        "Since (Lascarides and Asher, 1993), the triggering axioms for Narration have changed to reflect the fact that Narration is not always a default in narratives (Asher, 1996).",
        "It is only a default if no other relation can be inferred, that is, if in the discourse there are no clues that other axioms could exploit to infer other discourse relations: A 4 Clues_",

        "Occasion holds if the two clauses contain clues indicating that their main eventualities are of types that may belong to “the same story\".",
        "In other words, Occasion exploits lexical semantics and shared knowledge in terms of scripts connecting certain event types in sequences in which one event “naturally\" leads to the next.",

        "From the Discourse Structure point of view, we have shown that puis is a marker of Strong-Narration, involving the notion of telling the “same story” (topic), whereas un peu plus tard blocks Strong-Narration and licences Weak-Narration, involving no more semantic effects than temporal succession.",

        "On the one hand, puis has an important role at the rhetorical level, which is no surprise given its conjunct character.",
        "On the other hand, un peu plus tard is not the purely temporal adverbial that one could expect, since it is capable of blocking some discourse relations, among which Strong-Narration, the usual case of Narration.",
