        "This paper analyzes the semantics of while as reflecting the grammaticalization of its TEMPORAL meaning.",
        "While grammaticalization is generally studied as the linguistic change from more lexical to more grammatical form and meaning, our investigation is concerned with the synchronic variation between lexically autonomous and contextually dependent meaning with the current use of English while and its translation into German.",
        "This view on grammaticalization allows the typological study of a variety of grammatical functions across languages (Hopper and Traugott, 1993, 90).",
        "From a typological point of view we are particularly interested in the persistence of grammaticalization.",
        "In the ideal case we may observe how different grammatical functions of the same form are synchronically constrained by their lexical sources (Hopper and Traugott, 1993, 120).",
        "Consider the following cross–language comparison of verbs which express the lexical sense of a DIRECTIONAL MOTION alongside with the grammatical sense of the FUTURE:",
        "(1) English: to be going to, to come (2) German: gehen, kommen (3) French: ˆetre en train de, aller faire (4) Spanish: ir a",
        "The lexical meanings of these MOTION verbs coexist with the grammatical meaning of the FUTURE.",
        "The domain of SPACE provides the lexical source of the grammatical domain of TIME (Bybee et al., 1994, 269).",
        "This is an obvious extension from more lexical to more grammatical categorization which speakers create by a change from one domain to another and it is therefore a metaphorical extension.",
        "In this metaphorical transfer the domain of SPACE provides a model for the domain of TIME.",
        "The periphrastic constructions in (1) to (4) provide evidence for this direction of development, which has been attested for a wide number of languages (Bybee et al., 1994).",
        "Yet, the TEMPORAL sense represents a conversational implicature of the SPATIAL sense as SPATIAL MOTION logically presupposes EXTENSION through TIME.",
        "This grammaticalization by metaphorical transfer reduces the speakers’ reference from reference to SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL DIRECTION to reference to TEMPORAL DIRECTION.",
        "The semantic reduction strengthens the informativity and relevance of the TEMPORAL meaning (Hopper and Traugott, 1993, 65).",
        "Yet the general semantic schema of a DIRECTION FROM SOURCE TO GOAL is preserved in this transfer.",
        "As may be seen with the above given examples, the same series of semantic transitions or “clines” reoccur with different lexical units both within one and the same language, as with the English MOTION verbs go and come, and across languages, as with the equivalents go in English, gehen in German, aller in French and finally ir in Spanish.",
        "These clines are also similar across languages which are areally and genetically unrelated.",
        "The claim is therefore that these clines are universal and in most cases irreversible pathways of semantic change, that is we cannot observe speakers to be involved in a semantic extension from the domain of TIME to the domain of SPACE.",
        "This is the universal cognitive principle of unidirectionality (Hopper and Traugott, 1993, 1,6); (Bybee et al., 1994, 19,300).",
        "This paper will provide a theory about unidirectionality from the perspective of cognitive linguistics which will be evaluated and formalized by the grammaticalization cline of while.",
        "Finally we will discuss which implications the grammaticalization cline of while has for a our theory of unidirectionality."

        "The composition of a composite structure may thus be represented by a unification–based model par excellence (Zelinsky-Wibbelt, 2000).",
        "In terms of this formalism composition occurs through the unification of attribute–value structures.",
        "At each level these structures consist of an attribute on the left– hand side and a value on the right–hand side: In this schematic attribute–value matrix the lexical unit LU is the only variable specified by a simplex value V. The attribute LU is conjoined by the attribute N, N being paired with the complex value consisting of the attribute–value pair T A. Integers represent the inheritance from free to bound categories.",
        "In accordance with Gutt (1991, 189), we claim that translators produce an equivalent target language text by following the principle of relevance.",
        "As communication in general translation involves the comparison of interpretations as a universal disposition of human reasoning (Sperber and Wilson, 1995, 46ff.).",
