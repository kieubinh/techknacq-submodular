        "The set of these expressions investigated in the present paper includes dates (e.g. 08.04.2001), prepositional phrases (PPs) containing some time expression (e.g. on Friday), and verbs referring to a situation (e.g. opened).",
        "Related work by Mani and Wilson (2000) focuses only on the core temporal expressions neglecting the temporal information conveyed by prepositions (e.g. Friday vs. by Friday).",
        "The main part of the system is a temporal expression tagger that employs finite state transducers based on handwritten rules.",
        "The tagger was trained on economic news articles obtained from two German news papers and an on-line news agency (Financial Times Deutschland, die tageszeitung and www.",
        "comdirect .",
        "de).",
        "Based on the syntactic classification of temporal expressions a semantic representation of the extracted chunks is proposed.",
        "A clear-cut distinction between the syntactic tagging process and the semantic interpretation is maintained.",
        "The advantage of this approach is that a second level is created that represents the meaning of the extracted chunks.",
        "Having defined the semantic representation of the temporal expressions, further inferences, in particular on temporal relations, can be drawn.",
        "Establishing the temporal relations between all events mentioned by a news article is the ultimate goal of this enterprise.",
        "However, at the current stage of this work the semantic analysis is still in progress.",
        "For the time being, we focus on the anchoring of the temporal expressions in the absolute time line and present an already substantial subset of a full semantics that will eventually cover the entire set of temporal expressions extracted.",
        "Finally, the evaluation of the temporal expression tagger provides precision and recall rates for tagging temporal expressions and drawing temporal inferences."

        "The same phenomenon holds with dieser Monatserste (‘this first day of the month’) In the following we will apply the granularity structure of temporal expressions only with respect to the finer than - coarser than relation between levels of granularity, which is different from the is part of relation between temporal entities.",
