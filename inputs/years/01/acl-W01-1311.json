        "Many natural language processing applications, such as information extraction, question answering, topic detection and tracking, would benefit significantly from the ability to accurately position reported events in time, either relatively with respect to other events or absolutely with respect to calendrical time.",
        "To date relatively little work has been done on the extraction of temporal information from text.",
        "The Message Understanding Conferences (MUCs) addressed the problem in a limited way.",
        "So for example, the MUC6 named entity subtask required the identification of absolute time expressions in text (MUC6, 1995), and the MUC-7 named entity subtask extended this requirement to include relative time expressions (MUC7, 1998), but neither of these tasks required placing events in time, or temporally relating events to each other.",
        "The MUC-5 and MUC-7 scenario tasks required participants to assign a calendrical time just to the specified scenario event types (joint venture announcements and rocket launchings, respectively), but this is a limited task and the scores were low, indicating its difficulty.",
        "More recently the TIDES Temporal Guidelines (Ferro et al., 2000) have been developed – a very thorough set of guidelines for annotating time expressions.",
        "These will clearly supercede the MUC named entity guidelines for time expressions, but again are not setting out to annotate events and temporal relations between events or between events and times.",
        "In Setzer and Gaizauskas (2000a) we introduced an annotation scheme which does address these issues.",
        "While our guidelines also require the annotation of time expressions (and are much less detailed in this regard than the TIDES guidelines, which we are happy to adopt more or less completely), our guidelines go well beyond annotating time expressions and also describe how to annotate events and the temporal relations between events and other events or events and times.",
        "Thus our work should be seen as essentially complementary to the TIDES work, and in our view explores where annotation of temporal information in text should go next.",
        "We have now carried out a pilot study in which a group of annotators has been supplied with our temporal annotation guidelines and asked to apply the annotation scheme to a trial corpus.",
        "In particular we were interested in answers to these questions:",
        "• how unambiguous and comprehensive are our temporal guidelines?",
        "• how much genuine disagreement is there about temporal relations in text?",
        "• how burdensome is our annotation pro",
        "cedure?",
        " – – i.e. is it feasible to think of annotating a corpus of significant size at this level of detail?",
        "This paper discusses the design of the pilot study, its outcome and the answers to these questions, insofar as we have been able to determine them.",
        "2 Annotating Temporal Information in Text In this section we briefly introduce the annotation scheme we propose.",
        "This scheme has been introduced in detail in Setzer and Gaizauskas (2000a; 2000b) to which the reader should turn for more information."

        "Before we can propose an annotation scheme we must make clear the temporal entities and temporal relations we suppose exist.",
        "Our temporal ontology is a pragmatic one aimed at enabling us to identify events, determine their relative temporal order and, if possible, position them in calendrical time.",
        "It is not aimed at deriving at a philosophically `true' description of temporal reality.",
        "We provide an intuitive and restricted set of temporal entities and relations which enables us to achieve our goal to a certain extent.",
        "We presume the world contains the following primitive types: events, times, temporal relations and event identity.",
        "Events Intuitively an event is something that happens, something that one can imagine putting on a time map.",
        "Events have to be anchorable in time, and they are usually conveyed by finite verbs and some nominal-isations.",
        "Events can be ongoing or conceptually instantaneous, we do not distinguish between these.",
        "For example, the sentence A small single-engine plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean conveys an event.",
        "Times Like events, times can be viewed as having extent (intervals) or as being punctual (points).",
        "Both are treated as time objects.",
        "A time object must, however, be capable of being placed on a time line.",
        "Examples of time objects are last Tuesday, April 4, 1998 and March 1997 and also the referents of more complex expressions like 17 seconds after the crash.",
        "Temporal Relations Events stand in certain temporal relations to other events and to times, as in the following two examples.",
        "The plane crashed after the pilot and his crew ejected and A small single engine plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean on Wednesday.",
        "The full set of temporal relations we suppose at present is before, after, includes, included and simultaneous.",
        "This is a minimal set defined after a number of newswire articles had been analysed; it can easily be expanded should it prove useful or necessary.",
        "Event Identity In newswire articles, events are usually referred to more than once, with subsequent references giving more detailed information.",
        "Event identity proves a useful and comparatively easily annotated relation.",
        "In Setzer (2000a), we also included subeventness as an additional event relation to be annotated.",
        "This has been excluded in the current work because subeventness is very difficult to define and poses a significant additional burden on annotators."

        "Further should A happen before B and B before C, then A happens before C, but in the absence of any explicit relational expression in the text, an annotator may or may not explicitly annotate the relation.",
