        "The processing of temporal information poses numerous challenges for NLP.",
        "Progress on these challenges may be accelerated through the use of corpus-based methods.",
        "This paper introduces a set of guidelines for annotating time expressions with a canonicalized representation of the times they refer to, and describes methods for extracting such time expressions from multiple languages.",
        "Applications that can benefit include information extraction (e.g., normalizing temporal references for database entry), question answering (answering “when” questions), summarization (temporally ordering information), machine translation (translating and normalizing temporal references), and information visualization (viewing event chronologies).",
        "Our annotation scheme, described in detail in (Ferro et al.",
        "2000), has several novel features, including the following: It goes well beyond the one used in the Message Understanding Conference (MUC7 1998), not only in terms of the range of expressions that are flagged, but, also, more importantly, in terms of representing and normalizing the time values that are communicated by the expressions.",
        "In addition to handling fully-specified time expressions (e.g., September 3rd, 1997), it also handles context-dependent expressions.",
        "This is significant because of the ubiquity of context-dependent time expressions; a recent corpus study (Mani and Wilson 2000) revealed that more than two-thirds of time expressions in print and broadcast news were context-dependent ones.",
        "The context can be local (within the same sentence), e.g., In 1995, the months of June and July were devilishly hot, or global (outside the sentence), e.g., The hostages were beheaded that afternoon.",
        "A subclass of these context-dependent expressions are ‘indexical’ expressions, which require knowing when the speaker is speaking to determine the intended time value, e.g., now, today, yesterday, tomorrow, next Tuesday, two weeks ago, etc.",
        "The annotation scheme has been designed to meet the following criteria:",
        "• Simplicity with precision: We have tried to keep the scheme simple enough to be executed confidently by humans, and yet precise enough for use in various natural language processing tasks.",
        "• Naturalness: We assume that the annotation",
        "scheme should reflect those distinctions that a human could be expected to reliably annotate, rather than reflecting an artificially-defined smaller set of distinctions that automated systems might be expected to make.",
        "This means that some aspects of the annotation will be well beyond the reach of current systems.",
        "• Expressiveness: The guidelines require that",
        "one specify time values as fully as possible, within the bounds of what can be confidently inferred by annotators.",
        "The use of ‘parameters’ and the representation of ‘granularity’ (described below) are tools to help ensure this.",
        "• Reproducibility: In addition to leveraging",
        "the (ISO-8601 1997) format for representing time values, we have tried to ensure consistency among annotators by providing an example-based approach, with each guideline closely tied to specific examples.",
        "While the representation accommodates both points and intervals, the guidelines are aimed at using the point representation to the extent possible, further helping enforce consistency.",
        "The annotation process is decomposed into two steps: flagging a temporal expression in a document (based on the presence of specific lexical trigger words), and identifying the time value that the expression designates, or that the speaker intends for it to designate.",
        "The flagging of temporal expressions is restricted to those temporal expressions which contain a reserved time word used in a temporal sense, called a ‘lexical trigger’, which include words like day, week, weekend, now, Monday, current, future, etc."

        "Although the guidelines were developed with detailed examples drawn from English (along with English-specific tokenization rules and guidelines for determining tag extent), the semantic representation we use is intended for use across languages.",
        "This will permit the development of temporal taggers for different languages trained using a common annotation scheme.",
        "It will also allow for new methods for evaluating machine translation of temporal expressions at the level of interpretation as well as at the surface level.",
        "As discussed in (Hirschman et al.",
        "2000), time expressions generally fall into the class of so-called named entities, which includes proper names and various kinds of numerical expressions.",
        "The translation of named entities is less variable stylistically than the translation of general text, and once predictable variations due to differences in transliteration, etc.",
        "are accounted for, the alignment of the machine-translated expressions with a reference translation produced by a human can readily be accomplished.",
        "A variant of the word-error metric used to evaluate the output of automatic speech transcription can then be applied to produce an accuracy score.",
        "In the case of our current work on temporal expressions, it will also be possible to use the normalized time values to participate in the alignment and scoring."

        "of-day, or a combination of both, e.g., Monday 3 pm, Monday next week, a Friday, early Tuesday morning, the weekend.",

        "annotator to represent the values, where possible, of temporal expressions that do not indicate a specific time.",

        "Our approach would be (1) to run the tagger over the desired text corpora; (2) to run the concordance creation utility over the annotated version of the same corpora, using not only TIMEX2 tags but also lexical trigger words as input criteria; and (3) to partition the output of the creation utility into entries that are tagged as temporal expressions and entries that are not so tagged.",
        "We can then review the untagged entries to discover classes of cases that are not yet covered by the tagger (and hence, possibly not yet covered by the guidelines), and we can review the tagged entries to discover any spuriously tagged cases that may correspond to guidelines that need to be tightened up.",
        "We also expect to create and distribute multilingual corpora annotated according to these guidelines.",
