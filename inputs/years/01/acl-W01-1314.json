        "The identification and the interpretation of temporal and aspectual information plays an important role in text understanding.",
        "This information is encoded in the natural languages by a wide array of linguistic means ranging from grammatical (morpho-syntactic) to lexical (verbs and adverbials) or strictly syntactic phenomena (temporal anaphora (Webber, 1988) or argument structure of the verb (Verkuyl, 1993)).",
        "In this paper we present a system for identification of lexical non-verbal means of expressing temporal information in French texts.",
        "The system detects adverbs (e.g. yesterday), adverbial noun phrases (e.g. three days before the marriage of his youngest son) and adverbial expressions (e.g. at 10 o'clock), regardless of their number and complexity.",
        "Unlike some other approaches in temporal annotation (Ferro et al., 2001), this system identifies exclusively temporal expressions answering when-questions.",
        "Hence, the system will flag expressions which specify the time of occurrence of the situations (e.g. John received the letter on May 10th) and will skip those modifying lexical units (e.g. John received her letter of May 10th).",
        "The identification of the temporal expressions is based on a context-scanning strategy (CSS) (De-scles, 1997) which is carried out by two complementary techniques: search for regular expressions and left-to-right and right-to-left chart-parsing.",
        "The first technique looks for a particular set of markers (regular expressions) encoding temporal information.",
        "These markers can be standalone or parsing-triggering.",
        "The standalone markers are inactive chart elements (not necessarily a single word) which represent autonomous temporal expressions.",
        "The adverb then in Then, this was the only solution is an example of a standalone marker.",
        "The second technique of the CSS is launched, if the system identifies a parsing-triggering marker.",
        "The parsing-triggering markers are active chart elements which signal the presence of a larger temporal expression (for example before in three weeks before Christmas) and trigger a chart-parsing procedure for its identification.",
        "The chart-parsing scans the left and the right context of the marker in order to determine which lexical units from this context belong to the temporal expression.",
        "The identified entire temporal expression represents a temporal marker (inactive chart element) generated incrementally by association of chart elements situated to the left and to the right of the parsing-triggering marker (the initial active chart element) (Wonsever and Minel, 2001).",
        "The present paper is organised in 5 sections.",
        "Section 2 is a short presentation of the CSS as a method for goal-oriented information extraction.",
        "Section 3 discusses the classification of the markers into standalone and parsing triggering.",
        "Section 4 shows a procedure launched by standalone markers, namely, the identification of exclusion zones.",
        "In turn, section 5 presents the chart-parsing rules with the various semantic and syntactic constraints on their realisation.",
        "The architecture of the system is shown in section 6.",
        "2 The underlying principles of the context-scanning strategy The context-scanning strategy (CSS) (Descles et al., 1997; Minel and Descles, 2000) is based on the hypothesis that the semantic representations are not necessarily determined by world knowledge but can be considered as configurations integrating elements of local linguistic information.",
        "The interaction of these elements is controlled by a set of mechanisms which build the semantic representation by putting together all the pieces of local information.",
        "The elements of this representation can be derived from grammar or lexical semantics and from some syntactic phenomena which together account for the non-atomic (holistic) com-positionality of semantic representations.",
        "This hypothesis allows to formulate the two distinctive features of the CSS:",
        "• The CSS is designed to carry out a very specific task: to identify and interpret all the surface linguistic elements which account for a particular semantic representation.",
        "It does not claim to provide a complete analysis of texts.",
        "• The CSS extracts sets of interactive elements integrated in complex semantic representations.",
        "Unlike the approaches based on world knowledge, it deduces these representations using exclusively linguistic data found in the text.",
        "The system presented in this paper satisfies both features.",
        "The specific task of the system (first feature) is to indentify all non-verbal linguistic units which can convey temporal information and to group them in sets.",
        "These sets are called temporal expressions and may contain one or more members.",
        "All temporal expressions are considered as semantic functions whose argument is the semantic value of the grammatical tense in the analysed utterance.",
        "The result of the application of this function to its argument is the semantic (aspecto-temporal) value of the entire utterance.",
        "Thus, the identification of the temporal expressions is an important step in the deduction of a semantic representation which integrates information from different linguistic units (second feature).",
        "Utterances in 1 and 2 show the role of the temporal expressions in this deduction.",
        "Example 1 denotes an event which took place before the utterance time.",
        "In turn, the lack of temporal expression in 2 entails a double interpretation: the utterance can refer either to the fact of Jeanne's departure in a past moment, or to the fact that Jeanne is absent at the moment of utterance.",
        "This ambiguity is manifested in the English translation of 2.",
        "(1) Jeanne est partie trois minutes avant Pierre.",
        "„Jeanne left three minutes before Pierre.",
        "(2) Jeanne est partie.",
        "„Jeanne left/has left.",
        "The discussion in this paper will focus only at the first feature of the implemented CSS, namely, the identification and regrouping of linguistic units into temporal expressions.",
        "As it was mentioned in the introduction, the identification of the temporal expressions is carried out at two steps: identification of markers (stand-alone and parsing-triggering) and chart-parsing applied to the left/right context of the parsing triggering markers.",
        "These steps will be discussed in detail in the three following sections."

        "5.2.2 Semantic constraints on the lexical units Another constraint in the chart-parsing rules is the condition on the semantics of the lexical units in the context of the marker.",
        "This constraint affects exclusively the nouns in the left context of the markers from the set M3 (see section 3).",
        "Actually, the left context of these markers is a modifier of the expression constitued by the marker and its right context.",

        "Else, if the last verb is not preceded by one of the above elements, it belongs to the main clause and stands for the predicate of the grammatical subject - the element modified by the relative clause (example 15).",
