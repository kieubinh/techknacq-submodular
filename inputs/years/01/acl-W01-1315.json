        "In interpreting narratives the most essential information to be extracted is who did what where, when and why, the classic journalistic imperatives.",
        "The ‘who’ and ‘what’ information is usually expressed overtly, and this has made it possible to apply empirical techniques to problems in this domain (such as word-sense classification and argument structure mapping).",
        "The ‘when’ and ‘where’ information is, however, often left implicit, or, at least, only partially specified, making it difficlut to apply such techniques to this domain.",
        "Formal semantic theories of temporal interpretation (e.g. Kamp & Reyle 1993; Ogihara 1996; Abusch 1997) have been quite successful at specifying the contribution that such overt markers as tenses and temporal adverbials make to the meaning of a sentence or discourse.",
        "Investigations into the interpretation of narrative discourse (Lascarides & Asher 1993, Reyle & Rossdeutscher 2000) have, however, shown that very specific lexical information plays an important role in determining temporal interpretation.",
        "As of yet it is not clear how this kind of lexical information could be automatically acquired.",
        "The most promising avenue for acquiring lexical information appears to be automatic induction from very large annotated corpora (Rooth, et.",
        "al.",
        "1998).",
        "In order to apply these techniques to the temporal domain it is necessary that the temporal information be made explicit.",
        "Our task here is to provide a system of temporal annotation that fulfills this requirement.",
        "The systems for temporal annotation we are familiar with have been concerned either with absolute temporal information (Wiebe, et.",
        "al.",
        "1998, Androutsopoulos, Rithie & Thanisch 1997), or with the annotation of overt markers (Setzer & Gaizauskas 2000).",
        "Much temporal information, however, is not absolute but relative and not overtly marked but implicit.",
        "We are frequently only interested (and only have information about) the order events occurred in.",
        "And while there are sometimes overt markers for these temporal relations, the conjunctions before, after and when being the most obvious, usually this kind of relational information is implicit.",
        "The examples in (1) illustrate the phenomenon.",
        "(1) a. John kissed the girl he met at the party.",
        "b.",
        "Leaving the party, John walked home.",
        "c. He remembered talking to her and asking her for her name.",
        "Although there are no obvious markers for the temporal ordering of the events described in these sentences, native speakers have clear intuitions about what happened when: we know that the kissing took place after the meeting and that the asking was part of the talking.",
        "But how do we know this?",
        "And – more importantly – how could this information be automatically extracted from these sentences?",
        "These are the questions that motivate the development of our annotation system.",
        "We believe that the creation of a large scale treebank annotated with relational temporal information as well as standard morphological and syntactic information will make it possible to investigate these issues productively.",
        "The annotated treebank must be large scale for the obvious reason that the application of stochastic methods requires this.",
        "It should be syntactically as well as semantically annotated because we consider it quite likely that syntactic as well as lexical information plays a role in temporal interpretation.",
        "We don’t know a priori whether in (1a) it is the lexical relationship between kiss and meet that is crucial to determining the temporal interpretation, or whether the fact that meet is in a subordinate clause – the syntactic relation – also plays a role.",
        "To answer these kinds of questions it is necessary to encode the temporal information conveyed by a sentence in a way which makes addressing such questions possible.",
        "What we describe below is a practical system for encoding relational temporal information that is suited to large-scale hand annotation of texts.",
        "This system has a number of applications beyond this, both in the domain of cross-linguistic investigation and in empirical NLP."

        "A sentence was temporally annotated by linking the verbs in the sentence via secondary edges labeled with the appropriate temporal relation.",
        "As we were initially only concerned with the relations of precedence and inclusion, we only had four labels: “<” , “⊆”, and their duals.",

        "The annotation of (1c), which was somewhat more complex, indicates the two relations that hold among the events described by the sentence.",
        "(3) He remembered talking and asking her name",
        "In addition to encoding the relations among the events described in a sentence, we anticipated that it would be useful to encode also the relationship between these events and the time at which the sentence is produced.",
        "This is, after all, what tenses usually convey.",
        "To encode this temporal indexical information, we introduce into the annotation an explicit representation of the speech time.",
        "This is indicated by the “ ° ” symbol, which is automatically prefaced to all sentences prior to annotation.",
        "The complete annotation for sentence (1a), then, is (4).",

        "Note that in the case of reported speech, the time associated with the embedding verb plays, for the embedded sentence, much the same role that the speech time plays for the main clause.",
        "Formally, in fact, the relational analysis implicit in our notation makes it possible to avoid many of the problems associated with the treatment of these constructions (such as those discussed at length by von Stechow (1995)).",

        "It should be clear that we are not concerned with giving a semantics for temporal markers, but rather with providing a language within which we can describe the temporal information conveyed by natural language sentences.",
