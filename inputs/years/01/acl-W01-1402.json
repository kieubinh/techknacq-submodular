        "Commercially available machine translation (MT) systems have long been limited in their cost effectiveness and overall utility by the need for domain customization.",
        "Such customization typically includes identifying relevant terminology (esp.",
        "multi-word collocations), entering this terminology into system lexicons, and making additional tweaks to handle formatting and even some syntactic idiosyncrasies.",
        "One of the goals of data-driven MT research has been to overcome this customization bottleneck through automated or semi-automated extraction of translation knowledge from bilingual corpora.",
        "To address this bottleneck, a variety of example based machine translation (EBMT) systems have been created and described in the literature.",
        "Some of these employ parsers to produce dependency structures for the sentence pairs in aligned bilingual corpora, which are then aligned to obtain transfer rules or examples (Meyers et al.",
        "2000; Watanabe et al.",
        "2000).",
        "Other systems extract and use examples that are represented as linear patterns of varying complexity (Brown 1999; Watanabe and Takeda 1998; Turcato et al.",
        "1999).",
        "For some EBMT systems, substantial collections of examples are also manually crafted or at least reviewed for correctness after being identified automatically (Watanabe et al.",
        "2000; Brown 1999; Franz et al.",
        "2000).",
        "The efforts that report accuracy results for fully automatic example extraction (Meyers et al.",
        "2000; Watanabe et al.",
        "2000) do so for very modest amounts of training data (a few thousand sentence pairs).",
        "Previous work in this area thus raises the possibility that manual review or crafting is required to obtain example bases of sufficient coverage and accuracy to be truly useful.",
        "Other variations of EBMT systems are hybrids that integrate an EBMT component as one of multiple sources of transfer knowledge (in addition to other transfer rule or knowledge based components) used during translation (Frederking et al.",
        "1994; Takeda et al.",
        "1992).",
        "To our knowledge, commercial quality MT has so far been achieved only through years of effort in creating hand-coded transfer rules.",
        "Systems whose primary source of translation knowledge comes from an automatically created example base have not been shown capable of matching or exceeding the quality of commercial systems.",
        "This paper reports on MSR-MT, an MT system that attempts to break the customization bottleneck by exploiting example-based (and some statistical) techniques to automatically acquire its primary translation knowledge from a bilingual corpus of several million words.",
        "The system leverages the linguistic generality of employed during analysis and also makes use of its own small set of rules for determining",
        "existing rule-based parsers to enable broad coverage and to overcome some of the limitations on locality of context characteristic of data-driven approaches.",
        "The ability of MSR-MT to adapt automatically to a particular domain, and to produce reasonable translations for that domain, is validated through a blind assessment by human evaluators.",
        "The quality of MSR-MT’s output in this one domain is shown to exceed the output quality of two highly rated (though not domain-customized) commercially available MT systems.",
        "We believe that this demonstration is the first in the literature to show that automatic training methods can produce a commercially viable level of translation quality."

        "The resulting LFs then undergo a process known as MindMeld, which matches them against the LF transfer mappings stored in MindNet (section 5.2).",
