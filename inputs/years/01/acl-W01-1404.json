        "Several studies have investigated automatic or partly automatic learning of transductions for machine translation.",
        "Some of these studies have concentrated on finite-state or extended finite-state machinery, such as (Vilar and others, 1999), others have chosen models closer to context-free grammars and context-free transduction, such as (Alshawi et al., 2000; Watanabe et al., 2000; Ya-mamoto and Matsumoto, 2000), and yet other studies cannot be comfortably assigned to either of these two frameworks, such as (Brown and others, 1990) and (Tillmann and Ney, 2000).",
        "In this paper we will investigate both context-free and finite-state models.",

        "Furthermore, for limited domains, automatic learning of weighted context-free transductions from examples seems to be reasonably successful.",
        "However, practical algorithms for computing the most likely context-free derivation have a cubic time complexity, in terms of the length of the input string, or in the case of a graph output by a speech recognizer, in terms of the number of nodes in the graph.",
        "For certain lexicalized context-free models we even obtain higher time complexities when the size of the grammar is not to be considered as a parameter (Eisner and Satta, 1999).",
        "This may pose problems, especially for real-time speech systems.",
        "Therefore, we have investigated approximation of weighted context-free transduction by means of weighted rational transduction.",
        "The finite-state machinery for implementing the latter kind of transduction in general allows faster processing.",
        "We can also more easily obtain robustness.",
        "We hope the approximating model is able to preserve some of the accuracy of the context-free model.",
        "In the next section, we discuss preliminary definitions, adapted from existing literature, making no more than small changes in presentation.",
        "In Section 3 we explain how context-free transduction grammars can be represented by ordinary context-free grammars, plus a phase of postpro-cessing.",
        "The approximation is discussed in Section 4.",
        "As shown in Section 5, we may easily process input in a robust way, ensuring we always obtain output.",

        "Also, other methods of regular approximation of context-free grammars may be considered.",
        "In comparison to a simpler model, viz. bi-grams, our approximating transductions do not have a very high accuracy, which is especially worrying since the off-line costs of computation are much higher than in the case of bigrams.",
        "The relatively low accuracy may be due to sparseness of data when attaching weights to transitions: the size of the minimal deterministic automaton grows much faster than the size of the training corpus it is constructed from, and the same training corpus is used to train the weights of the transitions of the automaton.",
        "Thereby, many transitions do not obtain accurate weights, and unseen input sentences are not translated accurately.",
        "The problems described here may be avoided by leaving out the determinization of the automaton.",
        "This however leads to two new problems: training of the weights requires more sophisticated algorithms, and we may expect an increase in the time needed to transduce input sentences, since now both source and target symbols give",
        "rise to nondeterminism.",
