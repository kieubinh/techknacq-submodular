        "A machine translation system requires a substantial amount of translation knowledge typically embodied in bilingual dictionaries, transfer rules, example bases, or a statistical model.",
        "Over the last decade, research has focused on the automatic acquisition of this knowledge from bilingual corpora.",
        "Statistical systems build translation models from this data without linguistic analysis (Brown, 1993).",
        "Another class of systems, including our own, parses sentences in parallel sentence-aligned corpora to extract transfer rules or examples (Kaji, 1992) (Meyers, 2000) (Watanabe, 2000).",
        "These systems typically obtain a predicate-argument or dependency structure for source and target sentences, which are then aligned, and from the resulting alignment, lexical and structural translation correspondences are extracted, which are then represented as a set of rules or an example-base for translation.",
        "However, before this method of knowledge acquisition can be fully automated, a number of issues remain to be addressed.",
        "The alignment and transfer-mapping acquisition procedure must acquire rules with very high precision.",
        "It must be robust against errors introduced by parsing and sentence-level alignment, errors intrinsic to the corpus, as well as errors resulting from the alignment procedure itself.",
        "The procedure must also produce transfer mappings that provide sufficient context to enable the translation system utilizing these mappings to choose the appropriate translation for a given context.",
        "In this paper, we describe the alignment and transfer-acquisition algorithm used in our machine translation system, which attempts to address the issues raised above.",
        "This system acquires transfer mappings by aligning pairs of logical form structures (LFs) similar to those described by Jensen (1993).",
        "These LFs are obtained by parsing sentence pairs from a sentence-aligned bilingual corpus.",
        "(The problem of aligning parallel corpora at the sentence level has been addressed by Meyers (1998b) Chen (1993) and others and is beyond the scope of this paper).",
        "We show that alignment using a best-first strategy in conjunction with a small alignment grammar improves the alignment and the quality of the acquired transfer mappings."
