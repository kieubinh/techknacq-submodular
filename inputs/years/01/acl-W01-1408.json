        "• Using the empirical heuristic function we can translate 96 % of the sentences with A* search.",
        "This heuristic function does not guarantee to avoid search errors, but this case never occurred in our experiments.",
        "From these results we conclude that it is often possible to faster compute acceptable results using a beam search approach.",
        "Therefore, this is the method of choice in practice.",
        "From a theoretical viewpoint it is interesting that using A* it is possible to translate guaranteed without search errors.",
        "In addition, without having a chance to perform search without search errors it is almost impossible to assess if errors in translation should be assigned to the model/training or to the search heuristics.",
