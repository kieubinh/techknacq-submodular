        "Very clearly, the effort needed to create parallel data is one of the biggest obstacles to the rapid development of statistical MT systems for new languages.",
        "With the output of a system which uses a translation model trained on the small amount of parallel data that we created during the course of our experiment, human test subjects achieved a recall of over 50% on the document retrieval task but generally performed poorly on question answering (less than 20%).",

        "With respect to the scenario of “MT in a month”, we can now make the following calculation: If we assume that the average translator translates at a rate of 170 words/hour and is able to spend 6-7 hours per day on actual translations, then a translator can translate about 1000-1200 words per day.",

        "• Can the translation model and the algorithms for statistical training be improved so that they require less data to produce acceptable results?",
        "• Are there more efficient uses of scarce resources",
        "(such as language experts and translators) for building a statistical (or any other) MT system quickly, for example the creation of less but more informative data, e.g. a parallel corpus with alignments on the word level, or the compilation of a glossary/dictionary of the most frequently used terms?",
        "• How do the various approaches compare with respect to the ratio of construction effort versus performance improvement when the MT systems are scaled up?",
        "One approach may show rapid improvements initially but also reach a plateau quickly, whereas another may show slow but steady improvements.",
        "• Is there any potential for bootstrapping the resource creation process by using knowledge that can be extracted from little and poor data to speed up the creation of more and better data?",
        "These are some of the the questions that will need to be addressed in future research on Quick MT."
