        "This paper is a report on work in progress aimed at learning word translation relationships automatically from parallel bilingual corpora.",
        "Our effort is distinguished by the use of simple statistical models that are easier to implement and faster to run than previous high-accuracy approaches to this problem.",
        "Our overall approach to machine translation is a deep-transfer approach in which the transfer relationships are learned from a parallel bilingual corpus (Richardson et al., 2001).",
        "More specifically, the transfer component is trained by parsing both sides of the corpus to produce parallel logical forms, using lexicons and analysis grammars constructed by linguists.",
        "The parallel logical forms are then aligned at the level of content word stems (lemmas), and logical-form transfer patterns are learned from the aligned logical-form corpus.",
        "At run time, the source language text is parsed into logical forms employing the source language grammar and lexicon used in constructing the logical-form training corpus, and the logical-form transfer patterns are used to construct target language logical forms.",
        "These logical forms are transformed into target language strings using the target-language lexicon, and a generation grammar written by a linguist.",
        "The principal roles played by the translation relationships derived by the methods discussed in this paper are to provide correspondences between content word lemmas in logical forms to assist in the alignment process, and to augment the lexicons used in parsing and generation, for a special case described in Section 4."

      "text": [
        "The most common approach to deriving translation lexicons from empirical data (Catizone, Russell, and Warwick, 1989; Gale and Church, 1991; Fung, 1995; Kumano and Hirakawa, 1994; Wu and Xia, 1994; Melamed, 1995) is to use some variant of the following procedure :1",
        "• Pick a good measure of the degree of association between words in language L1 and words in language L2 in aligned sentences of a parallel bilingual corpus.",
        "• Rank order pairs consisting of a word from L1 and a word from L2 according to the measure of association.",
        "• Choose a threshold, and add to the translation lexicon all pairs of words whose degree of association is above the threshold.",
        "As Melamed later (1996, 2000) pointed out, however, this technique is hampered by the existence of indirect associations between words that are not mutual translations.",
        "For example, in our parallel French-English corpus (consisting primarily of translated computer software manuals), two of the most strongly associated word lemma translation pairs are fichier/file and syst`eme/system.",
        "However, because the monolingual collocations syst`eme de fichiers, fichiers syst`eme, file system, and system files are so common, the spurious translation pairs fichier/system and syst`eme/file also receive rather high association scores – higher in fact that such true translation pairs as confiance/trust, par-all´elisme/parallelism, and film/movie.",
        "Melamed’s solution to this problem is not to regard highly-associated word pairs as translations in sentences in which there are even more highly-associated pairs involving one or both of the same words.",
        "Since indirect associations are normally weaker than direct ones, this usually succeeds in selecting true translation pairs over the spurious ones.",
        "For example, in parallel sentences containing fichier and syst`eme on the French side and file and system on the English side, the associations of fichier/system and syst`eme/file will be discounted, because the degrees of association for fichier/file and syst`eme/system are so much higher.",
        "Melamed’s results using this approach extend the range of high-accuracy output to much higher coverage levels than previously reported.",
        "Our basic method is rooted the same insight regarding competing associations for the same words, but we embody it in simpler model that is easier to implement and, we believe, faster to run.2 As we will see below, our model yields results that seem comparable to Melamed’s up to nearly 60% coverage of the lexicon.",
        "A second important issue regarding automatic derivation of translation relationships is the assumption implicit (or explicit) in most previous work that lexical translation relationships involve",
        "only single words.",
        "This is manifestly not the case, as is shown by the following list of translation pairs selected from our corpus:",
        "Some of the most sophisticated work on this aspect of problem again seems to be that of Melamed (1997).",
        "Our approach in this case is quite different from Melamed’s.",
        "It is more general in that it can propose compounds that are dis-contiguous in the training text, as roll back would be in a phrase such as roll the failed transaction back.",
        "Melamed does allow skipping over one or two function words, but our basic method is not limited at all by word adjacency.",
        "Also, our approach is again much simpler computationally than Melamed’s and apparently runs orders of magnitude faster.3"

        "We will refer to all of these generically as “multiwords”.",
        "The existence of multiwords simplifies learning some translation relationships, but makes others more complicated.",
        "For example, we do not, in fact, have to learn base de donn´ees as a compound translation for database, because it is extracted from the French logical forms already identified as a single unit.",
        "Thus we only need to learn the base de donn´ees/database correspondence as a simple one-to-one mapping.",
        "On the other hand, the disque dur/hard disk correspondence is learned as two-to-one relationship independently of disque/disk and dur/hard (which are also learned) because hard disk appears as a mul-tiword in our English logical forms, but disque and dur always appear as separate tokens in our French logical forms."
