        "The machine translation system described here is a French-English translation system which uses a French broad coverage analyzer, a large multi-purpose French dictionary, a large French-English bilingual lexicon, an application independent English natural language generation component and a transfer component.",
        "The transfer component consists of high-quality transfer patterns automatically acquired from sentence-aligned bilingual corpora using an alignment grammar and algorithm described in detail in Menezes (2001) (see Figure 1 for an overview of the French-English MT system).",
        "The transfer component consists only of correspondences learned during the alignment process.",
        "Training takes place on aligned sentences which have been analyzed by the French and English analysis systems to yield dependency structures specific to our system entitled Logical Forms (LF).",
        "The LF structures, when aligned, allow the extraction of lexical and structural translation correspondences which are stored for use at runtime in the transfer database.",
        "The transfer database can also be thought of as an example-base of conceptual structure representations.",
        "See Figure 2 for an illustration of the training process.",
        "The transfer database for French-English was trained on approximately 200,000 pairs of aligned sentences from computer manuals and help files.",
        "In these aligned pairs, the French text was produced by human translators from the original English version.",
        "Sample sentences from the training set are:"

        "The French-English lexicon is used during the training period of the transfer component to establish initial, tentative, word correspondences during the alignment process.",
        "The sources for the bilingual dictionary were: Cambridge University Press English-French, Soft-Art English-French, and Langenscheidt French-English and English-French dictionaries.",
        "The English-French translation data was reversed to create French-English pairs in order to augment the size of the dictionary, with a final translation count of 75,000 pairs.",
        "However, quick examination of the sample sentence above shows that many terms are highly specific to the domain, e.g menu Démarrer <-> Start menu.",
        "To further add to the specificity of the vocabulary available to the alignment process, we added translation pairs extracted from the actual domain, using statistical word/phrase assignment, as described below.",
        "This resulted in one file of automatically created French English translation correspondences, or word associations (WA), and a second file of specialized multi-word translation correspondences which we term Title Associations (TA).",
        "These files, of size 30,000 and 2600 respectively, added to the quality of the alignments and to overall translation quality."

        "Because the order of the two machine translation sentences was randomized on each sentence, evaluators could not determine which sentence was from System 1.",
        "The order of presentation of sentences was also randomized for each rater in order to eliminate any ordering effect.",
        "The raters were asked to make a three-way choice.",
        "For each sentence, the raters were to determine which of the two automatically translated sentences was the better translation of the (unseen) source sentence, assuming that the reference sentence was a perfect translation, with the option of choosing “neither” if the differences were negligible.",
        "Raters were instructed to use their best judgment about the relative importance of fluency/style and accuracy/content preservation.",
        "We chose to use this simple three-way scale in order to avoid making any a priori judgments about the relative importance of these parameters for subjective judgments of quality.",
        "The three-way scale also allows sentences to be rated on the same scale, regardless of whether the differences between output from system 1 and system 2 were substantial or relatively small; and regardless of whether either version of the system produced an adequate translation.",
