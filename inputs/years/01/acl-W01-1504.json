        "The EC Concerted Action TELRI II is a pan-European alliance of currently 28 focal national language technology institutions with the emphasis on Central and Eastern European and NIS countries.",
        "TELRI II´s primary objectives are:",
        "• To strengthen the pan-European infrastructure for the multilingual language research and development community; • To collect, promote, and make available monolingual and multilingual language resources and tools for the extraction of language data and linguistic knowledge; • To offer a customized comprehensive service to academic and industrial users; • To prepare and organize research and",
        "development projects focusing on translation aids, multilingual authoring systems, and information retrieval;",
        "• To provide a forum where experts from academia and industry share and assess tools and resources, assess software, evaluate new trends, investigate alternative approaches, and engage in joint activities; • To make available the expertise of its",
        "partner institutions to the research community, to the public, and to language industry.",
        "TELRI II implements these objectives in the following activities:",
        "• Networking: This work package",
        "includes liaising with related infrastructure activities, centres, and institutions, promoting TELRI activities (newsletter, webpage, TELRI list), and strengthening the permanent infrastructure of the TELRI Association.",
        "• TELRI Seminars: The series of",
        "successful TELRI seminars continues with annual seminars in CEE/NIS countries, this year to be held in Bulgaria.",
        "• TRACTOR Service: This work package comprises promotion, support, and availability of customized service to the TRACTOR User Community.",
        "• TRACTOR Tools and Resources: This",
        "work package focuses on the acquisition of attractive tools and resources for TRACTOR, the TELRI Research Archive of Computational Tools and Resources.",
        "• Organizing Joint Research: TELRI",
        "partners will prepare European R&D projects with strong industrial involvement focusing on multilingual language and terminology issues."

        "TRACTOR is not the only language resource archive, as participants in this workshop are well aware.",
        "It does not aim to become the only focal point for language resource distribution on the web.",
        "Rather it hopes to complement other archives by providing a service for languages and users who are currently under-represented in existing archives.",
        "TRACTOR's unique strength lies in the amount of resources provided by centres in Central and Eastern Europe, and its role at the hub of a network of resource creation, standardisation and distribution which links the EU and non-EU European research communities.",
        "The TRACTOR User Community brings together resource providers, academic users and industrial users in an ongoing relationship, which is designed to foster the emergence of joint research projects in language engineering.",
        "The resources are in many languages, with several different character sets and widely differing storage and markup conventions, and variable degrees of documentation, which is also in various formats.",
        "This raises particular challenges in terms of standardisation and evaluation of the resources.",
        "Since most of the resources have been collected over a period of several years, and from countries with varying degrees of familiarity with the standards of the western European human language technology community standards, they do not in general conform to one, or in some cases to any, commonly accepted standards of digital storage, character encoding, textual or linguistic annotation.",
        "There are exceptions to this, such as the highly standardised corpus resources collected within the ELAN framework, now made available through the TRACTOR archive.",
        "The TRACTOR philosophy is to accept deposits of resources in any format, and to distribute them in the form in which they are received (with small changes if possible such as additional documentation, and putting a browsable version or sample online.)",
        "In addition, certain standards are recommended and help is offered to providers who wish to make their resources conformant with the standards.",
        "This lack of standardisation is not simply a pragmatic measure in the face of problems of heterogeneity.",
        "It is also based on the idea that standardisation should not be a barrier to language resource distribution.",
        "Sometimes providers of resources do not have the resources or expertise to adapt them to strict standards.",
        "We also recognise that the resource providers and users do not have requirements in common which can easily be translated into standards.",
        "Highly standardised resources built according to carefully crafted and strict criteria, and intended to be of commercial value such as EuroWordnet, the SIMPLE ontology, the ELAN network have more resources and attention paid to the design than the quality or usefulness of the knowledge which they contain.",
        "Furthermore, they are often too narrow in their applicability and in many cases they are simply not being used.",
        "TRACTOR aims to produce a synergy between academic and industrial researchers whereby the knowledge and resources can be shared and developed at a pre-competitive stage.",
        "Such collaborations can then develop on a commercial basis when on terms suitable for all parties.",
        "This is thought to be a more productive approach than the attempting to identify global, common needs and then to deliver large, valuable resources of general applicability.",
        "As far as documentation of the resources is concerned, we believe that standardisation is probably a good idea, and we are looking into participating in the OLAC initiative."

        "The principal reason for doing this is in order to put membership on a formal basis.",
        "To put it bluntly, if researchers have to pay for access, then they usually have to alert their colleagues and masters to it and persuade them to authorise the payment.",
        "Also, having paid for something, they are more likely to use it.",
        "The fee is considerably less than what users have to pay for more commercially oriented archives such as ELRA.",
        "TRACTOR needs an active User Community, and we would prefer to have a compact group of committed and active users, to a large number of people who register because it is free, and then take no active part in the activities.",

        "An important recent acquisition for the archive is the special TRACTOR version of the Qwick corpus analysis program, which is available to the TUC with indexed monolingual corpora in many languages.",
        "This is considered an important development as it means that corpora can now be delivered ready to analyse and use without any further demands on the expertise or software which the user may or may not have.",
        "It is intended to greatly increase the range and depth of holdings in the TRACTOR archive throughout 2001, as a key part of the work of the Centre for Corpus Linguistics in the English Department at the University of Birmingham.",
        "Particular efforts are being made to create and acquire parallel translation corpora, which are of particular interest for research purposes for many academic and industrial users of TRACTOR.",
        "TRACTOR is not in competition with other archives such as the Oxford Text Archive, ELDA and the Linguistic Data Consortium.",
        "TRACTOR is unique in it’s combination of the following features:",
        "• TRACTOR is not just an archive; it is a network of researchers with interests in linguistic resources; • all resources are available for research",
        "purposes only and not for commercial exploitation;",

        "This is just one area of interest, and members are free to develop ideas and resources in a multitude of directions.",
