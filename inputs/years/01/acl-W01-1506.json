        "Language technology and the linguistic sciences are confronted with a vast array of language resources, richly structured, large and diverse.",
        "Multiple communities depend on language resources, including linguists, engineers, teachers and actual speakers.",
        "Many individuals and institutions provide key pieces of the infrastructure, including archivists, software developers, and publishers.",
        "Today we have unprecedented opportunities to connect these communities to the language resources they need.",
        "First, inexpensive mass storage technology permits large resources to be stored in digital form, while the Extensible Markup Language (XML) and Unicode provide flexible ways to represent structured data and ensure its long-term survival.",
        "Second, digital publication – both on and off the world wide web – is the most practical and efficient means of sharing language resources.",
        "Finally, a standard resource description model, the Dublin Core Metadata Set, together with an interchange method provided by the Open Archives Initiative (OAI), make it possible to construct a union catalog over multiple repositories and archives.",
        "In December 2000, an NSF-funded workshop on Web-Based Language Documentation and Description, held in Philadelphia, brought together a group of nearly 100 language software developers, linguists, and archivists who are responsible for creating language resources in North America, South America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Asia and Australia http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/ exploration /expl2000/.",
        "The outcome of the workshop was the founding of the Open Language Archives Community (OLAC), an application of the OAI to digital archives of language resources, with the following purpose: OLAC, the Open Language Archives Community, is an international partnership of institutions and individuals who are creating a worldwide virtual library of language resources by: (i) developing consensus on best current practice for the digital archiving of language resources, and (ii) developing a network of interoperating repositories and services for housing and accessing such resources.",
        "This paper will describe the leading ideas that motivate OLAC, before focussing on the metadata set and the controlled vocabularies which implement part (ii) of OLAC’s statement of purpose.",
        "Metadata elements of special interest to the language resources community include such things as language identification and language resource type.",
        "The corresponding controlled vocabularies ensure consistent description.",
        "For example, French language resources are specified using an official RFC-3066 designation (Alvestrand, 2001), instead of multiple distinct text strings like “French”, “Francais” and “Franc¸ais”.",
        "A separate controlled vocabulary exists for resource type, and has items such as annotation/phonetic and description/grammar.",
        "Services for end-users can map controlled vocabularies onto convenient terminology for any target language.",

        "By DATA we mean any information that documents or describes a language, such as a published monograph, a computer data file, or even a shoebox full of handwritten index cards.",
        "The information could range in content from unanalyzed sound recordings to fully transcribed and annotated texts to a complete descriptive grammar.",
        "By TOOLS we mean computational resources that facilitate creating, viewing, querying, or otherwise using language data.",
        "Tools include not just software programs, but also",
        "the digital resources that the programs depend on, such as fonts, stylesheets, and document type definitions.",
        "By ADVICE we mean any information about what data sources are reliable, what tools are appropriate in a given situation, what practices to follow when creating new data, and so forth.",
        "In the context of OLAC, the term language resource is broadly construed to include all three of these: data, tools and advice.",
        "Unfortunately, today’s user does not have ready access to the resources that are needed.",
        "Figure 1 offers a diagrammatic view of the reality.",
        "Some archives (e.g. Archive 1) do have a site on the internet which the user is able to find, so the resources of that archive are accessible.",
        "Other archives (e.g. Archive 2) are on the internet, so the user could access them in theory, but the user has no idea they exist so they are not accessible in practice.",
        "Still other archives (e.g. Archive 3) are not even on the internet.",
        "And there are potentially hundreds of archives (e.g. Archive n) that the user needs to know about.",
        "Tools and advice are out there as well, but are at many different sites.",
        "There are many other problems inherent in the current situation.",
        "For instance, the user may not be able to find all the existing data about the language of interest because different sites have called it by different names (low recall).",
        "The user may be swamped with irrelevant resources because search terms have important meanings in other domains (low precision).",
        "The user may not be able to use an accessible data file for lack of being able to match it with the right tools.",

        "The first reason is that many language resources, such as audio files and software, are not text-based.",
        "The second reason concerns language identification, the single most important property for describing language resources.",
        "If a language has a canonical name which is distinctive as a character string, then the user has a chance of finding any online resources with a search engine.",
        "However, the language may have multiple names, possibly due to the vagaries of Romanization, such as a language known variously as Fadicca, Fadicha, Fedija, Fadija, Fiadidja, Fiyadikkya, and Fedicca (giving low recall).",
        "The language name may collide with a word which has other interpretations that are vastly more frequent, e.g. the language names Mango and Santa Cruz (giving low precision).",
        "The third reason why general-purpose search engines are inadequate is the simple fact that much of the material is not, and will not, be documented in free prose on the web.",
        "Either people will build systematic catalogues of their resources, or they won’t do it at all.",
        "Of course, one can always export a back-end database as HTML and let the search engines index the materials.",
        "Indeed, encouraging people to document resources and make them accessible to search engines is part of our vision.",
        "However, despite the power of web search engines, there remain many instances where people still prefer to use more formal databases to house their data.",
        "This last point bears further consideration.",
        "The challenge is to build a system for “bringing like things together and differentiating among them” (Svenonius, 2000).",
        "There are two dominant storage and indexing paradigms, one exemplified by traditional databases and one exemplified by the web.",
        "In the case of language resources, the metadata is coherent enough to be stored in a formal database, but sufficiently distributed and dynamic that it is impractical to maintain it centrally.",
        "Language resources occupy the middle ground between the two paradigms, neither of which will serve adequately.",
        "A new framework is required that permits the best of both worlds, namely bottom-up, distributed initiatives, along with consistent, centralized finding aids.",

        "Together, these facts suggest that a standard based on names will not work.",
