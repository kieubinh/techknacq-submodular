        "EAGLES work towards de facto standards has already allowed the field of Language Resources to establish broad consensus on key issues for some well-established areas – and will allow similar consensus to be achieved for other important areas through the ISLE project – providing thus a key opportunity for further consolidation and a basis for technological advance.",
        "EAGLES previous results have already become de facto standards.",
        "To mention several key examples: the LE PAROLE/SIMPLE resources (morphological/syntactic/semantic lexicons and corpora for 12 EU languages, Ruimy et al., 1998, Lenci et al., 1999, Bel et al., 2000) rely on EAGLES results (Sanfilippo, A. et al., 1996 and 1999), and are now being enlarged at the national level through many National Projects; the ELRA Validation Manuals for Lexicons (Underwood and Navarretta, 1997) and Corpora (Burnard et al., 1997) are based on EAGLES guidelines; morpho-syntactic tagging of corpora in a very large number of EU, international and national projects – and for more than 20 languages – is conformant to EAGLES recommendations (Leech and Wilson, 1996).",
        "The first priority of the CLWG in the first phase of the ISLE project was to do a comprehensive survey of existing multilingual lexicons.",
        "To this end the European and the American members decided, among others, i) to prepare a grid for lexicon description to classify the content and structure of the surveyed resources on the basis of a number of agreed parameters of description, and ii) to provide a list of cross-lingual lexical phenomena that could be used to focus the survey.",
        "The inventory (survey) of what exists and is available (semantic and bilingual/multilingual lexicons, printed bilingual dictionaries) is now being completed, and will be made soon available on the Web.",
        "Each participant engaged for surveying a number of resources.",
        "A list of the main applications that use lexical resources was also established, to focus the survey and subsequent recommendations around them.",
        "Each summary of a particular bilingual or multilingual dictionary includes: i) a description of the surveyed dictionary structure (on the basis of the common grid), ii) for one or two examples from the cross-lingual lexical phenomena, an explanation of how these examples are handled by this dictionary."

        "They have proven useful in the process of reaching consensual de facto standards in a bottom-up approach and will be at the basis also of ISLE work.",
        "The MILE is envisaged as a highly modular and possibly layered structure, with different levels of recommendations.",
        "Such an architecture has been proven useful in previous EAGLES work, e.g in the EAGLES morphosyntactic recommendations (Monachini and Calzolari, 1996), which embody three levels of linguistic information: obligatory, recommended and optional (optional splits furthermore into language independent and language dependent).",
        "This modularity would enhance: the flexibility of the representation, the easiness of customisation and integration of existing resources (developed under different theoretical frameworks or for different applications), the usability by different systems which are in need of different portions of the encoded data, the compliance with the proposed standards also of partially instantiated entries.",
        "The MILE recommendations should also be very granular, in the sense of reaching a maximal decomposition into the minimal basic information units that reflect the phenomena we are dealing with.",
        "This principle was previously recommended and used to allow easier reusability or mappability into different theoretical or system approaches (Heid and McNaught, 1991): small units can be assembled, in different frameworks, according to different (theory/application dependent) generalisation principles.",
        "Such basic notions must be established before considering any system-specific generalisations, otherwise our work may be too conditioned by system-specific approaches.",
        "For example, ‘synonymy’ can be taken as a basic notion; however, the notion of ‘synset’ is a generalisation, closely associated with the WordNet approach.",
        "‘Qualia relations’ are another example of a generalisation, whereas ‘semantic relation’ is a basic notion.",
        "Modularity is also a means to achieve better granularity.",
        "On the other side, past EAGLES experience has shown it is useful in many cases to accept underspecification with respect to recommendations for the representation of some phenomenon (and hierarchical structure of the basic notions, attributes, values, etc.",
        "), i) to allow for agreement on a minimal level of specificity especially in cases where we cannot reach wider agreement, and/or ii) enable mappability and comparability of different lexicons, with different granularity, at the minimal common level of specificity (or maximal generality).",
        "For example, the work on syntactic subcategorisation in EAGLES proved that it was problematic to reach agreement on a few notions, e.g. it seemed unrealistic to agree on a set of grammatical functions.",
        "This led to an underspecified recommendation, but nevertheless one that was useful.",
        "One of the first objectives of the CLWG will be to discover and list the (maximal) set of (minimal/more granular) basic notions needed to describe the multilingual level.",
        "This task will be facilitated by the survey of existing lexicons, accompanied by the analysis of the requirements of a few multilingual applications, and by the parallel analysis of typical multilingual complex phenomena.",
        "Most or part of these basic notions should be already included in previous EAGLES recommendations, and, with different distribution, in the existing and surveyed lexicons.",
        "We have therefore to revisit earlier linguistic layers (previous EAGLES work, essentially monolinguistic) to see what we need to change/add or what we can reuse for the multilingual layer.",

        "Different theoretical frameworks appear to impose different requirements on how lexical information should be represented.",
        "One way of tackling the issue of theoretical compatibility stems from the observation that existing representational frameworks mostly differ in the way pieces of linguistic information are mutually implied, rather than in the intrinsic nature of this information.",
        "To give a concrete example, almost all theoretical frameworks claim that lexical items have a complex semantic organization, but some of them try to describe it through a multidimensional internal structure (cf. the qualia structure in the Generative Lexicon, Pustejovsky 1995), others by specifying a network of semantic relations (cf. WordNet, Miller et al.",
        "1990), and others in terms of argumental frames (cf FrameNet, Baker et al.",
        "1998; Lexical Conceptual Structures, Jackendoff 1992; etc.).",
        "A way out of this theoretical variation is to augment the expressive power of the lexical representation language both horizontally, i.e. by distributing the linguistic information over mutually independent \"coding layers\", and vertically, by further specifying the information conveyed by each such layer.",
        "This solution will contribute to solve the issues raised by theoretical variation by defining a common level onto which different types of resources will be mapped without loss of information.",
        "This appears to be a necessary condition to guarantee an efficient reuse and interchange of lexical data, often coming from resources developed according to very different architectural and theoretical criteria.",

        "• factor out linguistically independent (but possibly correlated) primitive units of lexical information; • make explicit information which is otherwise only indirectly accessible by NLP systems; • rely on lexical analysis which have the highest degree of inter-theoretical agreement; • avoid framework-specific representational",
