        "FILES has been used to annotate a number of corpora of Italian within the National Project currently still work in progress.",
        "Input to FILES is the output of our linguistic modules for the automatic analysis of Italian, a tokenizer, a morphological analyser, a tagger equipped with a statistic and syntactic disambiguator and finally a shallow parser.",
        "All these separate modules contribute part of the input for the system which is then used by human annotators to operate at syntactic level on constituent structure, or at function level on head-features functional representation.",
        "We don’t have here space to describe the linguistic processors – but see [8, 9, 10, 11, 12].",
        "As to tag disambiguation, this is carried out in a semi-automatic manner by the human annotator, on the basis of the automatic redundant morphological tagger.",
        "The disambiguator takes each token and in case of ambiguity it alerts the annotator to decide which is the tag to choose: the annotator is presented with the best candidate computed on the basis both of syntactic and statistical information.",
        "Low level representations are integrated in a relational database and shown in the FILES environment which is an intelligent browser allowing the annotation to operate changes and create XML output automatically for each file.",
        "Here below is a snapshot of the six relational databases where all previously analysed linguistic material has been inputted.",
        "It contains tokens, lemmata, POS tagging, empty categories, sentences containing each token, tokens regarded as heads as separated from tokens regarded as features and verb subacategorization list."

        "An interesting part of the browser is the availability of subcategorization frames for verbs: these are expressed in a compact format which are intended to help the annotator in the most difficult task, i.e. that of deciding whether a given constituent head must be interpreted as either an argument or an adjunct; and in case it is an argument, whether it should be interpreted as predicative or “open” in LFG terms, or else as non-predicative or “close”.",
        "The list of subcategorization frames contains 17,000 entries.",
        "Of course the annotator can add new entries either as new lexical items or simply as new subcategorizations frames, which are encoded in the current list.",
        "Notable features of the browser are the subdivision into two separate columns of verbal heads from non verbal ones, whereas the actual sentence highlights all heads verbal and non verbal in bold.",
        "On the righthand side there is a scrollable list of relations and the possibility to move from one sentence to another at will.",

        "It is available under Internet and will be shown as such.",
        "The one for students of German on the contrary, is based on the shallow parser of Italian used to produce the syntactic constituency for the National Treebank.",
        "The output of the parser is a bracketing of the input tagged word sequence which is then passed to the higher functional processor.",
        "This is an LFG-based c-structure to f-structure mapping algorithm which has three tasks: the first one is to compute features from heads; the second one is to compute agreement.",
        "The third task is to impose LFG’s grammaticality principles: those of Coherence and Consistency, i.e. number and type of arguments are constrained by the lexical form of the governing predicate.",
        "The parser is an RTN which has been endowed with a grammar and a lexicon of German of about 8K entries.",
        "The grammar is written in the usual arc/transition nodes formalism, well-known in ATNs.",
        "However, the aim of the RTN is that of producing a structured output both for wellformed and illformed grammatical sentences of German.",
        "To this end, we allowed the grammar to keep part of the rules of Italian at the appropriate structural level, though.",

        "We prefer to perform some readjustment operations after structures have been built rather than introducing errors from the start.",
        "Readjustment operations are in line with LFG theoretical framework which assumes that f-structures may be recursively constituted by subsidiary f-structures, i.e. by complements or adjuncts of a governing predicate.",

        "Restructuring is executed taking advantage of agreement information which in languages like Italian or German, i.e. in morphologically rich languages, can be fruitfully used to that aim.",

        "Moreover, in order to select adjuncts appropriately at each level of constituency, semantic classes are added to more traditional syntactic ones like transitive, unaccusative, reflexive and so on.",
        "Semantic classes are of two kinds: the first class is related to extensionality vs intensionality, and is used to build discourse relations mainly; the second class is meant to capture aspectual restrictions which decide the appropriateness and adequacy of adjuncts, so that inappropriate ones are attached at a higher level."
