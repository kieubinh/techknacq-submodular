        "Human language resources, expensive to create and maintain, are in increasing demand among a growing number of research communities.",
        "One solution to this expanding need is to reannotate and reuse language resources created for other purposes.",
        "The now classic example is that of the Switchboard-1 Corpus (ISBN: 1-58563-121-3), a collection of 2400 two-sided telephone conversations among 543 U.S. speakers, created by Texas Instruments in 1991.",
        "Although collected for speaker identification and topic spotting research, Switchboard has been widely used to support large vocabulary conversational speech recognition.",
        "It has been extensively corrected twice, once at Penn and NIST, and once at Mississippi State.",
        "Two excerpts have been published as test corpora for government-sponsored projects.",
        "At least 6 other annotations have been created at various times and more-or-less widely distributed among research sites: part-of-speech annotation (Penn); syntactic structure annotation (Penn); dysfluency annotation (Penn); partial phonetic transcription (independently at UCLA and at Berkeley); and discourse function annotation (Colorado).",
        "These annotations use different “editions” of the underlying corpus and have sometimes silently introduced their own corrections or modified the data format to suit their needs.",
        "Thus the Colorado discourse function annotation was based on phrase structures introduced by the Penn dysfluency annotation, which in turn was based on the Penn/NIST corrections, which in turn were based on the original TI transcriptions of the underlying (and largely unchanging) audio files.",
        "Switchboard and its derivatives remain in active use worldwide, and new derivatives continue to be produced, along with (published and unpublished) corrections of old ones.",
        "This worsens the already acute problem of establishing and maintaining coherent relations among the derivatives in common use today.",
        "The Switchboard-1 case is by no means isolated (Graff & Bird 2000).",
        "The Topic Detection and Tracking Corpus, TDT-2 (ISBN: 1-58563-157-4) was created in 1998 by LDC and contains newswire and more than 600 hours of transcribed broadcast news from 8 English and 3 Chinese sources sampled daily over six months with annotations to indicate story boundaries and relevance of those stories to 100 randomly selected topics.",
        "Since its release, TDT-2 has been used as training, development-test and evaluation data in the TDT evaluations; the audio has been used in TREC SDR evaluations (Garofalo, Auzanne and Voorhees 2000), TDT text has been partially re-annotated for entity detection in the Automatic Content Extraction project (Przybocki 2000) and portions have been used for the Center for Spoken Language Processing’s workshops in Novel Information Detection (Allan et.",

        "1999), Mandarin-English Information (Meng et.",
        "al.",
        "2000) and Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (Chalapati 2000).",
        "Switchboard and TDT are just two examples of a growing trend toward reannotation and reuse of language resources, a trend that is not limited to language engineering.",
        "Miller and Walker (2001) have demonstrated the value of the CALLHOME German corpus (ISBN: 1 58563-117-5), developed to support speech recognition research, for language teaching.",
        "Deckert & Yaeger-Dror (2000) have used Switchboard to study regional syntactic variation in American English.",

        "There are various methods for linking to audio data and lexical entries, and for including footnotes and other marginalia.",
        "This diversity of form presents problems for general-purpose software for searching, exchanging, displaying and enriching interlinear texts.",
        "Nonetheless interlinear text is a precious resource with multiple uses in natural language processing.",

        "Will the study of corpus data reveal new patterns not evident in the more common studies conducted within the framework of the speech community?",
        "Can empirical research on language variation be organized on a large scale with teams of nonspecialist annotators?",
        "All of the data used in DASL were originally created to support human language technology development; the datasets are currently being reannotated to support empirical studies of linguistic variation.",
        "A custom annotation tool allows users to query each corpus for tokens of potential interest greatly reducing effort relative to traditional approaches.",
        "Annotators can read or listen to each token, access demographic data and encode their observations in formats compatible with other analytical software used in the community.",

        "Authoring Resources and Tools for Language Learning Although current information technology encourages new approaches in computer assisted language learning and teaching, progress in this area is hampered by an inadequate supply of language resources.",
        "The SMART (Source Media Authoring Resources and Tools) pilot project is addressing this problem by providing appropriately licensed data and software resources for preparing language-learning material.",
        "The Linguistic Data Consortium, a partner in this effort, is contributing several of its large data sets including conversational and broadcast data in Arabic, English, French and German.",
        "The language resources overlap almost completely with those used in language engineering.",
        "SMART is building upon the distribution model established in LDC Online, a service that provides network based access to hundreds of gigabytes of text and audio data and annotations.",
        "Audio data are available digitally in files corresponding to a conversation, broadcast or other linguistic event.",
        "To facilitate searching, LDC Online includes, according to their availability, human and machine-generated transcripts time-aligned to permit more fine-grained access.",
        "For example, where a time-aligned transcript of a conversation exists, users may extract, reformat and play any segment specified by the time stamps in the transcript.",
        "SMART is building upon this foundation by providing additional data resources, browsing and search customized to the needs of language teachers and additional output formats to accommodate courseware authoring tools available in the commercial market.",
        "SMART promises to benefit a wide range of language teachers and learners but only to the extent that its resources are readily available.",
        "The volume of SMART data exceeds that which can be easily transferred over a network.",
        "Even small video clips consume hundreds of megabits of bandwidth.",

        "The user will have the option of downloading the data for local use or adding annotations that may be kept privately or made public via the annotation server.",
        "The technology of the annotation server coupled with the extensibility of annotation graphs described below will enables nearly unconstrained access to SMART data.",
        "These efforts to support interlinear text, sociolinguistic annotation and multimodal data in language teaching each require flexible access to signal data and associated annotations.",

        "Annotation graphs were presented by Bird and Liberman (1999) as a general purpose model for representing and manipulating annotations of time series data, regardless of their physical storage format.",
        "An annotation graph is a labeled, directed, acyclic graph with time offsets on some of its nodes.",
        "The formalism is illustrated below by application to the TIMIT Corpus (Garofolo et al., 1986).",

        "Since an annotation graph is just a set of (timed) nodes, arcs and labels, it can be trivially represented using three relational tables:",
        "A large amount of annotation can be efficiently represented and indexed in this manner.",
        "This brings us to the question of converting (or loading) existing data into such a database.",
        "The LDC's catalog alone includes nearly 200 publications, where each typically has its own format (often more than one).",
        "The sheer quantity and diversity of the data presents a significant challenge to the conversion process.",
        "In addition, some corpora exist in multiple versions, or include uncorrected, corrected and re-corrected parts.",
        "The Annotation Graph Toolkit, version 1.0, contains a complete implementation of the annotation graph model, import filters for several formats, loading/storing data to an annotation server (MySQL), application programming interfaces in C++ and Tcl/tk, and example annotation tools for dialogue, ethology and interlinear text.",
        "The supported formats are: xlabel, TIMIT, BAS Partitur, Penn Treebank, Switchboard, LDC Callhome, CSV and AIF level 0.",

        "All software is distributed under an open source license, and is available from http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/AG/.",
        "Given that the annotation data can be stored in a relational database, it can be queried directly in SQL.",
        "More convenient, a domain-specific query language will be developed (see Cassidy and Bird 2000 and the work cited there).",
        "Query expressions will be transmitted over the web in the form of a CGI request, and translated into SQL by the annotation server.",
        "The resulting annotation data will be returned in the form of an XML document.",

        "These will always be hard problems; the proposed infrastructure will address them but no infrastructure is likely to eliminate conversion, integrity and provenance issues.",
        "Annotation graphs focus on the problems of dealing with time series.",

        "In this way, conventional “joins” of relational table can convolve time-series annotations with paradigms (e.g. texts with dictionaries or utterances with speaker demographics).",
        "Through judicious compromises - such as one-time computer-assisted conversion of legacy annotation data and creating once-off interfaces to existing useful tools - and through the judicious combination of simple and well-supported formalisms and technologies as described above, we believe that the management problems can be substantially reduced in scale and severity.",
