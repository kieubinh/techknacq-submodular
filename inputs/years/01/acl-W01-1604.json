        "Since van der Sandt & Geurts (1991), van der Sandt (1992) and Geurts (1995, 1999) have put forward the notion of a fundamental identity of presupposition and anaphora, a fairly universal consensus seems to have developed that this view is basically correct.",
        "Assuming that this notion is intended to have empirical consequences I shall refer to this view in the following as the 'Presupposition is Anaphora Hypothesis', for short: the PIA hypothesis.",
        "There is surely no doubt that phenomena of presupposition and anaphora are not unrelated.",
        "Understanding anaphora quite conventionally as a way of resuming a previously established reference more or less involves the assumption that this reference has actually been established beforehand and in this sense is presupposed.",
        "In this rough and general sense anaphora is presuppositional.",
        "Conversely, in presupposing that one or the other proposition is true, a relation is established to something that either was said before, follows from something that was said before, or at least could reasonably have been said before; and this relation may in some rough and general sense be called anaphorical.",
        "Now Geurts and van der Sandt do not stay at a rough and general level, but turn these relations between anaphora and presupposition into a venerable theory of presupposition that yields certain technical advantages for the treatment of presupposition when it is implemented in (a variety of) Discourse Representation Theory (van der Sandt (1992) and Geurts (1995, 1999)).",
        "I shall argue below that despite this technical progress the PIA hypothesis obscures both the notion of presupposition and the notion of anaphora.",
        "The Procrustean relationship actually harms our understanding of both phenomena.",
        "At the same time, I shall argue, the Hypothesis is empirically wrong with respect to linguistic data.",
        "I shall start with the latter."

        "I assume a semantics for definite NPs that follows Löbner (1985); for short: a definite NP is analysed as expressing (or, if you prefer, denoting or even referring to) a function, in the sense that it yields a unique value for (whatever may be) its arguments.",
        "Some definite NPs achieve their functional characteristic by virtue of properties of their context of occurrence: e.g.,",
        "(i) by plain resumption of a previously established discourse referent: A woman entered the room.",
        "The woman was wearing black.",

        "Or, (iii) by reference to the utterance situation: This month shows a new decrease in unemployment.",
        "Other definite NPs, however, would appear to be definite merely by virtue of their lexical and (internal) compositional semantics.",
        "Examples are the following:",
        "(1) the sum of 3 and 4 (2) the first thing that comes to mind when one thinks of Aalborg (3) the April 2001 unemployment figures for Germany (4) the beauty of a sunset (5) the H2O molecule",

        "But the notion that there should be an anaphorical relation between the presupposing expressions in (1)-(5) and their preceding, or embedding, context that would be related in any relevant way to the interpretation of (1)-(5) is hard to grasp.",
        "I take it rather that these NPs would rather demonstrate that presupposition may occur without anaphora.",
        "If one implements an algorithm for the processing for definite NPs that handles (1)-(5) by first accommodating the relevant entities as discourse referents (”global accommodation”) and then lets the newly accommodated objects be bound by them, this would just obliterate the difference between the contributions of lexical and compositional semantics on the one hand and of discourse semantics on the other.",
        "If one appreciates this difference, one should be rather reluctant to make it technically disappear in the processing mechanism.",
        "The more so, because it adds nothing to the understanding of definiteness and if the expressions in (1)-(5), used out of the blue or in any case without actual discourse antecedents, are declared anaphors, it would be hard to see what is left of the notion of anaphora.",

        "In (10) and (10'), with the intonationally marked grocer, no anaphoric reference to Jones comes about, but instead a presupposition is triggered that leads to the accommodation of a new discourse referent as the reference for the old grocer - with the properties of being old and a shopkeeper.",
        "In occurrences of this kind there is actually a choice between either anaphora or presupposition in the interpretation of the definite NP; but each clearly excludes the other.",

        "I doubt that this is the case for the PIA hypothesis.",
        "It obliterates a distinction between two phenomena that are different in an interesting way: The business of anaphora proper is the maintenance of reference in discourse (I am not talking here of the entirely different phenomenon of bound or \"syntactic\" anaphora (cf. Bosch 1983), which is rather a morphosyntactic matter and has nothing to do with either reference or presupposition).",
        "Presupposition on the other hand - and here I agree with van der Sandt (1992) - is not essentially bound up with reference, but is an inferential mechanism that contributes to discourse coherence in its own way by constraining the notion of contextual acceptability - pretty much the way proposed in van der Sandt (1988).",
        "The attempt to iron out some of the remaining difficulties in the latter approach by reducing presupposition to anaphora may be technically viable (but since this is not my issue here, I choose to remain agnostic with respect to this question), but it assumes a notion of anaphora that is, I believe, eventually not very helpful.",
        "My unsolicited advice, then, is this: Let us grant that van der Sandt and Geurts have demonstrated a very close connection, that was previously never properly detailed, between anaphora and presupposition.",
        "This much understood, we had better turn to some of the questions where current insight about anaphora and presupposition is pretty poor and where we may still learn a lot more about both phenomena and their relation.",
        "I am thinking, in particular, of the possibly very different relation of anaphora and presupposition to compositionality: One may reasonably hold that presupposition relations can be modelled compositionally.",
        "There is no way, however, as far as I can see for a realistic compositional model of anaphoric relations.",
