        "The development of spoken dialogue systems is faced with limitations in speech recognition technologies that make recognition errors a recurring problem for any dialogue system.",
        "Several studies have shown little correlation between speech recognition scores and user satisfaction, or the ability to complete the tasks underlying spoken dialogue [Yankelovich et al., 1995] [Dybkjaer et al., 1997], suggesting that a certain level of errors should not prevent spoken dialogue systems from being successful.",
        "However, most of the studies on speech recognition errors have concentrated either on parsing incomplete utterances or on global dialogue robustness, i.e. at task completion level [Allen et al., 1996] [Stromback and Jonsson, 1998] [Brandt-Pook et al., 1996].",
        "In this paper, we investigate the impact of speech recognition errors on a fully-implemented prototype for a task-oriented dialogue system.",
        "This system supports a conversational character for Interactive Television and is based on a speech acts formalism.",
        "We report a first empirical study on the consequences of speech recognition errors on the identification of speech acts, and the conditions under which the system can be robust to those errors."

        "The VIP (“Virtual Interactive Presenter”) system is a dialogue-based interface to an Electronic Programme Guide (EPG).",
        "One main advantage of human-computer dialogue is that it breaks down the information exchange into elementary units that correspond to the actual criteria on the basis of which TV programmes are selected, i.e. individual features such as the cast, the movie genre, its rating, etc.",
        "It assists the user in progressively refining the programme description without requiring explicit knowledge of the editorial categories used to index the EPG.",
        "Related applications, i.e. dialogue systems involving the choice of a film or TV programme have been also described in [Hagen, 2000] [Ludwig et al., 2000].",
        "Our system is a mixed-initiative conversational interface organised around a human-like character with which the user communicates through speech recognition [Nagao and Takeuchi, 1994] [Beskow and McGlashan, 1997].",
        "The interface is based on the Microsoft AgentTM system with a set of animated bitmaps acquired from a real human subject (Figure 1).",
        "An example dialogue illustrating the system capabilities is presented below (this example has been obtained with keyboard input only).",
        "After greetings by the system, the user opens the dialogue with a first request (U1).",
        "Even though the system’s goal is to refine the selection, it offers potential choices even at early stages of the dialogue, e.g. after only the programme genre has been specified (S2).",
        "As the dialogue progresses, it gives a count of programmes matching the current criteria and proposes the best one.",
        "The system acknowledges the most specific selections only (S 10, S14).",
        "Also, the system takes initiative whenever necessary (S12).",
        "It repairs non-productive dialogue, i.e. when several utterances have not altered the programme description (“is this programme all right, then?”).",
        "Whenever high-level categories are rejected by the user, leaaving the system without sufficient criteria to filter the EPG contents, it restarts the dialogue (“what would you like then?”, S 12).",
        "U1: Do you have any sports programmes S2: I have found 5 programmes for this choice.",
        "Would you like to watch “Keegan’s greatest games”?",
        "U3: Can I have some cricket instead?",
        "The software architecture is a pipeline comprising speech recognition, parsing and dialogue.",
        "In the next sections, we describe each of these components from the perspective of speech recognition errors.",
        "Finally, we discuss the impact of speech recognition errors on example dialogues and the mechanisms that contribute to dialogue robustness."

        "Speech recognition is based on the ABBOT system [Robinson et al., 1996].",
        "A specific ABBOT version has been developed for the VIP prototype, VIP-ABBOT, with a test vocabulary of 300+ words (Figure 2).",
        "This version is based on a trigram model, trained on a small corpus of 200 user questions and replies, using data from six speakers (average recording time is twelve minutes).",
        "Though the size of the corpus is in principle too small to obtain an accurate language model, the VIP-ABBOT system achieves a satisfactory performance.",
        "Global speech recognition accuracy has been tested as part of the development of the VIP-ABBOT version.",
        "The recognition accuracy varied across tests from 65 to a maximum 80 % (at this stage only laboratory conditions with non-noisy environments and good quality microphones have been considered).",
        "The system outputs the 1-best recognised utterance, which is passed to the dialogue system via a datagram socket.",
        "We have assembled an evaluation corpus of 500 utterances, collected from five speakers including one non-native speaker.",
        "Including a non-native speaker was an empirical way of increasing the error rate.",
        "Other researchers have suggested varying parameters of the speech recognition system, such as the beam width [Boros et al., 1996], as a method to increase word error rate, in order to collect error corpora.",
        "However, they have not documented whether the kind of errors induced in this way actually reproduce (in terms of distribution) those obtained during the actual use of the system.",
        "On the other hand, recognition errors obtained with native and non-native speakers appear similar in our experience, the overall error rate just being higher in the latter.",
        "For the whole corpus, approximately 50% of recognised utterances contain at least one speech recognition error."

      "text": [
        "Strictly speaking, a significant proportion (around 50%) of the recognition hypotheses produced by VIP-ABBOT are ungrammatical.",
        "For obvious reasons, and since the early stages of system development, we have abandoned the idea of producing a complete parse for the speech input, not so much because user expressions themselves could be ungrammatical but rather because recognised utterances were most certain to be, considering the error rate.",
        "One of the key questions for parsing, especially in the case of dialogue, where the average utterance length is 5-7 words, is whether complete parsing is at all necessary [Lewin et al., 1999].",
        "We have implemented a simplified parser based on a variant of Tree-Adjoining Grammars [Cavazza, 1998], This syntactic formalism being lexicalised has interesting properties in terms of syntax-semantics integration.",
        "This lexicalised formalism, combined with a simple bottom-up parser, is well adapted to the partial parsing of ungrammatical utterances (Figure 3).",
        "The main goal of parsing is to produce a semantic structure from which speech acts can be identified.",
        "Semantic features are aggregated as the parsing progresses following the syntactic operations.",
        "As a result, the parser produces a feature structure whose semantic elements can be mapped to the descriptors indexing the programmes in the EPG, such as genre (e.g. “movie”, “news”, “documentary”), sub-genre (e.g., “comedy”, “lifestyle”), cast (e.g., “Jeremy Clarkson”), channel (“BBC one”), rating (e.g., “caution”, “family”), etc.",
        "Whenever the parser fails to produce a single parse, the semantic structures obtained from partial parses are merged on a content basis.",
        "For instance, descriptors such as “cast” or “channel” are attached to programme descriptions, etc.",
        "This process confers a good level of robustness and tolerance to ungrammaticality.",
        "This kind of approach, where dialogue strategy is privileged over parsing was inspired from early versions of the AGS system [Sadek, 1999].",
        "These semantic structures are used to generate search filters on the EPG database, which correspond to semantic descriptions of the user choice.",

        "The dialogue strategy has been determined mainly from the task model.",
        "As the task is to progressively refine a programme description by using elementary dialogue acts, we have adopted a speech acts based approach [Traum and Hinkelmann, 1992].",
        "Each speech act corresponds to a specific construction operation – it is possible to map communicative operations (rejection, implicit rejection, specification, etc.)",
        "to the updating of the programme description, which is a filter through which the EPG database is searched.",
        "We are using a content-based approach to the identification of speech acts [Cavazza, 2000].",
        "This method has similarities with the one previously described by Maier [1996].",
        "Another source of inspiration was the work of Walker [1996], though it was restricted to the recognition of acceptance rather than a complete set of speech acts.",
        "Figure 4 shows the construction of search filters from the semantic contents of user utterances.",
        "Once a new",
        "utterance is analysed, its semantic contents are compared with the active search filter, which has been constructed from previous user utterances, and this comparison determines speech act recognition.",
        "For instance, when the last utterance contains semantic information for a programme sub-genre, the speech act is a specification.",
        "Explicit rejections are signalled by markers of negation, while implicit rejection speech acts are recognised when the semantic contents of the latest utterance overwrite the descriptors of the current filter (this is the case when, for instance, when the current filter contains the comedy sub-genre and the user asks “can I have a western?”).",
        "In this context, speech acts provide a unified and consistent way to determine the most appropriate answer to the user as well as the way in which the search filter should be updated at each dialogue turn.",
