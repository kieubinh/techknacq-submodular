        "In our initial experiments comparing human-human (HH) and human-computer (HC) interaction we have annotated dialogues from the air travel domain with several sets of tags: dialogue act, initiative and unsolicited information.",
        "Our aim is to begin an empirical exploration of how these aspects of the dialogue shed light on differences between HH and HC interactions.",
        "We found striking differences between the human-human and human-computer interactions.",
        "With many of the issues we examine here, researchers have voiced strong intuitions about the differences between HH and HC communication, but these intuitions have not previously been subject to empirical scrutiny.",
        "Why do we want to compare HH and HC interactions?",
        "We believe that an examination of the differences between HH and HC dialogues can help those working on the HC interactions to improve their systems.",
        "This will not necessarily mean making the HC interactions “more like” HH interactions; rather, we believe that such analysis can give us insights about the appropriateness and success of various communicative approaches in different settings.",
        "We are also interested in quantifying what it means for a dialogue to be “mixed-initiative”.",
        "There is liberal use of this term in work on human-computer dialogues, but there does not seem to be a clear sense of what it really means and how to define it.",
        "This work is being done in the context of the Communicator Travel task.",
        "Communicator is a DARPA-funded program involving major industry and academic sites, established to provide the next generation of intelligent conversational interfaces to distributed information.",
        "The goal of the program is to move beyond the current system initiated voice menu style of dialogue interaction towards a more flexible strategy of shared conversational control between human and system.",
        "Work up to the fall of 2000 concentrated on the travel task, but groups are now moving into other domains with their dialogue systems."

        "We rejected the DAMSL tag set (Core and Allen, 1997; Core et al., 1999) on the grounds that is was too sophisticated for our purposes, covering many aspects of dialogue structure that were not necessarily relevant for our task such as intentionality, grounding and context tracking.",
        "In addition, the interannotator agreement levels reported for this scheme are quite low.",
        "Some of the other tag sets we considered were (Carletta et al., 1995; Nakatani et al., 1995; van Vark et al., 1996; Di Eugenio et al., 1998; Jurafsky et al., 1997).",
        "In collaboration with AT&T, we arrived at a set of changes to our tag set that would make it compatible with their efforts to tag system utterances automatically (Walker and Passonneau, 2001), in the hopes of being able to share results with them more easily.",
        "We added a situation/conversation/task distinction to a number of our tags (e.g. GIVE-INFORMATION split into GIVE-TASK-INFO, GIVE-SITUATION-INFO and GIVE-CONVERSATION-INFO).",
        "We also added a NOT-UNDERSTAND tag and collapsed some original tags into super-categories.",

        "The situation/conversation/task distinction turned out to be extremely difficult for the taggers to make; we believe that revisions to the tagging guidelines could lead to some improvement on this front, but without enumerating the kinds of utterances which fall into each category, this will remain a difficult task.",
        "We tagged each utterance that contained some speech, i.e. was not composed entirely of non-speech annotation like *pause* or [click], and we split turns4 into utterances using guidelines that had been developed internally for another purpose.",
        "Utterances on this definition were roughly clause-sized units, and possibly fragmentary.5 This meant that there were often multiple dialogue acts (DAs) per turn, and where there were multiple sequential DAs of the same type, we collapsed them under a single tag on the assumption that they were combining to “perform” that DA.",
        "We initially split some of the CSTAR tags",
        "into IMPLICIT and EXPLICIT versions, but found that the IMPLICIT cases were so hard to identify that we were not using those tags, and they were dropped from the tag set.",

        "We define response delay as the number of system turns it takes before the information is acknowledged by the system (either correctly or incorrectly.)",
        "If a system responds immediately to the unsolicited information, a count of zero turns is recorded.",
        "Figure 5 shows the difference among systems in responding to unsolicited information.",
        "We graphed both the average total number of system turns as well as the average number of turns minus repetitions.",
        "HC B responds almost immediately to 10 This issue may also be related to where in the dialogue errors occur.",
        "We are pursuing another line of research which looks at automatic error detection, described in (Aberdeen et al., 2001).",
        "We believe we may also be able to detect unsolicited information automatically, as well as to see whether it is likely to trigger errors by the system.",
        "Figure 6 shows the different rates at which systems acknowledge unsolicited information for different fields.",
        "For example, departure city is recognized and validated almost immediately.",
        "Return date and flight type are incorporated fairly quickly when the system understands what is being said.",
        "If we look at the effects of experience on the amount of unsolicited information offered, as shown in Figure 7, we can see that users tend to provide more unsolicited information over time (i.e., as they make more calls to the systems).",
        "This effect may be the result of increased user confidence in the systems at handling unsolicited information.",
        "It also may be attributed to user boredom; as time goes on, users may be trying to finish the task as quickly as possible.",
        "Even if this is true, however, it demonstrates attempts by users to take more control of the interactions as",
        "Our data also show that the success rate of incorporating unsolicited information improves with user experience.",
        "The ratio of successes to failures increases in later calls to the systems (Figure 8)."

        "This was a relatively small study, but many of the results are sufficiently striking that we expect them to hold over large sets of dialogues.",
        "First, it is clear that (for our definition of the term) initiative is skewed towards the computer expert in the human-computer dialogues, despite claims of developers to the contrary.",
        "Whether this is desirable or not is a separate issue, but we believe it is a move forward to be able to quantify this difference.",
        "Second, there are clear differences in dialogue act patterns between the HH and HC dialogues.",
        "When the DAs correspond to basic dialogue moves, like questions or signals of agreement, we can begin to see how the dialogue dynamic is different in the human computer situation.",
        "In general, the conversation was much more balanced between traveler and expert in the HH setting, in terms of amount of speech, types of dialogue acts and with respect to initiative.",
        "In the HC conversations, the system dominated, in number of words and dialogue acts and in initiative.",
        "We are very interested in the selection of the ‘right’ tag set for a given task.",
        "As we noted in our discussion of DA tagging, we had very different outcomes with two closely related tag sets.",
        "Clearly the choice of tag set is highly dependent on the use the tagged data will be put to, how easily the task can be characterized in the set of tagging guidelines, and what trade-offs in accuracy vs. richness of representation are acceptable.",
        "A central question we are left with is “Why don’t the users talk more in HC dialogues?” Is it that they are happy to just give short, specific answers to very directed questions?",
        "Or do they “learn” that longer answers are likely to cause the systems problems?",
        "Or perhaps users have preconceived notions (often justified) that the computer will not understand long utterances?",
        "We may speculate that poor speech recognition performance is a major factor shaping this behavior, leading system designers to attempt to constrain what users can say, while simultneously attempting to hold onto the initiative.",
        "(Walker et al.",
        "(2001) found sentence accuracy to be one of the significant predictors of user satisfaction in the Summer 2000 DARPA Communicator data collection.)",
        "There are some cases where the experts in the HC dialogues say things their human counterparts need not.",
        "One obvious case, which appears in even the small example dialogues we are using here, is that the systems tend to repeat utterances when there is some processing difficulty.",
        "In the same vein, errors and misunderstandings are more frequent in the HC data, resulting in (some fairly verbose) efforts by the systems to identify the problem and get the conversation back on track."
