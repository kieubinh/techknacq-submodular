        "Clarification requests (CRs) are common in human conversation.",
        "They can take various forms and can be intended by the speaker making the request (the CR initiator) to request various types of clarification information (i.e. they can have various readings), but have in common the fact that they are in a sense meta-dialogue acts – they concern the content or form of a previous utterance that has failed to be fully comprehended by the initiator.",
        "It is not usual for computer dialogue systems do be able to process CRs produced by the user.",
        "One can see how important this might be in a negotiative dialogue by considering the following imagined exchange, which gives some possible alternative responses to a CR initiated by the caller: System: Would you like to travel via Paris or Amsterdam?",
        "Caller: Paris?",
        "System: (a) Yes, Paris.",
        "(b) Paris, France.",
        "(c) Paris is the quickest route, although Amsterdam is the cheapest.",
        "(d) OK.",
        "Your ticket via",
        "Paris will be posted to you.",
        "Goodbye.",
        "Any of responses (a) – (c), which correctly interpret the caller's move as a CR, might be regarded as useful to the caller: response (d), which incorrectly interprets it as an answer to the system's question, would not be acceptable under any circumstances.",
        "Which of (a) – (c) is preferred will depend on the reading intended.",
        "As a first step towards a full theory of CR interpretation, we therefore believe it is important to have information about which readings are available via which forms.",
        "Previous studies have examined some individual CR forms and given possible analyses for these forms.",
        "In this paper we describe an attempt to exhaustively categorise CR forms and readings based on corpus work, and discuss the implications of our results for further analysis.",
        "The analyses so far proposed require all in",
        "formation from a previous utterance to be retained in memory (not only propositional content but syntax and phonology).",
        "The retention of such a large amount of information indefinitely poses obvious problems for any implementation with finite resources, and seems at odds with some results from work in psycholinguistics: studies such as (Sachs, 1967; van Dijk and Kintsch, 1983) have argued that surface information such as syntax is retained only in the short term (see (Fletcher, 1994) for an overview).",
        "Our corpus work has therefore had the additional aim of identification of the maximum distance between a CR and the utterance being clarified (the source utterance).",
        "In this section we give a brief overview of CR forms identified in previous work, together with the analyses proposed and the readings that these analyses give rise to.",
        "In sections 2 and 3 we list the possible CR forms and readings that we have identified from corpus analysis.",
        "In section 4 we describe this analysis and give detailed results, including a discussion of apparent correlations between certain forms and readings and of maximum observed CR-source separation (CSS) distance.",
        "Finally, in section 5 we discuss the implications of our findings for an intended dialogue system implementation."

        "is the reference of your utterance X?\".",
        "A possible lexical identification reading is also discussed, but no analysis given.",
        "They also raise the issue of whether these specific readings really exist or could be subsumed by a single vague reading, but give evidence that this is not the case: they cite examples of CR misunderstanding leading to repeated attempts to elicit the desired clarificational information, showing that a specific reading was intended; they also point out that some readings involve different parallelism conditions.",

        "Of the remaining readings, we believe that the lexical reading can be treated by an extension of the existing analysis.",
        "Corrections will need further research but make up only a small proportion of CRs.",
        "Of the remaining forms, we believe that two (non-reprise and conventional) can be accommodated relatively smoothly within our current HPSG framework.",
        "Gaps and fillers, however, present a significant challenge and will be the subject of future research.",
        "The measurements of CSS distance show that an utterance record with length of the order of ten sentences would be sufficient to allow a dialogue system to process the vast majority of CRs.",
        "We are in the process of implementing our existing analyses for the CR forms and readings described above within a HPSG/TrindiKit-based dialogue system which incorporates the ellipsis resolution capability of SHARDS (Ginzburg et al., 2001a) and the dialogue move engine of GoDiS (Lars-son et al., 2000).",
        "At time of writing, the system can successfully produce both clausal and constituent readings.",
        "As a result of the research outlined in this paper, a lexical reading is currently being implemented.",
        "Our results also suggest that investigation into disambiguation of reading, possibly on the basis of dialogue information state and/or intonation, will be required."
