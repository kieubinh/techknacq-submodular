        "The dialogue manager of a spoken language system is responsible for determining what contributions a system can make and when it can make them.",
        "The question is, what should the dialogue manager pay attention to in order to accomplish this?",
        "Two areas of research have shaped our understanding of what happens in dialogue: research in dialogue structure and in mixed initiative.",
        "Grosz and Sidner (1986) proposed a theory of discourse structure to account for why an utterance was said and what was meant by it.",
        "Their theory has three components: linguistic structure, intentional structure and attentional state.",
        "Intentions are key to accounting for discourse structure, defining discourse coherence, and \"providing a coherent conceptualization of the term `discourse' itself.\" The intentional structure describes the purpose of the discourse as a whole, and the relationship of the purpose of each discourse segment to the main discourse purpose or other discourse segment purposes.",
        "All utterances within a segment contribute to the purpose of that segment.",
        "This theory, however, does not comment on initiative within the segment.",
        "Nor does it specify when and how speakers should start a segment or end the current one.",
        "Hence, it underspecifies what speakers can do in dialogue.",
        "Research in initiative works to account for which speaker is driving the conversation at any given point.",
        "For example, in a question-answer pair, the speaker asking the question is said to have the initiative (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988; Walker and Whittaker, 1990; Novick and Sutton, 1997).",
        "Whittaker and Stenton segmented dialogues where initiative shifts from one speaker to the other.",
        "They found that initiative \"did not alternate from speaker to speaker on a turn by turn basis, but that there were long sequences of turns in which [initiative] remained with one speaker.",
        "In a mixed initiative system, the dialogue manager needs to track initiative in order to know when the system should add significant content, and when it should let the user take over.",
        "However, no theory has offered a good account of why a speaker would want to take the initiative, or keep it once they have it.",
        "In the rest of this paper we first describe previous work in discourse structure and in initiative and describe our coding of them.",
        "Next, we explore the relationship between discourse structure and initiative.",
        "As previous studies have found (Whittaker and Stenton, 1988; Walker and Whittaker, 1990), there is a close correlation between them, but the relationship is not direct.",
        "We then explore how initiative can shift within a subdialogue and find two types of contributions that a speaker can make in a discourse segment: a special kind of acknowledgment we call forward acknowledgment, and short contributions that add content to the segment.",
        "We propose that initiative is subordinate to intentional structure.",
        "Additionally, our proposal is better able to account for question-answer pairs and how initiative returns to the original speaker after an embedded subdialogue.",
        "It will have important implications for dialogue management: a system only needs to model intentional structure, from which initiative follows."

        "The clarification subdialogue initiated by the user (u) checks that the plan the user is developing will work, and so it also supports the general purpose of developing the plan.",

        "We will use these annotation schemes as a foundation, and monitor our annotation results to ensure we achieve good intercoder reliability.",
        "Our theory necessitates that we better understand the structure of discourse, how it is built, and the actions and rules that a discourse manager can use to affect the discourse structure.",
        "We also need to understand the reasoning process that determines whether a participant will make an other-contribution or start a new subdialogue.",
