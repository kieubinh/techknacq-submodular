        "Natural language is efficient in the sense that a single message can convey different semantic contents in different contexts.",
        "And indeed, recent trends in semantics (e.g. optimality theoretic semantics) suggest that the actual interpretation of an utterance is highly underspecified by the conventional meanings of the sentence that is used.",
        "This requires, however, that language users have robust ways to resolve the underspecification and/or ambiguity.",
        "In this paper I will discuss two ways This research has been made possible by a fellowship of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.",
        "of doing this.",
        "First, one where the particular conversational situation is important; second, one which depends on more general conventions.",
        "2 The Q and I principle Neo-Gricean pragmatics seeks to reduce Grice's maxims of conversation to the so-called Q and I principles.",
        "Both are used to account for many conversational implicatures.",
        "The Q-principle (implementing Grice's first maxim of Quantity) advises the speaker to say as much as he can to fulfill his communicative goals, while the 1--principle (implementing Grice's other maxims, except for quality) advises the speaker to say no more than he must to fulfill these goals.",
        "Both principles help to strengthen what is communicated by a sentence.",
        "The Q-principle induces inferences from the use of one expression to the assumption that the speaker did not intend to communicate a contrasting, and informationally stronger, one.",
        "This principle is thus essentially metalinguistic in kind, and accounts for both `scalar' and `clausal' implicatures.",
        "It allows us, for instance, to conclude from \"John ate some of the cookies\" to \"John didn't eat all of the cookies\" (scalar implica-ture), and from \"A or B\" to \"A or B, but not both\" (clausal + scalar implicature).",
        "The (- principle allows us to infer from the use of an expression to its most informative or stereotypical interpretation.",
        "It is used, for instance, to enrich the interpretation of a conjunction to a temporal sequential, or causal, relation, and it allows us to interpret a conditional like `John walks, if Mary walks' as the bicondi-tional `John walks if and only Mary walks'."

        "Although the Q and I principles are intuitively appealing, they give rise to a number of conceptual and empirical problems.",
        "Let's start with some cases where it is predicted that Q-implicatures arise, although in fact they don't.",
        "First, at least when implemented as Gazdar (1979) did, we can derive from the existential \"Someone is sick\" as a Q-implicature that (the speaker knows that) a is not sick, for any individual a.",
        "Second, on the assumption that scales are defined in terms of entailment, it is predicted that we can infer from `B, if A' to the conclusion that it is not the case that the stronger `B if and only if A' holds, although in a lot of situations this is exactly what we can conclude.",
        "Third, on the same assumption, it is incorrectly predicted that we can infer `not regret A' from `know A'.",
        "Horn, Levinson and others have argued that these problems can be prevented by (i) weakening the force of Q-implicatures from know-not to not-know (for the first problem), and by putting constraints on what counts as contrastive expressions: contrastive expressions must be lexical items (second problem) and must have the same presuppositions (for the third).",
        "Although it can be argued that for the biconditional interpretation this – somewhat ad hoc – solution solves the second problem, Gazdar (1979) argued that the constraints doesn't solve the third one.",
        "Moreover, the most serious problematic cases where Q-implicatures overgenerate cannot be explained away in this way: The Horn/Gazdar/Levinson/Atlas analysis of Q-implicatures as generalized conversational implicatures (PCIs) triggered solely by lexical expressions cannot explain why from A's answer \"John has 2 children\" to Q's question \"Who has 2 children?\"",
        "the implicature \"John has only 2 children\" does not even arise as a default (cf. van Kuppevelt).",
        "This latter example seems to suggest that these so-called Q-implicatures are, after all, dependent on the conversational situation, in particular on the question being asked.",
        "Proponents of the Q and I pragmatics (Horn, Levinson), followed by Matsumoto (1995), argue that in such particular conversational situations the generalized conversational implicature is can-celled, for reasons of relevance: The answer is already informative enough for the purpose of the conversation.",
        "I will argue, however, that informativity is, in general, not the crucial issue, and that it is much more natural to assume that – for reasons of relevance in this particular situation – the (potential) implicature does not even arise.",
        "3.2 Not general enough Not only does the standard analysis of Q-implicatures overgeneralize, it also doesn't seem to be general enough.",
        "First, as discussed extensively by Hirschberg (1985), the standard analysis is of no help to account for certain examples that intuitively should be analyzed as scalar implicatures.",
        "If Mary's potential new boss asks her at her job-interview whether she speaks French, and she answers by saying \"My sister does\", he can conclude that Mary herself does not.",
        "The standard analysis fails to account for this, because (a) scalar implicatures are all analyzed in terms of the Q-principle, (b) the Q-principle is stated in terms of informativitg, but (c) the proposition that Mary speaks French is not more informative (i.e. entails) than the proposition that her sister does.",
        "This example suggests (i) that scalar implicatures should not exclusively be accounted for in terms of informativity, and (ii) that just like in the previous example, also here the relevant implicature crucially depends on the conversational situation (i.e. the beliefs and preferences of the agents involved).",
        "Second, as discussed by McCawley (1993), the implicatures generated by the (and, or) scale cannot account for the fact that a sentence of the form `A or B or C' gives rise to the inference that only one of the three is true.",
        "A final example where the standard analysis of Q-implicatures isn't general enough was discussed by Groenendijk & Stokhof (1984).",
        "They observe that when A answers Q's question \"Who comes?\"",
        "by saying \"Peter comes\", we typically interpret the answer as being exhaustive.",
        "That is, we interpret A's answer as \"Only Peter comes\".",
        "They claim that this kind of inference should intuitively be accounted for in terms of Grice's maxim of Quantity (as a Q-implicature), but note that the standard implementation does not predict the exhaustivity of the answer.",
        "Still, it seems that the exhaustive interpretation of the answer should be derived by Gricean pragmatics on the assumption that answers are as informative as the question requires.",
        "I conclude that the scales relevant for the implicatures depend on the conversational situation (i.e. question asked) and the beliefs and preferences of the agents involved is in correspondence with Hirschberg's claim that scales are dependent on context.",
        "However, we would like to say something more; we would also like to say how the relevant scale depends on the question asked and the relevant beliefs and desires."

        "In this respect, important progress has been made recently by Merin (1997).",
        "Following the lead of Anscombre & Ducrot (1983), Merin argues that scales should be defined not in terms of informativity, but rather in terms of a notion of relevance.",
        "The relevance of a proposition is determined in terms of the argumentative force the proposition would have in that particular conversational situation.",
        "The relevance of an assertion is then defined in information/decision/game theoretical terms, based on the assumption that the participants of the conversation have strictly opposing preferences, i.e. that the participants play a zero-sum game.",
        "Although Merin convincingly shows that some scalar implicatures (in particular the Hirschberg examples) can be accounted for appropriately on the assumption that players argue for particular hypotheses, and that their contribution should be interpreted in the most relevant way (i.e. strongest argument), it is intuitively clear that not all conversations can, and should, be modeled as zero-sum games.",
        "It makes little sense, for instance, to assume that the exhaustive interpretation of \"John has 2 children\" as answer to the question \"How many children does John have?\"",
        "can be explained in terms of opposing preferences between questioner and answerer, for the latter typically cooperates with the former.",
        "What is called for, then, is a generalization of Merin's notion of relevance that also measures the relevance of propositions in cooperative conversational situations.",
        "It seems only natural, on the assumption that speakers are relevance optimizers, that once we can define such a measure, not only the typical Q-implicatures can be accounted for in terms of relevance, but also the I-implicatures from conditional to biconditional, and Groe-nendijk & Stokhof's (1984) observation that answers are normally interpreted in an exhaustive way.",
        "As we will see in the next section, Groenendijk & Stokhof (1984) show that almost all typical Q-implicatures can be analyzed alternatively in terms of their explicit exhaustivity-operator, without giving rise to the above discussed overgeneralizat ions, when the clause that gives rise to the implicature is used as an answer to a question."

        "This exhaustivity operator accounts for many of the implicatures traditionally accounted for in terms of Grice's maxim of quantity.",
        "First, it obviously accounts for the fact that when Who comes?",
        "is answered by John we conclude that only John comes.",

        "Horn (2000) calls this inference conversion and explicitly proposes to account for it in terms of the I-principle.",

        "The question that started information theory was: how can we send messages over a channel as quickly as possible without distortion?",
        "The answer is: by looking for the optimal coding; to represent the data in a way as comprehensive as possible.",
        "Suppose we have a source (without memory) that sends messages from a set U = {u1, ..., u,} in terms of codes built up from codesymbols belonging to the code-alphabet S = {s1, ..., s, }.",
        "A source code, or coding system, C, is defined as a function from U to S*, where`*' is Kleene's star.",
        "For example, C(red) = 00, C(white) = 11, C(blue) = 10, C(orange) = 01 is a source code for U = {red, white, blue, orange} with alphabet S = {0, 1}.",
        "Of course, the source and alphabet allow for many different codes.",
        "Intuitively, however, some codings are more efficient than others.",
        "What is the best coding system?",
        "The coding system with the shortest expected length.",
        "The crucial insight of Shannon (1948) was that this expected length depends not only on the length of the messages after encoding, but also on the probability with which the messages are sent.",
        "Suppose that function P assigns numbers to the elements of U such that �uEU P(u) = 1, i.e. suppose that P is a probability distribution over U.",
        "Suppose, moreover, that l(C(u)) is the length of the codeword associated with u.",
        "In that case, the expected length of a source code C for U and P is given by:",
        "To illustrate, let us extend our example by assuming that the probability distribution of U is P (red) = 1�, P (white) = 14, P (blue) = 1�, P(orange) = 1�.",
        "Then we can easily see that the coding C'(red) = 0, C'(white) = 10, C' (blue) = 110, C' (orange) = 111 has a shorter expected length than the coding given above: 1.75 to 2.",
        "A crucial difference between the two codings is that in distinction with C, C' does not encode all elements of U with the same length: the more probable elements of U get an encoding with a shorter length.3 This holds in general: in case P(ui) > P(uj) the optimal coding C will be such that l(C(ui)) < l(C(uj)) (cf. Cover & Thomas, 1991).",
        "Thus, the messages that are more likely to be sent will be encoded with a smaller length.",
        "This fact can now be used to account for Horn's division of pragmatic labor.",
        "Suppose that speakers have the following set of contents/meanings that they might want to communicate: M = {m1, ..., m,}.",
        "On average, we might assume that the probabilities with which they want to communicate these contents/ meanings are correlated with the probabilities with which these contents are true: if mi is more likely to be the case, or more stereotypical, than mj, the probability that speakers want to communicate mi is higher than that of mj.",
        "In other communicative situations the probability with which the elements of M are communicated depends on how salient the elements of M are.4 Speakers cannot send the contents without representing them.",
        "Let us assume that speakers can use the elements of R (the representations), R = {r1, ..., rk}, to encode the elements of M. The elements of R might be varied: some are more complex than others.",
        "Codings are now functions from M to R. Just as before we can ask: what is the best coding?",
        "Following standards in data comprehension, the answer is: the coding that minimizes average complexity.",
        "Average complexity of coding system C 3 There exists a close connection with entropy too: for coding C', but not for C, the expected length, L(C') is equal to the entropy of U, E(U).",
        "It turns out that this is the optimal one can reach for w.r.t.",
        "uniquely decodable codes.",
        "Notice that this means that the optimal codelength for each ui is equal to",
        "Atlas, J. and S. Levinson (1981), `It-Clefts, Informativeness and Logical Form', In: P. Cole (ed.",
        "), Radical Pragmatics, New York, AP.",
        "Now it is easy to show that the assumption of optimal coding accounts for Horn's observation that simple expressions get a salient/ stereotypical interpretation, while complex expressions a marked one.",
        "Suppose that the conventional meanings of representations ri and rj are such that they both could express mi and mj.",
        "For instance, with both words kill and cause to die we could denote situations of direct (stereotypical) and indirect (marked) killing, and with both unstressed he and stressed HE we could refer to both salient and non-salient male individuals in the discourse.",
        "Still, the less complex kill will typically be interpreted as direct stereotypical killing, an the other way around for complex cause to die.",
        "And this follows from the assumption that speakers use a language that optimally encodes the relevant information.",
        "In this case we have two relevantly different coding systems: C, which assigns mi to ri and mj to rj, and C', which assigns mi to rj and mj to ri.",
        "The probabilities and complexities are such that P(mi) > P(mj) and Compl(ri) > Comp(rj).",
        "A standard proof showing that Compl (C') – Compl (C) > 0 demonstrates then that C is a more optimal coding than C' (where I abbreviate P(mi) by pi, Compl(ri) by cpli, and `x' by `-'):",
        "Because pi – pj > 0, C' can only be more optimal than C in case cplj – cpli < 0.",
        "But this is by assumption not the case, and so C is preferred to C'.",
        "The same proof shows that when pi – pj > 0 the optimal code is such that cpli < cplj ; only then Compl (C') – Compl (C) > 0.",
        "Horn's division explained."
