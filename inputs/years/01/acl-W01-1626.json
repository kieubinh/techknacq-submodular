        "Subjectivity in natural language refers to aspects of language used to express opinions and evaluations (Banfield, 1982; Wiebe, 1994).",
        "Subjectivity tagging is distinguishing sentences used to present opinions and other forms of subjectivity (subjective sentences) from sentences used to objectively present factual information (objective sentences).",
        "This task is especially relevant for news reporting and Internet forums, in which opinions of various agents are expressed.",
        "There are numerous applications for which subjectivity tagging is relevant.",
        "Two are information retrieval and information extraction.",
        "Current extraction and retrieval technology focuses almost exclusively on the subject matter of documents.",
        "However, additional aspects of a document influence its relevance, including, e.g., the evidential status of the material presented, and the attitudes expressed about the topic (Kessler et al., 1997).",
        "Knowledge of subjective language would also be useful in flame recognition (Spertus, 1997; Kaufer, 2000), email classification (Aone et al., 2000), intellectual attribution in text (Teufel and Moens, 2000), recognizing speaker role in radio broadcasts (Barzilay et al., 2000), review mining (Terveen et al., 1997), generation and style (Hovy, 1987), clustering documents by ideological point of view (Sack, 1995), and any other application that would benefit from knowledge of how opinionated the language is, and whether or not the writer purports to objectively present factual material.",
        "To use subjectivity tagging in applications, good linguistic clues must be found.",
        "As with many pragmatic and discourse distinctions, existing lexical resources are not comprehensively coded for subjectivity.",
        "The goal of our current work is learning subjectivity clues from corpora.",
        "This paper contributes to this goal by empirically examining subjectivity.",
        "We explore annotating subjectivity at different levels (expression, sentence, document) and produce corpora annotated at different levels.",
        "Annotator agreement is analyzed to understand and assess the viability of such annotations.",
        "In addition, because expression-level annotations are fine-grained and thus very informative, these annotations are examined to gain knowledge about subjectivity.",
        "We also use our annotations and existing editorial annotations to generate and test features of subjectivity.",
        "Altogether, the observations and results of these studies provide valuable information that will facilitate designing effective machine learning systems for recognizing subjectivity.",
        "The remainder of this paper first provides background about subjectivity, then presents results for document-level annotations, followed by an analysis of expression-level annotations.",
        "Results for features generated using document-level annotations are next, ending with conclusions."

        "In previous work (Wiebe et al., 1999; Bruce and Wiebe, 1999), a corpus of sentences from the Wall Street Journal Treebank Corpus (Marcus et al., 1993) was manually annotated with subjectivity classifications by multiple judges.",
        "The judges were instructed to consider a sentence to be subjective if they perceived any significant expression of subjectivity (of any source) in the sentence, and to consider the sentence to be objective, otherwise.",
        "Agreement was summarized in terms of Cohen's K (Cohen, 1960), which compares the total probability of agreement to that expected if the taggers' classifications were statistically independent (i.e., \"chance agreement\").",
        "After two rounds of tagging by three judges, an average pairwise K value of .69 was achieved on a test set.",
        "The EM learning algorithm was used to produce corrected tags representing the consensus opinions of the taggers (Goodman, 1974; Dawid and Skene, 1979).",
        "An automatic system to perform subjectivity tagging was developed using the new tags as training and testing data.",
        "In 10-fold cross validation experiments, a probabilistic classifier obtained an average accuracy on subjectivity tagging of 72.17%, more than 20 percentage points higher than a baseline accuracy obtained by always choosing the more frequent class.",
        "Five part-of-speech features, two lexical features, and a paragraph feature were used.",
        "To identify richer features, (Wiebe, 2000) used Lin's (1998) method for clustering words according to distributional similarity, seeded by a small amount of detailed manual annotation, to automatically identify adjective PSEs.",
        "There are two parameters of this process, neither of which was varied in (Wiebe, 2000): C, the cluster size considered, and FT, a filtering threshold, such that, if the seed word and the words in its cluster have, as a set, lower precision than the filtering threshold on the training data, the entire cluster, including the seed word, is filtered out.",

        "Ultimately, we would like to recognize the subjective elements in a text, and their types, targets, and sources.",

        "Thus, in the short term, it is probably best to use subjective-element annotations for knowledge acquisition (analysis, training, feature generation) alone, and not target automatic classification of subjective elements.",

        "First, they are more directly related to applications (e.g., filtering hostile messages and mining reviews from Internet forums).",
        "Second, there are existing annotations to be exploited, such as editorials and arts reviews marked as such by newspapers, as well as on-line product reviews accompanied by formal numerical ratings (e.g., 4 on a scale from 1 to 5).",
        "However, a challenging aspect of such data is that opinion pieces and flames contain objective sentences, while documents in other text categories contain subjective sentences.",
        "News reports present reactions to and attitudes toward reported events (van Dijk 1988); they often contain segments starting with expressions such as critics claim and supporters argue.",
        "In addition, quoted-speech sentences in which individuals express their subjectivity are often included (Barzilay et al., 2000).",
        "On the other hand, editorials contain objective sentences presenting facts supporting the writer's argument, and reviews contain sentences objectively presenting facts about the product.",

        "Each model tests for a specific pattern of agreement: symmetry tests the interchangeability of taggers, marginal homogeneity verifies the absence of bias among taggers, quasi-independence verifies that the taggers act independently when they disagree, and quasi-symmetry tests for the presence of any pattern in their disagreements.",
        "For a more complete description of these models and their use in analyzing intercoder reliability see (Bruce and Wiebe, 1999).",

        "Surprisingly, the taggers appear to act independently when they disagree in assigning the compressed type tags (i.e., tags e, u and o).",
        "This shift in the pattern of disagreement between taggers again suggests that the compression of the evaluative tags was inappropriate.",
        "Additionally, these findings suggest that it may be possible to automatically correct the type biases expressed by the taggers using the technique described in (Bruce and Wiebe, 1999), a topic that will be investigated in future work."

        "This section uses the opinion-piece annotations to expand our set of PSEs beyond those that can be derived from the subjective-element annotations.",
        "Precision is used to assess feature quality.",
        "The precision of feature F for class C is the number of Fs that occur in units of class C over the total number of Fs that occur anywhere in the data.",
        "An important motivation for using the opinion-piece data is that there is a large amount of it, and manually refining existing annotations as described in section 5.2 is much easier and more reliable than other types of subjectivity annotation.",
        "However, we cannot expect absolutely high precisions for two reasons.",
        "First, the distribution of opinions and non-opinions is highly skewed in favor of non-opinions.",
        "For example, in Table 1, tagger 1 classifies only 23 of 293 articles as opinion pieces.",
        "Second, as discussed in section 4, opinion pieces contain objective sentences and non opinion-pieces contain subjective sentences.",
        "For example, in WSJ-SE, which has been annotated at the sentence and document levels, 70% of the sentences in opinion pieces are subjective and 30% are objective.",
        "In non-opinion pieces, 44% of the sentences are subjective and only 56% are objective.",
        "To give an idea of expected precisions, let us consider the precision of subjective sentences with respect to opinion pieces.",
        "Suppose that 15% of the sentences in the dataset are in opinions, 85% in non-opinions.",
        "Let us assume the proportions of subjective and objective sentences in opinion and non-opinion pieces given just above.",
        "Let N be the total number of sentences.",
        "The desired precision is the number of subjective sentences in opinions over the total number of subjective sentences.",
        "It is .22:",
        "In addition, we are assessing PSEs, which are only potentially subjective; many have objective as well as subjective uses.",
        "Thus, even if precisions are much lower than 1, we use increases in precision over a baseline as evidence of promising PSEs.",
        "The baseline for comparison is the number of word instances in opinion pieces, divided by the total number of word instances.",
        "Table 8 shows the precisions for three types of PSEs.",
        "The freq columns give total frequencies, and the +prec columns show the improvements in precision from the baseline.",
        "The baseline precisions are given at the bottom of the table.",
        "As mentioned above, (Wiebe, 2000) showed success automatically identifying adjective PSEs using Lin's method, seeded by a small amount of detailed manual annotations.",
        "Desiring to move away from manually annotated data, for this paper the same process is used, but the seed words are all the adjectives (verbs) in the training data.",
        "In addition, in the current setting, there are no a priori values to use for parameters C (cluster size) and FT (filtering threshold), as there were in (Wiebe, 2000), and results vary with different parameter settings.",
        "Thus, a train-validate-test process is appropriate.",
        "In Table 8, the numbers given under, e.g., W9-10, are the results obtained when W9-10 is used as the test set.",
        "One of the other datasets, say W9-22, was used as the training set, meaning that all the adjectives (verbs) in that dataset are the seed words, and all filtering was performed using only that data.",
        "The seed-filtering process was repeated with different settings of C and FT, producing a different set of adjectives (verbs) for each setting.",
        "A third dataset, say W9-33, was used as a validation set, i.e., among all the sets of adjectives generated from the training set, those with good performance on the validation set were selected as",
        "the PSEs to test on the test set.",
        "A set was considered to have good performance on the validation set if its precision is at least .25 and its frequency is at least 100.",
        "Since this process is meant to be a method for mining existing document-level annotations for PSEs, the existing opinion-piece annotations were used for training and validation.",
        "Our manual opinion-piece annotations were used for testing.",
        "The row labeled unique words shows the precision on the test set of the individual words that are unique in the test set.",
        "The increase over baseline precision shows that low-frequency words can be informative for recognizing subjectivity.",
        "Note that the features all do better and worse on the same data sets.",
        "This shows that the subjectivity is somehow harder to identify in, say, W9-33 than in W9-10; it also shows an important consistency among the features, even though they are identified in different ways."

        "While analysis of subjectivity is perhaps most natural and precise at the expression level, document-level annotations are freely available from a number of sources and are appropriate for many applications.",
        "The sentence-level annotation is a workable intermediate level: sentence-level judgments are not as fine-grained as expression-level judgments, and they don't involve the large amount of noise found at the document level.",
        "As part of this examination, we present a study of annotator agreement characterizing the difficulty of identifying subjectivity at the different levels of a text.",
        "The results demonstrate that not only can subjectivity be identified at the document level with high reliability, but that it is also possible to identify expression-level subjectivity, albeit with lower reliability.",
        "Using manual annotations, we are able to characterize subjective language.",
        "At the expression level, we found that it is natural to distinguish among positively evaluative, negatively evaluative, and speculative uses of a word.",
        "We also found that subjective text contains a high proportion of unique word occurrences, much more so than ordinary text.",
        "Rather than ignoring or discarding unique words, we demonstrate that the occurrence of a unique word is a PSE.",
        "We also found that agreement is higher for some syntactic word classes, e.g., for adjectives in comparison with determiners.",
        "Finally, we are able to mine PSEs from text tagged at the document level.",
        "Given the difficulty of evaluating PSEs in document-level subjectivity classification due to the mix of subjective and objective sentences, the PSEs identified in this study exhibit relatively high precision.",
        "In future work, we will investigate document-level classification using these PSEs, as well as other methods for extracting PSEs from text tagged at the document level; methods to be investigated include mutual-bootstrapping and/or co-training."
