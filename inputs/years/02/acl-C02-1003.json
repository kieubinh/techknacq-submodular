        "Substantial improvements have been made to parse western language such as English, and many powerful models have been proposed (Brill 1993, Collins 1997).",
        "However, very limited progress has been achieved in Chinese.",
        "Knowledge acquisition is a bottleneck for real appication of Chinese parsing.",
        "While some methods have been proposed to learn syntactic knowledge from annotated Chinese corpus, most of the methods depended on the annotated or partial annotated data(Zhou 1997, Streiter 2000).",
        "Due to the limited availbility of Chinese annotated corpus, tests of these methods are still small in scale.",
        "Although some institutions and universities currently are engaged in building Chinese tree bank, no large scale annotated corpus has been published until now because the complexity in Chinese syntatic sturcture and the difficulty in corpus annotation (Chen 1996).",
        "This paper proposes a novel method to facilitate the Chinese tree bank construction.",
        "Based on English-Chinese bilingual corpora and better English parsing, this method obtains Chinese bracketing information automatically via a bilingual model and word alignment results.",
        "The main idea of the method is that we may acquire knowledge for a language lacking a rich collection of resources and tools from a second language that is full of them.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows : In the next section, a bilingual language model is introduced.",
        "Then, a bilingual parsing method supervised by English parsing is proposed in section 2.",

        "Wu (1997) has proposed a bilingual language model called Inversion Transduction Grammar (ITG), which can be used to parse bilingual sentence pairs simultaneously.",
        "We will give a brief description here.",
        "For details please refer to (Wu 1995, Wu 1997).",
        "The Inversion Transduction Grammar is a bilingual context-free grammar that generates two matched output languages (referred to as L1 and L2).",
        "It also differs from standard context-free grammars in that the ITG allows right-hand side production in two directions: straight or inverted.",
        "The following examples are two ITG productions:",
        "Each nonterminal symbol stands for a pair of matched strings.",
        "For example, the nonterminal A stands for the string-pair (A1, A2).",
        "A1 is a sub-string in L1, and A2 is A1’s corresponding translation in L2.",
        "Similarly, (B1, B2) denotes the string-pair generated by B.",
        "The operator [ ] performs the usual concatenation, so that C -> [A B] yields the string-pair (C1, C2), where C1 =A1B1 and C2=A2B2.",
        "On the other hand, the operator <> performs the straight concatenation for language 1 but the reversing concatenation for language 2, so that C -> <A B> yields C1 =A1B1, but C2=B2A2.",
        "The inverted concatenation operator permits the extra flexibility needed to accommodate many kinds of word-order variation between source and target languages (Wu 1995).",
        "There are also lexical productions of the following form in ITG: A -> x/y This means that a symbol x in language L1 is translated by the symbol y in language L2.",
        "x or y may be a null symbol e, which means there may be no counterpart string on other side of the bitext.",
        "ITG based parsing matches constituents for an input sentence-pair.",
        "For example, Figure 1 shows an ITG parsing tree for an English-Chinese sentence-pair.",
        "The inverted production is indicated by a horizontal line in the parsing tree.",
        "The English text is read in the usual depth-first left to right order, but for the Chinese text, a horizontal line means the right sub-tree is traversed before the left.",
        "The generated parsing results are:",

        "Because of the difficulty in finding a suitable bilingual syntactic grammar for Chinese and English, a practical ITG is the generic Bracketing Inversion Transduction Grammar (BTG)(Wu 1995).",

        "SBTG employs only one nonterminal symbol A that can be used recursively.",
        "Here, “a” denotes the probability of syntactic rules.",

        "bij can be obtained using a statistical word-translation model (Melamed 2000) or word alignment(Lü 2001a).",
        "The last two productions denote that the word in one language has no counterpart on other side of the bitext.",
        "A small constant can be chosen for the probabilities bie and bej.",
        "In BTG, no language specific syntactic grammar is used.",
        "The maximum-likelihood parser selects the parse tree that best satisfies the combined lexical translation preferences, as expressed by the bij probabilities.",
        "Because the expressiveness characteristics of ITG naturally constrain the space of possible matching in a highly appropriate fashion, BTG achieves encouraging results for bilingual bracketing using a word-translation lexicon alone (Wu 1997).",
        "Since no syntactic knowledge is used in SBTG, output grammaticality can not be guaranteed.",
        "In particular, if the corresponding constituents appear in the same order in both languages, both straight and inverted, then lexical matching does not provide the discriminative leverage needed to identify the sub-constituent boundaries.",

        "Here, English parsing supervised BTG means using an English parser’s bracketing information as a boundary restriction in the BTG language model.",
        "But this does not necessitate parsing Chinese completely according to the same parsing boundary of English.",
        "If the English parsing structure is totally fixed, it is possible that the structure is not linguistically valid for Chinese under the formalism of Inversion Transduction Grammar.",
        "To illustrate this, see the example shown in Figure 2.",
        "The sub-tree for blacked underlined part of English and corresponding Chinese are shown in Figure 2(a).",
        "We can see that the Chinese constituents do not match the English counterparts in the English structure.",
        "In this case, our solution is that: the whole English constituent of “VP” is aligned with the whole Chinese correspondence; i.e., “eat less bread” is matched with “ ” shown in Figure 2(b).",
        "At the same time, we give the inner structure matching according to ITG regardless of the English parsing constraint.",
        "An “X” tag is introduced to indicate that the sub-bilingual-parsing-tree is not consistent with the given English sub-tree.",
        "Our result can also be understood as a flattened bilingual parsing tree as shown in Figure 2(c).",
        "This means that when the bilingual constituents couldn’t match in the small syntactic structure, we will match them in a larger structure.",
        "The main idea is that the given English parser is only used as a boundary constraint for bilingual parsing.",
        "When the constraint is incompatible with the bilingual model ITG, we use ITG as the default result.",
        "This process enables parsing to go on regardless of some failures in matching.",
        "We heuristically define a constraint function Fe(s, t) to denote the English boundary constraint, where s is the beginning position and t is the end.",
        "There are three cases of structure matching: violate match, exact match and inside match.",

        "(1,6), (2,5), (3,5) are examples.",

        "Thus, the best parser has the probability 5(0, T,0, V) .",
        "(s, t, u, v) is calculated as the maximum probability combination of all possible sub-tree combinations(Wu 1995).",
