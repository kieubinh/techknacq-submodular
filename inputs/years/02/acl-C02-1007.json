        "According to Ferdinand de Saussure (1916), there are two fundamental types of relations between words that he believes correspond to basic operations of our brain: syntagmatic and paradigmatic associations.",
        "There is a syntagmatic relation between two words if they co-occur in spoken or written language more frequently than expected from chance and if they have different grammatical roles in the sentences in which they occur.",
        "Typical examples are the word pairs coffee – drink, sun – hot, or teacher – school.",
        "The relation between two words is paradigmatic if the two words can substitute for one another in a sentence without affecting the grammaticality or acceptability of the sentence.",
        "Typical examples are synonyms or antonyms like quick – fast, or eat – drink.",
        "Normally, words with a paradigmatic relation are the same part of speech, whereas words with a syntagmatic relation can but need not be the same part of speech.",
        "In this paper we want to show that the two types of relations as defined by de Saussure are reflected in the statistical distribution of words in large corpora.",

        "If for each word in a corpus a co-occurrence vector is determined whose entries are the co-occurrences with all other words in the corpus, then the semantic similarities between words can be computed by conducting simple vector comparisons.",
        "To determine the words most similar to a given word, its co-occurrence vector is compared to the co-occurrence vectors of all other words using one of the standard similarity measures, for example, the cosine coefficient.",
        "Those words that obtain the best values are considered to be most similar.",
        "Practical implementations of algorithms based on this principle have led to excellent results as documented in papers by Ruge (1992), Grefen-stette (1994), Agarwal (1995), Landauer & Dumais (1997), Schütze (1997), and Lin (1998)."

        "However, the simulation system never obtained any information on part of speech, and so it is nevertheless surprising that – besides computing term similarities – it implicitly seems to be able to cluster parts of speech.",
        "This observation is consistent with other studies (e.g., Ruge, 1995).",
        "blue cold fruit green tobacco whiskey red hot food red cigarette whisky alcohol brandy green warm flower blue grey dry fish white coal champagne yellow drink meat yellow import lemonade white cool vegetable grey textile vodka",
        "A qualitative inspection of the word lists generated by the system shows that the results are quite satisfactory.",
        "Paradigmatic associations like blue 4 red, cold 4 hot, and tobacco 4 cigarette are intuitively plausible.",
        "However, a quantitative evaluation would be preferable, of course, and for this reason we did a comparison with the results of the human subjects in the TOEFL test.",
        "Remember that the human subjects had to choose the word most similar to a given stimulus word from a list of four alternatives.",
        "In the simulation, we assumed that the system had chosen the correct alternative if the correct word was ranked highest among the four alternatives.",
        "This was the case for 55 of the 80 test items, which gives us an accuracy of 69%.",
        "This accuracy may seem low, but it should be taken into account that the TOEFL tests the language abilities of prospective university students and therefore is rather difficult.",
        "Actually, the performance of the average human test taker was worse than the performance of the system.",
        "The human subjects were only able to solve 51.6 of the test items correctly, which gives an accuracy of 64.5%.",
        "Please note that in the TOEFL, average performance (over several types of tests, with the synonym test being just one of them) admits students to most universities.",
        "On the other hand, by definition, the test takers did not have a native command of English, so the performance of native speakers would be expected to be significantly better.",
        "Another consideration is the fact that our simulation program was not designed to make use of the context of the test word, so it neglected some information that may have been useful for the human subjects.",
        "Nevertheless, the results look encouraging.",
        "Given that our method is rather simple, let us now compare our results to the results obtained with more sophisticated methods.",
        "One of the methods reported in the literature is singular value decomposition (SVD); another is shallow parsing.",
        "SVD, as described by Schütze (1997) and Landauer & Dumais (1997), is a method similar to factor analysis or multidimensional scaling that allows a significant reduction of the dimensionality of a matrix with minimum information loss.",
        "Landauer & Dumais (1997) claim that by optimizing the dimensionality of the target matrix the performance of their word similarity predictions was significantly improved.",
        "However, on the TOEFL task mentioned above, after empirically determining the optimal dimensionality of their matrix, they report an accuracy of 64.4%.",
        "This is somewhat worse than our result of 69%, which was achieved without SVD and without optimizing any parameters.",
        "It must be emphasized, however, that the validity of this comparison is questionable, as many parameters of the two models are different, making it unclear which ones are responsible for the difference.",
        "For example, Landauer and Dumais used a smaller corpus (4.7 million words), a larger window size (151 words on average), and a different similarity measure (cosine measure).",
        "We nevertheless tend to interpret the results of our comparison as evidence for the view that SVD is just another method for smoothing that has its greatest benefits for sparse data.",
        "However, we do not deny the technical value of the method.",
        "The one-time effort of the dimensionality reduction may be well spent in a practical system because all subsequent vector comparisons will be speeded up considerably with shorter vectors.",
        "Let us now compare our results to those obtained using shallow parsing, as previously done by Grefenstette (1993).",
        "The view here is that the window-based method may work to some extent, but that many of the word co-occurrences in a window are just incidental and add noise to the significant word pairs.",
        "A simple method to reduce this problem could be to introduce a threshold for the minimum number of co-occurrences; a more sophisticated method is the use of a (shallow) parser.",
        "Ruge (1992), who was the first to introduce this method, claims that only head-modifier relations, as known from dependency grammar, should be considered.",
        "For example, if we consider the sentence “Peter drives the blue car”, then we should not count the co-occurrence of Peter and blue, because blue is neither head nor modifier of Peter.",
        "Ruge developed a shallow parser that is able to determine the head-modifier relations in unrestricted English text with a recall of 85% and a precision of 86% (Ruge, 1995).",
        "Using this parser she extracted all head-modifier relations from the 100 million words of the British National Corpus.",
        "Thus, the resulting co-occurrence matrix only contained the counts of the head-modifier relations.",
        "The word similarities were computed from this matrix by using the cosine similarity measure.",
        "Using this method, Ruge achieved an accuracy of about 69% in the TOEFL synonym task, which is equivalent to our results.",
        "Again, we need to emphasize that parameters other than the basic methodology could have influenced the result, so we need to be cautious with an interpretation.",
        "However, to us it seems that the view that some of the co-occurrences in corpora should be considered as noise is wrong, or else if there is some noise it obviously cancels out over large corpora.",
        "It would be interesting to know how a system performed that used all co-occurrences except the head-modifier relations.",
        "We tend to assume that such a system would perform worse, so the parser selected the good candidates.",
        "However, the experiment has not been done, so we cannot be sure.",
        "Although the shallow parsing could not improve the results in this case, we nevertheless should point out its virtues: It improves efficiency since it leads to sparser matrices.",
        "It also seems to be able to separate the relevant from the irrelevant co-occurrences.",
        "Third, it may be useful for determining the type of relationship between words (e.g., synonymy, an-tonymy, meronymy, hyponymy, etc., see Berland & Charniak, 1999).",
