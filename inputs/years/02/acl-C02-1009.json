        "Since the bilingual corpus is a valuable resource for training statistical language models [Dagon, 91; Suet al., 95; Su and Chang, 99] and sentence alignment is the first step for most such tasks, many alignment approaches have been proposed in the literature [Brown, 91; Gale and Church, 93; Wu, 94; Vogel et al., 96; Och and Ney, 2000].",
        "Most of those reported approaches use the sentence length as the main feature to perform the alignment task.",
        "For example, Brown et al.",
        "(91) used the feature of number-of-words for alignment, and [Gale and Church,93] claimed that better performance can be achieved (5.8% error rate for English-French corpus) if the number-of-characters is adopted instead.",
        "As cognates are reliable cues for language pairs derived from the same family, Church (93) also attacked this problem by considering cognates additionally.",
        "Because most of those reported work are performed on those Indo-European language-pairs, for testing the performance on non-Indo-European languages, Wu (94) had tried both length and cognate features on the Hong Kong Hansard English-Chinese corpus, and 7.9% error rate has been reported.",
        "Besides, sentence alignment can also be indirectly achieved via more complicated word corresponding models [Brown et al., 93; Vogel et al., 96; Och and Ney, 2000].",
        "Since those word corresponding models, which also achieve similar performance, are more complicated and run relatively slow, they seems to be overkilled for the task of aligning sentences and will not be discussed in this paper.",
        "Although length-based approaches above mentioned are simple and can achieve good performance, they are usually trained and tested in the text with the same style.",
        "Therefore, they are style-dependent approaches.",
        "Since performing supervised-training for each style is not feasible in many applications, it would be interesting to know whether those length-based approaches can still achieve the similar performance if they are tested in the text with different styles other than the training corpora.",
        "An experiment was thus conducted to train the parameters with a machinery technical manual; the performance is then tested on a general magazine (for introducing Taiwan to foreign visitors).",
        "It shows that the testing set performance of the length-based model (with cognates considered) would drop from 98.2% (tested in the same technical domain) to 85.6% (tested in the new general magazine) in F-measure.",
        "After investigating those errors, it has been found that the length distribution and alignment-type distribution (used by those length-based approaches) vary significantly across the texts of different styles (as would be shown in Tables 5.2 and 5.3), and the cognate-frequency1 drops greatly from the technical manual to a general magazine in non-Indo-European languages (as would be shown in Table 5.3).",
        "On the other hand, sentence length is seldom used by a human to align bilingual sentences.",
        "They usually do not align bilingual sentences by counting the number of characters (or words) in the sentence pairs.",
        "Instead, since a large percentage of content words in the source text would be translated into their translation-duals to preserve the meaning in the target text, transfer-lexicons are usually used for aligning sentences when the alignment task is performed by human.",
        "To enhance the robustness across different styles, transfer-lexicons are thus integrated into the traditional sentence-length based model in the proposed robust statistical model described below.",
        "After integrating transfer-lexicons into the model, a 60% F-measure error reduction (from 14.4% to 5.8%) has been observed, which corresponds to improving the cross-style performance from 85.6% to 94.2% in F-measure.",
        "The details of the proposed robust model, the associated features extracted from the bilingual corpora, and the probabilistic scoring function will be given in Section 2.",
        "In Section 3, we briefly mention some implementation issues.",
        "The associated performance evaluation is given in Section 4, and Section 5 would address error analysis and discusses the limitation of the proposed statistical model.",
        "Finally, the concluding remarks are given in Section 6.",
        "2 Statistical Sentence Alignment Model Since an English-Chinese bilingual corpus will be adopted in our experiments, we will denote the source text with m sentences as E5m1, and its corresponding target text, with n sentences, as C5n1.",
        "Let Mi = {typei,1, • • • , typei,nri } denote the i-th possible alignment-candidate, consisting of Ni Alignment-Passages of typei,j, j = 1, • • • , Nij where typei,j is the matching type (e.g., 1-1, 0 -1, 1-0, etc.)",
        "of the j-th Alignment-Passage in the i-th alignment-candidate, and Ni denotes the number of the total Alignment-Passages in the i-th alignment-candidate.",
        "Then the statistical alignment model is to find the Bayesian estimate M* among all possible alignment candidates, shown in the following equation",
        "According to the Bayesian rule, the maximization problem in (2.1) is equivalent to solving the following maximization equation",
        "where Aligned-Pairi,j, j = 1, • • • , Ni, denotes the j-th aligned English-Chinese bilingual sentence groups pair in the i-th alignment candidate.",
        "Assume that",
        "and different typei,j in the i-th alignment candidate are statistically independent2, then the above maximization problem can be approached by searching for {P(Aligned-Pairi,j|typei,j)P(typei,j)}, (2.4) where Mˆ denotes the desired candidate.",
        "To make the above model feasible, Aligned-Pairi,j should be first transformed into an appropriate feature space.",
        "The baseline model will use both the length of sentence [Brown et al., 91; Gale and Church, 93] and English cognates [Wu, 94], and is shown as follows: f (Sc, Sw I typei,j)P(Scognate)P(typei,j), (2.5) where Sc and Sw denote the normalized differences of characters and words as explained in the following; Sc is defined to be (ltc – clsc)/Vlscs2c, where lsc and ltc are the character numbers of the aligned bilingual portions of source text and target text, respectively, under consideration; c denotes the proportional constant for target-character-count and s2 c denotes the corresponding target-character-count variance per source-character.",
        "Similarly, Sw is defined to be (ltw – wlsw)/Vlsws2w, where lsw and ltw are the word numbers of the aligned bilingual portions of source text and target text, respectively; w denotes the proportional constant for target-word-count and s2w denotes the corresponding target-word-count variance per source-word.",
        "Also, the random variables Sc and Sw are assumed to have bivariate normal distribution and each possesses a standard normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1.",
        "Furthermore, Scognate denotes (“Number of English cognates found in the given Chinese sentences” – “Number of corresponding English cognates found in the given English sentences”), and is Poisson3 distributed independent of its associated matching-type; also assume that Scognate is independent of other features (i.e., character-count and word-count)."

        "Those translated Chinese words, which are derived from each English word (contained in given English sentences) by looking up some kinds of dictionaries, can be viewed as transfer-lexicons because they are very likely to appear in the translated Chinese sentence.",
        "However, as the distribution of various possible translations (for each English lexicon) found in our bilingual corpus is far more diversified4 compared with those transfer-lexicons obtained from the dictionary, only a small number of transfer-lexicons can be matched if the exact-match is specified.",
        "Therefore, each Chinese-Lexicon obtained from the dictionary is first augmented with its associated Chinese characters, and then the augmented transfer-lexicons set are matched with the target Chinese sentence(s).",
        "Once an element of the augmented transfer-lexicons set is matched in the target Chinese sentence, it is counted as being matched.",
        "So we compute the Normalized Transfer-Lexicon-Matching-Measure, STrans f er – Lexicons which denotes [(“Number of augmented transfer-lexicons matched” – “Number of augmented transfer-lexicons unmatched”)/ “Total Number of augmented transfer-lexicons sets”], and add it to the original model as another additional feature.",

        "From Table 5.1, it is found that the matching-type errors dominate in the baseline model.",
        "To investigate the matching-type error, the prior distributions of matching-types under training set [Caterpillar User Manual] and testing set II [Sinorama Magazine] are given in Table 5.2.",
        "The comparison clearly shows that the matching-type distribution varies significantly across different domains, and that explains why the baseline model (which only considers length-based features and matching-type distribution) fails to achieve the similar performance in the cross-style test.",
        "However, as the “1-1” matching-type always dominates in both texts, the matching-type distribution still provide useful information for aligning sentences when it is jointly considered with the lexical-related feature.",

        "Furthermore, although English-cognates are reliable cues for aligning bilingual sentences and occurs quite a few times in the technical manual (such as company names: IBM, HP, etc., and some special technical terms such as ”RS-232”, etc), they almost never occur in a general magazine such as the one that we test.",
        "Therefore, they provide no help for aligning corpus in such domains.",
        "Table 5.1 also shows that errors distribute differently in the proposed robust model.",
        "The length-type, instead of matching-type, now dominates errors, which implies that the mismatching effect resulting from different distributions of matching types has been diluted by the transfer-lexicon feature.",
        "Furthermore, the score of erroneous lexicon-type assignment never dominates any error found in the proposed robust model, which verifies our supposition that transfer-lexicons are more reliable cues for aligning sentences.",
        "To further investigate those remaining errors generated from the proposed robust model, two error examples are given in Figure 1.",
        "The first case shows an example of “Length-Type Error”, in which the short sentence (E2) is erroneously merged with the long sentence (E1) and results in an erroneous alignment [E1, E2 : C1] and [E3 : C2].",
        "(The correct alignment should be [E1 : C1] and [E2, E3 : C2].)",
        "Generally speaking, if a short source sentence is enclosed by two long source sentences in both sides, and they are jointly translated into two long target sentences, then it is error prone compared with other cases.",
        "The main reason is that this short source sentence would contain only a few words and thus its associated transfer",
        "lexicons are not sufficient enough to override the wrong preference given by the length-based feature (which would assign similar score to both merge-directions).",
        "The second case shows an example of “Length&Lexicon-Type Error”, in which the source sentence (E1) is erroneously deleted and results in an erroneous alignment [E1: Delete] and [E2 : C1].",
        "(The correct alignment should be [E1, E2 : C1].)",
        "The main reason is that the meaning of sentence (E1) is similar to that of (E2) but stated in different words, and the translator has merged the redundant information in his/her translation.",
        "Therefore, the length-feature prefers to delete the first source sentence.",
        "On the other hand, since most of those associated transfer-lexicons in the source sentence E1 cannot be found in the corresponding target sentence C1, the Transfer-Lexicon feature also prefers to delete the first source sentence E1.",

        "Although those length-based approaches are simple and can achieve good performance when they are trained and tested in the corpora of the same style, the performance drops significantly when they are tested in different styles other than that of the training corpora.",
        "(For instance, the F-measure error increases from 1.8% to 14.4% in our experiment.)",
        "The main reason is that the statistical characteristics of those features adopted by the length-based approaches (such as length-distribution, alignment-type-distribution and cognate-frequency) vary significantly from one style to another style.",
        "Since human align sentences mainly by examining the similarity between different meanings conveyed by the given bilingual sentences pair, not by counting the number of characters in sentences, the transfer-lexicon is expected to be the more reliable cue than the sentence length.",
        "A robust statistical sentences alignment model, which integrates the associated transfer-lexicons into the original length-based model, is thus proposed in this paper.",
        "Great improvement has been observed in our experiment, which reduces the F-measure error generated from the length-based model from 14.4% to 5.8%, when the proposed approach is tested in the cross-style case.",
        "Last, length-features, cognate-feature and transfer-lexicon-feature are implicitly assumed to contribute equally in aligning sentences in this paper; however this assumption is not usually held because different features might have various dynamic ranges for their scores and thus contribute differently to discrimination power.",
