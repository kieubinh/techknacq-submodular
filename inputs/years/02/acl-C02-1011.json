        "We address here the problem of Base NP translation, in which for a given Base Noun Phrase in a source language (e.g., ‘information age’ in English), we are to find out its possible translation(s) in a target language (e.g., ‘ (N ,, A f R’ in Chinese).",
        "We define a Base NP as a simple and non-recursive noun phrase.",
        "In many cases, Base NPs represent holistic and non-divisible concepts, and thus accurate translation of them from one language to another is extremely important in applications like machine translation, cross language information retrieval, and foreign language writing assistance.",
        "In this paper, we propose a new method for Base NP translation, which contains two steps: (1) translation candidate collection, and (2) translation selection.",
        "In translation candidate collection, for a given Base NP in the source language, we look for its translation candidates in the target language.",
        "To do so, we use a word-to-word translation dictionary and corpus Hang Li Microsoft Research Asia hangli@microsoft.com data in the target language on the web.",
        "In translation selection, we determine the possible translation(s) from among the candidates.",
        "We use non-parallel corpus data in the two languages on the web and employ one of the two methods which we have developed.",
        "In the first method, we view the problem as that of classification and employ an ensemble of Naïve Bayesian Classifiers constructed with the EM Algorithm.",
        "We will use ‘EM-NBC-Ensemble’ to denote this method, hereafter.",
        "In the second method, we view the problem as that of calculating similarities between context vectors and use TF-IDF vectors also constructed with the EM Algorithm.",
        "We will use ‘EM-TF-IDF’ to denote this method.",
        "Experimental results indicate that our method is very effective, and the coverage and top 3 accuracy of translation at the final stage are 91.4% and 79.8%, respectively.",
        "The results are significantly better than those of the baseline methods relying on existing technologies.",
        "The higher performance of our method can be attributed to the enormity of the web data used and the employment of the EM Algorithm."

        "A straightforward approach to word or phrase translation is to perform the task by using parallel bilingual corpora (e.g., Brown et al., 1993).",
        "Parallel corpora are, however, difficult to obtain in practice.",
        "To deal with this difficulty, a number of methods have been proposed, which make use of relatively easily obtainable non-parallel corpora (e.g., Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Diab and Finch, 2000).",
        "Within these methods, it is usually assumed that a number of translation candidates for a word or phrase are given (or can be easily collected) and the problem is focused on translation selection.",
        "All of the proposed methods manage to find out the translation(s) of a given word or phrase, on the basis of the linguistic phenomenon that the contexts of a translation tend to be similar to the contexts of the given word or phrase.",
        "Fung and Yee (1998), for example, proposed to represent the contexts of a word or phrase with a real-valued vector (e.g., a TF-IDF vector), in which one element corresponds to one word in the contexts.",
        "In translation selection, they select the translation candidates whose context vectors are the closest to that of the given word or phrase.",
        "Since the context vector of the word or phrase to be translated corresponds to words in the source language, while the context vector of a translation candidate corresponds to words in the target language, and further the words in the source language and those in the target language have a many-to-many relationship (i.e., translation ambiguities), it is necessary to accurately transform the context vector in the source language to a context vector in the target language before distance calculation.",
        "The vector-transformation problem was not, however, well-resolved previously.",
        "Fung and Yee assumed that in a specific domain there is only one-to-one mapping relationship between words in the two languages.",
        "The assumption is reasonable in a specific domain, but is too strict in the general domain, in which we presume to perform translation here.",
        "A straightforward extension of Fung and Yee’s assumption to the general domain is to restrict the many-to-many relationship to that of many-to-one mapping (or one-to-one mapping).",
        "This approach, however, has a drawback of losing information in vector transformation, as will be described.",
        "For other methods using non-parallel corpora, see also (Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996; Kikui, 1999, Koehn and Kevin 2000; Sumita 2000; Nakagawa 2001; Gao et al., 2001)."
