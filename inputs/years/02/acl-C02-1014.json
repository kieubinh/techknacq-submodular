        "In this context, we used genus data and specific relators, together with a few words manually labelled, to extract the information corresponding to the (±animate) feature.",

        "This paper describes the work carried out with the aim of expanding this idea this idea through the inclusion of information about synonymy, repeating the automatic process iteratively in order to obtain better results and, monitoring the reliability of the labelling of each individual noun.",
        "After studying the ideal relationship between the manual part of the operation and the scope of the automatic process, we generalised the process in order to adapt it to other semantic features.",
        "We obtained very satisfactory results considering the labelling of common nouns contained in the dictionary: for the [±animate] feature, we labelled 12,308 nouns with an accuracy of 99.2%, after the manual labelling of only 100.",
