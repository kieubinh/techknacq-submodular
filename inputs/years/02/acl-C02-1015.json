        "In theory, for most rhetorical relations, a rhetorical relation can be realizes by either a paratactic operator or a hypotactic operator, but not both.",
        "In practice, it is difficult for a content planner to specify rhetorical relations in such a way so that the sentence planner can simply perform an one to one transformation.",
        "For example, since in general only constituents of the same syntactic category can be conjoined and a content planner lacks detailed syntactic information, a content planner cannot always correctly specify JOINT relations to all the modifying propositions which will be transformed into a conjoined constituent in the final sentence.",

        "The percentage is quite high because the incorporation of propset in the annotation takes care of many cases which would have violated our proposed ordering.",
        "This result provides evidence supporting our claim that the proposed ordering shown in Figure 1 is effective.",
        "Excluding the 40 \"ARG\" relations in our analysis, there are 20 different types of rhetorical relations identified in the corpus, with a total of 523 rhetorical relations.",

        "The full annotated corpus is available through the Web (www.es.columbia.edu/-shave/co102).",
        "In the annotated corpus, excluding \"ARG\" transformations which arc not involved in the ordering of aggregation operators, there arc 523 transformations used, roughly 2.6 transformations for each sentence.",

        "Overall, unsupported cases arc rare.",
        "6 Rationale for the Ordering Before the current annotation effort was under-way, the ordering of operators used in our system eras paratactic operators, hypotactic operators, and then paratactic operators again.",
        "It eras not clear why paratactic operators arc applied multiple times while hypotactic operators only once.",
        "It was not clear if there were different types of JOINT relations connecting the propositions which resulted in multiple applications of paratactic operators.",
        "After preliminary annotation of the corpus using propset, the answer became clear – the first application of paratactic operators is a sub-step of the hypotactic operations which combine satellite propositions with subordinate rhetorical relations (i.e.., ELABORATION) that have.",
        "similar structures and modify the same entity in their nucleus proposition.",
        "The ordering of clause aggregation operators should be hypotactic operators followed by paratactic operators, but inside the hypotactic operators, paratactic operators arc also applied to specific configurations of satellite propositions as an optimization.",
        "We believe the ordering of hypotactic and paratactic operators might be related to the locality of their operations.",
        "The operations to insert a modifying constituent into a sentence is a local operation because such insertion can be done without considering other constituents in the sentence which arc not being modified.",
        "For example, attaching a prepositional phrase \"with deep pocket\" to the sentence \"Bob Morgan is a reputable stockbroker who is interested in dot coml.\" can be performed without considering how \"with deep pocket\" interacts with adjectives or the relative.",
        "clause, or where the entity being modified, \"stock-broker\", appears in the sentence.",
        "In contrast, paratactic operators arc global in nature because they arc very sensitive to constituents that arc identical across all the propositions being combine.",
        "Due to directional constraint (Ross, 1970; Shaw, 1998b), the deletion of identical constituents cannot be made locally but must wait until the surface ordering of the identical constituents is known.",
        "In comparison, hypotactic operations have fewer constraints and should be applied earlier.",
        "The proposed sequence in Figure 1 applies all hypotactic operations before paratactic operations.",
        "The ordering for intra-hypotactic operators is chosen to produce the most concise sentence by applying operators producing shortest transformed constituents first.",
        "Similarly, simple conjunction operator is applied before complex conjunction operator because the simple conjunction operator produces more concise expressions.",
        "Other hypotactic transformations for non-ELABORATION relation arc treated similarly as relative clause transformations.",
        "Since there is little or no deletion result from such constructions (\"Because John likes fruit, he ate oranges.\" has no deletion), they arc low on the priority and thus become the last one of the hypotactic transformations.",
        "7 Conclusion Current work made two signification observations.",
        "First, in Section 6 we explained why some paratactic operators arc applied before the hypotactic operators while others arc applied later.",
        "Secondly, propset was used for annotating propositions during the de-aggregation process.",
        "The importance of rhetorical relations in clause aggregation operations were noted by many researchers (Scott and de Souza, 1990; Moser and Moore, 1995; Rosner and Stede, 1992), but the concept of propset was not mentioned in previous literature related to rhetorical relations.",
        "It facilitates annotation during the de-aggregation process and allows annotator to ensure that both the number of transformations and rhetorical relations is always one smaller than the number of propositions.",
        "This kept both the de-aggregation and aggregation process manageable.",
        "The goal of this work is to find evidence to support the proposed ordering of the aggregation operators for synthesizing grammatical and concise sentences.",
        "By imposing our proposed ordering onto de-aggregated propositions and trying to resynthesize the original sentences, we determined the proposed ordering works well based on a human-written corpus.",
        "Using such ordering information and ensuring the content planner can specify propositions, propset, and rhetorical relations as the markup in the annotated corpus, the research community can incorporate clause aggregation operations into natural language generation systems and expect grammatical, concise sentences to be automatically generated."
