        "The problem is mainly caused by the fact that functional morphemes, which are considered to be crucial for identifying the relation, are frequently omitted in the noun phrases.",
        "To tackle this problem, we propose to employ the Support Vector Machines(SVM) in determining the grammatical functions.",

        "Many structural ambiguities in Korean sentences are one of the major problems in Korean syntactic analyses.",
        "Most of those ambiguities can be classified into either of two categories known as \"noun phrase (NP) attachment problem\" and \"verb phrase (VP) attachment problem\".",
        "The NP attachment problem refers to finding the VP which is the head of an NP.",
        "On the other hand, the VP attachment problem refers to finding the VP which is the head of a VP.",
        "In resolving the NP attachment problem, functional morphemes play an important role as they are the crucial elements in characterizing the grammatical function between an NP and its related VP.",
        "However, the problem is that there are many NPs that do not have such functional morphemes explicitly attached to each of them.",
        "This omission makes it difficult to identify the relation between constituents and subsequently to solve the NP attachment problem.",
        "Moreover, most Korean sentences are complex sentences, which also makes the problem more complicated.",
        "In this research, we make an attempt to solve this problem.",
        "The focus is on the analysis of the grammatical function between an NP and an embedded adnoun clause with a functional morpheme omitted.",
        "We adopt Support Vector Machines(SVM) as the device by which a given adnoun clause is analyzed as one of three relative functions (subject, object, or adverbial) or an appositive.",
        "Later in this paper (section 3), a brief description of SVM will be given."

        "There are two types of adnoun clauses in Korean : relative adnoun clause and appositive adnoun clause.",
        "The former is a more general form of adnoun clause and its formation can be exemplified as follows :",
        "(He worte the book.)",
        "1.a is a complex sentence composed of two simple sentences 1.b and 1.c in terms of adnoun clause formation.",
        "The functional morpheme ‘eul’, which represents the object relation between ‘chaeg’ and ‘sseoss-da’ in 1.c, does not appear in 1.a but ‘chaeg’ is the functional object of ‘sseu-n’ in 1.a.",
        "This adnoun clause is called a relative adnoun clause whose complement moves to the NP modified by the adnoun clause and the NP modified by a relative adnoun clause is called a head NP.",
        "In 1.a ‘geu-ga sseun’ is a relative adnoun clause and ‘chaeg’ is its head noun (or NP).",
        "Let us consider another example of an adnoun clause.",
        "(Everybody knows the fact that he is honest.)",
        "The adnoun clause in 2 is a complete sentence which has all necessary syntactic constituents in itself.",
        "This type of adnoun clause is called an appositive adnoun clause.",
        "And the head NP modified by the appositive adnoun clause is called a complement noun (Lee, 1986; Chang 1995).",
        "In 2, ‘geu-ga jeongjig-han’ is an appositive adnoun clause and ‘sasil’ is a complement noun.",
        "Generally, such words as “iyu(reason), gyeong-u(case), jangmyeon(scene), il(work), cheoji(condition), anghwang(situation), saggeon(happening), naemsae(smell), somun(rumor) and geos(thing)” are typical examples of the complement noun (Chang, 1995; Lee, 1986)."

      "text": [
        "The first problem we are faced with when analyzing grammatical functions of Korean adnoun clauses is obviously the disappearance of the functional morphemes which carry important information, as shown in the previous subsection (2.1).",
        "Apart from the morpheme-ommission problem, there is another reason for the difficulty.",
        "As it is directly related to a language particular syntactic characteristic of Korean, we need first to understand a unique procedure of Korean relativization.",
        "Unlike English, in which relative pronouns (e.g., who, whom, whose, which and that) are used for relativization and they themselves bear crucial information for identifying grammatical function of the head noun in relative clauses (see example 1.a, in section 1), there is no such relative pronouns in Korean.",
        "Instead, an adnominal verb ending is attached to the verb stem and plays a grammatical role of modifying its head noun.",
        "However, the problem is that these verb ending morphemes do not provide any information about the grammatical function associated with the relevant head noun.",
        "Take 3.a-c for examples.",
        "(He who ate a rice in a restaurant.)",
        "3.b Sigdang-eseo geu-ga meog-eun bab.",
        "(the rice which he ate in a restaurant.)",
        "3.c Geu-ga bab-eul meog-eun sigdang.",
        "(the restaurant in which he ate a rice.)",
        "Despite all three sentences above have the same adnominal ending ‘eun’, the grammatical function of each relative noun is different.",
        "The grammatical function of the head noun in 3.a is subject, in 3.b, object and in 3.c, adverbial.",
        "The word order gives little information because Korean is a partly free word-order language and some complements of a verb may be frequently omitted.",
        "For example, in sentence 4, the verb of relative clause ‘sigdang-eseo meog-eun(who ate in the restaurant or which one ate in the restaurant)’ have two omitted complements which are subject and object.",
        "So ‘bab’ can be identified as either of subject or object in the relative clause.",

        "Sigdang-eseo(restaurant) meog-eun(ate) bab-eul(rice) na-neun(I) boass-da(saw).",

        "Korean appositive adnoun clauses have the same syntactic structure of relative adnoun clauses as in example 2 in section 2.",
        "Yoon et al.",
        "(1997) classified adnoun clauses into relative adnoun clauses and appositive adnoun clauses based on a complement noun dictionary which was manually constructed, and then tries to find the grammatical function of a relative noun using lexical co-occurrence information.",
        "But as shown in example 5, a complement noun can be used as a relative noun, so Yoon et al.",
        "(1997)’s method using the dictionary has some limits.",

        "(1998) described a method using conceptual co-occurrence patterns and syntactic role distribution of relative nouns.",
        "Linguistic information is extracted from corpus and thesaurus.",
        "However, he did not take into account appositive adnoun clauses but only considered relative adnoun clauses.",
        "Lee et al.",
        "(2001) classified adnoun clauses into appositive clauses and one of relative clauses.",
        "He proposed a stochastic method based on a maximum likelihood estimation and adopted the backed-off model in estimating the probability P(r |v, e, n) to handle sparse data problem (the symbols r, v, e and n represent the grammatical relation, the verb of the adnoun clause, the adnominal verb ending, and the head noun modified by an adnoun clause, respectively).",

        "The algorithms for solving linearly separable cases can be extended so that they can solve linearly non-separable cases as well by either introducing soft margin hyperplanes, or by mapping the original data vectors to a higher dimensional space where the new features contain interaction terms of the original features, and the data points in the new space become linearly separable (Vapnik, 1995).",

        "Part of speech(POS) tags of all lexical item are also used as feature.",

        "Because we found that the kernel of SVM does not strongly affect the performance of our problem through many experiments, we concluded that our problem is linearly separable.",
