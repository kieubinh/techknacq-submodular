        "Translation dictionaries used in multilingual natural language processing such as machine translation have been made manually, but a great deal of labor is required for this work and it is difficult to keep the description of the dictionaries consistent.",

        "This paper proposes a learning and extracting method of bilingual word sequence correspondences from non-aligned parallel corpora with Support Vector Machines (SVMs) (Vapnik, 1999).",
        "SVMs are ones of large margin classifiers (Smola et al., 2000) which are based on the strategy where margins between separating boundary and vectors of which elements express the features of training samples is maximized.",
        "Therefore, SVMs have higer ability of the generalization than other learning models such as the decision trees and rarely cause over-fit for training samples.",
        "In addition, by using kernel functions, they can learn non-linear separating boundary and dependencies between the features.",
        "Therefore, SVMs have been recently used for the natural language processing such as text categorization (Joachims, 1998; Taira and Haruno, 1999), chunk identification (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000b), dependency structure analysis (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2000a).",
