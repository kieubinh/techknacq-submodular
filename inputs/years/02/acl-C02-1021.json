        "1.1 If we consider a quite typical case of a Part-of-Speech (PoS) tagged corpus used for training statistical taggers, then an error is defined naturally as any deviation from the regularities which the system is expected to learn; in this particular case this means that the corpus should contain neither errors in assignment PoS-tags nor ungrammatical constructions in the corpus body1, since if any of the two cases is present in the corpus, then the learning process necessarily:",

        "1.2 If we consider PoS-tagged corpora desti-nated for testing NLP systems, then obviously they should not contain any errors in tagging (since this would be detrimental to the validity of results of the testing) but on the other hand they should contain a certain amount of ungrammatical constructions, in order to test the behaviour of the tested system on a realistic input.",
        "Both these cases share the quiet presupposition that the tagset used is linguistically adequate, i.e. it is sufficient for unequivocal and consistent assignment of tags to the source text2.",
        "1 In this paper we on purpose do not distinguish between \"genuine\" ungrammaticality, i.e. one which was present already in the source text, and ungrammaticality which came into being as a result of faulty conversion of the source into the corpus-internal format, e.g., incorrect tokenization, OCR-errors, etc.",
        "2 This problem might be – in a very simplified form – illustrated on an example of a tagset introducing tags for NOUNs and VERBs only, and then trying to tag the sentence John walks slowly - whichever tag is assigned to the word slowly, it is obviously an incorrect one.",
        "Natural as this requirement might 1.3 As for using annotated corpora for linguistic research, then it seems that even inadequacies of tagset are tolerable provided they are marked off properly - in fact, these spots in the corpus might well be quite an important source of linguistic investigation since, more often than not, they constitute direct pointers to occurrences of linguistically \"interesting\" (or at least \"difficult\") constructions in the text."

Staaten schickt ... are tagged as Staaten-NOUN-MASC-PL-NOM and schickt-MAINVERB-PRES-ACT-SG, then the respective tags NOUN-MASC-PL-NOM and MAINVERB-PRESACT-SG (in this order) create an \"impossible bigram\".",
        "The reason for this bigram being impossible is that if a noun in nominative case occurs in a German clause headed by a finite main verb different from sein/werden (which, however, are not tagged as main verbs in the STTS tagset used in NEGRA®), then either this noun must be the verb's subject, which in turn requires that the noun and the verb agree in number, or that the noun is a part of coordinated subject, in which case the verb must be in plural.",
        "The configuration from the example meets neither of these conditions, and hence it generates an \"impossible bigram\".",
        "The central observation lies then in the fact that the property of being an impossible configuration can often be retained also after the components of the \"impossible bigram\" get separated by material occurring inbetween them.",
        "Thus, for example, in both our examples the property of being an impossible configuration is conserved if an adverb is placed inbetween, creating thus an \"impossible trigram\".",
        "In particular, in the first example, the configuration PREP ADV VFIN cannot be a valid trigram, exactly for the same reasons as PREP VFIN was not a valid bigram: ADV is not a valid NP remnant.",
        "In the second case, the configuration NOUN-MASC-PL-NOM ADV MAINVERB-PRES-ACT-SG is not a valid trigram either, since obviously the presence (or absence) of an adverb in the sentence does not change the subject-verb relation in the sentence.",
        "In fact, due to recursiv-ity of language, also two, three and in fact any number of adverbs would not make the configurations grammatical and hence would not disturb the error detection potential of the \"extended impossible bigrams\" from the examples.",
        "These linguistic considerations have a straightforward practical impact.",
        "Provided an error-free and representative (in the above sense) corpus is available, it is possible to construct the IB set.",

        "In case one of the tags Middle _1, Middle_2 occurs already in the set Possible_Inner_Tags, no action is to be taken, but in case the set Possible_Inner_Tags contains neither of Middle_1, Middle _2, both the tags Middle _1 and Middle_2 are to be added into the set Possible_Inner_Tags.",
        "The same action is then to be repeated for pentagrams, hexagrams, etc., until the maximal length of sentence in the learn corpus prevents any further prolongation of the n-grams and the process terminates.",
        "If now the set Impossible_Inner_Tags is constructed as the complement of Possible _Inner_Tags relatively to the whole tagset, then any n-gram consisting of the tag First, of any number of tags from the set Impossible_Inner_Tags and finally from the tag Second is very likely to be an n-gram impossible in the language and hence if it occurs in the corpus whose correctness is to be checked, it is to be signalled as a \"suspect spot\".",
        "Obviously, this idea is again based on the assumption of error-freeness and representativity of the learning corpus, so that for training on a realistic corpus the correctness of the resulting \"impossible n-grams\" has to be hand-checked.",

        "The whole resulted in changes on 3.774 lines of the corpus; the rectification of errors in segmentation resulted in reducing the number of corpus positions by over 700, from 355.096 to 354.3549.",
        "After finishing the corrections, we experimented with training and testing the TnT tagger (Brants, 2000) on the \"old\" and on the \"corrected\" version of NEGRA®.",

        "9 Which is a much nicer number than 355.096, and thus an additional motivation for correcting corpora each part having parallel starting and end position in each of the versions, and then running the system ten times, each time training on nine parts and testing on the tenth part, and finally computing the mean of the quality results.",
        "In doing so, we arrived at the following results: • if both the training and the testing was performed on the \"old\" NEGRA®, the tags assigned by the TnT tagger differed from the hand-assigned tags within the test sections on (together) 11.138 positions (out of the total of 355.096), which yields the error rate of 3,14% • if both the training and the testing was performed on the \"correct\" NEGRA®, the tags assigned by the TnT tagger differed from the hand-assigned tags of the test sections on (together) 10.889 positions (out of the total of 354.354), which yields the error rate of 3,07% • in the most interesting final experiment, the training was performed on the \"old\" and the testing on the \"correct\" NEGRA®; in the result, the tags assigned by TnT differed from the hand-assigned tags in the test sections on (together) 12.075 positions (out of the total of 354.354), yielding the error rate of 3,41%.",
        "These results show that there was only a negligible (and, according to the χ2 test, statistically insignificant) difference between the results in the cases when the tagger was both trained and tested on \"old\" corpus and both trained and tested on the \"corrected\" corpus.",

        "10 We did not perform training on the \"corrected\" corpus and testing on the \"old\" one, because it is not clear how the results of such an experiment should be evaluated: in particular, in such a case it is to be expected that it often happens that the tags assigned by the tagger and the ones in the \"pyrite standard\" (since it cannot be really called \"golden\", then) differ due to an error in the \"standard\" - and hence the measuring of the accuracy of the results of the tagger are problematic at best within such an architecture."

        "The main advantage is that the approach described is based on the combination of focussed search for errors of a particular, specific type with bootstrapping of the search, which makes it possible to detect errors even in a very large corpus where manual checking would not be feasible (at least in practice), since it requires passing through the whole of the text and paying attention to all kinds of possible violations - while the approach described concentrates on violations of particular phenomena on particular spots.",
        "Hence, it allows for straightforward checking whether an error really occurrs - and if so, for a direct correction.",
