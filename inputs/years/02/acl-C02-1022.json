        "Meaning shifting phenomena such as metonymy have recently attracted increasing interest.",
        "Computational approaches to these phenomena aim at inferring implicitly represented relations, predicting meaning shifts of nouns or verbs, expressing restrictions on these meaning shifts in dependency of context or language-specific factors, and facilitating reference resolution.",
        "Measures to achieve these issues include representation of default knowledge and various sorts of inference methods and constructive procedures.",
        "However, the entities in the texts examined almost always appear in singular form so that issues of cardinality of metonymically related items have been widely ignored by the approaches made so far.",
        "Motivated by this lack of analysis, we have examined metonymic expressions by varying cardinalities of the items appearing explicitly or implicitly, to analyze effects of these alternations.",
        "The results have inspired us to build increasingly explicit versions of logical forms, and to formulate conditions on pronominal accessibility.",
        "The insights gained improve analysis methods for relating contextual specifications to the appropriate entity, and for supporting reference resolution to entities related implicitly.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "We review computational approaches to metonymy.",
        "Then we illustrate the phenomena investigated.",
        "We elaborate suitable techniques to deal with these phenomena, that is, an enhancement to entries in the Generative Lexicon, and a procedure for building a logical form.",

      "text": [
        "Metonymy is a natural language phenomenon that contributes to expressing information in an effective and economic way.",
        "It involves what has been termed 'transfers of meaning' by (Nunberg 1995), i.e., the meaning of some constituent does not correspond to what can be expected according to the syntactic and semantic environment – the speaker is \"using one entity to refer to another that is related to it\" (Lakoff and Johnson 1980).",
        "For example, in the utterance \"The ham sandwich is waiting for his check\", it is not literally the ham sandwich, which wants to pay, but the person who ordered it.",
        "Computational approaches such as the NL database interface TEAM (Grosz et al.",
        "1988) are concerned with inferring implicitly expressed metonymic relations, mostly in English; some analyses consider German (Horacek 1996) and French (Kayser 1988, Pustejovsky and Bouillon 1995).",
        "Prominent representatives include Fass' program met* (1991), which makes use of formal definitions of several kinds of metonymic relations, Sowa's conceptual graphs (1992), in which an a priori unspecific relation is inserted between a concept of the type expected and the concept appearing on the surface, and the TACITUS system (Hobbs et al.",
        "1993) which treats metonymy as a special case of reference resolution, in a uniform abduction process to “find the best explanation for the observables ”.",
        "Altogether, these approaches have two characteristic properties: (1) The conditions expressing when leaving a metonymic relation implicit or not is possible are too unconstrained to cover a larger number of examples in several languages, or to generate sentences with metonymic expressions systematically.",
        "(2) The intended and the literal referent always appear in singular definite form.",
        "There are only three approaches which in some aspects deviate from this characterization.",
        "Pustejovsky's Generative Lexicon (1991) addresses the first aspect.",
        "He proposes a Theory of Qualia, with an explanation of systematic polyse-my.",
        "Applying type coercion enables one to arrive at cases of ordinary metonymy which can be grounded in terms of the semantics of lexemes, as well as at word senses which Pustejovsky has termed logical metonymy, like the reading of a book in the sentence “Mary enjoyed the book”.",
        "Such contexts reflect prototypical knowledge derived from AGENTIVE or TELIC roles of the lexical entry for 'book', which are prominent roles in the Qualia Structure of nouns.",
        "Particularities of the Qualia Structure of nouns regulate the acceptability of leaving a metonymic relation implicit (Pustejovsky and Bouillon 1995).",
        "Stallard (1993) indirectly addresses the second aspect by taking into account scoping relations and impacts on pronominal reference.",
        "He introduces a distinction between referential and predicative metonymy, depending on whether the intended or the literal argument is accessible for subsequent pronominal reference.",
        "This distinction manifests itself in different scope relations that hold between these arguments in the corresponding logical forms.",
        "We will argue against his usage of scoping and the resulting strict distinction of pronominal accessibility.",
        "Markert and Hahn (1997) address interactions of metonymic relation extension and anaphora resolution, which enables them to handle textual ellipsis references.",
        "They apply extensive language independent conceptual definitions with relational path classifications and preference rules.",
        "In their corpus, there are also cases of indefinite metonymic NPs, which is an indication for metonymic relations to several objects.",
        "Though neither Pustejovsky's nor Stallard's approach address cardinalities, we show that both can be extended accordingly: we augment the Generative Lexicon by representing cardinality information, and techniques for building logical forms are enhanced to yield more precise specifications of the metonymically related entities."

        "These reformulations suggest that the man in (1) and the Boston ofice in (2) have wider scope in Stallards representation than the ham sand",
        "wich in (1) and the employee in (2), which predicts pronominal accessibility in (1a) and (2b), as opposed to (1b), (2a) and (2c).",

        "Otherwise, a variety of complications arise in in-trasentential reference, which also demonstrate a specificity of English.",
        "Whereas pronouns agree with the literal referent in most languages, it is the intended referent that determines verb agreement and pronominal reference in the same sentence in English.",
        "For example, metonymic extension to the expression 'fruit dumplings' is ambiguous in the sense that it can refer to one plate of dumplings to be eaten by a single person, or to several plates, each for another person (see the variants in (4)).",
        "Conversely, metonymic extension to the expression 'meat plate' can also be interpreted as a reference to several persons sharing that dish (see the variants in (5)).",
        "Finally, metonymic extension to the expression 'table' seems to be more neutral with respect to the number of persons sharing it (see the variants in (6)).",
        "Thus, the syntactic subject and the verb would not agree in number in English, when the default situation concerning these dishes is present.",
        "Hence, English is, in principle, more informative than other languages when the cardinality of the intended referent differs from the number of the literal referent.",
        "However, those expressions without subject/verb agreement are unlikely to occur in practice, since they appear to be strange.",
        "Unlike with intrasentential reference, intersentential pronominal reference with number features deviating from the referent that is pronominally accessible intrasententially is possible due to default expectations about the cardinality of the real referents (compare complementary variants in (4a) and (5a)).",

        "While in (7c) and (8c), the pronouns refer to the entire set of employees of the Boston office, they more plausibly refer to the representatives in the meeting in (7b) and to the excursion participants in (8b).",
        "These examples indicate an additional demand on the treatment of cardinalities and referential accessibility of metonymic expressions: a distinction is to be made between the entities referred to metonymically (here: employees of the Boston office), and those of its members involved in the event expressed by the sentence (here: the meeting and the excursion).",

        "However, 'the flights' appearing in the logical form representing the sentence “Which airlines serve diet food from New York to Boston?” are not pronominally accessible."

        "In this paper, we have presented an approach to deal with cardinality aspects of metonymic extensions to nouns.",
        "We have discussed a variety of constellations with pronominal references to implicitly related items, sometimes associated with subtle conditions, focusing on English, also including some language specificities.",
        "In order to build explicit logical forms with cardinality specifications, we have extended entries in Pustej-ovsky's Generative Lexicon by default quantifier specifications.",
        "Through exploiting these entries, metonymic extensions are introduced on the basis of events represented in the roles of the Qualia structure, and member or subset relations are introduced on the basis of the associated quantifier specification.",
        "Our method for building explicit logical forms challenges Stallard's distinction of predicative and referential readings of metonymic expressions: it produces scopings that reflect proper quantifier dominance relations rather than pronominal accessibility conditions, and it allows for additional cases of pronominal reference.",
        "In addition, our method enables a more precise attachment of contextual specifications to related entities, and it supports reference resolution to metonymically related entities."
