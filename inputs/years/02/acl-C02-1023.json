        "As the mass of international communication and exchange increases, icons as a mean to cross the language barriers have come through in some specific contexts of use, where language independent symbols are needed (e.g. on some machine command buttons).",
        "The renewed interest in iconic communication has given rise to important works in the field of Design (Aicher and Krampen, 1996; Dreyfuss, 1984; Ota, 1993), on reference books on the history and development of the matter (Frutiger, 1991; Li-ungman, 1995; Sassoon and Gaur, 1997), as well as newer studies in the fields of Human-Computer Interaction and Digital Media (Yazdani and Barker, 2000) or Semiotics (Vaillant, 1999).",
        "We are here particularly interested in the field of Information Technology.",
        "Icons are now used in nearly all possible areas of human computer interaction, even office software or operating systems.",
        "However, there are contexts where richer information has to be managed, for instance: Alternative & Augmentative Communication systems designed for the needs of speech or language impaired people, to help them communicate (with icon languages like Minspeak, Bliss, Commun-I-Mage); Second Language Learning systems where learners have a desire to communicate by themselves, but do not master the structures of the target language yet; Cross-Language Information Retrieval systems, with a visual symbolic input.",
        "In these contexts, the use of icons has many advantages: it makes no assumption about the language competences of the users, allowing impaired users, or users from a different linguistic background (which may not include a good command of one of the major languages involved in research on natural language processing), to access the systems; it may trigger a communication-motivated, implicit learning process, which helps the users to gradually improve their level of literacy in the target language.",
        "However, icons suffer from a lack of expressive power to convey ideas, namely, the expression of abstract relations between concepts still requires the use of linguistic communication.",
        "An approach to tackle this limitation is to try to “analyse” sequences of icons like natural language sentences are parsed, for example.",
        "However, icons do not give grammatical information as clues to automatic parsers.",
        "Hence, we have defined a method to interpret sequences of icons by implementing the use of “natural” semantic knowledge.",
        "This method allows to build knowledge networks from icons as is usually done from text.",
        "The analysis method that will be presented here is logically equivalent to the parsing of a dependency grammar with no locality constraints.",
        "Therefore, the complexity of a fully recursive parsing method grows more than exponentially with the length of the input.",
        "This makes the reaction time of the system too long to be acceptable in normal use.",
        "We have now defined a new parsing algorithm which stores intermediate results in “charts”, in the way chart parsers (Earley, 1970) do for natural language."

        "Assigning a signification to a sequence of information items implies building conceptual relations between them.",
        "Human linguistic competence consists in manipulating these dependency relations: when we say that the cat drinks the milk, for example, we perceive that there are well-defined conceptual connections between ‘cat’, ‘drink’, and ‘milk’ – that ‘cat’ and ‘milk’ play given roles in a given process.",
        "Symbolic formalisms in AI (Sowa, 1984) reflect this approach.",
        "Linguistic theories have also been developed specifically to give account of these phenomena (Tesnière, 1959; Kunze, 1975; Mel’ˇcuk, 1988), and to describe the transition between semantics and various levels of syntactic description: from deep syntactic structures which actually reflect the semantics contents, to the surface structure whereby messages are put into natural language.",
        "Human natural language reflects these conceptual relations in its messages through a series of linguistic clues.",
        "These clues, depending on the particular languages, can consist mainly in word ordering in sentence patterns (“syntactical” clues, e.g. in English, Chinese, or Creole), in word inflection or suffixation (“morphological” clues, e.g. in Russian, Turkish), or in a given blend of both (e.g. in German).",

        "We thus should have to use a parser based on computing the dependencies, such as some which have been written to cope with variable-word-order languages (Covington, 1990).",
        "However, since no morphological clue is available either to tell that an icon is, e.g., accusative or dative, we have to rely on semantic knowledge to guide role assignment.",

        "Compatibility is measured as a unification score between two sets of feature structures: the intrinsic semantic features of the candidate actor, and the “extrinsic” semantic features of the predicative icon attached to a particular semantic role (i.e. the properties “expected” from, say, the agent of kiss, the direct object of drink, or the concept qualified by the adjective fierce ).",
