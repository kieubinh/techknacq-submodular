        "Chinese aspect is a traditional area of research that has always brought up questions and confusion for both theoretical and computational linguists.",
        "Our own practical motivation for exploring this area addresses two concerns.",
        "First, most existing research achievements in Chinese aspect have interpreted the semantics of Chinese aspect in intuitive and general terms rather than in terms of temporal logic theories'; the latter is however crucial for computational implementation.",
        "Second, Chinese linguists traditionally focus their attention on simple primary aspect (simple aspect) forms, but make no efforts either theoretically or computationally to deal with the large variety of complex aspects.",
        "Although the frequency of appearance of complex aspects is not as high as that of simple primary aspect types, they nevertheless play an important role in the Chinese aspect system and cannot be ignored.",
        "To meet these problems, we are constructing a complete Chinese aspect system in which 'Exception to this are Smith (1991) and Dai Y-J (1997) who have investigated Chinese aspect in terms of temporal logic theories.",
        "Their studies have focused particularly on simple aspect forms however.",
        "all aspect expressions, including both simple primary aspect forms and complex aspect forms, are systematically organized.",
        "We are implementing the system using the KPML multilingual generator (Bateman, 1997), interpreting the intrinsic semantics of each aspect form in terms of existing temporal logic theories.",
        "In this paper we focus on the generation of complex aspect."

        "We briefly look into the profile of tense, aspect, and situation type, before examining closely the semantic temporal relations of complex aspect forms.",
        "We adopt Comrie's theoretical framework of tense and aspect.",
        "\"As far as tense is concerned, then, the reference point is typically the present moment, and tenses locate situations either at the same time as the present moment, or prior to the present moment, or subsequent to the present moment...\" (Connie, 1985, p.14).",

        "We also agree with Bache's viewpoint \"it seems to me not only convenient but also legitimate to accept future TEMPORALITY as a genuine member of the metacategory of tense\" (Bache, 1995, p. 266).",
        "Compatible claims are also made by Dahl (Dahl, 1985, p.102-112).",
        "Also see Gong Q-Y (1995).",
        "internal temporal constituency of a situation\".",
        "(Connie, 1976, p.3) Aspect is determined by the type of process 5 (in terms of systemic linguistics), the type of object, and the specific allocation of event initial time, speaking time and reference time.",
        "The aspectual properties of different kinds of event may be generalized in terms of Vendler's four situation types: states, activities, accomplishments, and achievements (Vendler, 1967).",
        "Situation types have nothing to do with the referential time of the event and are influenced only by process, object, and the time point or time interval over which the event holds.",
        "We define several predicates to be used to express temporal relations based on and slightly altering those of Allen (1984).",
        "The important ones are:",
        "The predicates PRECEDE(t,, t2) and SAME(t,, t2) correspond to Allen's predicates BEFORE(tl, t2) and EQUAL(tl, t2) respectively.",
        "The difference between Allen's predicates and ours is that we use time points for definitions rather than time intervals.",
        "The reason for this slight change is that when the system is going to generate an aspect expression, either a simple aspect or a complex aspect, the breakdown into the relevant time points is often needed.",
        "The predicate PRECEDE(t,, t2) indicates that the time point t, precedes the time point t2 on the time axis.",
        "The predicate SAME(t,, t2) indicates that the time point t, equals the time point t2 on the time axis.",
        "Three additional predicates are defined to meet the particular needs of expressing the temporal relations entailed by Chinese aspects.",
        "The predicate FAR-PRECEDE(t,, t2) indicates that the time point t, precedes the time point t2 considerably on the time axis.",

        "From a theoretical point of view, to generate complex aspect forms not only must the temporal relations of individual aspect forms and the complex aspect forms be correctly represented, but the semantic requirements for the combination must also be met.",
        "What determines the combining possibility between different aspect forms is their own intrinsic logical temporal attributes.",
        "When the intrinsic logical temporal attributes of each aspect type are in harmony, the two aspect forms can combine; otherwise they cannot.",
        "We have observed the following principled conditions for this.",
        "First, it is feasible to express the process in each individual aspect form before the combination is made.",
        "Second, each individual aspect form has its own semantic function which is different from that of others.",
        "Third, in a specific situation, when two different aspect forms combine, the reference time points of each aspect type may move according to the temporal attributes of the combined aspect – however, no matter how reference time points change, the event initial time must remain unique, i.e. there must only be a single event initial time to which the complex aspect refers.",
        "If there is any conflict over this, the two aspects are incompatible with each other and the combination cannot be made.",
        "Finally, the combination must be in a proper order.",

        "For the long-durative aspect 一 直 +V (yiIzhi2+V), the event finishing time does not equal the reference time any more, which means that the situation is continuing.",
        "The simple aspect forms differ in terms of how restricted they are in their usage with particular situation types or process types.",
        "In the design of the system network, it is necessary to arrange the logical dependencies such that less restricted aspect forms are made dependent on more restricted aspect forms.",
        "This avoids potentially incompatible logical conditions being required.",
        "For example, compared with other simple primary aspect forms, the unmarked-durative aspect V+ 着 (V+zhe) (Figure 3) has more restricted requirements in its usage, therefore, it should be selected first; then it combines with the long-durative aspect 一直+V (yilzhi2+V) to form the complex aspect long-and-unmarked-durative 一直+V+着 (yi I zhi2+V+zhe).",
        "The secondary aspect long-and-unmarked-durative 一 直 +V+ 着 (yi 1 zhi2+V+zhe) can further combine with another primary aspect, e.g. the unmarked-future-existing aspect (UFT) which is realized lexically by 将 Oiangl), to form a tertiary aspect type: 将+一 直+V+着 oiangl+yilzhi2+V+zhe).",
