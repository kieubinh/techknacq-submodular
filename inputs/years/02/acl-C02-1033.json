        "Topic analysis, which aims at identifying the topics of a text, delimiting their extend and finding the relations between the resulting segments, has recently raised an important interest.",
        "The largest part of it was dedicated to topic segmentation, also called linear text segmentation, and to the TDT (Topic Detection and Tracking) initiative (Fiscus et al., 1999), which addresses all the tasks we have mentioned but from a domain-dependent viewpoint and not necessarily in an integrated way.",
        "Systems that implement this work can be categorized according to what kind of knowledge they use.",
        "Most of those that achieve text segmentation only rely on the intrinsic characteristics of texts: word distribution, as in (Hearst, 1997), (Choi, 2000) and (Utiyama and Isahara, 2001), or linguistic cues as in (Passonneau and Litman, 1997).",
        "They can be applied without restriction about domains but have low results when a text doesn’t characterize its topical structure by surface clues.",
        "Some systems exploit domain-independent knowledge about lexical cohesion: a network of words built from a dictionary in (Kozima, 1993); a large set of collocations collected from a corpus in (Ferret, 1998), (Kaufmann, 1999) and (Choi, 2001).",
        "To some extend, this knowledge permits these systems to discard some false topical shifts without losing their independence with regard to domains.",
        "The last main type of systems relies on knowledge about the topics they may encounter in the texts they process.",
        "This is typically the kind of approach developed in TDT where this knowledge is automatically built from a set of reference texts.",
        "The work of Bigi (Bigi et al., 1998) stands in the same perspective but focuses on much larger topics than TDT.",
        "These systems have a limited scope due to their topic representations but they are also more precise for the same reason.",
        "Hybrid systems that combine the approaches we have presented were also developed and illustrated the interest of such a combination: (Jobbins and Evett, 1998) combined word recurrence, collocations and a thesaurus; (Beeferman et al., 1999) relied on both collocations and linguistic cues.",
        "The topic analysis we propose implements such a hybrid approach: it relies on a general language resource, a collocation network, but exploits it together with word recurrence in texts.",
        "Moreover, it simultaneously achieves topic segmentation and link detection, i.e. determining whether two segments discuss the same topic.",
        "We detail in this paper the implementation of this analysis by the TOPICOLL system, we report evaluations of its capabilities concerning segmentation for two languages, French and English, and finally, we propose an evaluation measure that integrates both segmentation and link detection."

      "text": [
        "In accordance with much work about discourse analysis, TOPICOLL processes texts linearly: it detects topic shifts and finds links between segments without delaying its decision, i.e., by only taking into account the part of text that has been already analyzed.",
        "A window that delimits the current focus of the analysis is moved over each text to be processed.",
        "This window contains the lemmatized content words of the text, resulting from its preprocessing.",
        "A topic context is associated to this focus window.",
        "It is made up of both the words of the window and the words that are selected from a collocation network1 as strongly linked to the words of the window.",
        "The current segment is also given a topic context.",
        "This context results from the fusion of the contexts associated to the focus window when this window was in the segment space.",
        "A topic shift is then detected when the context of the focus window and the context of the current segment are not similar any more for several successive positions of the focus window.",
        "This process also performs link detection by comparing the topic context of each new segment to the context of the already delimited segments.",
        "The use of a collocation network permits TOPICOLL to find relations beyond word recurrence and to associate a richer topical representation to segments, which facilitates tasks such as link detection or topic identification.",
        "But work such as (Kozima, 1993), (Ferret, 1998) or (Kauf-mann, 1999) showed that using a domain-independent source of knowledge for text segmentation doesn’t necessarily lead to get better results than work that is only based on word distribution in texts.",
        "One of the reasons of this fact is that these methods don’t precisely control the relations they select or don’t take into account the sparseness of their knowledge.",
        "Hence, while they discard some incorrect topic shifts found by methods based on word recurrence, they also find incorrect shifts when the relevant relations are not present in their knowledge or don’t find some correct shifts because of the selection of non relevant relations from a topical viewpoint.",
        "By combining word recurrence and relations selected from a collocation network, TOPICOLL aims at exploiting a domain-independent source of knowledge for text segmentation in a more accurate way."

        "The size of each corpus was around 40 million words.",
        "The building process was the same for the two networks.",
        "First, the initial corpus was preprocessed in order to characterize texts by their topically significant words.",
        "Thus, we retained only the lemmatized form of plain words, that is, nouns, verbs and adjectives.",
        "Collocations were extracted according to the method described in (Church and Hanks, 1990) by moving a window on texts.",
        "Parameters were chosen in order to catch topical relations: the window was rather large, 20-word wide, and took into account the boundaries of texts; moreover, collocations were indifferent to word order.",
        "We also adopted an evaluation of mutual information as a cohesion measure of each collocation.",
        "This measure was normalized according to the maximal mutual information relative to the considered corpus.",
        "After filtering the less significant collocations (collocations with less than 10 occurrences and cohesion lower than 0.1), we got a network with approximately 23,000 words and 5.2 million collocations for French, 30,000 words and 4.8 million collocations for English."

        "where occNb(w) is the number of occurrences of the word w in the window and signif(w) is the significance of w. The weight given by (1) combines the importance of w in the part of text delimited by the window and its general significance.",
        "This significance is defined as in (Kozima, 1993) as its normalized information in a reference corpus2: where fw is the number of occurrences of the word w in the corpus and Sc, the size of the corpus.",
        "The building of the collocation vector for the window’s context comes from the procedure presented in (Ferret, 1998) for evaluating the lexical cohesion of a text.",
        "It consists in selecting words of the collocation network that are topically close to those in the window.",

        "This weight is equal to the sum of the contributions of the window words to which it is linked to.",
        "The contribution of a word of the window to the weight of a selected word is equal to its weight in the window, given by (1), modulated by the cohesion measure between these two words in the network (see Figure 1).",

For the words from the window context that are not part of the segment context, wghtx(w,Cs,t-1) is equal to 0.",
        "The revaluation of the weight of a word in a segment context given by (4) is a solution halfway between a fast and a slow evolution of the content of segment contexts.",

        "In order to determine if the content of the focus window is topically coherent or not with the current segment, the topic context of the window is compared to the topic context of the segment.",
