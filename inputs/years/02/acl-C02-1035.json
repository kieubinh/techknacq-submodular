        "Inspired by earlier works on multimodal interfaces (e.g., Bolt, 1980; Cohen el al., 1996; Wahlster, 1991; Zancanaro et al., 1997), we are currently building an intelligent infrastructure, called Responsive Information Architect (RIA) to aid users in their information-seeking process.",
        "Specifically, RIA engages users in a full-fledged multimodal conversation, where users can interact with RIA through multiple modalities (speech, text, and gesture), and RIA can act/react through automated multimedia generation (speech and graphics) (Zhou and Pan 2001).",
        "Currently, RIA is embodied in a testbed, called Real HunterTM, a real-estate application to help users find residential properties.",
        "As a part of this effort, we are building a semantics-based multimodal interpretation framework MIND (Multimodal Interpretation for Natural Dia-log) to identify meanings of user multimodal inputs.",
        "Traditional multimodal interpretation has been focused on integrating multimodal inputs together with limited consideration on the interaction context.",
        "In a conversation setting, user inputs could be abbreviated or imprecise.",
        "Only by combining multiple inputs together often cannot reach a full understanding.",
        "Therefore, MIND applies rich contexts (e.g., conversation context and domain context) to enhance multimodal interpretation.",
        "In support of this context-based approach, we have designed a semantics-based representation to capture salient information from user inputs and the overall conversation.",
        "In this paper, we will first give a brief overview on multimodal interpretation in MIND.",
        "Then we will present our semantics-based representation and discuss its characteristics.",
        "Finally, we will describe the use of this representation in context-based multimodal interpretation and demonstrate that, with this representation, MIND is able to process a variety of user inputs including those ambiguous, abbreviated and complex ones."

        "To interpret user multimodal inputs, MIND takes three major processes as in Figure 1: unimodal understanding, multimodal understanding, and discourse understanding.",
        "During unimodal understanding, MIND applies modality specific recognition and understanding components (e.g., a speech recognizer and a language interpreter) to identify meanings from each unimodal input, and captures those meanings in a representation called modality unit.",
        "During multimodal understanding, MIND combines semantic meanings of unimodal inputs (i.e., modality units), and uses contexts (e.g., conversation context and domain context) to form an overall understanding of user multimodal inputs.",
        "Such an overall understanding is then captured in a representation called conversation unit.",
        "Furthermore, MIND also identifies how an input relates to the overall conversation discourse through discourse understanding.",

        "For example, from the speech input in U4 (“show me houses with this style around here”), three Attention structures are generated as shown in Figure 8(a).",
        "From the gesture input, only one Attention structure is generated which corresponds to the city of White Plains.",
        "Since the gesture input overlaps with both “this style” (corresponding to A2) and “here” (corresponding to A3), there is no obvious temporal relation indicating which of these two references should be unified with the deictic gesture.",
        "In fact, both A2 and A3 are potential candidates.",
        "Based on the domain context that a city cannot have a feature Style, MIND determines that the deictic gesture is actually resolving the refer",
        "ence of “here”.",
        "To resolve the reference of “this style”, MIND uses the visual context which indicates a house is highlighted on the screen.",
        "A recent study (Kehler, 2000) shows that objects in the visual focus are often referred by pronouns, rather than by full noun phrases or deictic gestures.",
        "Based on this study, MIND is able to infer that most likely “this style” refers to the style of the highlighted house (MLS7689432).",
        "Suppose the style is “Victorian”, then MIND is able to figure out that the overall meaning of U4 is looking for houses with a Victorian style and located in White Plains (as shown in Figure 8b).",
        "Furthermore, for U5 (“Comparing these two houses with the previous house”), there are two Attention structures (A1 and A2) created for the speech input as in Figure 12(a).",
        "A1 corresponds to “these two houses”, where the Number feature in the reference constraint is set 2.",
        "Although there is only one deictic gesture which points to two potential houses (Figure 12b), MIND is able to figure out that this deictic gesture is actually referring to a group of two houses rather than an ambiguous single house.",
        "Although the gesture input in U5 is the same kind as that in U1, because of the fine-grained information captured from the speech input (i.e., Number feature), MIND processes them differently.",
        "For the second reference of “previous house” (A2 in Figure 12a), based on the information captured in the temporal constraint, MIND searches the conversation history and finds the most recent house explored (MLS7689432).",
        "Therefore, MIND is able to reach an overall understanding of U5 that the user is interested in comparing three houses (as in Figure 12c)."

        "To facilitate multimodal interpretation in conversational systems, we have developed a semantics-based representation to capture salient information from user inputs and the overall conversation.",
        "In this paper, we have presented three unique characteristics of our representation.",
        "First, our representation is based on fine grained semantic models of intention, attention and constraints that are important in information seeking conversation.",
        "Second, our representation is composed by a flexible combination of feature structures and thus supports complex user inputs.",
        "Third, our representation of intention and attention is consistent at different levels and therefore facilitates context-based interpretation.",
        "This semantics-based representation allows MIND to use contexts to resolve ambiguities, derive unspecified information and improve alignment.",
        "As a result, MIND is able to process a large variety of user inputs including those incomplete, ambiguous or complex ones."
