        "Stemming and morphological analysis techniques can be viewed as clustering mechanisms and usually help in resolving the lexical ambiguity.",
        "The main objective of the stemming algorithms and one objective of morphological analysis techniques is to remove all possible affixes and thus reduce the word to its stem.",

        "A single root can create a set of stems using tens of patterns.",
