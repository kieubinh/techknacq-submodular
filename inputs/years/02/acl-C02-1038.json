        "This paper presents a method for augmenting taxonomies with domain information using a simple combination of three existing lexical similarity metrics.",
        "The combined approach is evaluated by comparing their results against the annotated SEMCOR corpus.",
        "An implementation is described in which WordNet is augmented with thesaural information from the CIDE+ machine readable dictionary.",
        "1 The Tennis Problem Lexical taxonomies, in particular WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), are now widely used in NLP for applications including semantic tagging, text categorisation and parsing (Harabagiu and Chai, 1998).",
        "WordNet consists of sets of lexical items (words and phrases) with similar meanings called synsets which are organised into a hyponomy (IS_A) hierarchy.",
        "For example, \"doctor\" and \"physician\" are in the same synset which is directly subsumed by \"medical practitioner\".",
        "However the coverage of lexical semantics in WordNet is not comprehensive, items such as discourse information are not included.",
        "For example, \"tennis player\" (a hyponym of person) is not closely related to \"racket\", \"balls\" or \"net\" (hyponyms of arti-fact).",
        "Motivated by this example, Fellbaum (1998) dubbed this the \"tennis problem\".",
        "Taxonomies omitting this information are ignoring potentially valuable information which could be helpful for applications such as information retrieval (IR), word sense disambiguation, information extraction and parsing.",
        "This paper reports a step towards a solution for the tennis problem by adding thesaural relations to the noun taxonomy in WordNet (version 1.6).",
        "The aim is to produce groups of noun synsets which are related by topic or domain.",
        "Once identified these links can be added to WordNet to denote this new form of lexical information, which is in addition to the existing hyponomy and hypernymy relations.",
        "An example fragment of the WordNet hierarchy with the types of links we aim to add is shown in Figure 1.",
        "The existing relations, shown as unbroken and dashed lines, demonstrate the relative distance between items such as \"ball boy\" and \"tennis ball\".",
        "This link would be made explicit by the addition of the thesaural links which are shown as dotted lines.",
        "This new information is obtained from the related words classes found in the CIDE+ machine readable dictionary (Procter, 1995).",
        "The main problem with using these existing classes is that it is not clear which of the possible synsets in WordNet each word refers to since they are not disambiguated against WordNet.",
        "Therefore the problem reduces to disambiguating sets of related nouns against the senses in the taxonomy.",
        "This problem is addressed by combining existing disambiguation techniques and applying this approach to WordNet and CIDE+ (Section 2).",
        "An evaluation of this approach is presented in Section 3.",
        "Some related work is described in Section 4."

        "The machine readable version of the CIDE+ dictionary contains thesaural information in the form of 1924 related word classes.",

        "Each member of the category relates to a particular CIDE+ sense which allows access to the textual definitions contained in the dictionary.",
        "This extra information is the main advantage of using CIDE+ related word categories compared to a traditional thesaurus which consists only of groups of related words untagged for sense.",
        "The first stage is to disambiguate each noun in CIDE+ thesaurus classes against WordNet.",

        "WordNet sense for each of the members of the CIDE+ categories.",

        "This corpus consists of 103 files on a wide variety of topics, each concerned with a particular subject.",
        "Content words are tagged with WordNet synset numbers but there is no direct way of telling which of these are related to CIDE+ senses.",
        "However, when semantically related nouns occur together they do so with the related meanings.",
        "For example, if \"monitor\", \"drive\", \"zip\" and \"screen\" occur in the same text it is highly likely that they are all used with their senses related to computer hardware.",
        "In addition nouns appearing in a text on a given topic are likely to be related to that topic.",
        "So the word \"Java\" is more likely to mean `programming language' than `coffee' or `island' in a text about software development.",
        "These two observations about the behaviour of noun meanings can be used to automatically derive disambiguated noun groups suitable for our evaluation from the SEMCOR texts.",
        "It is likely that in SEMCOR texts which contain a large portion of the types from a particular thesaurus class those words will be used with the WordNet sense appropriate to that class.",
        "'The semantic tags in SEMCOR refer to WordNet version 1.5 although the release now contains a mapping for nouns between WordNet versions 1.5 and 1.6 which was used to adapt the corpus to use the lexicon in these experiments.",
        "To match SEMCOR texts against CIDE+ categories we compared each text against each category and attached a score to their relation based on the percentage of words in the category which appeared at least once in the document.",
        "This allowed us to produce a ranked list of document-category pairs based on this simple measure of relatedness.",
        "Any documents in which a CIDE+ category's words were used with less than 5 tokens were discarded.",
        "We then extracted the 10 highest ranking pairs, ignoring any categories which have already appeared.",
        "In effect this is a naive information retrieval (IR) system in which SEMCOR is the document collection and the words in the CIDE+ related word categories are the queries.",
        "We did not use a full IR system as the results from this simple method appeared adequate for the evaluation.",
        "Table 2 shows the ten CIDE+ categories used in our evaluation and the document associated with each.",

        "A first observation is that there is a reasonable semantic relation between each of the CIDE+ categories and the texts to which they were mapped.",

        "This is necessary since the lexicographers for each resource may have made different decisions about how rough or fine grained the sense distinctions should be.",
        "Table 3 lists the words used with more than one sense in each of the remaining four SEMCOR files.",
