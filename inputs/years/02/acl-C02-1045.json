        "This paper is an attempt to provide a view of indexing as a process of generating many small clusters overlapping with each other.",
        "Individual clusters, referred to as micro-clusters in this paper, contain multiple subsets of associated elements, such as documents, terms, authors, keywords, and other related attribute sets.",
        "For example, a cluster in Figure 1 represents ‘a set of documents written by a specific community of authors related to a subject represented by a set of terms’.",
        "Our motivations for considering such clusters are that (i) the universal properties of text-based information spaces, namely large scale, sparseness, and local redundancy (Joachims, 2001), may be better manipulated by focusing on only limited subregions of the space; and also that (ii) the multiple viewpoints of information contents, which a conventional retrieval system provides, can be better utilized by considering not only the relations between ‘documents’ and ‘terms’ but also associations between other attributes such as ‘authors’ within the same unified framework.",
        "Based on the background, this paper presents a framework of micro-clustering, within which we adopt a probabilistic formulation of co",
        "occurrences of textual elements.",
        "For simplicity, we focus primarily on the co-occurrences between ‘documents’ and ‘terms’ in our explanation, but the presented framework is directly applicable to more general cases with more than two attributes."

        "A view from indexing In information retrieval research, matrix transformation-based indexing methods such as Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) (Deerwester et al., 1990) have recently become quite common.",
        "These methods can be viewed as an established basis for exposing hidden associations between documents and terms.",
        "However, their objective is to generate a compact representation of the original information space, and it is likely in consequence that the resulting orthogonal vectors are dense with many non-zero elements (Dhillon and Modha, 1999).",
        "In addition, because the reduction process is globally optimized, matrix transformation-based methods",
        "The document-clustering problem has also been extensively studied in the past (Iwayama and Tokunaga, 1995; Steinbach et al., 2000).",
        "The majority of the previous approaches to clustering construct either a partition or a hierarchy of target documents, where the generated clusters are either exclusive or nested.",
        "However, generating mutually exclusive or tree-structured clusters in general is a hard-constrained problem and thus is likely to suffer high computational costs when dealing with large-scale data.",
        "Also, such a constraint is not necessarily required in actual applications, because ‘topics’ of documents, or rather ‘indices’ in our context, are arbitrarily overlapped in nature (Zamir and Etzioni, 1998)."

        "Based on the above observations, our basic strategy is as follows:",
        "• Instead of generating component vectors with many non-zero elements, produce only limited subsets of elements, i.e., micro-clusters, with significance weights.",
        "• Instead of transforming the entire co-occurrence matrix into a different feature space, extract tightly associated substructures of the elements on the graphical representation of the matrix.",
        "• Use entropy-based criteria for cluster evaluation so that the sizes of the generated clusters can be determined independently of other existing clusters.",
        "• Allow the generated clusters to overlap with",
        "each other.",
        "By assuming that each element can be categorized into multiple clusters, we can reduce the problem to a feasible level where the clusters are processed individually.",
        "Related studies: Another important aspect of the proposed micro-clustering scheme is that the method employs simultaneous clustering of its composing elements.",
        "This not only enables us to combine issues in term indexing and document clustering, as mentioned above, but also is useful for connecting matrix-based and graph-based notions of clustering; the latter is based on the association networks of the elements extracted from the original co-occurrence matrices.",
        "Some recent topics dealing with this sort of duality and/or graphical views include: the Information Bottleneck Method (Slonim and Tishby, 2000), Conceptual Indexing (Dhillon and Modha, 1999; Karypis and Han, 2000), and Bipartite Spectral Graph Partitioning (Dhillon, 2001), although each of these follows its own mathematical formulation."
