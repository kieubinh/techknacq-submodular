        "The MML principle provides a uniform and incremental framework for combining the uncertainty arising from different stages of the interpretation process.",
        "This enables our mechanism to cope with noisy input in terms of wording, beliefs and argument structure, and to factor out the elements of an interpretation which rely on a particular knowledge representation.",

        "In this example, the argument is obtained through a web interface (the uncertainty value of the consequent is entered using a drop-down menu).",
        "As seen in this example, the input argument differs structurally from the system’s interpretation.",
        "In addition, the belief value for the consequent differs from that in the domain BN, and the wording of the statements differs from the canonical wording of the BN nodes.",
        "Still, the system found a reasonable interpretation in the context of its domain model.",
        "The results obtained in this informal trial are validated by our automated evaluation.",
        "This evaluation, which assesses baseline performance, consists of passing distorted versions of the system’s arguments back to the system for interpretation.",
        "In 75% of the cases, the interpretations produced by the system matched the original arguments (in BN form) precisely or almost-precisely.",
        "In the next section, we review related research.",
