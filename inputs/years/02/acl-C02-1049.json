        "One of the most prominent problems in computer processing of Chinese language is identification of the word sequences of input sentences.",

        "As a result, identifying words is difficult, because of segmentation ambiguities and occurrences of unknown words (i.e. out-of-vocabulary words).",
        "Most papers dealing with the problem of word segmentation focus their attention only on the resolution of ambiguous segmentation.",
        "The problem of unknown word identification is considered more difficult and needs to be further investigated.",
        "According to an inspection on the Sinica corpus (Chen etc., 1996), a 5 million word Chinese corpus with word segmented, it shows that 3.51% of words are not listed in the CKIP lexicon, a Chinese lexicon with more than 80,000 entries.",
        "Identifying Chinese unknown words from a document is difficult; since 1.",
        "There is no blank to mark word boundaries; 2.",
        "Almost all Chinese characters and words are also morphemes; 3.",
        "Morphemes are syntactic ambiguous and semantic ambiguous; 4.",
        "Words with same morpho-syntactic structure might have different syntactic categories; 5.",
        "No simple rules can enumerate all types of unknown words; 6.",
        "Online identification from a short text is even harder, since low frequency unknown words are not identifiable by naive statistical methods.",
        "It is difficult to identify unknown words in a text since all Chinese characters can either be a morpheme or a word and there are no blank to mark word boundaries.",
        "Therefore without (or even with) syntactic or semantic checking, it is difficult to tell whether a character in a particular context is a part of an unknown word or whether it stands alone as a word.",
        "Compound words and proper names are two major types of unknown words.",
        "It is not possible to list all of the proper names and compounds neither in a lexicon nor enumeration by morphological rules.",
        "Conventionally unknown words were extracted by statistical methods for statistical methods are simple and efficient.",
        "However the statistical methods without using linguistic knowledge suffer the drawbacks of low precision and low recall.",

        "Common statistical features for unknown word extraction are mutual information (Church 90), entropy (Tung 94), association strength (Smadja 93, Wang 95) and dice coefficients (Smadja 96) etc.",
        "Chang etc.",
        "(Chang etc.",
        "97) iteratively apply the joint character association metric, which is derived by integrating above statistical features.",
        "Their performance is recall rate:81%, precision rate: 72% in disyllabic unknown word, recall rate:88%, precision rate: 39% in trisyllabic unknown word, and recall rate:94%, precision rate: 56% in four-syllabic unknown word.",
        "Chang etc.",
        "(1994) used statistical methods to identify personal names in Chinese text which achieved a recall rate of 80% and a precision rate of 90%.",
        "Chen & Lee (1994) used morphological rules and contextual information to identify the names of organizations.",
        "Since organizational names are much more irregular than personal names in Chinese, they achieved a recall rate of 54.50% and a precision rate of 61.79%.",
        "Lin etc.",
        "(1993) made a preliminary study of the problem of unknown word identification.",
        "They used 17 morphological rules to recognize regular compounds and a statistical model to deal with irregular unknown words, such as proper names etc.. With this unknown word resolution procedure, an error reduction rate of 78.34% was obtained for the word segmentation process.",
        "Since there is no standard reference data, the claimed accuracy rates of different papers vary due to different segmentation standards.",
        "In this paper we use the Sinica corpus as a standard reference data.",
        "As mentioned before, the Sinica corpus is a word-segmented corpus based on the Chinese word segmentation standard for information processing proposed by ROCLING (Huang et al., 1997).",
        "Therefore it contains both known words and unknown words, which are properly segmented.",
        "The corpus was utilized for the purposes of training and testing.",
        "From the above discussion, it is known that identification of unknown words is difficult and need to adopt different methods in identifying different types of unknown words.",
        "The objective of this research is to find methods to extract unknown words from a document and identify their syntactic and semantic categories.",
        "Although both processing are interrelated, for limiting scope of this paper, we will focus our discussion on the extraction process only and leave the topics of syntactic and semantic category predictions to other papers.",
        "2 Steps to Identify Unknown Words In addition to statistical information, we try to use as much information as possible, such as morphology, syntax, semantics, and world knowledge, to identify unknown words.",
        "The identification system fully utilizes the context and content information of unknown words in each three steps of processes, i.e. detection process, extraction process, and verification process.",
        "The detection process detects the occurrences of unknown words for better focusing, so that on the next step extraction process, it needs only focus on the places where unknown were detected.",
        "In addition, it also helps in identifying low frequency unknown words, which hardly can be identified by conventional statistical extraction methods.",
        "The extraction process extracts unknown words by applying morphological rules and statistical rules to match for different types of unknown words.",
        "As usual, tradeoff would occur between recall and precision.",
        "Enriching the extraction rules might increase recall rates, but it also increases the ambiguous and false extractions and thus lowers the precision.",
        "The final verification process comes to rescue.",
        "It resolves ambiguous and false extractions based on the morphological validity, syntactic validity, and statistical validity.",
        "word detection is the problem of monosyllabic known-word detection, i.e. to remove the monosyllabic known-words as the candidates of unknown morphemes.",
        "A corpus-based learning method is proposed to derive a set of syntactic discriminators for monosyllabic words and monosyllabic morphemes (Chen & Bai, 1998).",
        "The following types of rule patterns were generated from the training corpus.",
        "Each rule contains a key token within curly brackets and its contextual tokens without brackets.",
        "For some rules there may be no contextual dependencies.",
        "The function of each rule means that in a sentence, if a character and its context match the key token and the contextual tokens of the rule respectively, this character is a proper word (i.e. not a morpheme of an unknown word).",
        "For instance, the rule \"{Dfa} Vh\" says that a character with syntactic category Dfa is a proper word, if it follows a word of syntactic category Vh.",
        "Rule type Example char { personal names, the name extraction rules are designed as shown in Table 2.",
        "Context information is used for verification and determining the boundary of the extracted word.",
        "For instance, in the last rule of Table 2, it uses context information and statistical information to resolve ambiguity of the word boundary.",
        "It is illustrated by the following examples.",

        "The threshold value 0.8 is adjusted according to the experimental results, which means at least four out of five times the preceding morpheme of Rm is Lm and vice versa.",
        "However the statistical constraints are much loose when the right morpheme Rm is also a detected morpheme, as exemplified in R2.",
        "You may notice that it also accepts the unknown words occurred only once in the document.",
        "Conventional statistical extraction methods are simple and efficient.",
        "However if without supporting linguistic evidences the precision of extraction is still not satisfactory, since a high frequency character string might be a phrase or a partial phrase instead of a word.",
        "In addition to statistical constraint, our proposed statistical method requires that a candidate string must contain detected morphemes.",
        "In other words, the statistical rules are triggered by detected morphemes only.",
