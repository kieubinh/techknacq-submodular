        "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an emerging technology with a variety of real-world applications.",
        "Computer-Assisted Language Learning/Teaching (CALL/CALT) is one area that NLP techniques can contribute to.",
        "Such techniques range from indexing and concor-dancing to morphological processing with on-demand dictionary lookups and syntactic processing with diagnostic error analysis, to name a few.",
        "But little work has been done on discourse-level phenomena, including anaphora.",
        "Zero anaphora or zero pronouns (henceforth zeros) are referential noun phrases (NPs) that are not overtly expressed in Japanese discourse.",
        "These NPs can be omitted if they are recoverable from a given context or relevant knowledge.",
        "The use of zeros is common in Japanese and this poses a challenge for Japanese as a Second Language (JSL) learners for their accurate comprehension and natural-sounding production of Japanese discourse with zeros.",
        "Some learners fail to understand a passage correctly because of the difficulty of identifying zeros and/or their antecedents.",
        "Other learners produce grammatically correct but still unnatural-sounding Japanese due to overuse or underuse of zeros.",
        "Yet, very few textbooks provide systematic instruction or intensive exercises to overcome these difficulties with zeros.",
        "Consequently many Japanese language teachers rely on their intuitions when explaining zeros.",
        "Intuition is a conventional tool in teaching one’s native language, but from a student’s perspective, a well-developed systematic method of instruction can be more convincing.",
        "Also from a teacher’s standpoint, such analysis will be helpful in preparing teaching materials and evaluating students’ performance.",
        "Analysis of zeros can be divided into three phases: zero identification, zero interpretation and zero production.",
        "This paper focuses on the first phase and proposes a method of systematically identifying the presence of zeros in order that teachers might provide effective instruction of zeros, based on some pedagogical principles from relevant second language acquisition (SLA) theory.",
        "We regard teachers as primary users of the program and aim to help them enhance their instruction.",
        "We implemented the program and evaluated its potential benefits for language teachers.",
        "In Sections 1 and 2 we discuss the pedagogical assumptions from SLA theory that motivate our program design, and present the linguistic assumptions from which our heuristics were drawn.",
        "Section 3 provides an overview of our system implementation.",
        "In Section 4, we present the results of evaluation from the viewpoints of both the accuracy and the empirical validity of the program.",
        "We conclude with a discussion of possible future work."

        "Arguments are classified into three types: Topic Phrase (TP), headed by a topic marker wa, Focus Phrase (FP), headed by focus particles mo, koso, dake, sae, shika, etc., and Kase Phrase (KP), headed by case particles ga, wo, ni, e, to, yori, de, kara, and made.",

        "Obligatoriness is a controversial issue, and there is no set agreement among linguists on its definition.",
