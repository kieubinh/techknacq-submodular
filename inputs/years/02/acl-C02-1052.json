        "In English, nouns heading noun phrases are typically either countable or uncountable (also called count and mass).",
        "Countable nouns can be modified by denumerators, prototypically numbers, and have a morphologically marked plural form: one dog, two dogs.",
        "Uncountable nouns cannot be modified by denumerators, but can be modified by unspecific quantifiers such as much, and do not show any number distinction (prototypically being singular): * one equipment, some equipment, *two equipments.",
        "Knowledge of countability is important when translating from a source language without obligatory number and countability distinctions to a target language that does make number distinctions.",
        "Some examples are Japanese-to-English (Ehara and Tanaka, 1993; Bond, 2001), Japanese-to-German (Siegel, 1996), and Chinese-to-English.",
        "For a system generating English, it is important to know the countability of the head noun, as this determines whether it can become plural, and the range of possible determiners.",
        "Knowledge of countability is particularly important in machine translation, because the closest trans-\"This research was done while the second author was visiting the NTT Communication Science Laboratories lation equivalent may have different countability from the source noun.",
        "Many languages, such as Chinese and Japanese, do not mark countability, which means that the choice of countability will be largely the responsibility of the generation component.",
        "In this paper, we measure how well semantic classes predict countability.",
        "Obviously, the answer depends both on how many countability distinctions are made, and how many semantic classes are used.",
        "If every sense of every word belongs to its own semantic class, then semantic classes will uniquely, although not usefully, predict countability.",
        "This is effectively the position taken by Wierzbicka (1988), where the semantics of a noun, given in the Natural Semantic Metalanguage, always provides enough information to predict the countability.",
        "On the other hand, if there are only a handful of semantic classes, then they will have little predictive power.",
        "We first define countability, and discuss its semantic motivation (§ 2).",
        "Then we present the lexical resources used in our experiment (§ 3), including the ontology of 2,710 semantic classes.",
        "Next, we describe the experiment, which uses the semantic classes of words in a Japanese-to-English transfer dictionary to predict their countability (§ 4).",

        "There is definitely some link between countability and conceptualization, but it is a subject of contention among linguists as to how far grammatical countability is motivated and how much it is arbitrary.",
        "Jack-endoff (1991) assumes countability and number to be fully motivated, and shows various rules for conversion between countable and uncountable meanings, but does not discuss any of the problematic exceptions.",
        "The prevailing position in the natural language processing community is to effectively treat countability as though it were arbitrary and encode it as a lexical property of nouns.",
        "Copestake (1992) has gone some way toward representing countability at the semantic level using a type form with subtypes countable and uncountable with further subtypes below these.",
        "Words that undergo conversion between different values of form can be linked with lexical rules, such as the grinding rule that links a countable animal with its uncountable interpretation as meat.",

        "Nouns which rarely undergo conversion are marked as either fully countable, uncountable or plural only.",
        "Nouns that are non-specified are marked as either strongly countable (for count nouns that can be converted to mass, such as cake) or weakly countable (for mass nouns that are readily convertible to count, such as beer).",
        "Conversion is triggered by surrounding context.",
        "Noun phrases headed by uncountable nouns can be converted to countable noun phrases by generating classifiers: one piece of equipment, as described in Bond and Ikehara (1996).",
        "Full knowledge of the referent of a noun phrase is not enough to predict countability.",
        "There is also language-specific knowledge required.",
        "There are at least three sources of evidence for this: the first is that different languages encode the countability of the same referent in different ways.",
        "To use Allan (1980)’s example, there is nothing about the concept denoted by lightning that rules out * a lightning being interpreted as a flash of lightning.",
        "In both German and French (which distinguish between countable and uncountable uses of words) the translation equivalents of lightning are fully countable (ein Blitz and un ´eclair respectively).",
        "Even within the same language, the same referent can be encoded countably or uncountably: clothes/clothing, things/stuff, jobs/work.",
        "The second evidence comes from the psycholinguistic studies of Imai and Gentner (1997) who show that speakers of Japanese and English characterize the same referent in different ways depending on whether they consider it to be countable (more common for English speakers) or uncountable (more common for Japanese speakers).",
        "Further evidence comes from the English of non-native speakers, particularly those whose native grammar does not mark countability.",
        "Presumably, their knowledge of the world is just as complete as English native speakers, but they tend to have difficulty with the English specific conceptual encoding of countability.",

        "In English, the class names of heterogeneous collections of objects tend to be uncountable, while the names of the actual objects are countable.",
        "For example, the following terms are all hy-ponyms of tableware in Wordnet (Fellbaum, 1998): cutlery, chopsticks, crockery, dishware, dinnerware, glassware, glasswork, gold plate, service, tea set, ....",
        "Most of the entries are either uncountable, or multi-word expressions headed by group classifiers, such as service and set.",
        "The words below these classes are almost all countable, with a sprinkling of plural only (like tongs).",
        "Thus in the three levels of the hierarchy, two are mainly uncountable, and below that mainly countable.",
        "However, ALT-J/E’s ontology only has two levels here: 910:tableware has four daughters, all leaf nodes in the semantic hierarchy: 911:crockery, 912:cookware, 913:cutlery and 914:tableware (other).",
        "The majority NCPs for all four of these classes are fully countable.",
        "The question arises as to whether words such as cutlery should be in the upper or lower level.",
        "Using countability as an additional criterion for deciding which class to add a word to makes the task more constrained, and therefore more consistent.",
        "In this case, we would add cutlery to the parent node 910:tableware, on the basis of its countability (or add a new layer to the ontology).",
        "Adding countability as a criterion would also help to solve the problem of words being entered in a class one level too high or too low, as noted in Section 3.2.",
        "We were resigned to getting almost all of the pair plural only wrong, and we did, but they amount to less than 3% of the total.",
        "Although there are some functional similarities, such as a large percentage of 820:clothes for the lower body, it was more common to get one or two in an otherwise large group, such as tongs in the 913:cutlery class, which is overwhelmingly fully countable.",
        "Because the major differentiator is physical shape, which is not included in our semantic hierarchy, these words cannot be learned by our method.",
        "This is another argument for the importance of representing physical shape so that it is accessible for linguistic processing.",
        "We had expected single word entries to be easier to predict than multiple word entries, because of the lack of influence of modifiers.",
        "However, the experiment showed the opposite.",
        "Investigating the reason found that single word entries tended to have more semantic classes per word (1.38 vs 1.34) and more varied combinations of semantic classes.",
        "This meant that there were 5.1 entries per combination to train on for the multi-word entries, but only 3.7 for the single word entries.",
        "Therefore, it was harder to train for the single word entries.",
        "As can be seen in the case of tableware given above, there were classes where the single-word and multi-word expressions in the same semantic class had different countabilities.",
        "Therefore, even though there were fewer training examples, learning the NCPs differently for single and multi-word expressions and then combing the results gave an improved score: 72.0%.",
