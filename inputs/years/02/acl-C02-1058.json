        "Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is an “intermediate” task that is necessary for accomplishing most natural language processing tasks, especially machine translation and information retrieval.",
        "A variety of WSD methods have been proposed over the last decade; however, such methods are still immature.",
        "In response to this situation, we have developed an unsupervised WSD method using bilingual comparable corpora.",
        "With the growing amount of texts available in electronic form, data-driven or corpus-based WSD has become popular.",
        "The knowledge useful for WSD can be learned from corpora.",
        "However, supervised learning methods suffer from the high cost of manually tagging the sense onto each instance of a polysemous word in a training corpus.",
        "A number of bootstrapping methods have been proposed to reduce the sense-tagging cost (Hearst 1991; Basili 1997).",
        "A variety of unsupervised WSD methods, which use a machine-readable dictionary or thesaurus in addition to a corpus, have also been proposed (Yarowsky 1992; Yarowsky 1995; Karov and Edelman 1998).",
        "Bilingual parallel corpora, in which the senses of words in the text of one language are indicated by their counterparts in the text of another language, have also been used in order to avoid manually sense-tagging training data (Brown, et al.",
        "1991).",
        "Unlike the previous methods using bilingual corpora, our method does not require parallel corpora.",
        "The availability of large parallel corpora is extremely limited.",
        "In contrast, comparable corpora are available in many domains.",
        "The comparability required by our method is very weak: any combination of corpora of different languages in the same domain is acceptable as a comparable corpus.",
        "Several types of information are useful for WSD (Ide and Veronis 1998).",
        "Three major types are the grammatical characteristics of the polysemous word to be disambiguated, words that are syntactically related to the polysemous word, and words that are topically related to the polysemous word.",
        "Among these types, use of grammatical characteristics, which are language-dependent, is not compatible with the approach using bilingual corpora.",
        "On the other hand, since a topical relation is language-independent, use of topically related words is most compatible with the approach using bilingual corpora.",
        "Accordingly, we focused on using topically related words as clues for determining the most suitable sense of a polysemous word."

        "A comparable corpus consists of a first-language corpus and a second-language corpus of the same domain.",

        "Therefore, we extract a collection of statistically significant pairs of related words from each language corpus independently of the other language, and then align the pairs of related words translingually with the assistance of a bilingual dictionary.",
        "The underlying assumption is that translations of words that are related in one language are also related in the other language (Rapp 1995).",
        "Translingual alignment of pairs of related words enables us to acquire knowledge useful for WSD (i.e., sense-clue pair).",
        "For example, the alignment of (tank, gasoline) with (タ ン ク <TANKU>, ガ ソ リ ン <GASORIN>) implies that “gasoline” is a clue for selecting the “container” sense of “tank”, which is translated as “タンク <TANKU>”, and the alignment of (tank, soldier) with (戦 車<SENSYA>, 兵士<HEISI>) implies that “soldier” is a clue for selecting the “military vehicle” sense of “tank”, which is translated as “戦車<SENSYA>”.",
        "Figure 1 shows an overview of our proposed method for acquiring knowledge for WSD.",

        "This difference results in a difference in the performance of WSD, particularly in a poor-context situation (e.g., query translation).",
        "Second, our method can acquire sense-clue correlation even from a pair of related words for which alignment results in failure [e.g., C({tank, タンク<TANKU>, 水槽<SUISOU>, 槽<SOU>}, ozone) in Figure 3].",
        "On the contrary, a conventional WSD method using a second-language monolingual corpus uses only pairs of related words for which alignment results in success.",

        "The essence of their method is to obtain a translation matrix that maximizes the distance between the co-occurrence matrix of the first language and that of the second language.",
        "Their method is useful for extracting corpus-dependent translations; however, it does not extract knowledge for WSD, i.e., which co-occurring word suggests which sense or translation."

        "A method for word sense disambiguation using a bilingual comparable corpus together with sense definitions by translations into another language was developed.",
        "In this method, knowledge for WSD, i.e., sense-vs.clue correlation, is acquired in an unsupervised fashion as follows.",
        "First, statistically significant pairs of related words are extracted from the corpus of each language.",
        "Then, aligning pairs of related words translingually, the correlation between the senses of a polysemous word and the clues, i.e., the words related to the polysemous word, is calculated.",
        "In order to overcome both the problem of ambiguity in the translingual alignment of pairs of related words and that of disparity of topical coverage between corpora of different languages, an iterative algorithm for calculating the correlation was developed.",
        "WSD for each instance of the polysemous word is done by selecting the sense that maximizes the score, i.e., the sum of the correlations between each sense and the clues appearing in the context of the instance.",
        "An experiment using corpora of English and Japanese newspaper articles showed that the performance of the new method is promising: the applicability and precision of sense selection were 88.5% and 77.7%, respectively, averaged over 60 test polysemous words.",
