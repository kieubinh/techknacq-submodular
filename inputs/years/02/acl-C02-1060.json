        "Computing word similarity in meanings is an important technique that can be applied in many natural language processing fields, such as query expansion in information retrieval (Frakes and Baeza-Yates, 1992) and reasoning in word sense disambiguation (Dagan et al., 1993; Karov and Edelman, 1996; Lin, 1997) A number of corpus-based statistical approaches have been used to compute word similarity (Hindle, 1990; Dagan et al., 1994; Mori and Nagao, 1998).",
        "In general, computing using these approaches is performed as follows.",
        "First, words are represented by sets of their word co-occurrence statistics, relying on the assumption that the meaning of words is related to their patterns of occurrence with other words in the text (Harris, 1968).",
        "Second, all word representations are transformed into vectors.",
        "Finally, the word similarity is computed using a mathematical measure of vector distance.",
        "In practical applications, e.g., to find the optimal query expansion in information retrieval, words must be further sorted globally based on the prior computing of word similarity.",
        "Usually, the sorting is done using various clustering techniques.",
        "Word clustering, however, only classifies words into several groups.",
        "It is difficult, or at least not intuitive, to recognise the relationships between groups or the relationships between words within groups.",
        "To begin with, it may even be a problem to simply classify words into specific groups because some words can be classified into more than one group.",
        "To solve these problems, we need an alternative technique to word clustering to sort words.",
        "We need a technique that maps words from a very large lexicon into a small semantic space, i.e., a visible representation in which words with similar meanings are placed at the same or neighboring points so that the distance between the points represents the semantic similarity of the words.",
        "This representation is called a semantic map.",
        "There have been several studies on developing semantic maps for English (Ritter and Kohonen, 1989) and also for Chinese and Japanese (Ma et al., 2000 and Ma et al., 2001) using a corpus-based connectionist approach.",
        "In these studies, a self-organizing neural network, which was proposed by Kohonen (1984) and called a self-organizing map (SOM), has been adopted as an unsupervised learning machine.",
        "In these self-organizing English maps, however, co-occurrent words were gathered only from three-word windows, and each word was then simply coded (i.e., transformed into vectors) according to randomly generated patterns of co-occurrent words.",
        "In studies to develop Chinese and Japanese maps, on the other hand, co-occurrent words were gathered according to their grammatical relationships, i.e., adjective/noun – noun in Chinese and adjective/nominal adjectival– noun in Japanese.",
        "The words then were coded, taking into account the semantic correlation between the words, which was established using a form of word similarity computing.",
        "Coding based on word similarity computing used in developing Chinese and Japanese maps has made remarkable progress compared to the random coding used to develop English maps').",
        "However, the coding method is still too crude: co-occurence frequency, which is essential information for judging the importance of a word, has not been utilized in word similarity computing.",
        "Because the self-organization of semantic maps is actually a form of sorting based on word similarity computing, coding based on word similarity computing significantly affects the map created.",
        "It is, therefore, very important in developing semantic maps to establish the optimal coding method.",
        "In addition, in previous studies, there has been no numerical evaluation used to objectively judge the maps developed; i.e., they were only evaluted subjectively by intuition.",
        "This paper describes a corpus-based connectionist approach to the development of self-organizing Chinese and Japanese semantic maps.",
        "An improved coding method using TFIDF term-weighting is proposed to solve the problems existing in the previous coding method.",
        "The evaluations for the maps created are performed by the numerical evaluation using the newly introduced accuracy, recall, and F-measure, as well as by intuition, and by the comparisons with a clustering method and multivariate statistical analysis."
