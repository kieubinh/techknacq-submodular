        "There are still many possible approaches to the problem, and correspondingly many suitable outcomes.",
        "For this reason it is best to firstly derive a suitable measure for the quality of an inferred DTD.",
        "As will be seen in section 3.1, determining the relative utility of content models is a task in itself.",

        "The inference of structure in XML information is a relatively new area of research.",

        "Many of these topics fall into the general field of Inductive Inference, more specifically the sub-field of Grammatical Inference.",
        "This sub-field is concerned with the theory and methods for learning grammars from example data.",
        "For further details concerning the field of Grammatical Inference the reader is referred to the surveys of Pitt (Pitt 1989) and Sakakibara (Sakakibara 1997).",
        "In addition, there has also been prior research into automatic recognition of document structure.",
        "Earlier attempts by (Chen 1991), (Fankhauser & Yu 1994) and (Shafer 1995) in similar problem spaces all use solutions based on heuristic methods.",
        "In each case, the generalisation step involves searching for similar patterns in the data and combining the corresponding structural information.",
        "Although these techniques may work well in some cases, their applicability is restricted by a lack of generality.",
        "The approaches of (Ahonen 1996) and (Young-Lai 1996) are more powerful in concept.",
        "In both of these works, methods derived from theoretical grammatical inference are applied to the problem of inferring DTD content models.",
        "The first known application of such theory to this problem, in (Ahonen 1996), makes use of a characterising method to infer a subset of the regular language class.",
        "The alternative solution in (Young-Lai 1996) makes use of an adapted stochastic method.",
        "In both cases, the results are post-processed to produce more desirable content models.",
        "Unfortunately, neither paper investigates or compares other methods.",
        "It is partly for this reason that these methods have been included in this study for comparisons.",
        "The more recent paper of Garofalakis et al. (Garofalakis et al.",
        "2000) is very similar to this work in terms of motivation and the application of information theory.",
        "However, their inference algorithms are based upon direct generalisation and factoring of regular expressions, with information theoretic principles used to choose a final result from a pool of candidates.",
        "In contrast, we propose a hybrid method which employs various principles throughout the inference process, with the aim of producing a more general method.",
        "3 Overview of Solution The major grammatical inference methods fall into a few general categories.",
        "One of these categories includes a family of algorithms known as state merging methods.",
        "A state merging method typically begins by constructing what is known as a Prefix Tree Automaton (PTA) from the positive examples of the language to be inferred.",

        "When a symbol is found that does not match a valid transition, the PTA is augmented with a new path to accept the rest of the string.",
        "In particular, a Probabilistic Finite State Automaton (PFSA) is merely an automaton with probabilities associated with each transition and final state.",
