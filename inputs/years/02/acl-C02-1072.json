        "This method has been mainly used for indexing and relevance estimation in information retrieval area (Deerwester et al., 1990).",
        "And LSA could be utilized to measure the coherence of texts (Foltz et al., 1998).",
        "By applying the basic concept, a vector representation and a cosine computation, to estimate relevance of a word and/or a text and coherence of texts, we could also estimate the semantic similarity between words.",
        "It is claimed that LSA represents words of similar meaning in similar ways (Landauer et al., 1998).",
        "Probabilistic LSA (PLSA) is based on probabilistic mixture decomposition while LSA is on a linear algebra and singular value decomposition (SVD) (Hofmann, 1999b).",
        "In contrast to LSA, PLSA’s probabilistic variant has a sound statistical foundation and defines a proper generative model of the data.",
        "Both two techniques have a same idea which is to map high-dimensional vectors representing text documents, to a lower dimensional representation, called a latent semantic space (Hofmann, 1999a).",

        "In this paper, we comparatively evaluated these two techniques performed in translation selection of English-Korean machine translation.",

        "Third, if the argument word is not listed in the dictionary, we used k-nearest neighbor learning method to determine which class of translation is appropriate for the translation of an input word.",
        "The distance used in discovering the nearest neighbors was computed by estimating the similarity measured on above latent semantic spaces.",
        "In the experiment, we used 1988 AP news corpus from TREC-7 data (Voorhees and Harman, 1998) for building latent semantic spaces and Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus for constructing a dictionary and test sets.",
        "We obtained 11-20% accuracy improvement, comparing to a simple dictionary search method.",
        "And PLSA has shown that its ability to select an appropriate translation is superior to LSA as an extent of up to 3%, without regard to the value of k and grammatical relationship.",
