        "Evaluation is an essential step of any natural language processing task.",
        "In the field of text summarization almost all research is published with an in-house evaluation, which makes it difficult to replicate experiments, to compare results, or to use evaluation data for training purposes.",
        "The development of standards of evaluation and sharable resources, such as the Document Understanding Conference (DUC, 2000) among others, is of paramount importance for progress in text summarization.",
        "Evaluations can be intrinsic or extrinsic (Sparck Jones and Galliers, 1995): intrinsic evaluation measures the content of the summary by a comparison with an \"ideal\" or \"target\" summary.",
        "Extrinsic evaluation measures how helpful summaries are in the completion of a given task, for example in question answering or text categorization.",
        "If intrinsic evaluation is performed by comparing extracted sentences to a set of \"correct\" extracted sentences, then co-selection is measured by precision, recall and F-score (Firmin and Chrzanowski, 1999).",
        "But these measures only consider sentence identity and not sentence content to carry out Wai Lam Department of Systems Engineering & Engineering Management The Chinese University of Hong Kong Shatin, Hong Kong wlam@se.cuhk.edu.hk the comparison, which has the following negative effect: if two extracts consist of different sentences, whereby the sentences convey the same meaning, they are judged as very different by this measure, even though intuitively they would be judged as equivalent.",
        "As consequence of the fact that these measures consider only binary decisions (a sentence either is or is not in the extract), they ignore partially correct answers.",
        "Also, many researchers have opposed these measures; the generally accepted opinion is that there is no such thing as one ideal summary.",
        "Instead, a summary consists of a set of main ideas that should be conveyed (Jones and Paice, 1992) The most extensive extrinsic evaluation of summarization systems was the TIPSTER SUMMAC evaluation (Mani et al., 1998).",
        "In that evaluation, given a generic summary (or a full document), a human assessor had to perform different tasks, eg.",
        "relevance decision of a document given a query, or categorization of a document into one out of five categories to which the document is relevant.",
        "The evaluation seeks to determine whether the summary is effective in capturing whatever information in the document is needed to correctly categorize the document.",
        "SUMMAC was extremely labour-intensive because of the need for assessors who had to read each of the full documents or extracts, which is a clear disadvantage of extrinsic measures of evaluation.",
        "In our research we investigated measures for content evaluation based on the notion of vocabulary overlap.",
        "They are developed to palliate the problems with precision and recall.",
        "As they are completely automatic, they overcome the problems of task-based evaluations.",
        "These metrics are believed to be quite effective in determining the informativeness of a summary (Mani et al., 2001), and can be used in both extractive and non-extractive summarization, single and multi-document summarization.",
        "Recent research has shown how content-based evaluation can be carried out in automatic or semi-automatic fashion (Donaway et al., 2000; Paice and Oakes, 1999).",
        "In this paper, we are interested in meta-evaluation: a comparative evaluation of evaluation measures for summarization.",
        "We present a framework for evaluation of the content of automatic summaries, which relies on the availability of target summaries and extracts produced by humans.",

        "The English corpus was further annotated with part of speech tags (Mikheev, 2000) and morphologic information, and both Chinese and English text were annotated with named entity tags.",
        "Sentence-level alignment was performed based on our reimplementation of Gale and Church's (1991) alignment algorithm.",
        "For a complete description of the corpus the reader is referred to (Saggion et al., 2002).",
        "We used 400 documents for our experiments.",
        "They were clustered into document sets of 10 documents about one subject (\"narcotics rehabilitation\", \"natural disaster victims aided\", \"customs staff doing good job\", etc.).",
        "LDC annotators developed 40 such queries according to our guidelines, then they used an in-house information retrieval engine and human revision, to find the 10 most relevant documents for that query.",
        "We provided a manual Chinese translation of each query.",
        "Three LDC judges then assessed each sentence in the 10 relevant documents, and assigned each sentence a score on a scale from 0 to 10, expressing how important this sentence is for the summary.",
        "This annotation, which is called \"utility judgement\", allows us to compile human-generated 'ideal' summaries at different compression rates, which is one gold-standard we use for our different measures of sentence-based agreement, both between the human agreement and between the system and the human annotators.",
        "We call this gold standard \"human extracts\".",
        "The judges also wrote multi-document summaries for each cluster at 50, 100, and 200 words (independently of the size of the documents).",
        "As human summary writing by trained professionals is very expensive, it was not possible to provide summaries of all 400 documents by several subjects (and several compression rates).",
        "However, our judges found the writing of multi-document summaries to be natural task.",
        "They followed the DUC guidelines to do so (DUC, 2000).",

        "When comparing two texts, we compute a normalized pairwise lcs between the sentences of the two texts.",

        "These resources are being made available for the community.",
        "Second, we have implemented content-based similarity measures that can be used in both extractive and non-extractive summarization, single and multi-document summarization, and which can be used to compare texts in English and Chinese, and we have shown the advantages of these measures over single co-selection measures.",
        "Finally, we believe this is the first meta-evaluation directly comparing evaluation measures for text summarization on a large-scale level with unrestricted text.",
