        "This paper deals with the problem of how to disambiguate the readings of sentences, analyzed by a given unification-based grammar (UBG).",
        "Apparently, there are many different approaches for almost as many different unification-based grammar formalisms on the market that tackle this difficult problem.",
        "All approaches have in common that they try to model a probability distribution over the readings of the UBG, which can be used to rank the competing analyses of a given sentence; see, e.g., Briscoe and Carroll (1993), Eisele (1994), Brew (1995), Abney (1997), Goodman (1997), Bod and Kaplan (1998), Johnson et al.",
        "(1999), Riezler et al.",
        "(2000), Osborne (2000), Bouma et al.",
        "(2001), or Schmid (2002).",
        "Unfortunately, most of the proposed probability models are not mathematically clean in that the probabilities of all possible UBG readings do not sum to the value 1, a problem which is discussed intensively by Eisele (1994), Abney (1997), and Schmid (2002).",
        "In addition, many of the newer approaches use log-linear (or exponential) models.",
        "Schmid (2002) outlines a serious problem for these models: log-linear models prevent the application of dynamic programming methods for the computation of the most probable parse, if complex features are incorporated.",
        "Therefore the runtime complexity of the disambiguation algorithm is linear in the number of parses of a sentence.",
        "If the number of parses grows exponentially with the length of the sentence, these approaches are simply impractical.",
        "Our approach obviates the need for such models on the UBG side in that it shifts the responsibility to simpler CF models, indirectly obtained from the UBG.",
        "In more detail, the kernel of our novel disambiguation method for UBGs consists of the application of a context-free approximation for a given UBG (Kiefer and Krieger, 2000) and the exploitation of the standard probability model for CFGs.",
        "In contrast to earlier approaches to disambiguation for UBGs, our approach has several advantages.",
        "Firstly, probabilistic modeling/training of context-free grammars is theoretically well-understood and can be effectively done in practice, using the inside-outside algorithm (Lari and Young, 1990).",
        "Secondly, the Viterbi algorithm enables CFG parsing and disambiguation in cubic time, exploiting dynamic programming techniques to specify the maximum-probability parse of a given sentence.",
        "Thirdly, probability distributions over the CFG trees are mathematically clean, if some weak conditions for this desired behaviour are fulfilled (Booth and Thompson, 1973).",
        "In the rest of the paper, we present the context-free approximation, our novel disambiguation approach, and an experiment, showing that the approach is feasible."

        "In this section, we briefly review a simple and intuitive approximation method for turning unification-based grammars, such as HPSG (Pollard and Sag,",
        "1994) or PATR-II (Shieber, 1985) into context-free grammars (CFG).",
        "The method was introduced by Kiefer and Krieger (2000).",
        "The approximation method can be seen as the construction of the least fixpoint of a certain monotonic function and shares similarities with the instantiation of rules in a bottom-up passive chart parser or with partial evaluation in logic programming.",
        "The basic idea of the approach is as follows.",
        "In a first step, one generalizes the set of all lexicon entries.",
        "The resulting structures form equivalence classes, since they abstract from word-specific information, such as FORM or STEM.",
        "The abstraction is specified by means of a restrictor (Shieber, 1985), the so-called lexicon restrictor.",
        "After that, the grammar rules are instantiated by unification, using the abstracted lexicon entries and resulting in derivation trees of depth 1.",
        "The rule restrictor is applied to each resulting feature structure (FS), removing all information contained only in the daughters of a rule.",
        "Additionally, the restriction gets rid of information that will either lead to infinite growth of the FSs or that does not constrain the search space.",
        "The restricted FSs (together with older ones) then serve as the basis for the next instantiation step.",
        "Again, this gives FSs encoding a derivation, and again the rule restrictor is applied.",
        "This process is iterated until a fixpoint is reached, meaning that further iteration steps will not add (or remove) new (or old) FSs to the set of computed FSs.",
        "Given the FSs from the fixpoint, it is then easy to generate context-free productions, using the complete FSs as symbols of the CFG; see Kiefer and Krieger (2002).",
        "We note here that adding (and perhaps removing) FSs during the iteration can be achieved in different ways: either by employing feature structure equivalence - (structural equivalence) or by using FS subsumption C. It is clear that the resulting CFGs will behave differently (see figure 4).",
        "An in-depth description of the method, containing lots of details, plus a mathematical underpinning is presented in (Kiefer and Krieger, 2000) and (Kiefer and Krieger, 2002).",
        "The application of the method to a mid-size UBG of English, and large-size HPSGs of English and Japanese is described in (Kiefer and Krieger, 2002) and (Kiefer et al., 2000)."

        "(Kiefer and Krieger, 2000) suggest that, given a UBG, the approximated CFG can be used as a cheap filter during a two-stage parsing approach.",
        "The idea is to let the CFG explore the search space, whereas the UBG deterministically replays the derivations, proposed by the CFG.",
        "To be able to carry out the replay, during the creation of the CF grammar, each CF production is correlated with the UBG rules it was produced from.",
        "The above mentioned two-stage parsing approach not only speeds up parsing (see figure 4), but can also be a starting point for an efficient stochastic parsing model, even though the UBG might encode an infinite number of categories.",
        "Given a training corpus, the idea is to move from the approximated CFG to a PCFG which predicts probabilities for the CFG trees.",
        "Clearly, the probabilities can be used for disambiguation, and more important, for ranking of CFG trees.",
        "The idea is, that the ranked parsing trees can be replayed one after another by the UBG (processing the most probable CFG trees first), establishing an order of best UBGparsing trees.",
        "Since the approximation always yields a CFG that is a superset of the UBG, it might be possible that derivation trees proposed by the PCFG can not be replayed by the UBG.",
        "Nevertheless, this behavior does not alter the ranking of reconstructed UBG parsing trees.",
        "Figure 1 gives an overview, displaying the readings",
        "of a sentence, analyzed by a UBG and its CFG approximation.",
        "Using this figure, it should be clear that a ranking of CFG trees induces a ranking of UBG readings, even if not all CFG trees have an associated UBG reading.",
        "We exemplify our idea in section 4, where we disambiguate a sentence with a PP-attachment ambiguity.",
        "As a nice side effect, our proposed stochastic parsing model should usually not explore the full search space, nor should it statically estimate the parsing results afterwards, assuming we are interested in the most probable parse (or say, the two most probable results) – the disambiguation of UBG results is simply established by the dynamic ordering of most probable CFG trees during the first parsing stage."

        "(Dowding et al., 2001) compared (Moore, 1999)’s approach to grammar approximation to (Kiefer and Krieger, 2000).",
        "As a basis for the comparison, they chose an English grammar written in the Gemini/CLE formalism.",
        "The motivation for this enterprise comes from the use of the resulting CFG as a context-free language model for the Nuance speech recognizer.",
        "John Dowding kindly provided the Gemini grammar and a corpus of 500 sentences, allowing us to measure the quality of our approximation method for a realistic mid-size grammar, both under - and C (see section 2).1 The Gemini grammar consisted of 57 unification rules and a small lexicon of 216 entries which expanded into 425 full forms.",
        "Since the grammar allows for atomic disjunctions (and makes heavy use of them), we ended in overall 1,886 type definitions in our system.",
        "Given the 500 sentences, the Gemini grammar licensed 720 readings.",
        "We only deleted the ARGS feature (the daughters) during the iteration and found that the original UBG encodes a context-free language, due to the fact that the iteration terminates under -.",
        "This means that we have even obtained a correct approximation of the Gemini grammar.",
        "Table 4 presents the relevant numbers, both under - and C, and shows that the ambiguity rate for C goes up only mildly.",
        "We note, however, that these numbers differ from those presented in (Dowding et al., 2001).",
        "We could not find out why their implementation produces worse results than ours.",
        "They suggested that the use of C is the reason for the bad behaviour of the resulting grammar, but, as our figures show, this is not",
        "true, at least not for this grammar.",
        "Of course, using C instead of - can lead to substantially less restrictive grammars, but when dealing with complex grammars, there is – at the moment – no alternative to using C due to massive space and time requirements of the approximation process.",
        "Figure 2 displays one of the two readings for the sentence measure temperature at all three decks, analyzed by the Gemini grammar.",
        "The sentence is one of the 500 sentences provided by John Dowding.",
        "The vertical dots simply indicate that some less relevant nodes of the FS derivation tree have been omitted.",
        "The figure shows the reading, where the PP at all three decks is attached to the NP temperature.",
        "Due to space constraints, we do not show the second reading, where the PP is attached to the VP measure temperature.",
        "Figure 3 shows the two syntax trees for the sentence, analyzed by the context-free approximation of the Gemini grammar, obtained by using C. It",
        "is worth noting that both readings of the CFG approximation differ in PP attachment, in the same manner as the readings analyzed by the UBG itself.",
        "In the figure, all non-terminals are simply displayed as numbers, but each number represents a fairly complex feature structure, which is, in general, slightly less informative than an associated tree node of a possible FS derivation tree of the given Gemini grammar for two reasons.",
        "Firstly, the use of the C operation as a test generalizes information during the approximation process.",
        "In a more complex UBG grammar, the restrictors would have deleted even more information.",
        "Secondly, the flow of information in a local tree from the mother to the daughter node will not be reflected because the approximation process works strictly bottom up from the lexicon entries.",
        "Training of the CFG approximation.",
        "A sample of sentences serves as input to the inside-outside algorithm, the standard algorithm for unsupervised training of PCFGs (Lari and Young, 1990).",
        "The given corpus of 500 sentences was divided into a training corpus (90%, i.e., 450 sentences) and a testing corpus (10%, i.e., 50 sentences).",
        "This standard procedure enables us (i) to apply the inside-outside algorithm to the training corpus, and (ii) to evaluate the resulting probabilistic context-free grammars on the testing corpus.",
        "We linguistically evaluated the maximum-probability parses of all sentences in the testing corpus (see section 5).",
        "For unsupervised training and parsing, we used the implementation of Schmid (1999).",
        "Figure 5 shows a fragment of the probabilistic context-free approximation.",
        "The probabilities of the grammar rules are extracted after several training iterations with the inside-outside algorithm using the training corpus of 450 sentences.",
        "Disambiguation using maximum-probability parses.",
        "In contrast to most approaches to stochastic modeling of UBGs, PCFGs can be very easily used to assign probabilities to the readings of a given sentence: the probability of a syntax tree (the reading) is the product of the probabilities of all context-free rules occurring in the tree.",
        "For example, the two readings of the sentence measure temperature at all three decks, as displayed in figure 3, have the following probabilities: 2.25 • 10-12 (first reading on the left-hand side) and 1.49 • 10-13 (second reading on the right-hand side).",
        "The maximum-probability parse is therefore the syntax-tree on the left-hand side of figure 3, which is the reading, where the PP at all three decks is attached to the NP temperature.",
        "A closer look on the PCFG fragment shows that the main contribution to this result comes from the two rules 929 -+1028 951 (0.938) and 183 -+960 951 (0.042).",
        "Here, the probabilities encode the statistical finding that PP-to-NP attachments can be expected more frequently than PP-to-VP attachments, if the context-free approximation of the Gemini grammar is used to analyze the given corpus of 500 sentences."
