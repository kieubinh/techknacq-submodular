        "Ambiguity on all levels of representation is an inherent property of natural languages and it also forms a central problem of natural language parsing.",
        "A consequence of the natural language ambiguity is a high number of possible outputs of a parser that are usually represented by labeled trees.",
        "The average number of parsing trees per input sentence strongly depends on the background grammar and thence on the language.",
        "There are natural language grammars producing at most hundreds or thousands of parsing trees but also highly ambiguous grammar systems producing enormous number of results.",
        "For example, a grammar extracted from the Penn Treebank and tested on a set of sentences randomly generated from a probabilistic version of the grammar has on average 7.2 × 1027 parses per sentence according to Moore’s work (Moore, 2000).",
        "Such a mammoth extent of result is also no exception in parsing of Czech (Smrˇz and Hor´ak, 2000) (see Fig. 1) due to free word order and",
        "rich morphology of word forms whose grammatical case cannot often be unambiguously determined.",
        "A traditional solution for these problems is presented by probabilistic parsing techniques (Bunt and Nijholt, 2000) aiming at finding the most probable parse of a given input sentence.",
        "This methodology is usually based on the relative frequencies of occurrences of the possible relations in a representative corpus.",
        "“Best” trees are judged by a probabilistic figure of merit (FOM).",
        "The term “figure of merit” is usually used to refer to a function that prunes implausible partial analyses during parsing.",
        "In this paper, we rather take figure of merit as a measure bounding the true probabilities of the complete parses.",
        "The standard methods of the best analysis selection (Caraballo and Charniak, 1998) usually use simple stochastic functions independent on the peculiarities of the underlying language.",
        "This approach seems to work satisfactorily in case of analytical languages.",
        "On the other hand, the obstacles brought by the synthetical languages in relationship with those simple statistical techniques are indispensable.",
        "Therefore, we try to improve the standard FOMs taking into consideration specific features of free word order languages.",

        "The overall figure of merit of the syntactic analysis results is determined as a combination of several contributory FOMs that reflect particular language features such as",
        "• frequency of syntactic constructs represented by precomputed rule probabilities • augmented n-gram model based on the occurrence of adjacent lexical heads standing for the corresponding subtrees • affinity between constituents modeled by valency frames of verbs, adjectives and nouns",
        "The selected FOMs participate on the determination of the most probable analysis.",
        "A straightforward approach lies in the linear combination of FOMs: 5=A1·51+A2·2+A3·3 where �i are the FOMs’ contributions and Ai are empirically assigned weights (usually taken as normalizing coefficients).",
        "However, our experiments showed that the weights Ai need to reflect the behaviour of particular lexical items, their categories or even analysed constituents.",
        "We thus need to handle the Ai variables as functions of various parameters.",

        "A key question is then what the good candidates for FOMs are.",
        "The use of probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) involves simple CF rule probabilities to form a FOM (Chitrao and Grishman, 1990; Bo-brow, 1991).",
        "The evaluation of the first FOM is based on the mechanism of contextual actions built into the metagrammar conception (Smrˇz and Hor´ak, 2000).",
        "It distinguishes four kinds of contextual actions, tests or constraints:",
        "1. rule-tied actions 2. agreement fulfilment constraints 3. post-processing actions 4. actions based on derivation tree",
        "The rule-based probability estimations are solved on the first level by the rule-tied actions, which also serve as rule parameterization modifiers.",
        "Agreement fulfilment constraints are used in generating the expanded grammar (Smrˇz and Hor´ak, 1999) or they serve also as chart pruning actions.",
        "In terms of (Maxwell III and Kaplan, 1991), the agreement fulfilment constraints represent the functional constraints, whose processing can be interleaved with that of phrasal constraints.",
        "The post-processing actions are not triggered until the chart is already completed.",
        "The main part of FOM computation for a particular input sentence is driven by actions on this level.",
        "Some figures of merit (e.g. verb valency FOM, see Section 2.3) demand exponential resources for computation over the whole chart structure.",
        "This problem is solved by splitting the calculation process into the pruning part (run on the level of post-processing actions) and the reordering part, that is postponed until the actions based on derivation tree.",
        "The actions that do not need to work with the whole chart structure are run after the best or n most probable derivation trees are selected.",
        "These actions are used, for example, for determination of possible verb valencies within the input sentence, which can produce a new ordering of the selected trees."

        "This technique, as well as stochastic POS tagging based on n-gram statistics, achieves satisfactory results for analytical languages (like English).",
        "However, in case of free word order languages, current studies suggest that these simple stochastic techniques considerably suffer from the data sparseness problem and require a huge amount of training data.",
        "The reduction of the number of possible training schemata, which correctly keeps the correspondence with the syntactic tree structure, is achieved by elaborate selection of n-gram candidates.",
        "While the standard n-gram techniques work on the surface level, this approach allows us to move up to the syntactic tree level.",
        "We advantageously use the ability of lexical heads to represent the key features of the subtree formed by its dependants (see Figure 2).",
        "The principle of lexical heads has shown to be fruitfully exploited in the analysis of free word order languages.",

        "During the analysis of noun groups and prepositional noun groups in the role of verb valencies in a given input sentence one needs to be able to distinguish free adjuncts or modifiers from obligatory valencies.",
        "We are testing a set of heuristic rules that determine",
        "whether a found noun group typically serves as a free adjunct.",
        "The heuristics are based on the lexico-semantic constraints (Smrˇz and Hor´ak, 1999).",
        "An example of the application of the heuristics is depicted in Figure 3.",
        "In the presented Czech sentence, the expression na Karla (with Charles) is denoted as a verb argument by the valency list of the verb rozhnˇevat se (anger), while the prepositional noun phrase na sch˚uzi (at the meeting) is classified as a free adjunct by the rule specifying that the preposition na (at) in combination with an <ACTIVITY> class member (in locative) forms a location expression.",
        "The remaining constituent na mzdu (for payroll) is finally recommended as a modifier of the preceding noun phrase z´aloze ([about the] advance).",
        "Certainly, we also need to discharge the dependence on the surface order.",
        "Therefore, before the system confronts the actual verb valencies from the input sentence with the list of valency frames found in the lexicon, all the valency expressions are reordered.",
        "By using the standard ordering of participants, the valency frames can be handled as pure sets independent on the current position of verb arguments.",
        "2.4 Preferred Word Order In analytical languages, the word order is usually taken as rather fixed and that is why it can be employed in parsing tree pruning algorithms.",
        "However, in case of inflectional languages, the approaches to word order analysis are diverse.",
        "The most influential theory works with the topic-focus articulation (Sgall et al., 1986).",
        "Although nearly all rules that could limit the order of constituents in Czech sentences can be fully relaxed, a standard order of participants can be defined.",
        "A corpus analysis of general texts affirms that this preferred word order is often followed and that it can be advantageously used as an arbiter for best analysis selection.",
        "Cases where the �i FOMs do not unambiguously elect the best candidates can be routed by the preferred word order in the form of functional weights Ai() with appropriate parameters."
