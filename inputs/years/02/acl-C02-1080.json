        "Named entity (NE) recognition is a fundamental step to many language processing tasks.",
        "It was a basic task of the Message Understanding Conference (MUC) and has been studied intensively.",
        "Palma & Day (97) reported that person (PER), location (LOC) and organization (ORG) names are the most difficult subtasks as compared to other entities as defined in MUC.",
        "This paper thus focuses only on the recognition of PER, LOC and ORG entities.",
        "Recent research on NE recognition has been focused on the machine learning approach, such as the transformation-based learning (Aberdeen 95), hidden Markov model (Bikel et al. 97), decision tree (Sekin et al. 98), collocation statistics (Lin 98), maximum entropy model (Borthwick 99), and EM bootstrapping (Cucerzan & Yarowsky 99).",
        "Other than English, several recent works examined the extraction of information from Spanish, Chinese, and Japanese (Isozaki 01).",
        "Most approaches for Chinese NE recognition used handcrafted rules, supplemented by word or character frequency statistics.",
        "These methods require a lot of resources to model the NEs.",
        "Chen et al.",
        "(98) used 1-billion person name dictionary and employed mainly internal word statistics with no generalization.",
        "Yu et al.",
        "(98) employed a common framework to model both the context and information residing within the entities, and performed rule generalization using POS (part-of-speech) and some semantic tags.",
        "A similar system is also reported in Luo & Song (01).",
        "Chinese NE recognition is much more difficult than that in English due to two major problems.",
        "The first is the word segmentation problem (Sproat et al.",
        "96, Palmer 97).",
        "In Chinese, there is no white space to delimit the words, where a word is defined as consisting of one or more characters representing a linguistic token.",
        "Word is a vague concept in Chinese, and Palmer (97) showed that even native speakers could only achieve about 75% agreement on “correct” segmentation.",
        "As word segmentation is the basic initial step to almost all linguistic analysis tasks, many techniques developed in English NLP cannot be applied to Chinese.",
        "Second, there is no exterior feature (such as the capitalization) to help identify the NEs, which share many common characters with non-NE (or common words).",
        "For example, while 中 is normally associated with the country China, it could also mean the concepts in, at or hit; and张 normally refers to the surname Zhang, but it also means the concepts open, sheet or spread.",
        "Moreover, proper names in Chinese may contain common words and vice versa.",
        "Because of the above problems, the use of statistical and heuristic rules commonly adopted in most existing systems is inadequate to tackle the Chinese NE recognition problem.",
        "In this paper, we consider a new approach of employing a rationality model in a multi-agent framework.",
        "The main ideas of our approach are as follows.",
        "First, we use an NE rationality measure to evaluate the probability of a sequence of tokens being a specific NE type, and adopt a greedy approach to detect all possible NEs.",
        "Second, we treat the process of selecting the best NEs among a large set of possibilities as a multi-agent negotiation problem.",
        "We test our overall approach on the MET-2 test set and the system is able to achieve high F1 values of over 92% on all NE types.",
        "The results are significantly better than most reported systems on MET-2 test set.",
        "The rest of the paper describes the details of our rationality-based and multi-agent negotiation approach to detect and refine NEs."

        "The pair could be recognized as PER only if both tokens are labeled as positive (or of the right types) as shown in Table 1.",
        "If either one of both of the tokens are evaluated negatively, then the pair will not be recognized as PER based on the model defined above.",
        "Although the example depicted in Table 1 is very simple, the same idea can be extended to the more complex NE Types for ORG and LOCs.",
        "The number of tokens in a NE may vary from 2 in PER to about 20 for ORG.",
        "One constraint is that the sequencing of tokens and their labels must be consistent with the respective NE type.",
