        "In this paper, we propose a topic detection method using a dialogue history for a speech translator.",
        "The method uses a k-nearest neighbor method for the algorithm, automatically clusters target topics into smaller topics grouped by similarity, and incorporates dialogue history weighted in terms of time to detect and track topics on spoken phrases.",
        "From the evaluation of detection performance using test data comprised of realistic spoken dialogue, the method has shown to perform better with clustering incorporated, and when combined with dialogue history of three sentences, gives detection accuracy of 72.1 %."

        "In recent years, demand for international information exchange has rapidly increased with the advance of globalization and cross-border utilization of information.",
        "Consequently, machine translation technologies have achieved significant progress, and speech translator has enhanced its practical value for certain settings such as a travel domain (Watanabe et al., 2000).",
        "Further improvement in quality of translation technology will expand its applicable domains and the user market.",
        "As the translation system is improved to increase its applicable situations and topics, higher translation quality using dialogue context and scene knowledge becomes a crucial factor.",
        "For example, we take an example phrase in a travel conversation, \"It's rare\".",
        "In a restaurant, the word \"rare\" probably means that the meat is cooked for a short period of time.",
        "In other situations, the word \"rare\" most likely means uncommon and not widely known.",
        "The word should be appropriately translated if the target language has different expressions for these two different situations.",
        "User's previous input sentences can help identify the sentence topic, thus disambiguate polysemy and improve the quality of speech translation.",
        "We have conducted studies on domain adaptation techniques to enable speech translation system embodied with understanding of what a topic is.",
        "Domain adaptation techniques are comprised of 1) dynamic replacing of the topic knowledge according to the theme transition to process direct translation; 2) semi-automatic extracting and accumulating of knowledge on respective topics; and 3) topic detecting and tracking of input data.",
        "This paper proposes and examines the topic detection on speech translation system, which can link previous dialogue sentences to identify topics that are relevant to disambiguate polysemy and improve the speech recognition accuracy.",
        "It also investigates the method's limitation and its possible solutions.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the constraints in detecting a topic from dialogue utterances.",
        "Section 3 describes our topic detection algorithm to overcome these constraints.",
        "Section 4 explains the evaluation of our method using a travel conversation corpus and Section 5 presents the evaluation result.",
        "Section 6 discusses the effect of our method from a comparison of the results on typical dialogue data and on real situation dialogue data.",
        "We conclude in Section 7 with some final remarks and directions for future work.",
        "2 Topic detection The topic detection module uses one spoken phrase in a dialogue as an input.",
        "It dynamically tracks the topic transitions and outputs most appropriate topic as a detected topic.",
        "We use the term \"topic\" to define an abstract scene determined by a purpose and an occurrence at a given place covered by the conversation, and any surrounding knowledge relevant to the scene.",
        "For example, in a speech translation system for travel conversation, topics may include \"Hotel', \"Restaurant\", \"Sightseeing\", and \"Emergency\".",
        "Among conventional topic detection methods, one uses compound words that features certain topic as trigger information for detecting a topic (Hatori et al., 2000), and another uses domain-dependant dictionaries and thesauruses to construct knowledge applicable to a certain topic (Tsunoda et al., 1996).",
        "In the former method, a scene-dependant dictionary provides the knowledge relevant to the scene and compound words in the dictionary are used for detecting a topic.",
        "In the latter method, words appearing in a scene are defined as the knowledge relevant to the scene and superordinate/subordinate relation and synonyms provided by thesauruses are used to enhance the robustness.",
        "These conventional methods are suitable for written texts but not for dialogue utterances in a",
        "speech translator.",
        "A speech translator requires: - Topic detection for each utterance in a dialogue; - Prompt topic detection in real time processing; - Dynamic tracking of topic transition.",
        "The following two major constraints make the topic detection for dialogue utterances more difficult.",
        "(1) Constraint due to single sentence process - Sentences in a dialogue are usually",
        "short with few keywords.",
        "- In a dialogue, the frequency values of the word in a sentence are mostly one, making it difficult to apply a statistical method.",
        "(2) Constraint due to the nature of spoken dialogue - In a dialogue, one topic is sometimes expressed using two or more sentences.",
        "- The words appearing in a sentence are sometimes replaced by anaphora or omitted by ellipsis in the next sentence.",
        "- Topics frequently change in a dialogue.",
        "To make topic detection adaptive to the speech translator, we propose a topic detection method which accepts single utterance as an input, detects the topic transitions dynamically and outputs most appropriate topic for the latest utterance.",
        "The k-nearest neighbor method (Yang, 1994) is used with the clustering method linked with the dialogue history as a topic detection algorithm for dialogue utterance.",
        "The k-nearest neighbor method is known to have high precision performance with less restriction in the field of document categorization.",
        "This method is frequently used as a baseline in the field and also applied to topic detection for stories but not for a single sentence (Yang et al., 1999).",
        "We incorporated two new methods to the k-nearest neighbor method to overcome the constraints mentioned above.",
        "To overcome the first constraint we clustered a set of sentences in training data into subsets (called subtopics) based on similarity between the sentences.",
        "A topic is detected by calculating the relevance between the input sentence and these subtopics.",
        "Clustering sentences on the same subtopic increases the number of characteristic words to be compared with input sentence in calculation.",
        "To overcome the second constraint, we grouped an input sentence with other sentences in the dialogue history.",
        "A topic is detected by calculating the relevance between this group and each possible topic.",
        "Grouping the input sentence with the preceding sentences increases the number of characteristic words to be compared with topics in calculation.",
        "We consider the time sequence of sentences in a dialogue in calculating the relevance to avoid the influence of topic change in the dialogue."

        "Figure 3 shows the result of topic detection with change in number of sentences in a dialogue history.",
        "The accuracy rate improved as the number of incorporated sentences increased and the best accuracy rate achieved was about 80%.",

        "Our results using the typical dialogue data demonstrated that the one-sentence-per-cluster case achieved the best accuracy rate of all clustering cases.",
        "This is due to nature of typical dialogue and its short sentences, frequently allowing the input data's feature words to exactly match those of the training data.",
        "On the same detection results, the accuracy rate of one-topic-per-cluster case was substantially poorer than all other clustering cases, primarily due to large number of sentences merged into one cluster, making each feature word less effective.",
        "For example, the training data sentence \"Is it all right to pick it up with my hand?\" may be categorized under the topic \"Shopping\" as this conversation phrase can be used to a shop clerk.",
        "The one-sentence-per-cluster case correctly categorizes the input sentence: \"Is it all right to pick up this with my hand?\" to the same topic as it nearly matches the above sentence.",

        "This topic contains phrases like \"My hand hurts\" or \"I feel all right lately\" according to their topic similarity in describing physical conditions.",
        "One-topic-per-cluster puts the input sentence under the same topic based on matching words \"my hand\" and \"all right\".",
        "Topic detection performs better with a large topic divided into smaller groups or even into single sentences when the approach is applied to a typical dialogue.",
        "The results using the real situation dialogue data showed that the one-sentence-per-cluster case achieved higher accuracy rate than one-topic-per-cluster case.",
        "Moreover, the medium-cluster case performed better than one-sentence-per-cluster case in accuracy.",

        "We had 12 input sentences that are incorrectly detected in one-sentence-per-cluster case but correctly detected in the medium-cluster case.",
        "All these input sentences do not entirely match the training data sentences.",
        "The clustering is advantageous when there is no strong feature word and the topics are determined by sets of words in the sentence.",
        "We had 9 input sentences that are correctly detected in one-sentence-per-cluster case but not in the medium-cluster case.",
        "One-third of these input sentences exactly matched the training data sentences.",
        "In the case where the strong feature words exist in input sentences, clustering does not improve and sometimes hurt the performance of topic detection.",
        "It seems clear from the results that the one-sentence-per-cluster is advantageous for the input sentences in the typical dialogue and the medium-cluster is favorable for the input sentences in the real situation dialogue.",
        "When compared to one-sentence-per-cluster, the medium-cluster topic detection performance is almost equal for the typical dialogue data and somewhat superior for the real situation dialogue.",
        "A practical improvement in the performance would result from a better estimation of optimal topic clusters applied to both typical and real situation dialogues derived from large amount of travel corpus.",
        "We examined the effect of implementing a dialogue history in topic detection.",
        "Equally weighted dialogue history demonstrated moderately better than the time series weighted history in terms of accuracy rate.",
        "We examined the sentences in the dialogue history and found that the sentences categorized into single topic is 45.1% of all sentences.",
        "39.6% of all sentences are categorized as \"General conversation\", which means it cannot specify a relevant topic.",
        "When we apply the weight set based on time series and the later sentence is categorized into \"General conversations\" or into two or more topics, this sentence will likely lead to a false topic detection.",
        "On the other hand, when the sentences in a dialogue history is equally weighted, the topic detection performance for the sentence representing only one topic is relatively better than other sentences, leading to the correct result.",
        "The effect of varying the number of sentences in the dialogue history was also examined.",
        "The performance improved as the number of dialogue history sentences increased.",
        "The accuracy rate productively increase up to 3 or 4 preceding sentences, then reach about 76% with 4 preceding sentences, then there is limited benefit in adding sentences after this point.",
