        "An expert can answer the question by overcoming such gaps through the conversation with the questioner.",
        "Huge amount of texts are available on the world wide web these days, and an answer to any question potentially exists somewhere on the web.",
        "However, searching the web is far away from the effectiveness of asking an expert.",

        "In case of web search engines, an enormous list of possibly relevant texts are returned, annoying users.",
        "In case of the QA track of TREC, systems find an answer (passage of 50 or 250 bytes) among texts and return it to the questioner.",
        "This seems an attractive ability, but it is assumed that questions are well specific.",
        "That is, questions are so clear that the answer can be found by one-step retrieval.",
        "However, in most cases a user cannot express his/her question in such a clear way.",

        "On the user interface, dialogs between a user and the system is displayed in the upper frame as shown in Figure 2.",
        "After a user inputs a question into the text box, the system asks him/her back by showing choices in the lower frame.",
        "Input Analyzer: The user question is transformed into a dependency structure by a robust parser, KNP (Kurohashi and Na-gao, 1994), and question-pattern rules are applied to extract the question type (symp",
