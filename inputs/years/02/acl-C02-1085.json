        "Multi-document summarization of news stories differs from single document in that it is important to identify differences and similarities across documents.",
        "This can be interpreted as the question of how to identify an event and a subject in documents.",
        "According to the TDT project, an event is something that occurs at a specific place and time associated with some specific actions, and it becomes the background among documents.",
        "A subject, on the other hand, refers to a theme of the document itself.",
        "Another important factor, which is typical in a stream of news, is recognizing and handling subject shift.",
        "The extracted paragraphs based on an event and a subject may include the main points of each document and the background among documents.",
        "However, when they are strung together, the resulting summary still contains much overlapping information.",
        "This paper focuses on subject shift and presents a method for extracting key paragraphs from documents that discuss the same event.",
        "We use the results of our tracking technique which automatically detects subject shift, and produces the optimal window size in the training data so as to include only the data which are sufficiently related to the current subject.",
        "The idea behind this is that, of two documents from the target event which are close in chronological order, the latter discusses (i) the same subject as an earlier one, or (ii) a new subject related to the target event.",
        "This is particularly well illustrated by the Kobe Japan quake event in the TDT1 data.",
        "The first document says that a severe earthquake shook the city of Kobe.",
        "It continues until the 5th document.",
        "The 6th through 17th documents report damage, location and nature of quake.",
        "The 18th document, on the other hand, states that the Osaka area suffered much less damage than Kobe.",
        "The subject of the document is different from the earlier ones, while all of these are related to the Kobe Japan quake event.",
        "We use the leave-one-out estimator of Support Vector Machines(SVMs)(Vapnik, 1995) to make a clear distinction between (i) and (ii) and thus estimate the optimal window size in the training data.",
        "For the results of tracking where documents are divided into several sets, each of which covers a different subject related to the same event, we apply SVMs again and induce classifiers.",
        "Using these classifiers, we extract key paragraphs.",
        "The next section explains why we need to detect subject shift by providing notions of an event, a subject class and a subject which are properties that identify key paragraphs.",
        "After describing SVMs, we present our system.",
        "Finally, we report some experiments using the TDT1 and end with a very brief summary of existing techniques."

        "Most of the work on summarization task by paragraph or sentence extraction has applied statistical techniques based on word distribution to the target document(Kupiec et al., 1995).",
        "More recently, other approaches have investigated the use of machine learning to find patterns in documents(Strzalkowski et al., 1998) and the utility of parameterized modules so as to deal with different genres or corpora(Goldstein et al., 2000).",
        "Some of these approaches to single document summarization have been extended to deal with multi-document sum-marization(Mani and E.Bloedorn, 1997), (Barzilay et al., 1999), (McKeown et al., 1999).",
        "Our work differs from the earlier work in several important respects.",
        "First, our method focuses on subject shift of the documents from the target event rather than the sets of documents from different events(Radev et al., 2000).",
        "Detecting subject shift from the documents in the target event, however, presents special difficulties, since these documents are collected from a very restricted domain.",
        "We thus present a window adjustment algorithm which automatically adjusts the optimal window in the training documents, so as to include only the data which are sufficiently related to the current subject.",
        "Second, our approach works in a living way, while many approaches are stable ones, i.e., they use documents which are prepared in advance and apply a variety of techniques to create summaries.",
        "We are interested in a substantially smaller number of initial training documents, which are then utilized to extract paragraphs from documents relevant to the initial documents.",
        "Because the small number of documents which are used for initial training is easy to collect, and costly human intervention can be avoided.",
        "To do this, we use a tracking technique.",
        "The small size of the training corpus, however, requires sophisticated parameters tuning for learning techniques, since we can not make one or more validation sets of documents from the initial training documents which are required for optimal results.",
        "Instead we use El.",
        "of SVMs to cope with this problem.",
        "Further, our method does not use specific features for training such as ‘Presence and type of agent’ and ‘Presence of citation’, which makes it possible to be extendable to other domains(Teufel, 2001)."
