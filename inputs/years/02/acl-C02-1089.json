        "Syllable-to-word (STW) conversion is important in Chinese phonetic input methods and speech recognition.",
        "There are two major problems in the STW conversion: (1) resolving the ambiguity caused by homonyms; (2) determining the word segmentation.",
        "This paper describes a noun-verb event-frame (NVEF) word identifier that can be used to solve these problems effectively.",
        "Our approach includes (a) an NVEF word-pair identifier and (b) other word identifiers for the non-NVEF portion.",
        "Our experiment showed that the NVEF word-pair identifier is able to achieve a 99.66% STW accuracy for the NVEF related portion, and by combining with other identifiers for the non-NVEF portion, the overall STW accuracy is 96.50%.",
        "The result of this study indicates that the NVEF knowledge is very powerful for the STW conversion.",
        "In fact, numerous cases requiring disambiguation in natural language processing fall into such “chicken-and-egg” situation.",
        "The NVEF knowledge can be employed as a general tool in such systems for disambiguating the NVEF related portion independently (thus breaking the chicken-and-egg situation) and using that as a good fundamental basis to treat the remaining portion.",
        "This shows that the NVEF knowledge is likely to be important for general NLP.",
        "To further expand its coverage, we shall extend the study of NVEF to that of other co-occurrence restrictions such as noun-noun pairs, noun-adjective pairs and verb-adverb pairs.",
        "We believe the STW accuracy can be further improved with the additional knowledge."

        "More than 100 Chinese input methods have been created in the past [1-6].",
        "Currently, the most popular input method is based on phonetic symbols.",
        "Phonetic input method requires little training because Chinese are taught to write the corresponding pinyin syllable of each Chinese character in primary school.",
        "Since there are more than 13,000 distinct Chinese characters (with around 5400 commonly-used), but only 1,300 distinct syllables, the homonym problem is quite severe in phonetic input method.",
        "Therefore, an intelligent syllable-to-word (STW) conversion for Chinese is very important.",
        "A comparable (but easier) problem to the STW conversion in English is the word-sense disambiguation.",
        "There are basically two approaches for the STW conversion: (a) the linguistic approach based on syntax parsing or semantic template matching [3,4,7,8] and (b) the statistical approach based on the n gram model where n is usually 2 or 3 [9-12].",
        "The linguistic approach is more laborious but the end result can be more user friendly.",
        "On the other hand, the statistical approach is less labor intensive, but its power is dependent on training corpus and it usually does not provide deep semantic information.",
        "Our approach adopts the semantically oriented NVEF word-pairs (to be defined formally in Section 2.1) plus other statistical methods so that not only the result makes sense semantically, but the model is also fully automatic provided that enough NVEFs have already been collected.",
        "According to the studies in [13], good syllable sequence segmentation is crucial for the STW conversion.",
        "For example, consider the syllable sequence “zhe4 liang4 che1 xing2 shi3 shun4 chang4\" of the Chinese sentence \" A permissible NV word-pair such as \" matches an NVEF subclass sense-pair in the KR-tree, then this permissible NVEF sense-pairs and their corresponding NVEF word-pairs can be used for the sentence.",
        "Resolve conflicts using the LS-NVWF strategy.",
        "Step 4.",
        "Arrange all remaining permissible NVEF sense-pairs and their corresponding NVEF word-pairs in a sentence-NVEF tree.",
        "If no NVEF word-pair can be identified from the input sequence, a null sentence-NVEF tree will be produced.",
        "A system overview of the NVEF word-pair identifier is given in Fig. 2.",
        "The output of this NVEF word-pair identifier is called a sentence-NVEF tree, as shown in Fig. 3."
