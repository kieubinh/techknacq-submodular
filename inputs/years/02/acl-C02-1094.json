        "Normal spoken language is not delivered in an uninterrupted monotone; prosodic cues such as pauses or boundary tones greatly help the listener to understand an utterance.",
        "Most text-to-speech systems use statistical models to find the appropriate locations for prosodic phrase breaks.",
        "In this work we use insights gained from the linguistics literature to develop a computational model which assigns prosodic structure to unrestricted text.",
        "We start by briefly reviewing the relationship between syntactic and prosodic structure.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of the right-branching syntactic structure that is standardly assigned to English sentences.",
        "Figure 2 shows a much flatter tree which corresponds to widely accepted views of the same sentences prosodic structure.",
        "According to the latter, the Utterance level is partitioned into intonational (I-) phrases,1 which in turn are partitioned into phonological ( -) phrases.",
        "(We ignore lower levels of representation such as prosodic words and syllables for the purposes of this paper.)",
        "In their investigation of the syntax-prosody mapping, Nespor and Vogel (1986) define phrases as consisting of a lexical head (e.g., a verb, noun or adjective) together with all the material on its non recursive side up until the next head.2 In the ex-1Intonational phrases are phonologically defined as units which are associated with a characteristic intonational contour; in particular, an I-phrase is marked by the presence of a major pitch accent.",
        "The boundary of an I-phrase is canonically manifested as a perceptible pause, accompanied by a local fall or rise in F (fundamental frequency); it can also be marked by constituent-final syllable lengthening, and stronger articulation of constituent-initial consonants.",
        "2Here, nonrecursive is intended to cover modifiers and de-ample of Figures 1 and 2 tease, little, girl, like, big and dogs are lexical heads.",
        "These headsbarring the adjectivesare bundled with the material to their left.",
        "The adjectives are included in the same phrases as the nouns they modify because they are still inside the maximal projection (NP) of the nouns.",
        "The level of phrases can fairly easily be derived from syntax.",
        "However, the same is not true of I-phrases.",
        "According to the strict layer hypothesis (Selkirk, 1984), an intonational phrase must consist of complete -phrases.",
        "But syntax does not determine how many phrases go to make up an I phrase.",
        "To illustrate this point, consider (1), discussed by Gee and Grosjean (1983), where is used to indicate I-phrase boundaries.",
        "Both phrasings are acceptable.",
        "(1) By making his plan known he brought out the objections of everyone.",
        "(2) By making his plan known he brought out the objections of everyone.",
        "Nevertheless, the structure provides a strong constraint on the location of breaks between I-phrases, since an I-phrase can never interrupt a -phrase.",
        "Although structure has been used by others to assign prosodic structure algorithmically (Gee and Grosjean, 1983; Bachenko and Fitzpatrick, 1990), there is no generally accepted method for bundling phrases into I-phrases.",
        "The main consensus is that I-phrases have a more or less uniform average length\" (Nespor and Vogel, 1986, p.194).",
        "In a similar vein, Gee and Grosjean (1983) observe that utterances tend to be split into two or three I-phrases of roughly equal length.",
        "Gee and Grosjean (1983) (and subsequently, Bachenko and Fitzpatrick (1990)) construct I phrases by comparing the length of the prosodic constituents on both the left-hand side and the right hand side of the utterances main verb (or the - phrase containing the verb), and grouping the verb with the shorter neighbouring constituent.",
        "They give little consideration to the grouping of constituents which are not adjacent to the verb.",
        "This limitation in their model seems innocuous when dealing with the rather artificially well-behaved set of sentences in their sample.",
        "(This 14 sentence terminers as opposed to complements.",
        "It is also required that the next head referred to in the definition be outside the maximal projection of the head which forms the basis of the - phrase.",
        "corpus, also used by Bachenko and Fitzpatrick, only contains sentences of 1113 words in length and does not scale up to unrestricted text).",
        "However, to be useful in a realistic TTS system our model should robustly run with unrestricted text and not rely like Bachenko and Fitzpatricks model on a correct parser output.",
        "Consequently, we need to adopt a different strategy."

        "When speakers talk faster they use fewer breaks per utterance, and when they talk more slowly they use more breaks (Trouvain and Grice, 1999).",

        "Intuitively, the algorithm was often able to predict acceptable break patterns for various threshold parameters.",
        "The variation in threshold seemed to reflect what speakers would do when varying their speech rate.",
        "In order to capture this effect in a more formal way we tried to evaluate the algorithm on a corpus which was recorded at three different speech rates (Trouvain and Grice, 1999).",
        "Three speakers (CZ, PS and AT) read a German text of 108 words 3 times slowly, 3 times at a normal rate, and 3 times at a fast rate.",
        "Trouvain and Grice show that reducing/increasing breaks is not the only prosodic correlate of changing speech rate; for example, speakers also reduce phone durations or pause durations.",
        "The extent to which increasing/decreasing the number of breaks correlates with speech rate varies both within and across speakers.",
        "One of the speakers, for instance, uses 23 breaks in her first slow version, 28 in her second slow version, and 26 in her third slow version.",
        "On average this was definitely more than she used in her normal versions (20, 20 and 24 respectively).",
        "To test our algorithm we only used the slow version with the largest number of breaks, the fast version with the smallest number of breaks, and one of the normal versions which was closest to the average of the normal versions.",
        "We did this for each speaker.",
        "We expected to see an effect of the slower version being better modelled by low threshold parameters, and the fast versions by higher parameters.",
        "It turned out, however, that the slow versions produced much lower recall/precision values compared to the faster versions.",
        "This was due to the fact the when they produced their slow versions, the speakers tended to insert breaks at positions which do not correspond to our phrase boundaries, such as immediately after sentence-initial temporal adverbial phrases (which are not marked by commas in German).",
        "We would have needed a tagger which distinguishes adverbials of time from other adverbials to account for this.",
        "Moreover, further changes in the rules for the restructuring of chunks might have been appropriate, such as preventing breaks before any phrase-final verb chunks up to a certain length.",
        "This expedient needs to be approached carefully, however, since when we are trying to model such a small corpus, there is a danger of overfitting the rule set in a way which fails to generalize properly to more extensive corpora.",
        "For the time being, we decided to manually carry out the first step of the algorithm, namely the assignment of -phrases, in order to test whether the heuristics are useful for modelling different speech rates.",
        "We assigned a final phrase boundary to all those structural locations where we could find a phrase break in more than one of our 27 spoken versions of the text.",
        "This resulted in a structure which could in theory be found automatically if the necessary information was available (e.g. explicitly annotating adverbs of time).",
        "Running the heuristics on this structure did indeed show some potential for imitating various speech rates.",
        "Table 4 shows recall/precision pairs for running the algorithm with the range of possible threshold values on a slow, normal and fast version by speaker CZ.",
        "The grey shading in the table shows the best values, i.e. where recall is greater than 90.0% and precision is greater than 80.0.%7 It does indeed appear that higher thresholds lead to a better model of fast speech rates, and lower thresholds are more appropriate for slow speech rates.",
        "The",
        "tables for the other two speakers (Table 5 and Table 6) show the same tendency.",
        "They also reflect the tendency of those two speakers to use the strategy of varying the number of breaks to a lesser extent than CZ when speeding up (cf. Trouvain and Grice (1999))."
