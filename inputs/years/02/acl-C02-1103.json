        "The goal of text categorization is to classify documents into a certain number of predefined categories.",
        "Text categorization is an active research area in information retrieval and machine learning.",
        "A wide range of supervised learning algorithms has been applied to this problem using a training data set of categorized documents.",
        "For examples, there are the Naïve Bayes (McCallum et al., 1998; Ko et al., 2000), Rocchio (Lewis et al., 1996), Nearest Neighbor (Yang et al., 2002), and Support Vector Machines (Joachims, 1998).",
        "A text categorization task consists of a training phase and a text classification phase.",
        "The former includes the feature extraction process and the indexing process.",
        "The vector space model has been used as the conventional method for text representation (Salton et al., 1983).",
        "This model represents a document as a vector of features using Term Frequency (TF) and Inverted Document Frequency (IDF).",
        "This model simply counts TF without considering where the term occurs.",
        "But each sentence in a document has different importance for identifying the content of the document.",
        "Thus, by assigning a different weight according to the importance of the sentence to each term, we can achieve better results.",
        "For this problem, several techniques have been studied.",
        "First, term weights were differently weighted by the location of a term, so that the structural information of a document was applied to term weights (Murata et al., 2000).",
        "But this method supposes that only several sentences, which are located at the front or the rear of a document, have the important meaning.",
        "Hence it can be applied to only documents with fixed form such as articles.",
        "The next technique used the title of a document in order to choose the important terms (Mock et al., 1996).",
        "The terms in the title were handled importantly.",
        "But a drawback of this method is that some titles, which do not contain well the meaning of the document, can rather increase the ambiguity of the meaning.",
        "This case often comes out in documents with a informal style such as Newsgroup and Email.",
        "To overcome these problems, we have studied text summarization techniques with great interest.",
        "Among text summarization techniques, there are statistical methods and linguistic methods (Radev et al., 2000; Marcu et al., 1999).",
        "Since the former methods are simpler and faster than the latter methods, we use the former methods to be applied to text categorization.",
        "Therefore, we employ two kinds of text summarization techniques; one measures the importance of sentences by the similarity between the title and each sentence in a document, and the other by the importance of terms in each sentence.",
        "In this paper, we use two kinds of text summarization techniques for classifying important sentences and unimportant sentences.",
        "The importance of each sentence is measured by these techniques.",
        "Then term weights in each sentence are modified in proportion to the calculated sentence importance.",
        "To test our proposed method, we used two different newsgroup data sets; one is a well known data set, the Newsgroup data set by Ken Lang, and the other was gathered from Korean UseNet discussion group.",
        "As a result, our proposed method showed the better performance than basis system in both data sets.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 1 explains the proposed text categorization system in detail.",
        "In section 2, we discuss the empirical results in our experiments.",
        "Section 3 is devoted to the analysis of our method.",

        "In the next method, we first measure the importance of terms by TF, IDF, and χ2 statistic values.",
        "Then we assign the higher importance to the sentence with more important terms.",
        "Finally, the importance of a sentence is calculated by combination of two methods.",
        "Generally, we believe that a title summarizes the important content of a document (Endres-Niggemeyer et al., 1998).",
        "By Mock (1996), terms occurred in the title have higher weights.",
        "But the effectiveness of this method depends on the quality of the title.",
        "In many cases, the titles",
        "of documents from Newsgroup or Email do not represent the contents of these documents well.",
        "Hence we use the similarity between each sentence and the title instead of directly using terms in the title.",
        "The similar sentences to the title contain important terms generally.",
        "For example, “I have a question.” This title does not contain any meaning about the contents of a document.",
        "Nevertheless, sentences with the term, ‘question’, must be handled importantly because they can have key terms about the question.",
        "We measure the similarity between the title and each sentence, and then we assign the higher importance to the sentences with the higher similarity.",
        "The title and each sentence of a document are represented as the vectors of content words.",
        "The similarity value of them is calculated by the inner product and the calculated values are normalized into values between 0 and 1 by a maximum value.",
        "The similarity value between title T and sentence Si in a document d is calculated by the following formula:",
        "where Tr denotes a vector of the title, and Si denotes a vector of a sentence.",
        "Since the method by the title still depends on the quality of the title, it can be useless in the document with a meaningless title or no title.",
        "Besides, the sentences, which do not contain important terms, need not be handled importantly although they are similar to the title.",
        "On the contrary, sentences with important terms must be handled importantly although they are dissimilar to the title.",
        "In consideration to these points, we first measure the importance values of terms by TF, IDF, and χ2 statistic value, and then the sum of the importance values of terms in each sentence is assigned to the importance value of the sentence.",
        "Here, since the χ2 statistic value of a term presents information of the term for document classification, it is added to our method unlike the conventional TF-IDF.",
        "In this method, the importance value of a sentence Si in a document dis calculated as follows:",
        "where tf(t) denotes term frequency of term t, idf(t) denotes inverted document frequency, and χ2(t) denotes χ2 statistic value.",
        "Two kinds of sentence importance are simply combined by the following formula:",
        "In formula (3), k1 and k2 are constant weights, which control the rates of reflecting two importance values.",
        "The importance value of a sentence by formula (3) is used for modifying TF value of a term.",
        "That is, since a TF value of a term in a document is calculated by the sum of the TF values of terms in each sentence, the modified TF value (WTF(d,t)) of the term t in the document d �is calculated by formula (4).",
        "where tf(Si,t) denotes TF of the term t in sentence Si.",
        "By formula (4), the terms, which occurr in a sentence with the higher importance value, have higher weights than the original TF value.",
        "In our proposed method, we compute the weight vectors for each document using the WTF and the conventional TF-IDF scheme (Salton et al., 1988).",
        "The weight of a term t in a document d is calculated as follows:",
        "where N is the number of documents in the training set, T is the number of features limited by feature selection, and nt is the number of training documents in which t occurs.",
        "The weight by formula (5) is used in k-NN, Rocchio, and SVM.",
