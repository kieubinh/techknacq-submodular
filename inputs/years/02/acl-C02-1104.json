        "Some NLP applications make use of shallow parsing techniques (typically the ones treating large data), some others rely on deep analysis (e.g. machine translation).",
        "The respective techniques are quite different: the former usually relies on stochastic methods where the later uses symbolic ones.",
        "However, this can constitute a problem for applications relying on shallow parsing techniques and needing in some occasions deep analysis.",
        "This is typically the case for text-to-speech systems.",
        "Such applications usually rely on shallow parsers in order to calculate intonative groups on the basis of syntactic units (or more precisely on chunks).",
        "But in some cases, such a superficial syntactic information is not precise enough.",
        "One solution would then consist in using a deep analysis for some constructions.",
        "No system exists implementing such an approach.",
        "This is in particular due to the fact that this would require two different treatments, the second one redoing the entire job.",
        "More precisely, it is difficult to imagine in the generative framework how to implement a parsing technique capable of calculating chunks and, in some cases, phrases with a possible embedded organization.",
        "We present in this paper a formalism relying on constraints that constitutes a possible answer to this problem.",
        "This approach allows the use of a same linguistic resource (i.e. a unique grammar) that can be used fully or partially by the parser.",
        "This approach relies on the fact that (1) all linguistic information is represented by means of constraints and (2) the constraints are of regular types.",
        "The idea consists then in implementing a technique that can make use of some constraints in the case of shallow parsing, and the entire set of them for deep analysis.",
        "In our formalism, constraints are organized into different types.",
        "Tuning the granularity of the parse consists then in selecting the types of constraints to be verified.",
        "In the first part of this paper, we present the property grammar formalism, its main advantages both in terms of representation and implementation.",
        "In the second part, we describe the parsing technique and the different approaches used for shallow and deep parsing.",
        "We address in particular in this section some complexity aspects illustrating the properties of the parsing techniques and we propose an evaluation over a corpus.",
        "In the third part, we illustrate the respective characteristics of the different approaches in describing for the same example the consequences of tuning the parse granularity.",
        "We conclude in presenting some perspectives for such a technique."

        "The notion of constraints is of deep importance in linguistics, see for example Maruyama (1990), Pollard (1994), Sag (1999).",
        "Recent theories (from the constraint-based paradigm to the principle and parameters one) rely on this notion.",
        "One of the main interests in using constraints comes from the fact that it becomes possible to represent any kind of information (very general as well as local or contextual one) by means of a unique device.",
        "We present in this section a formalism, called Property Grammars, described in Bès (1999) or Blache (2001), that makes it possible to conceive and represent all linguistic information in terms of constraints over linguistic objects.",
        "In this approach, constraints are seen as relations between two (or more) objects: it is then possible to represent information in a flat manner.",
        "The first step in this work consists in identifying the relations usually used in syntax.",
        "This can be done empirically and we suggest, adapting a proposal from Bès (1999), the set of following constraints: linearity, dependency, obligation, exclusion, requirement and uniqueness.",
        "In a phrase-structure perspective all these constraints participate to the description of a phrase.",
        "The following figure roughly sketches their respective roles, illustrated with some examples for the NP.",
        "In this approach, describing a phrase consists in specifying a set of constraints over some categories that can constitute it.",
        "A constraint is specified as follows.",
        "Let R a symbol representing a constraint relation between two (sets of) categories.",
        "A constraint of the form a R b stipulates that if a and b are realized, then the constraint a R b must be satisfied.",
        "The set of constraints describing a phrase can be represented as a graph connecting several categories.",
        "The following example illustrates some constraints for the NP.",
        "In this description, one can notice for example a requirement relation between the common noun and the determiner (such a constraint implements the complementation relation) or some exclusion that indicate cooccurrency restriction between a noun and a pronoun or a proper noun and a determiner.",
        "One can notice the use of sub-typing: as it is usually the case in linguistic theories, a category has several properties that can be inherited when the description of the category is refined (in our example, the type noun has two sub-types, proper and common represented in feature based notation).",
        "All constraints involving a noun also hold for its subtypes.",
        "Finally, the dependency relation, which is a semantic one, indicates that the dependent must combine its semantic features with the governor.",
        "In the same way as HPSG does now with the DEPS feature as described in Bouma (2001), this relation concerns any category, not necessarily the governed ones.",
        "In this way, the difference between a complement and an adjunct is that only the complement is selected by a requirement constraint, both of them being constrained with a dependency relation.",
        "This also means that a difference can be done between the syntactic head (indicated by the oblig constraint) and the semantic one (the governor of the dependency relation), even if in most of the cases, these categories are the same.",
        "Moreover, one can imagine the specification of dependencies within a phrase between two categories other than the head.",
        "One of the main advantages in this approach is that constraints form a system and all constraints are at the same level.",
        "At the difference of other approaches as Optimality Theory, presented in Prince (1993), there exists no hierarchy between them and one can choose, according to the needs, to verify the entire set of constraints or a subpart of it.",
        "In this perspective, using a constraint satisfaction technique as basis for the parsing strategy makes it possible to implement the possibility of verifying only a subpart of this constraint system.",
        "What is interesting is that some constraints like linearity provide indications in terms of boundaries, as described for example in Blache (1990).",
        "It follows that verifying this subset of constraints can constitute a bracketing technique.",
        "The verification of more constraints in addition to linearity allows to refine the parse.",
        "In the end, the same parsing technique (constraint satisfaction) can be used both for shallow and deep parsing.",
        "More precisely, using the same linguistic resources (lexicon and grammar), we propose a technique allowing to choose the granularity of the parse."
