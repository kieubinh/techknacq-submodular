        "The roles and functions of proteins are important study objects in many areas of the life sciences, as well as in the pharmaceutical industry.",
        "In view of the vast amount of scientific text produced in these areas, it is important to develop tools and methods for automatic structuring and extraction of the information found therein.",
        "The detection and categorization of named entities, such as names of people, organisations and places, in classical MUC-style information extraction tasks, e.g., (Borthwick et al., 1998) might be regarded a solved problem.",
        "But names of proteins present a different challenge because of their variant structural characteristics, their resemblance to regular noun phrases and their oftentimes unclear position on the continuum between proper names and terminology.",
        "They share these characteristics with other biological substances and probably with many other kinds of named terminology as well.",
        "One common reason for developing methods for automatic detection of protein names in text has been the desire to build systems for automatic extraction of interactions between proteins, e.g., (Blaschke et al., 1999; Thomas et al., 2000).",
        "However, the detection of protein names is useful in itself.",
        "In our case, the first application at hand is a browsing support system, which links protein names in scientific text to entries in SWISS-PROT (Bairoch and Apweiler, 2000), which is an annotated protein sequence database.",
        "Previous attempts at identifying protein names in text can be divided into systems using machine learning techniques, e.g., (Nobata et al., 1999; Collier et al., 2000), and systems based on handwritten rules, e.g., (Fukuda et al., 1998; Humphreys et al., 2000).",
        "The advantage of using machine learning techniques is that such a system is relatively easy to tune to new domains, provided that tagged training data exists.",
        "A rule based system, on the other hand, requires a lot of human analysis and labor, but results in a transparent system which is easier to support, adjust and expand.",
        "In Yapex, we utilise an off-the-shelf syntactic parser to improve the performance of a rule-based system.",
        "Work on evaluation of protein name taggers seldom clearly specify what notion of correctness has been used when evaluating the systems, with the exception of de Bruijn and Martin (2000), who present figures on undertagging and overtagging, as well as type and token matches.",
        "Correspondingly, the definition of what should be regarded a protein name is often implicit.",
        "2 Protein Names Despite the lack of common standards and fixed nomenclatures, protein names exhibit several regularities that can be exploited in order to identify previously unseen instances.",
        "Primarily, protein names are almost always descriptive in some way.",
        "Protein characteristics such as function (e.g. growth hormone), localization or cellular origin (such as HIV-1 envelope gly-coprotein gp120), physical properties (salivary acidic protein-1), similarities to other proteins (Rho-like protein) are commonly reflected in the name.",
        "Names are also constructed using a combination or abbreviation of the above.",
        "As can be noted from the examples, protein names often consist of multiple words.",
        "It needs to be said that the definition of what should be considered a protein name is not self-evident and that it can be varied to a certain extent.",
        "In this study, we define a protein name semantically as something that denotes a single biological entity composed of one or more amino acid chains.",
        "Protein fragments or protein families are not included in this definition.",
        "In addition to the semantic definition above, from a text structural point of view, we define a protein name as a sequence of words denoting a specific, individual protein entity.",
        "Furthermore, we also include some, more indirect, references to individual protein entities into the protein name definition, (e.g. <prot>importin betal</prot> derivatives).",
        "The definition excludes non-specific reference to individuals (transcription factor, a 89 kD protein).",
        "It also excludes most reference to groups or classes of proteins (protein kinases, globulins), though phrases denoting small groups of nearly identical proteins are included (eukary-otic RhoA-binding kinases).",
        "Finally, the definition of a protein name excludes anaphoric references to proteins (this protein)."

        "Both taggers appear to be stable in the sense that each tagger exhibits similar figures for both precision and recall in any given row in Table 1, with one exception the difference between recall and precision for KeX under the PNP notion.",
        "This, in combination with the results under the SLOPPY condition, suggests that KeX's matches are too long; KeX's high recall and precision under SLOPPY tells us that KeX's suggestions are located close to the correct ones without to many false suggestions entirely outside.",
        "Still, KeX gives a lot of false suggestions when it comes to protein name parts.",
        "Visualizing the F-scores for the full corpus evaluation in Figure 1, it is clear that both a STRICT and a PNP definition of a match favours the Yapex system.",
        "The result under the PNP condition clearly shows that the overlap between the proposed hits and the corresponding answer keys is remarkably higher for Yapex than for KeX, i.e., Yapex will find more of the protein name parts.",
        "We believe that this is due to the ability of the FDG parser to analyse noun phrases well, and thereby predict the boundaries of protein names.",
        "When looking at the result under the STRICT condition, the impression remains the same, suggesting that Yapex is much better at finding the exact edges of the protein names.",
        "This is also shown by the result under the LEFT, RIGHT, and LEFT OR RIGHT conditions in Table 1.",

        "To problematize the metrics of recall and precision, we have choosen to evaluate along several notions of correctness.",
        "What is relevant to annotate varies with the intended application, and different methods of evaluation can highlight characteristics of competing systems.",
        "PNP is a relevant measure for this kind of named terminology where even human domain experts argue about the boundaries of names, since it gives an idea of how much of the multi-word proteins the systems match.",
        "We believe that by equipping Yapex with capabilities of elaborate syntactic analysis, it performs better in recognising protein names with respect to boundaries as well as content, than a system like KeX that does not explicitly exploit syntax.",
        "There is nothing surprising about a syntatic parser being able to aid in the detection of protein names; names cannot be found anywhere but in noun phrases.",
        "Given a perfect parser that identifies minimal noun phrases, the problem would be reduced to deciding if the noun phrase is a protein name or not.",
        "It should be noted though, that we use the FDG parser without modification; it has not been trained to handle this quite specific subdomain of text.",
        "Our technique of boosting the identification of protein names by using the Local Dynamic Dictionary finds noun phrases that were not correctly analysed as such by the parser.",
        "What notion of correctness to actually choose to describe the performance of a protein name tagger depends on the setting in which it will be used; in our case, the tagger will be used in a browsing aid, connecting protein names in MEDLINE abstracts with the SWISS-PROT database.",
        "Since the query to SWISS-PROT can be made in a way that does not require all parts of the tagged protein name to be present in a SWISS-PROT entry to yield a match, it is not crucial that the tagger achieves perfect matches of the protein names.",
        "Thus, in our case, a figure obtained with the SLOPPY notion may suffice to describe the performance of the tagger.",
        "In an information extraction setting where the goal is to automatically build a high quality database, it would be more important to find the exact boundaries of the protein names, hence, such an application would benefit from a description along the STRICT or BOUNDARY notions.",
        "It is hard to compare two systems like Yapex and KeX and still maintain a balanced record of result there is always a risk that the test data is biased towards one of the systems.",
        "In this particular case, the domain experts that annotated the test corpus were also involved in discussing the development of Yapex, thus the annotators' definition of what constitutes a protein name is likely to favour Yapex over KeX.",
        "It is possible, e.g., that KeX's low performance under the STRICT, and especially the RIGHT condition is due to a target definition that includes parts of proteins, such as protein sites and domains.",
        "Solving problems like this calls for researchers performing similar studys in the field to clearly state their definitions of what is considered relevant for solving a particular task.",
        "Ideally, the research community should strive for shared and open resources.",

        "The LEFT OR RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT and STRICT notions are suitable for describing a system's behaviour in a setting such as information extraction, where it is crucial that the terms searched for are exactly matched in their entirety.",
        "The SLOPPY notion describes a system's ability to find at least some part of the target, and it is sufficient only when the output from the system at hand is to be used in a setting where perfect matches are not crucial.",
        "A combination of the SLOPPY notion and the BOUNDARY one (as in Figure 2) is good for illustrating how well a system is able to delimit a match once it has got a hold of one of the parts of the term searched for.",
        "Presenting results using PNP is suitable for highlighting the system's ability to cover multi-word names.",
        "By using these new notions of correctness PNP, STRICT and the variants of BOUNDARY in addition to the commonly used SLOPPY notion, we have illustrated that it is possible to shed light on different aspects of the performance of protein name taggers.",
        "Taking into consideration the nature of protein names as such, i.e., the way they are constructed and behave, lead us to believe that the notions are suitable also for other kinds of named terminology."
