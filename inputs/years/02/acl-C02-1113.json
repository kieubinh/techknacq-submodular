        "Text adventures are computer games with which the player interacts via a natural language dialogue.",
        "Texts describe the game world and how it evolves, and the player can manipulate objects in this game world by typing in commands; Fig. 1 shows a sample interaction.",
        "Text adventures were very popular and commercially successful in the eighties, but have gone out of fashion since then – mostly because the parsers were rather limited and forced the user into very restricted forms of interaction.",
        "We describe an engine for text adventures that attempts to overcome these limitations by using current methods from computational linguistics for processing the natural language input and output, and a state-of-the-art inference system based on description logic (DL) to represent the dynamic state of the game world and what the player knows about it.",
        "The DL prover is used in all language-processing modules except for parsing and surface realization, and supports the inferences we need very well.",
        "This shows in particular in the modules for the resolution and generation of referring expressions.",
        "By keeping track of the true state of the world and the player’s knowledge in separate knowledge bases, we can evaluate definite descriptions with respect to what the player knows.",
        "In generation, such inferences allow us to produce smaller while still sufficiently informative references.",
        "Another interesting aspect which we discuss in this paper is the treatment of syntactic and referential ambiguities that come up in understanding input sentences.",
        "Here, too, the player knowledge restricts the way in which the input should be interpreted and guides the resolution process.",
        "We use inferences about the player knowledge to rule out inconsistent analyses and pragmatic heuristics to possibly select the preferred one.",
        "Players of a text adventure are effectively situated in a game world and have to accomplish a specific task, which severely restricts the utterances they will naturally produce.",
        "For example, they will typically only refer to objects they could “see” in the simulated world.",
        "This simplifies the language processing tasks tremendously.",
        "The scenario of the game can be freely specified and tailored to different applications and levels of complexity.",
        "Along with the modularity of our implementation, this makes our system an interesting testbed for evaluating more sophisticated NLP modules, which also have access to the inference infrastructure.",
        "The same reason makes it useful as a teaching tool; in fact, our implementation was created as an advanced project for students.",
        "Plan of the paper.",
        "We will start with an overview over the architecture of our system in Section 2.",
        "Section 3 will give a brief introduction to description logics, and then describes the knowledge bases we use.",

        "Section 5 deals with the resolution of ambiguities in the player input.",

        "Among the most common are consistency checking, subsumption checking, and instance and relation checking.",
        "Consistency checks decide whether a combination of T-Box and A-Box can be satisfied by some model, subsumption is to decide of two concepts whether all individuals that belong to one concept must necessarily belong to another, and instance and relation checking test whether an individual belongs to a certain concept and whether a certain relation holds between a pair of individuals, respectively.",
        "In addition to these basic reasoning tasks, description logic systems usually also provide some retrieval functionality which e.g. allows to compute all concepts that a given individual belongs to or all individuals that belong to a given concept.",

        "The result is a system which exceeds traditional text adventures by far in the flexibility offered to the user.",
        "Unlike the input, the output that our game generates is far away from the quality of the commercial text adventures of the eighties, which produced canned texts, sometimes written by professional book authors.",
        "A possible solution could be to combine the full generation with a template based approach, to which the TAG-based generation approach we take lends itself well.",
        "Another problem is the generation of error messages asking the user to resolve an ambiguous input.",
        "The game should ideally generate and present the player with a choice of possible (unambiguous) readings.",
        "So, the generation strategy would have to be augmented with some kind of monitoring, such as the one proposed by Neumann and van Noord (1994).",
        "Finally, we want to come up with a way of synchronizing the grammars for parsing and generation, in order to ensure that expressions used by the game can always be used by the player as well.",
        "The system is designed in a way that should make it reasonably easy to replace our simple modules by more sophisticated ones.",
        "We will shortly make our adventure engine available over the web, and want to invite colleagues and students to test their own language processing modules within our system.",
        "Generally, we believe that the prototype can serve as a starting point for an almost unlimited range of extensions."
