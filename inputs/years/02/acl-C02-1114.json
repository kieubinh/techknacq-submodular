        "Semantic knowledge for particular domains is increasingly important in NLP.",
        "Many applications such as Word-Sense Disambiguation, Information Extraction and Speech Recognition all require lexicons.",
        "The coverage of hand-built lexical resources such as WordNet (Fell-baum, 1998) has increased dramatically in recent years, but leaves several problems and challenges.",
        "Coverage is poor in many critical, rapidly changing domains such as current affairs, medicine and technology, where much time is still spent by human experts employed to recognise and classify new terms.",
        "Most languages remain poorly covered in comparison with English.",
        "Hand-built lexical resources which cannot be automatically updated can often be simply misleading.",
        "For example, using WordNet to recognise that the word apple refers to a fruit or a tree is a grave error in the many situations where this word refers to a computer manufacturer, a sense which WordNet does not cover.",
        "For NLP to reach a wider class of applications in practice, the ability to assemble and update appropriate semantic knowledge automatically will be vital.",
        "This paper describes a method for arranging semantic information into a graph (Bollob´as, 1998), where the nodes are words and the edges (also called links) represent relationships between words.",
        "The paper is arranged as follows.",
        "Section 2 reviews previous work on semantic similarity and lexical acquisition.",
        "Section 3 describes how the graph model was built from the PoS-tagged British National Corpus.",
        "Section 4 describes a new incremental algorithm used to build categories of words step by step from the graph model.",
        "Section 5 demonstrates this algorithm in action and evaluates the results against WordNet classes, obtaining state-of-the-art results.",
        "Section 6 describes how the graph model can be used to recognise when words are poly-semous and to obtain groups of words representative of the different senses."

        "Most work on automatic lexical acquisition has been based at some point on the notion of semantic similarity.",
        "The underlying claim is that words which are semantically similar occur with similar distributions and in similar contexts (Miller and Charles, 1991).",
        "The main results to date in the field of automatic lexical acquisition are concerned with extracting lists of words reckoned to belong together in a particular category, such as vehicles or weapons (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997) (Roark and Charniak, 1998).",
        "Roark and Charniak describe a “generic algorithm” for extracting such lists of similar words using the notion of semantic similarity, as follows (Roark and Charniak, 1998, §1).",
        "1.",
        "For a given category, choose a small set of exemplars (or ‘seed words’) 2.",
        "Count co-occurrence of words and seed words within a corpus 3.",
        "Use a figure of merit based upon these counts to select new seed words 4.",
        "Return to step 2 and iterate n times 5.",
        "Use a figure of merit to rank words for category membership and output a ranked list",
        "Algorithms of this type were used by Riloff and Shepherd (1997) and Roark and Charniak (1998), reporting accuracies of 17% and 35% respectively.",
        "Like the algorithm we present in Section 5, the similarity measure (or ‘figure of merit’) used in these cases was based on co-occurrence in lists.",
        "Both of these works evaluated their results by asking humans to judge whether items generated were appropriate members of the categories sought.",
        "Riloff and Shepherd (1997) also give some credit for ‘related words’ (for example crash might be regarded as being related to the category vehicles).",
        "One problem with these techniques is the danger of ‘infections’ – once any incorrect or out-of-category word has been admitted, the neighbours of this word are also likely to be admitted.",
        "In Section 4 we present an algorithm which goes some way towards reducing such infections.",
        "The early results have been improved upon by Riloff and Jones (1999), where a ‘mutual bootstrapping’ approach is used to extract words in particular semantic categories and expression patterns for recognising relationships between these words for the purposes of information extraction.",
        "The accuracy achieved in this experiment is sometimes as high as 78% and is therefore comparable to the results reported in this paper.",
        "Another way to obtain word-senses directly from corpora is to use clustering algorithms on feature-vectors (Lin, 1998; Sch¨utze, 1998).",
        "Clustering techniques can also be used to discriminate between different senses of an ambiguous word.",
        "A general problem for such clustering techniques lies in the question of how many clusters one should have, i.e. how many senses are appropriate for a particular word in a given domain (Manning and Sch¨utze, 1999, Ch 14).",
        "Lin’s approach to this problem (Lin, 1998) is to build a ‘similarity tree’ (using what is in effect a hierarchical clustering method) of words related to a target word (in this case the word duty).",
        "Different senses of duty can be discerned as different sub-trees of this similarity tree.",
        "We present a new method for word-sense discrimination in Section 6."

        "In this section we describe how a graph – a collection of nodes and links – was built to represent the relationships between nouns.",
        "The model was built using the British National Corpus which is automatically tagged for parts of speech.",
        "Initially, grammatical relations between pairs of words were extracted.",
        "The relationships extracted were the following:",
        "• Noun (assumed to be subject) Verb • Verb Noun (assumed to be object) • Adjective Noun • Noun Noun (often the first noun is modifying the second) • Noun and/or Noun",
        "The last of these relationships often occurs when the pair of nouns is part of a list.",
        "Since lists are usually comprised of objects which are similar in some way, these relationships have been used to extract lists of nouns with similar properties (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997) (Roark and Charniak, 1998).",
        "In this paper we too focus on nouns co-occurring in lists.",
        "This is because the noun and/or noun relationship is the only symmetric relationship in our model, and symmetric relationships are much easier to manipulate than asymmetric ones.",
        "Our full graph contains many directed links between words of different parts of speech.",
        "Initial experiments with this model show considerable promise but are at too early a stage to be reported upon yet.",
        "Thus the graph used in most of this paper represents only nouns.",
        "Each node represents a noun and two nodes have a link between them if they co-occur separated by the conjunctions and or or, and each link is weighted according to the number of times the co-occurrence is observed.",
        "Various cutoff functions were used to determine how many times a relationship must be observed to be counted as a link in the graph.",
        "A well-behaved option was to take the top n neighbours of each word, where n could be determined by the user.",
        "In this way the link-weighting scheme was reduced to a link-ranking scheme.",
        "One consequence of this decision was that links to more common words were preferred over links to rarer words.",
        "This decision may have effectively boosted precision at the expense of recall, because the preferred links are to fairly common and (probably) more stable words.",
        "Research is need to reveal theoretically motivated or experimentally optimal techniques for selecting the importance to assign to each link – the choices made in this area so far are often of an ad hoc nature.",
        "The graph used in the experiments described has 99,454 nodes (nouns) and 587,475 links.",
        "There were roughly 400,000 different types tagged as nouns in the corpus, so the graph model represents about one quarter of these nouns, including most of the more common ones."

        "Here is the process we use to select and add the ‘most similar node’ to a set of nodes: Definition 1 Let A be a set of nodes and let N(A), the neighbours of A, be the nodes which are linked to any a ∈ A.",

        "The best new node b ∈ N(A) \\ A is the node which maximises this affinity score.",

        "However many times the string “Apple and Novell” occurs in the corpus, the novell node will not be added to this list because it doesn’t have a link to orange, banana or any of their neighbours except for apple.",

        "This method is easier to implement and less open to variation than human judgements.",
        "While WordNet or any other lexical resource is not a perfect arbiter, it is hoped that this experiment procedure is both reliable and repeatable.",
        "The ten classes of words chosen were crimes, places, tools, vehicles, musical instruments, clothes, diseases, body parts, academic subjects and foodstuffs.",
        "The classes were chosen before the experiment was carried out so that the results could not be massaged to only use those classes which gave good results.",
        "(The first 4 categories are also used by (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997) and (Roark and Charniak, 1998) and so were included for comparison.)",
        "Having chosen these classes, 20 words were retrieved using a single seed-word chosen from the class in question.",
        "This list of words clearly depends on the seed word chosen.",
        "While we have tried to optimise this choice, it depends on the corpus and the the model.",
        "The influence of semantic Prototype Theory (Rosch, 1988) is apparent in this process, a link we would like to investigate in more detail.",
        "It is possible to choose an optimal seed word for a particular category: it should be possible to compare these optimal seed words with the ‘prototypes’ suggested by psychological experiments (Mervis and Rosch, 1981)."

        "Since the algorithms used are in many ways very similar, this improvement demands explanation.",
        "Some of the difference in accuracy can be attributed to the corpora used.",
        "The experiments in (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997) were performed on the 500,000 word MUC-4 corpus, and those of (Roark and Charniak, 1998) were performed using MUC-4 and the Wall Street Journal corpus (some 30 million words).",

        "The high accuracy achieved thus questions the conclusion drawn by Roark and Charniak (1998) that ‘parsing is invaluable’.",
        "Our results clearly indicate that a large PoS-tagged corpus may be much better for automatic lexical acquisition than a small fully-parsed corpus.",
        "This claim could of course be tested by comparing techniques on the same corpus.",
        "To evaluate the advantage of using PoS information, we compared the graph model with a similarity thesaurus generated using Latent Semantic Indexing (Manning and Sch¨utze, 1999, Ch 15), a ‘bag-of-words’ approach, on the same corpus.",
        "The same number of nouns was retrieved for each class using the graph model and LSI.",
        "The LSI similarity thesaurus obtained an accuracy of 31%, much less than the graph model’s 82%.",
        "This is because LSI retrieves words which are related by context but are not in the same class: for example, the neighbours of piano found using LSI cosine-similarity on the BNC corpus include words such as composer, music, Bach, concerto and dance, which are related but certainly not in the same semantic class.",
