        "Also (Melcuk, 1988) assumes different levels of representation.",
        "A shortcoming of the syntactic level in (Melcuk, 1988) is, though, that his syntactic classes are dependent on the specific lexical item, and therefore problematic to define.",

        "(Davis, 1998) has recently proposed a linking theory in the formal framework of HPSG.",
        "He separates syntax and semantics by postulating thematic roles under the CONTENT feature of his HPSG architecture (Pollard and Sag, 1994), and syntactic characterizations of the arguments under CAT-EGORY|ARG-ST and CATEGORY |SUB CAT.",
        "He has separate hierarchies of syntactic patterns (intrans, trans, ditrans, 5:32) and semantic classes (subtypes of RELATION, 5:72).",
        "These hierarchies interact by a set of linking constraints and yield a hierarchy ofpredicators (5:41), which specifies possible linkings of thematic roles to syntactic arguments.",
        "While (Helbig, 1995) obviously employs a large role set, (Davis, 1998) has only 6 roles, and moves thematic roles further down into semantics than we assume by postulating them on an event level, which “effectively amounts to a limited amount of semantic decomposition” (5:39).",
        "The shortcoming of the model is that the syntactic patterns assumed are very sparse indeed with only three transitivity classes.",
        "Due to this, semantic predictions can be made only for NP-complements, while PPs must be treated by a separate mechanism (“content sharing account”).",
        "Thus, there is no specific prediction for the prepositional complement in English dative shift constructions.",
