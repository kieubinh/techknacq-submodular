        "Zipf’ s law states that the frequency of word tokens in a large corpus of natural language is inversely proportional to the rank.",

        "The law for single words is shown to be valid only for high frequency words.",
        "However, when single word and n-gram phrases are combined together in one list and put in order of frequency the combined list follows Zipf’ s law accurately for all words and phrases, down to the lowest frequencies in both languages.",

        "When log(f) is drawn against log(r) in a graph (which is often called a Zipf curve), a straight line is obtained with a slope of –1.",
        "An example with a small corpus of 250,000 tokens is given in Figure 1.",
        "Zipf’s discovery was followed by a large body of literature reviewed in a series of papers edited by Guiter and Arapov (1982).",
        "It continues to stimulate interest today (Samuelson, 1996; Montermurro, 2002; Ferrer and Solé, 2002) and, for example, it has been applied to citations Silagadze (1997) and to DNA sequences (Yonezawa & Motohasi, 1999; Li, 2001).",

        "It contains a vocabulary of 29,899 different word types associated with 260,430 word tokens.",
        "Following its discovery in 1949, several experiments aided by the appearance of the computer in the 1960’s, confirmed that the law was correct for the small corpora which could be processed at that time.",
        "The slope of the curve was found to vary slightly from –1 for some corpora; also the frequencies for the highest ranked words sometimes deviated slightly from the straight line, which suggested several modifications of the law, and in particular one due to Mandelbrot (1953):",
        "where and are constants for the corpus being analysed.",
        "However, generally the constants and were found to be only small statistical deviations from the original law by Zipf (exceptions are legal texts which have smaller values (0.9) showing that lawyers use more words than other people!",
        ")(Smith & Devine, 1985).",
        "A number of theoretical developments of Zipf’s law had been derived in the 50’s and 60’s and have been reviewed by Fedorowicz (1982), notably those due to Mandelbrot (1954, 1957) and Booth (1967).",
        "A well-known derivation, due to Simon (1955), is based on empirically derived distribution functions.",
        "However, Simon’s derivation was controversial and a correspondence in the scientific press developed between Mandelbrot and Simon on the validity of this derivation (1959-1961); the dispute was not resolved by the time Zipf curves for larger corpora were beginning to be computed.",
        "The processing of larger corpora with 1 million words or more was facilitated by the development of PC’s in the 1980’s.",
        "When Zipf curves for these corpora were drawn they were found to drop below the Zipf straight line with slope of –1 at the bottom of the curve, starting for rank greater than about 5000.",
        "This is illustrated in Figure 2 which shows the Zipf curve for the Brown corpus of 1 million words of American English (Francis & Kucera, 1964).",
        "This appeared to confirm the opinion of the opponents of Simon’s derivation: the law clearly did not hold for r>5000; so it appeared that the derivation must be invalid."
