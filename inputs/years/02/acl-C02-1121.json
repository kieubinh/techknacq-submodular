        "Furthermore, it has been shown that finite-state parsers can be used to extract predicate-argument structure at least for complement relations.",
        "Since arguments are typically expressed by NPs or PPs, identifying NPs and PPs is an important step in determining predicate-argument structure.",
        "In German, grammatical roles are not encoded in relative string positions but rather in case and number information on NPs and PPs.",
        "Thus, at least for German, identification of case and number is a prerequisite for the determination of predicate-argument structure, and the computation of agreement features needs to be explicitly addressed.",
        "Another characteristic of German is its commons usage of center-embedding in noun phrases.",
        "The combination of agreement checking and center embedding makes sure that, in contrast to English, determination of (full) noun chunks requires not one, but a cascade of finite-state automata.",
        "An iterative application of finite-state automata which all serve to match the same type of chunks leads to certain problems, since tokens may be mistakenly assigned to chunks at the lower levels even if they should be inserted only at a higher level.",
        "Explicit representation of ambiguities at the individual levels would jeopardize the complexity class.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 discusses a variety of definitions that have been pro-'In the test corpus used in the experiments (NEGRA, described below), as much as 6.3% of all maximal noun phrases show center-embedding.",
        "posed for noun chunks in the literature.",
        "Section 3 describes the system used to parse full noun chunks and discusses possible strategies.",
        "Section 4 presents and discusses the results of the experiments made to evaluate the different strategies and compares the performance of the present system with those described in the literature.",

        "A chunk is a substring of the sentence, and it has syntactic structure which comprises a connected subgraph of the sentence's parse tree.",
        "Every chunk is centered around a major head.",
        "A major head is a content word which does not appear between any function word f and the content word selected by f. Thus, in example (la) proud does not qualify as a major head while it does in example (lb).",

        "The root of a chunk is the highest node in the parse tree which has the chunk's major head as its semantic head.",

        "A chunk is a maximal string of words which consists of the chunk's major head and words that are dominated by the chunk's root but are not contained in other chunks.",
        "Note that a word dominated by the root is not automatically part of the chunk even if it is not contained in other chunks.",
        "A case in point is the preposition in in example (2) which is dominated by the root of the house chunk and not included in any other chunk.",

        "Thus, we take it that nouns and names are major heads in all contexts.",
        "Often a determiner is missing (cf. example (3a)) or a head noun is elided (cf. example (3b)).",
        "If null determiners and empty nouns are not assumed, the pre-nominal adjectives (e.g. poor) will form chunks of their own in this case.",

        "In particular, the chunks corresponding to the coordinated content words all have the same root.",
        "They either exclude each other or collapse to a single chunk.",
        "The second choice is obviously much preferable and yields the chunk in example (4).",

        "If conjunctions between major heads are excluded, Abney's definition predicts two separate chunks in example (5), one for men and one for women.",
        "The rest of the paper adopts this second approach.",
        "(5) {the old men} and {women} The last problem is the definition of noun chunks.",
        "Noun chunks are defined as those chunks whose major head is a noun.",
        "Since prepositions are treated as function words, the content word in a prepositional phrase is the noun.",
        "Thus, prepositional phrases also count as noun chunks.",

        "Kermes and Evert (2002) also evaluated the performance of their system using the NEGRA treebank, but got considerably worse results (84.74% precision, 82.36% recall) for unclear reasons.",
        "While the precision values in Figure 4 approximately stay the same for all configurations, a certain tendency can be seen in the recall values: Recall improves with agreement checking and even more with right-to-left traversal.",
        "The most frequent errors made without but not with agreement checking are the following: • genitives after prepositions (see example (13), repeated here as (15)): The recognizer finds a noun chunk which is morphologically impossible.",
        "(15) {in John's} {house} • conjunction attachment, see example (16): Sometimes agreement excludes a wide attachment which is favoured by the longest-match criterion.",

        "(17) {diese beiden} {ahnliche Erfolge} these two similar successes There are, however, some errors that only occur if agreement is checked.",
        "The set-up of the system only allows for NP coordination but not N' coordination.",
        "In some cases adjective declination distinguishes N' from NP with null determiner (nachlassenden Krafte versus nachlassende Krafte in example (18), cf. (7)).",
        "These cases are lost only if agreement checking is switched on.",
        "(18) die [Verletzungen and nachlassenden Krafte]N the injuries and diminishing strength The gain in recall observed when parsing right-to-left is mainly due to a heuristic that could only be incorporated into the right-to-left chunker: In case of conjunction attachment, shortest match is preferred.",

        "The paper has presented a method to recognize and morphologically interpret noun chunks.",
        "A distinction has been made between base noun chunks (non-recursive) and full noun chunks (potentially recursive).",
        "Two chunkers have been constructed, one recognizes base noun chunks, the other identifies full noun chunks.",
        "On a SUN Ultra-250, the base noun chunker can process 12,500 words/second, while the full noun chunker achieves 5,200 words/second.",
        "In contrast to other full noun chunkers proposed in the literature (Brants, 1999) (Schmid and Schulte im Walde, 2000), the chunker described here is completely deterministic and does not rely on an explicit representation of ambiguities (like a chart).",
        "In the experiments, it has been shown that the labour of writing a grammar, which is needed in the finite-state approach, indeed leads to improvements in performance.",
        "It has further been shown that the longest-match criterion is a bad substitute for a POS tagger and that a POS tagger is useful as a preprocessing tool for finite-state parsers.",
        "Online agreement checking improves performance, more so for the full noun chunking task than for base noun chunking.",
        "The direction of processing (left-to-right or right-to-left) did not lead to clear distinction, although right-to-left performed consistently better if combined with agreement checking.",
        "The best treatment of coordination (and apposition for that matter) is still an open question.",
        "Since coordination attachment depends on factors that are not accessible to a parser, it should be underspecified like pre or post-nominal modifiers.",
        "There is, however, a major difference between coordination attachment and modifier attachment in that coordination constrains agreement.",
        "Thus the choice of attachment point for coordination may have consequences for the selection of grammatical roles and hence for the predicate-argument structure even if it is reduced to head-complement-relations.",
        "The noun chunker described in the paper is intended to be used as a submodule of a finite-state parser for German newspaper text.",
        "It is planned to convert the output of this parser into underspecified semantic representations on which simple inferences can be drawn as needed e.g. for tasks like Information Extraction."
