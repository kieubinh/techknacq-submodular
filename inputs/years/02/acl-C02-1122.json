        "It describes what kinds of cases each verb has and what kinds of nouns can fill a case slot.",
        "Since these relations have millions of combinations, it is difficult to construct a case frame dictionary by hand.",
        "We proposed a method to construct a Japanese case frame dictionary automatically by arranging large volumes of parse results by coupling a verb and its closest case component (Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2001).",
        "This case frame dictionary, however, could not handle complicated expressions: double nominative sentences, non-gapping relation of relative clauses, and case change.",
        "This paper proposes a method of fertilizing the case frame dictionary to handle these complicated expressions.",
        "We take an iterative method which consists of two stages.",
        "This means gradual learning of what is understood by an analyzer in each stage.",
        "In the first stage, we parse a large raw corpus and construct a Japanese case frame dictionary automatically from the parse results.",
        "This is the method proposed by (Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2001).",
        "In the second stage, we apply case analysis to the large corpus utilizing the constructed case frame dictionary, and upgrade the case frame dictionary by incorporating newly acquired information.",
        "We conducted a case analysis experiment with the upgraded case frame dictionary, and its evaluation showed effectiveness of the fertilization process."

        "Japanese is a head-final language.",
        "Word order does not play a case-marking role.",
        "Instead, postpositions function as case markers (CMs).",
        "The basic structure of a Japanese sentence is as follows: (1) kare ga hon wo kaku he nom-CM book acc-CM write (he writes a book) ga and wo are postpositions which mean nominative and accusative, respectively.",
        "kare ga and hon wo are case components, and kaku is a verb'.",
        "There are two phenomena that case markers are hidden.",
        "A modifying clause is left to the modified noun in Japanese.",

        "This is the first stage of our two-stage approach, and is performed by the method proposed by (Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2001).",
        "In the rest of this section, we describe this approach in detail.",
        "The biggest problem in automatic case frame construction is verb sense ambiguity.",
        "Verbs which have different meanings should have different case frames, but it is hard to disambiguate verb senses very precisely.",
        "To deal with this problem, we distinguish predicate-argument examples, which are collected from a large corpus, by coupling a verb and its closest case component.",
        "That is, examples are not distinguished by verbs such as naru ‘make/become’ and tsumu ‘load/accumulate’, but by couples such as “tomodachi ni naru” ‘make a friend’, “byouki ni naru” ‘become sick’, “nimotsu wo tsumu” ‘load baggage’, and “keiken wo tsumu” ‘accumulate experience’.",
        "This process makes separate case frames which have almost the same meaning or usage.",
        "For example, “nimotsu wo tsumu” ‘load baggage’ and “busshi wo tsumu” ‘load supply’ are separate case frames.",
        "To merge these similar case frames and increase coverage of the case frame, we cluster the case frames.",
        "We employ the following procedure for the automatic case frame construction:",
        "1.",
        "A large raw corpus is parsed by a Japanese parser, and reliable predicate-argument examples are extracted from the parse results.",
        "Nouns with a TM such as wa or mo and clausal modifiees are discarded, because their case markers cannot be understood by syntactic analysis.",
        "2.",
        "The extracted examples are bundled according to the verb and its closest case component, making initial case frames.",
        "3.",
        "The initial case frames are clustered using a similarity measure, resulting in the final case frames.",
        "The similarity is calculated by using NTT thesaurus.",
        "We constructed a case frame dictionary from newspaper articles of 20 years (about 20,000,000 sentences).",
        "4 Target expressions The following expressions could not be handled with the initial case frame dictionary shown in section 3, because of lack of information in the case frame.",
        "Non-gapping relation This is the case in which the clausal modifiee is not a case component of the verb in the modifying clause, but is semantically associated with the clause.",
        "(6) kare ga syudoken wo nigiru kaigi",
        "he initiative have meeting (the meeting in which he has the initiative) In this example, kaigi ‘meeting’ is not a case component of nigiru ‘have’, and there is no case relation between kaigi and nigiru.",
        "We call this relation non-gapping relation.",
        "Double nominative sentence This is the case in which the verb has two nominatives in sentences such as the following.",
        "(7) kuruma wa engine ga yoi car TM engine good (the engine of the car is good) In this example, wa plays a role of nominative, so yoi ‘good’ subcategorizes two nominatives: kuruma ‘car’ and engine.",

        "Correspondence to outer nominative cannot be understood by the case slot matching, but indirectly.",
        "If the TM cannot correspond to any case slots of the initial case frame, the TM can be regarded as outer nominative.",
        "For example, in the case of (7), since the case frame of “engine ga yoi” ‘the engine is good’ has only nominative which corresponds to “engine”, the TM of “kuruma wa” cannot correspond to any case slots and is recognized as outer nominative.",

        "If the case frame does not have any cases which have no correspondence with the case components in the input, the TM cannot correspond to any case slots and is regarded as outer nominative.",
