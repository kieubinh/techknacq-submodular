        "The task of location normalization is to identify the correct sense of a possibly ambiguous location Named Entity (NE).",
        "Ambiguity is very serious for location NEs.",
        "For example, there are 23 cities named ‘Buffalo’, including the city in New York State and in Alabama State.",
        "Even country names such as ‘Canada’, ‘Brazil’, and ‘China’ are also city names in the USA.",
        "Almost every city has a Main Street or Broadway.",
        "Such ambiguity needs to be properly handled before converting location names into some normal form to support entity profile construction, event merging and visualization of extracted events on",
        "a map for an Information Extraction (IE) System.",
        "Location normalization is a special application of word sense disambiguation (WSD).",
        "There is considerable research on WSD.",
        "Knowledge-based work, such as (Hirst, 1987; McRoy, 1992; Ng and Lee, 1996) used hand-coded rules or supervised machine learning based on annotated corpus to perform WSD.",
        "Recent work emphasizes corpus-based unsupervised approach (Dagon and Itai, 1994; Yarowsky, 1992; Yarowsky, 1995) that avoids the need for costly truthed training data.",
        "Location normalization is different from general WSD in that the selection restriction often used for WSD in many cases is not sufficient to distinguish the correct sense from the other candidates.",
        "For example, in the sentence “The White House is located in Washington”, the selection restriction from the collocation ‘located in’ can only determine that “Washington” should be a location name, but is not sufficient to decide the actual sense of this location.",
        "Location normalization depends heavily on co-occurrence constraints of geographically related location entities mentioned in the same discourse.",
        "For example, if ‘Buffalo’, ‘Albany’ and ‘Rochester’ are mentioned in the same document, the most probable senses of ‘Buffalo’, ‘Albany’ and ‘Rochester’ should refer to the cities in New York State.",
        "There are certain fixed keyword-driven patterns from the local context, which decide the sense of location NEs.",
        "These patterns use keywords such as ‘city’, ‘town’, ‘province’, ‘on’, ‘in’ or other location names.",
        "For example, the pattern “X + city” can determine sense tags for cases like “New York city”; and the pattern “City + comma + State” can disambiguate cases such as “Albany, New York” and “Shanghai, Illinois”.",
        "In the absence of these patterns, co-occurring location NEs in the same discourse can be good evidence for predicting the most probable sense of a location name.",
        "For choosing the best matching sense set within a document, we simply construct a graph where each node represents a sense of a location NE, and each edge represents the relationship between two location name senses.",
        "A graph spanning algorithm can be used to select the best senses from the graph.",
        "If there exist nodes that cannot be resolved in this step, we will apply default location senses that were extracted semi-automatically by statistical processing.",
        "The location normalization module, or ‘LocNZ’, is applied after the NE tagging module in our InfoXtract IE system as shown in Figure 1.",
        "This paper focuses on how to resolve ambiguity for the names of island, town, city, province, and country.",
        "Three applications of LocNZ in Information Extraction are illustrated in Section 2.",
        "Section 3 presents location sense identification using local context; Section 4 describes disambiguation process using information within a document through graph processing; Section 5 shows how to semi-automatically collect default senses of locations from a corpus; Section 6 presents an algorithm for location normalization with experimental results.",

        "Event extraction is an advanced IE task.",
        "Extracted events can be merged to provide key content in a document.",
        "The merging process consists of several steps including checking information compatibility such as checking synonyms, name aliases and co-reference of anaphors, time and location normalization.",
        "Two events cannot be merged if there is a conflicting condition such as time and location.",
        "Figure 2 shows an example of event merging where the events occurred in Microsoft at Beijing, not in Seattle.",
        "• Event visualization",
        "Visualization applications can illustrate where an event occurred with support of location normalization.",
        "Figure 3 demonstrates a visualized event on a map based on the normalized location names associated with the events.",
        "The input to visualization consists of extracted events from a news story pertaining to Julian Hill’s life.",
        "The arrow points to the city where the event occurred.",
        "• Entity profile construction",
        "An entity profile is an information object for entities such as person, organization and location.",
        "It is defined as an Attribute Value Matrix (AVM) to represent key aspects of information about entities, including their relationships with other entities.",
        "Each attribute slot embodies some",
        "information about the entity in one aspect.",
        "Each relationship is represented by an attribute slot in the Profile AVM.",
        "Sample Profile AVMs involving the reference of locations are illustrated below.",
        "Several other applications such as question answering and classifying documents by location areas can also be enabled through LocNZ."

        "Using MaxEnt, systems learn under what situation a word is a location name, but it is very difficult to determine the correct sense of an ambiguous location name.",
        "If a word can represent a city or state at the same time, such as New York or Washington, it is difficult to decide if it refers to city or state.",
        "The NE tagger in InfoXtract only assigns the location super-type tag NeLOC to the identified location words and leaves the task of location subtype tagging such as NeCITY or NeSTATE and its normalization to the subsequent module LocNZ.",
        "For representation of LocNZ results, we add an unique zip code and position information that is longitude and latitude for the cities for event visualization.",

        "Manually calculating the default senses for over 30,000 location names will be difficult and it is subject to inconsistency due to the different knowledge background of the human taggers.",
        "To solve this problem in calculating the default senses of location names, we propose to extract the knowledge from a corpus using statistical processing method.",
        "With the TREC-8 (Text Retrieval Conference) corpus, we can only extract default senses for 1687 location names, which cannot satisfy our requirement.",
