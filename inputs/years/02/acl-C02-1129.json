        "Terminology Acquisition (TA) methods are a viable solution for the knowledge bottleneck that confines knowledge-intensive information access systems (such as Information Extraction systems) to restricted application scenarios.",
        "TA is the study of methods to extract concise domain knowledge representation (i.e. terminological dictionaries or terminology knowledge bases, TKBs) by inspecting large text collections.",
        "These corpora embody domain knowledge in the most natural and effective ways.",
        "The major limitation for any TA process is the difficulty in capturing, in computational terms, the complex notion of the underlying cornerstone, i.e. the term.",
        "Most automatic TA methods start from the definition of what a term is and use it against a domain corpus (Jacquemin, 1997).",
        "This latter represents source information for any decision about lexical items (i.e. legal terms of the domain) that do (or do not) meet the given definition.",
        "In this sense, the corpus expresses, implicitly, all the information needed for semantic characterization of the underlying domain: it is thus an implicit domain model (IDM) In automatic TA, there is a general consensus in assuming a term as a surface representation of a key domain concept (Jacquemin, 1997).",
        "Since this definition is open to different \"operational\" interpretations, it has led to the design of different corpus-driven TA architectures.",
        "An \"operational\" model is obtained by specifying the prototypes of admissible surface forms and a notion of relevance of a candidate form able to capture the importance of the underlying concept for the target domain.",
        "The prototypes for the surface forms are usually specified via NP grammars in agreement with valid natural language interpretations.",
        "Generally the morpho-syntactic level is used where term prototypes may be specified for instance as Adj Noun or Noun Noun constraints able to select respectively surface forms as joint venture or information access.",
        "The notion of relevance for the domain relies generally on probabilistic properties.",
        "In (Daille, 1994), the simple frequency f (s) of surface forms in the corpus is suggested as the most effective measure.",
        "Frequency f seems to reproduce the terminologist judgement better than other more complex statistical measures.",
        "However, as admittedly mentioned in (Daille, 1994), frequency alone is still far from being a perfect \"termhood\" function.",
        "In this paper we propose to consider further information embedded in the underlying implicit domain model (IDM).",
        "When terminological dictionaries are manually built, terminologists start from a general notion of term and apply it to the specific domain.",
        "As long as they look at the target collections their intuitive perception of the underlying domain improves.",
        "In fact, they tune their starting hypothesis along with their exposition to texts.",
        "In this process, the IDM usually consists of a domain collection together with an explicit preexisting domain terminology, To.",
        "Two kinds of information, often neglected by other computational approaches, are here available: (1) usage of already accepted terms (terms in To) are embodied by the corpus and (2) negative evidences, derived through negative decisions, i.e. rejections.",
        "Frequent occurrences, but non-terminological, expressions increase the terminologists' perception of what a non-term is.",
        "Typical uses of accepted (and refused) candidates refine incrementally an inner definition of terms.",
        "This, in a computational perspective, should be expressed via an intentional term definition.",
        "This is the purpose of the method described in this paper.",
        "Several observable properties can be derived from the collections (i.e. in the contexts of terms and non-terms).",
        "A predictive (intensional) model, able to correctly separate terms from non-terms, should be developed on the most relevant (i.e. distinctive) of such properties.",
        "In the following, two text fragments appear: Example 1 .",
        "a) The vorticity equation governs the evolution of vorticity in a geophysical fluid.",
        "This is an equation used in large-scale geophysical fluid dynamics.",
        "b) The generalized airfoil equation governs the pressure across an airfoil oscillating in a wind tun-n el.",
        "Both expressions vorticity equation and generalized airfoil equation are here terminological with respect to a scientific domain.",
        "The syntagmatic structure of the sentences is similar.",
        "The expressions are both subjects of the verb govern and this is often true of technical definitions for physical laws.",
        "Such grammatical facts may be usefully adopted as selective criteria as they establish a domain specific notion of similarity.",
        "These decision rules should be embodied into the domain-specific intensional term definition (itd) that we aim to capture.",
        "We then argue that major advances in terminology acquisition can be obtained by adopting the intensional term definitions as a concise operational notion.",
        "For this reason we settled a learning model within a cycle of TA acquisition.",
        "The resulting learning model is assumed to derive an itd as a decision tree representing the terminologist activity in an explicit and hierarchical way.",
        "The induction can be incrementally applied to the TA cycle and the psychological plausibility (as an heurism) of the resulting model can be studied.",
        "In Section 2, the itd learning model is defined.",
        "The related feature space, introduced in Sec. 3, is based on the implicit domain model (i.e. the corpus plus a seeding terminological dictionary).",
        "It supports the application of machine learning algorithms such as (Quinlan, 1993).",
        "The natural language processing tools, responsible for mapping the textual material into the feature representations (Basili et al., 2000), are then described in Section 3.2.",
        "The results are analysed in Section 4.",
        "First, a discussion of the induced models is presented (Section 4.1).",
        "Then, performance in the TA task is measured over benchmarking data (Section 4.2).",
        "2 Decision Tree Learning of itds The decision tree formalism is an interesting way for representing the heurisms used by the terminologists in assessing \"termhood\" of the incoming candidates as it represents the decision rules in a hierarchical fashion.",
        "As any categorisation method, a decision tree is a function that, given an object represented by a set of properties (i.e. attribute-value pairs), outputs a category chosen from a predetermined set.",
        "This latter is the classification decision over the input object.",
        "If 0 is the space where properties are represented and O the set of the target decisions, the decision tree DT is then a function:",
        "In this formalism, the decision strategy is represented by a tree where each internal node corresponds to a test on a given property, i.e. the test on the value of a given attribute.",
        "The categorisation is achieved when a leaf node is reached, i.e. all the tests in the path are passed.",
        "Given its nature, a decision tree imposes a hierarchy on the attributes.",
        "In fact, the more discriminating is an attribute with respect to the target competing concepts (decisions), the higher it should be modelled in the hierarchy since the decision can be taken more straightforwardly.",
        "Therefore, the inspection of an already built decision tree provides insights on which feature has been considered more important in the description of the target concepts.",
        "Applied to the problem of term definition, the decision tree should represent the internal hierarchy of choices that terminologists perform when observing the properties of a given term candidate.",
        "The classification decision they have to take is whether or not the candidate is a term, i.e. whether or not it is an instance of the concept of term.",
        "Since in our model we assume that terminologists use as a source of discriminating hints the term contextual information, in a decision tree this information should be described.",
        "A sample decision tree based on such a kind of contextual information is depicted in Fig. 2.",
        "Here",
        "four properties are considered.",
        "The property of the candidate of being: (1) subject of the verb to be (V_Subj-essere); (2) object of the verb to make (V_Obj-fare); (3) prepositional modifier of the verb to make (V_PP-f are) ; and (4) prepositional modifier of the noun contract (NP_PP-contratto).",
        "What is stated in the tree is that if the analysed candidate is \"enough\" correlated with the verb to be in a subject relation (i.e. the \"correlation score\" is between 0.00772 and 0.153846) it can be reasonable considered a term, otherwise the correlation with other features has to be evaluated.",
        "The noticeable information in the tree is that, in this particular term definition, the contextual relation with the verb to be has been considered as the more discriminating hint.",
        "In order to be a useful decision maker, the tree should represent the important properties of the notion of the term as well as the notion of non-term in the given environment, i.e. in the particular implicit domain model.",
        "Standard and effective tools for the induction of decision trees are available (Quinlan, 1993).",
        "In particular, this latter method is able to infer regularities over feature space with continuous-valued attributes.",
        "This is necessary in the model we propose since we want to study the regular correlations of terms and non-terms with the other words in the domain contexts.",
        "It is worth noticing that the applicability of the tree learning method is possible due to the inclusion of the non-term concept in the model of TA postulated in this work.",
        "The model of the overall process includes the following steps: (a) Generation of a global feature vector for knowledge item (i.e. a term or a non-term); (b) Induction of the target intensional definition as a decision tree that divides incoming candidates into terms and non-terms.",
        "To better understand the terminologists' be-haviour, the above process can be also modelled as an incremental approach.",
        "Newly accepted (or rejected) candidates allow a dynamic revision of the corresponding decision tree structure: a new learning process can be activated over the newly assessed instances.",
        "3 Making use of Implicit Domain Models in TA The induction of concise domain-oriented term definition needs a suitable representation of the observations.",
        "This representation should be derivable from the implicit domain model.",
        "A suitable observation model should include all those selective properties characterizing the notion of term and non-term.",
        "The aim here is to understand if and how regularities in the behaviour of terms in the corpus are used by terminologists as selective features for the final decision.",
        "Syntax will be used (in line with other works like (Grefenstette, 1993) or (Basili et al., 2001)) as linguistic level able to characterize the similarity among contexts.",
        "In the next Sections the formal definitions of the feature vectors representing positive and negative instances are presented."
