        "Recent advances have made some systems (such as BBN’s IdentiFinder (Bikel, 1999)) very successful when classifying named entities into broad categories, such as person, organization, and location.",
        "While the accurate classification of general named entities is useful in many areas of natural language research, more fine-grained categorizations would be of particular value in areas such as Question Answering, information retrieval, and the automated construction of ontologies.",
        "The research presented here focuses on the subcategorization of person names, which extends research on the subcategorization of location names (Fleischman, 2001).",
        "While locations can often be classified based solely on the words that surround the instance, person names are often more challenging because classification relies on much deeper semantic intuitions gained from the surrounding text.",
        "Further, unlike the case with location names, exhaustive lists of person names by category do not exist and cannot be relied upon for training and test set generation.",
        "Finally, the domain of person names presents a challenge because the same individual (e.g., “Ronald Reagan”) is often represented differently at different points in the same text (e.g., “Mr.",
        "Reagan”, “Reagan”, etc.).",
        "The subcategorization of person names is not a trivial task for humans either, as the examples below illustrate.",
        "Here, names of persons have been encrypted using a simple substitution cipher.",
        "The names are of only three subtypes: politician, businessperson, and entertainer, yet prove remarkably difficult to classify based upon the context of the sentence.",

        "Data was word tokenized, stemmed using the Porter stemming algorithm (Porter, 1980), part of speech tagged using Brill’s tagger (Brill, 1994), and named entity tagged using BBN’s IdentiFinder (Bikel, 1999).",
        "Person instances were classified into one of eight categories: athlete, politician/government, clergy, businessperson, entertainer/artist, lawyer, doctor/scientist, and police.",
        "These eight categories were chosen because of their high frequency in the corpus and also because of their usefulness in applications such as Question Answering.",
        "A training set of roughly 25,000 person instances was then created using a partially automated classification system.",
        "In generating the training data automatically we first attempted to use the simple tagging method described for location names in (Fleischman, 2001).",
        "This method involved collecting lists of instances of each category from the Internet and using those lists to classify person names found by IdentiFinder.",
        "Although robust with location names, this method proved inadequate with persons (in a sample of 300, over 25% of the instances were found to be incorrect).",
        "This was due to the fact that the same name will often refer to multiple individuals (e.g., “Paul Simon” refers to a politician, an entertainer, and Belgian scientist).",
        "In order to avoid this problem we implemented a simple bootstrapping procedure in which a seed data set of 100 instances of each of the eight categories was hand tagged and used to generate a decision list classifier using the C4.5 algorithm (Quinlan, 1993) with the word frequency and topic signature features described below.",
        "This simple classifier was then run over a large corpus and classifications with a confidence score above a 90% threshold were collected.",
        "These confident instances were then compared to the lists collected from the Internet, and, only if there was agreement between the two sources, were the instances included in the final training set.",
        "This procedure produced a large training set with very few misclassified instances (over 99% of the instances in a sample of 300 were found to be correct).",
        "A validation set of 1000 instances from this set was then hand tagged to assure proper classification.",
        "A consequence of using this method for data generation is that the training set created is not a random sample of person instances in the real world.",
        "Rather, the training set is highly skewed, including only those instances that are both easy enough to classify using a simple classifier and common enough to be included in lists found on the Internet.",
        "To examine the generalizability of classifiers trained on such data, a held out data set of 1300 instances, also from the AP and WSJ, was collected and hand tagged."

        "Each term in a text is given a topic signature score that indicates its ability to signal that the text is in a relevant category (the higher the score, the more that term is indicative of that category).",

        "The first hypothesis (h1) is that the probability (p1) that the text is in the relevant category, given a specific term, is equivalent to the probability (p2) that the text is in the relevant category, given any other term (h1: p1=p2).",
        "The second hypothesis (h2) is that these two probabilities are not equivalent, and that p1 is much greater than p2 (h2: p1>>p2).",
        "The calculation of this likelihood ratio [-2logL(h1)/L(h2)] for each feature and for each category gives a list of all the terms in a document set with scores indicating how much the presence of that term in a specific document indicates that the document is in a specific category.",
        "In creating topic signature features for the subcategorization of persons, we created a database of topic signatures generated from the training set (see Figure 2).1 Each sentence from the training set was treated as a unique document, and the classification of the instance contained in that sentence was treated as the relevant topic.",
        "We implemented the algorithm described in (Lin and Hovy, 2000) with the addition of a cutoff, such that the topic signatures for a term are only included if the p1/p2 for that term is greater than the mean p1/p2 over all terms.",
        "This modification was made to ensure the assumption that p1 is much greater than p2.",

        "The failure of our automatic data generation algorithm to produce a good sample of training data is evident in the large disparity between performances on validation and held out test sets.",
        "There are at least two reasons for the algorithm’s poor sampling.",
        "First, by using only high confidence guesses from the seed trained classifier, the training data may have a disproportionate number of instances that are easy to classify.",
        "This is evident in the number of partial names that are present in the held out test set versus the training set.",
        "Partial names, such as “Simon” instead of “Paul Simon,” usually occur with weaker evidence for classification than full names.",
        "In the training set only 45.1% of the instances are partial names, whereas in the more realistic distribution of the held out set, 58.4% are partial names.",
        "The second reason for the poor sampling stems from the use of lists of person names.",
        "Because the training set is derived from individuals in these lists, the coverage of individuals included in the training set is inherently limited.",
        "For example, in the businessperson category, lists of individuals were taken from such resources as Forbes’ annual ranking of the nation’s wealthiest people, under the assumption that wealthy people are often in the news.",
        "However, the list fails to mention the countless vice presidents and analysts that frequent the pages of the Wall Street Journal.",
        "This failure to include such lower level businesspersons means that a large space of the classification domain is not covered by the training set, which in turn leads to poor results on the held out test set.",
        "The results of these experiments suggest that better fine-grained classification of named entities will require not only more sophisticated feature selection, but also a better data generation procedure.",
        "In future work, we will investigate more sophisticated bootstrapping methods, as (Collins & Singer, 1999) as well as co-training and co-testing (Muslea et al., 2000).",
        "In future work we will also examine adapting the hierarchical decision list algorithm from (Yarowsky, 2000) to our task.",
        "Treating fine-grained classification of named entities as a word sense disambiguation problem (where categories are treated as different senses of a generic “person name”) allows these methods to be directly applicable.",
        "The algorithm is particularly relevant in that it provides an intuitive way to take advantage of the similarities of certain categories (e.g., Athlete and Entertainer).",
        "Of more theoretical concern are the problems of miscellaneous classifications that do not fit easily into any category, as well as, instances that may fit into more than one category (e.g., Ronald Reagan can be either a Politician or an Entertainer).",
        "We plan to address these issues as well as problems that may arise with extending this system for use with other classes, such as organizations."
