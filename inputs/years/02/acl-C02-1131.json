        "Annotating a corpus of German with chunks, topological fields and clause boundaries is both a goal in itself and a step towards further syntactic annotation.",
        "Partial annotation can serve as data to test linguistic hypotheses and it can be used as a pre-structuring for further linguistic annotation steps.",
        "If, however, the underlying part-of-speech (POS) annotation is imperfect, these errors will be passed on to the subsequent levels of annotation and increase annotation errors on those levels.",
        "It is especially damaging for subsequent annotation if POS tags are incorrect which provide the framework of the German sentence by demarcating the topological fields and the clause boundaries (e.g. subordinators and verbs).",
        "This paper presents a method to automatically annotate a corpus of German with chunks, topological fields and clause boundaries, and improve tagging accuracy at the same time in order to increase the overall annotation accuracy.",
        "Tag improvement primarily relies on the linguistic knowledge encoded in the grammar for annotating the topological fields."

        "The topological field model (cf. Hohle (1986)) is a well-established descriptive model of the constituent order in German and other Germanic languages.",
        "Topological fields describe sections in the German sentence with regard to the distributional properties of the verb (and the subordinator in subclauses).",
        "There are three different types of clauses as can be seen in Table 1:1 verb-last clauses (VL), verb-first clauses (V1) and verb-second clauses (V2).",
        "VL clauses 'Cf.",
        "Figures 1 - 3 for examples for illustration.",
        "comprise all introduced subclauses, V1 clauses mainly comprise imperatives and yes/no questions and V2 clauses mostly comprise affirmative clauses.",
        "The topological fields CF/VCL (complementizer field/verb complex left) and VCR (verb complex right)2 constitute the sentence bracket, relative to which the other fields can be described 3.",
        "The section preceding the left part of the sentence bracket is called the Vorfeld (VF; initial field; only in V2 clauses), the section included in the sentence bracket is called the Mittelfeld (MF; middle field) and the section following the right part of the sentence bracket is called the Nachfeld (NF; final field).",
        "While the ordering of other constituents is relatively free in German, the ordering of topological fields is subject to syntactic restrictions which adhere to the unvarying pattern outlined in Table 1.",
        "Figure 1 shows that the topological field model is also capable of accounting for recursive structures.",
        "Subordinate clauses (INF, SUB, REL) may be embedded in topological fields and, with this model, it is possible to leave their attachment open until its disambiguation in further annotation steps."

      "heading": "1.2 The linguistic perspective",
      "text": [
        "The topological field model is primarily a distributional model.",
        "It does not give any account of the verb-complement structure and it does not reveal the relation of the constituents within the topological fields, either.",
        "However, as argued by Meurers (2002), topological field annotation can \"significantly help in using corpora from the perspective of theoretical linguistics\".",
        "This becomes clear if one takes a look at Figure 1: The structure of topological fields along with POS tags marks the borders and the type of subclauses in a sentence.",
        "This shallow annotation thus provides the user with what one can call the skeleton of the sentence.",
        "Without the annotation of topological fields, it is by no means clear where the borders of the subclauses are and it is not clear where the potential complements of the respective verbs are.",
        "A query for a linguistic structure would therefore highly over-generate, thus producing a high amount of false matches.",
        "The shallow annotation as shown in Figure 1 gives the user of an annotated corpus the possibility to investigate various distributional phenomena which have to be described relative to the topological fields.",
        "The location of the embedding of subclauses is one of them, which has to be discussed in every linguistic theory and which is by no means agreed upon by linguists.",
        "Eisenberg (1999) is an adequate example: \"Der Besetzung des Nachfeldes wird haufig eine kommunikativ-pragmatische Funktion zugeschrieben, [... ]\"4 (p. 391).",
        "If linguists want to examine such a hypothesis, they are in need of an annotation which provides them with topological fields.",
        "A detailed account of the structure of the annotation in our system is given in Muller (2002).",
        "1.3 The computational perspective Concerning automatic annotation, one of the main advantages of topological fields is that they reduce the scope of ambiguity by dividing the sentence into fields and subclauses: constituents below clausal nodes can typically only be complements to verbs under the same clausal node (cf. squared nodes in Figure 1).",
        "The subclauses can now even be dealt with as single units, thus using a divide-and-conquer strategy similar to the one outlined in Peh and Ting (1996).",
        "By first annotating topological fields, one can use a strategy termed containment of ambiguity by Abney (1996).",
        "This strategy proposes to annotate higher levels first if \"reliable markers\" are present because this considerably limits the number of possible attachment sites.",
        "Annotating topological fields first and verb-complement structure later transfers this strategy, which was originally used for chunking (i.e. basic phrase recognition), to the topological fields and clause level.5 \"'A communicative-pragmatic function is very often attributed to the occupation of the Nachfeld, [...]\" (our translation) 5A similar strategy has already been used to prestruc-Another reason for splitting the annotation task of topological fields and chunks on the one hand and further annotation like verb-complement structure and phrase attachment on the other hand is that these linguistic phenomena adhere to two different organizing principles.",
        "While the former phenomena are mainly based on syntactic restrictions, the latter phenomena are to a large extent based on lexical selection.",
        "The syntactic pattern of topological fields in a clause is independent of the lexical entry for the respective head verb.",
        "Verb-complement structure, on the other hand, is clearly subject to lexical selection.",
        "Whether a verb takes a direct and an indirect object or not clearly depends on the lexical entry of the verb.",
        "It is thus only logical to use two different annotation methods which fit the respective phenomena.",
        "Chunks and topological fields can be annotated with no other information than the POS tags, using a finite state transducer which works with a regular expression grammar.",
        "The rules for this grammar can be derived from linguistic knowledge.",
        "In this manner, the task of annotating a corpus is split into several tasks, thus generating a hybrid parser (cf. Hinrichs et al.",
        "(2002))."

        "From what has been said in section 1 it should be clear that the correct annotation of the tokens in the sentence bracket is crucial for syntactic parsing in general and for our method in particular.",
        "The quality of a POS tagger is usually given as the overall percentage of correctly assigned tags, 97.02% in our case.",
        "This relatively high accuracy does not reveal, however, the severity of tagging errors (cf. Oliva (2001)) and which kinds of tags are mistagged at which rate.",
        "We tested the difference between the two high-frequent?",
        "open POS tag classes ADJA (attributive adjective) and VVFIN (finite lexical verb) according to their tagging error rate, i.e. the number of tokens which should have been assigned a certain POS tag but were not.",
        "Attributive adjectives have an error rate of 2.40% and finite lexical verbs have an error rate of 9.95%.",
        "The test has thus shown that especially the verb tags, which are of major importance for our system, have an error rate much higher than the average error rate of 2.98% and still higher than a comparable high-frequent open class.",
        "Severe tagging errors are, thus, more frequent in the POS annotation.",
        "The main reason for this is that standard taggers like the ones used in our system only take into account the immediate context of a token when searching for the correct tag.",
        "This strategy is effective for tokens where the syntactic relation is reflected in distributional proximity.",
        "This is much more the case in English than it is in German.",
        "In German, the syntactic relation between two tokens is reflected by distributional proximity mainly in noun chunks (e.g. the relation between an attributive adjective and the head noun) and prepositional chunks.",
        "The German verb complex, however, is split into two parts in the affirmative clause as explained in section 1.",
        "In the example in Figure 1 there are fourteen tokens between the two parts of the verb complex of the main clause and even one intermitting subclause.",
        "Sentences (1) and (2) below show an example of the problem of verbs which are ambiguous as regards their POS tags.",
        "The verb zustimmen is an infinitive verb in (1) and a finite verb in (2).",
        "As the examples show, there is no cue in a window of eight tokens as to which POS tag is the correct one.",
        "Thus, taggers taking into account a window of only two or three tokens cannot reliably annotate verbs in such a structure.",
        "In the following section, we show how this problem can be tackled.",

        "The tag correction component is one level in this cascade.",
        "Within the task of annotating topological fields, the left part of the sentence bracket (i.e. CF and VCL) and the right part of the sentence bracket (i.e. VCR) are annotated first using POS tags and local context information.",
        "The parser then tries to match the respective parts of the sentence bracket into a parsable sequence.",
        "This would typically be a sequence like in Figure 2: An initial field (VF) followed by a left part of a sentence bracket containing a finite verb (VCLMF) followed by a middle field (MF) followed by a right part of a sentence bracket containing a non-finite verb (VCRVI).",
        "If the parser fails to assign a parsable structure, it makes use of the ranked POS tag assignments recorded in the linguistic markup.",
        "The parser considers the second-best tag and tries to match a parsable sequence again.",
        "Provided that the parser succeeds, the second-best tag is promoted to be the best tag and the whole sequence is annotated.",
        "As regards Figure 2 this would mean that if the verb zustimmen was wrongly assigned the POS tag VVFIN for finite verb and VVINF was also in the list of possible tags, then the parser would mark VVINF as the best tag and change the label of the sentence bracket into the respective one for finite verbs.",
        "This strategy is similar to the one described in Hirakawa et al.",
        "(2000) in that it uses linguistic knowledge already encoded in the NLP system.",
        "Apart from the language-specific characteristics, the difference between our approach and Hirakawa et al.",
        "(2000) is that they use this strategy to acquire rules for POS tag correction, while our system directly integrates the POS correction component into the parsing process.",
        "Other approaches which combine rule-based and statistical components outside the parsing process are Tapanainen and Voutilainen (1994) (for English) and Hajic et al.",

        "In contrast to our approach, the latter approaches both apply the linguistic rules before doing stochastic disambiguation.",
        "They first either completely disambiguate the POS of a token or reduce its ambiguity for the following stochastic process.",
        "This strategy does not allow, however, to share the same linguistic components between the rule-based tagger and the parser.",
        "Our approach rather leaves the POS tag to a certain extent ambiguous by assigning a ranked ambiguity class and allows the parser to decide which POS tag fits into the sequence.",
        "Figure 3 gives another example with a subclause.",
        "In this subclause, there is again the verb zustimmen, which this time is a finite verb.",
        "If it is incorrectly tagged VVINF (for infinitive), then there is no parsing rule to match the sequence of a CF, an MF and a non-finite VCR because this sequence does not comply with any grammatical structure.",
        "The VVINF is thus changed to VVFIN and the structure can be annotated.",
        "There are also cases in which the left part of the sentence bracket is mistagged (Cf.",
        "Figure 1 in which um, wie and der are ambiguous).",

        "This is even the more important to point out if one considers that the high-frequent German subordinators daflldass, wenn and well are unambiguous so that the error rate for ambiguous subordinators is even higher.",
        "These errors are corrected along the same lines as shown for the verbs.",
