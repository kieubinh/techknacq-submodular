        "The title is expected to play two roles.",
        "One is to give the reader a very compact summary of the document, and the other is to attract the target reader’s interest and lead the reader to read the document.",
        "It is preferable that a title plays both roles, because the reader may be disappointed with a gap between the title and the document if the title plays the former role poorly, and the reader may not read the document if the title plays the latter role poorly.",
        "Therefore, it is very important what title is attached to a document.",
        "Several techniques have been reported on generating titles (Jin and Hauptmann, 2000) (Berger and Mittal, 2000), and they focus on the former role, that is, to give a compact summary.",
        "The main approach is to find a few keywords from the document by calculating the importance of each word in the document.",
        "This approach, incidentally, is similar to most text summarization techniques.",
        "The selected keywords or title strongly reflect the author’s wordings.",
        "In other words, this approach is an “author-centered approach”.",
        "In some cases, the title generated by this approach might play the latter role poorly and fail to get the reader’s interest.",
        "To make generated titles play their latter role properly, it is not sufficient to look into only the author’s document.",
        "It is important to also pay more attention to the reader.",
        "It is necessary in the “reader-centered approach” to clarify the features of the reader’s attention, that is, the relationship between the reader’s attention and the content and wording of the title.",
        "Based on this knowledge, it will be possible to extract information from the document that is more attractive to the reader than the author’s key expressions and to include it in the generated title.",
        "Our first goal is to clarify the kind of content and wording that are key to getting the reader’s comprehension, interest in, and positive feeling toward the document.",
        "For this purpose, we first conducted a comparative study on the titles of technical papers and headlines rewritten for newspapers to identify the typical content and wording of titles aimed at general readers.",
        "We then conducted a questionnaire survey on the effects of different content and wording of titles on different kinds of readers’ interest.",
        "The following sections are as follows: section 2 describes the comparative study and its results, section 3 and 4 explain the details and the results of our questionnaire survey, and section 5 relates our conclusion and future work.",
        "2 Comparison between Paper Titles and Newspaper Headlines To identify the typical content and wording of titles aimed at general readers, we conducted a comparative study on the Japanese titles of research papers and the headlines of Japanese newspaper articles describing the corresponding technology.",
        "We first divided the titles and headlines into several syntactic components (text segments) and assigned each component a syntactic function tag, such as “P(urpose of development)” and “M(ethod for realization)”, and then comparatively analyzed the expression of paper title and headlines on the basis of each component."

        "In the above example, the compound noun “buried cables” is assigned the tag “O”.",

        "(e.g., “for power distribution cables under pavements”) • M(ethod): The tag “M” stands for the method for realization and is expressed by a noun phrase following a preposition, such as “by” (“ni yori” in Japanese).",
        "(e.g., “by underground radar”) • S(trong point): “S” stands for the advantage or merit of the developed technology.",
        "It is usually expressed by an adjective or adverb phrase.",
