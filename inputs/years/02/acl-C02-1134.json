        "In recent times, there has been an increased interest in translation systems that employ statistical models for mapping a source language sentence to a target language sentence (Brown et al., 1993; Ney, 1999; Alshawi et al., 1998b).",
        "The appeal of statistical translation approaches is that translation models can be trained directly from data without any human intervention, thus reducing the effort in building translation systems, in contrast to the effort involved in building hand-crafted translation systems.",
        "The models are trained using large bilingual corpora of parallel texts â€“ sentence pairs in two languages that are known translations of each other.",
        "As a result, training a statistical translation model for a specific application requires the availability of a large parallel corpus for the application domain.",
        "However, the data available for many applications is typically in only one language.",
        "Although there are bilingual corpora such as the English-French Hansard Corpus and the English-Chinese HongKong News Corpus for different language pairs that are known parallel texts, they may not be useful to a given application domain.",
        "Also, techniques that exploit parallel web pages (Resnik, 1999) to build a parallel corpus may not be well suited for translations in a given application domain.",
        "In previous work (Alshawi et al., 1998a), human translators translated application-specific monolingual data to create bilingual parallel data for training statistical translation models.",
        "However, such an approach is prohibitively expensive when large amounts of application-specific monolingual data needs to be translated as is the case in our application context.",
        "An alternate resource for building parallel corpora is to use off-the-shelf translation systems to translate the monolingual data.",
        "It is to be expected that the quality of translation from such off-the-shelf translation engines on application-specific data is likely to be poor.",
        "Our approach in this paper is to combine the output of multiple such off-the-shelf translation engines (improving on the quality of each individual translation) to bootstrap a parallel corpus for an instant-messaging application.",
        "In Bangalore et al.",
        "(2001), it has been shown that combining the translations provided by a variety of off-the-shelf machine translation (MT) engines on domain dependent spoken dialog transcriptions can improve upon the performance of each of the individual MT engines.",
        "In this paper, we apply the same techniques for data from a general domain obtained in the context of an instant messaging application, AT&T's instant messenger, Hubbub (Isaacs et al., 2001a).",
        "Furthermore, we explore techniques to cope with the rapidly increasing amount of data available for training statistical translation models.",
        "The layout of the paper follows.",
        "In Section 2 we describe the multilingual Hubbub instant messaging application and discuss other approaches to multilingual chat applications.",
        "In Section 3, we describe the multi-sequence alignment algorithm and its use in arriving at the consensus translation.",
        "The experimental set up and performance results from these experiments are presented in Section 4.",
        "We present our conclusions in Section 5."

        "In this paper, we discuss the process by which we bootstrapped the bilingual data needed for training statistical translation models from the 58,300 English sentences collected from conversations among users of Hubbub.",
        "These sentences are typically short and spontaneous and use a variety of slang and informal language.",
        "Furthermore, these conversations do not adhere to any particular topic.",

        "One such system, Lotus Translation Services for Same-Time (Lotus, 2001), connects users to a translation server of their choice within the Lotus Translation Community to provide chat translations.",
        "The translation server appears as another user participating in the chat conversation, under a user-defined alias.",
        "The user can connect to the translation service, which provides a URL link to the translation console, allowing the user to translate the chat using the translation console (Kellerman and Mayeur, 2000).",
