        "Different from the previous statistical models for title generation, which treat title generation as a generation process that converts the ‘document representation’ of information directly into a ‘title representation’ of the same information, this model introduces a hidden state called ‘information source’ and divides title generation into two steps, namely the step of distilling the ‘information source’ from the observation of a document and the step of generating a title from the estimated ‘information source’.",

        "Compared with a document, a title provides a compact representation of the information and therefore helps people quickly capture the main idea of a document without spending time on the details.",
        "Automatic title generation is a complex task, which not only requires finding the title words that reflects the document content but also demands ordering the selected title words into human readable sequence.",
        "Therefore, it involves in both nature language understanding and nature language synthesis, which distinguishes title generation from other seemingly similar tasks such as key phrase extraction or automatic text summarization where the main concern of tasks is identify important information units from documents (Mani & Maybury., 1999).",
        "The statistical approach toward title generation has been proposed and studied in the recent publications (Witbrock & Mittal, 1999; Kennedy & Hauptmann, 2000; Jin & Hauptmann, 2001).",
        "The basic idea is to first learn the correlation between the words in titles (title words) and the words in the corresponding documents (document words) from a given training corpus consisting of document-title pairs, and then apply the learned title-word-document-word correlations to generate titles for unseen documents.",
        "Witbrock and Mittal (1999) proposed a statistical framework for title generation where the task of title generation is decomposed into two phases, namely the title word selection phase and the title word ordering phase.",
        "In the phase of title word selection, each title word is scored based on its indication of the document content.",
        "During the title word ordering phase, the ‘appropriateness’ of the word order in a title is scored using ngram statistical language model.",
        "The sequence of title words with highest score in both title word selection phase and title word ordering phase is chosen as the title for the document.",
        "The follow-ups within this framework mainly focus on applying different approaches to the title word selection phase (Jin & Hauptmann, 2001; Kennedy & Hauptmann, 2000).",
        "However, there are two problems with this framework for title generation.",
        "They are:",
        "• A problem with the title word ordering",
        "phase.",
        "The goal of title word selection phase is to find the appropriate title words for document and the goal of title word ordering phase is to find the appropriate word order for the selected title words.",
        "In the framework proposed by Witbrock and Mittal (1999), the title word ordering phase is accomplished by using ngram language model (Clarkson & Rosenfeld, 1997) to predict the probability P(T), i.e. how frequently the word sequence T is used as a title for a document.",
        "Of course, the probability for the word sequence T to be used as a title for any document is definitely influenced by the correctness of the word order in T. However, the factor whether the words in the sequence T are common words or not will also have great influence on the chance of seeing the sequence T as a title.",
        "Word sequence T with many rare words, even with a perfect word order, will be difficult to match with the content of most documents and has small chance to be used as a title.",
        "As the result, using probability P(T) for the purpose of ordering title words can cause the generated titles to include unrelated common title words.",
        "The obvious solution to this problem is to somehow eliminate the bias of favouring common title words from probability P(T) and leave it only with the task of the word ordering.",
        "• A problem with the title word selection",
        "phase.",
        "The title word selection phase is responsible for coming up with a set of title words that reflect the meaning of the document.",
        "In the framework proposed by Witbrock and Mittal (1999), every document word has an equal vote for title words.",
        "However, title only needs to reflect the main content of a document not every single detail of that document.",
        "Therefore, letting all the words in the document participate equally in the selection of title words can cause a large variance in choosing title words.",
        "For example, common words usually have little to do with the content of documents.",
        "Therefore, allowing common words of a document equally compete with the content words in the same document in choosing title words can seriously degrade the quality of generated titles.",
        "The solution we proposed to this problem is to introduce a hidden state called ‘information source’.",
        "This ‘information source’ will sample the important content word out of a document and a title will be computed based on the sampled ‘information source’ instead of the original document.",
        "By striping off the common words through the ‘information source’ state, we are able to reduce the noise introduced by common words to the documents in selecting title words.",
        "The schematic diagram for the idea is shown in Figure 1, together with the schematic diagram for the framework by Witbrock and Mittal.",
        "As indicated by Figure 1, the old framework for title generation has only a single ‘channel’ connecting the document words to the title words while the new model contains two ‘channels’ with one connecting the document words to the ‘information source’ state and the other connecting the ‘information source’ state to the title words.",

        "In the old framework for title generation, term P(T) is used for ordering title words into a correct sequence.",

        "A word sequence T with a set of rare words will have small chance to be used as a title for any document even if the word order in T is perfectly correct.",
        "On the other side, a title T with a set of common words can have a good chance to be a title for some documents even its word order is problematic.",
        "Therefore, the probability for a word sequence T to be used as a title, i.e. P(T), is determined by both the ‘appropriateness’ of the word order of T and the ‘rareness’ of the words in T and doesn’t appropriately represent the process of title word ordering whose only goal is to identify a correct word order with the given words.",
        "In terms of formal analysis, the problem with the title word selection phase can be attributed to the oversimplified approximation for probability P(T|D).",
        "According to the chain rule in probability theory, the approximation for P(T|D) in Equation (2) is quite problematic and a more reasonable expansion for probability P(T|D) should be following:",
        "where P({tw∈ T}) stands for the probability of using the set of word {tw∈ T} in titles without considering the word order.",
        "The difference between Equations (3) and (2) is that, Equation (2) uses term P(T) directly for title word ordering phase while Equation (3) divides term P(T) by term P({tw∈ T}) and uses the result of division for title word ordering process.",
        "Because term P({tw∈ T}) concerns only with the popularity of the words twin sequence T, dividing P(T) by P({tw∈ T}) has the effect of removing the bias of favouring popular title words from term P(T).",
        "Therefore, term P(T)/P({tw∈ T}) is determined mainly by the word order in T and not influenced by the popularity of title words in T. 1.3 Problem with title word selection phase As already discussed in the introduction section, the old framework for title generation allows all the words in the document equally participate in selecting title words and therefore, the final choice of title words may be influenced significantly by the common words in the document which have nothing to do with the content of the document.",
        "Thus, we suggest a solution to this problem by introducing a hidden state called ‘information source’ which is able to sampled the important content words from the original document.",
        "To find an optimal title for a document, we will create the title from the ‘distilled information source’ instead of the original document.",
        "To allow titles being generated from the ‘distilled information source’ instead of the original document, we can expand the probability P(T|D) as the sum of the probabilities P(T |‘information source’ S) over",
        "all the possible ‘information sources’ S, where probability P(T|S) stands for the probability of using the word sequence T as the title for the ‘information source’ S. Formally, this idea can be expressed as:",
        "where symbol S stands for a possible ‘information source’ S for the document D. In Equation (4), term P(T|S)P(S|D) represents the idea of two noisy channels, with term P(S|D) corresponding to the first channel that samples ‘information source’ S out of the original document D and term P(T|S) corresponding to the second noisy channel that creates title T from the ‘distilled information source’ S. Since the first noisy channel, i.e. P(S|D), is new to the old framework for title generation, we will focus on the discussion of the noisy channel P(S|D).",
        "Since the motivation of introducing the hidden state ‘information source’ S is to strip off the common words and have important content words kept, we want the noisy channel P(S|D) to be a sampling process where important content words have higher chances to be selected than common words.",
        "Let function g(dw,D) stands for the importance of the word dw related to the document D. Then, the word sampling distribution should be proportional to the word importance function g(dw,D).",
        "Therefore, we can write the probability P(S|D)",
        "As indicated by Equation (5), the probability for ‘information source’ S to represent the content of the document D, i.e. P(S|D), is proportional to the product of the importance function values for all the words selected by ‘information source’ S."
