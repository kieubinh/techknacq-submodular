        "Unknown words are a major bottleneck for learners of any language, due to the high overhead involved in looking them up in a dictionary.",
        "This is particularly true in non-alphabetic languages such as Japanese, as there is no easy way of looking up the component characters of new words.",
        "This research attempts to alleviate the dictionary lookup bottleneck by way of a comprehensive dictionary interface which allows Japanese learners to look up Japanese words in an efficient, robust manner.",
        "While the proposed method is directly transferable to other language pairs, for the purposes of this paper, we will focus exclusively on a Japanese–English dictionary interface.",
        "The Japanese writing system consists of the three orthographies of hiragana, katakana and kanji, which appear intermingled in modern-day texts (NLI, 1986).",
        "The hiragana and katakana syllabaries, collectively referred to as kana, are relatively small (46 characters each), and each character takes a unique and mutually exclusive reading which can easily be memorized.",
        "Thus they do not present a major difficulty for the learner.",
        "Kanji characters (ideograms), on the other hand, present a much bigger obstacle.",
        "The high number of these characters (1,945 prescribed by the government for daily use, and up to 3,000 appearing in newspapers and formal publications) in itself presents a challenge, but the matter is further complicated by the fact that each character can and often does take on several different and frequently unrelated readings.",
        "The kanji -R, for example, has readings including hatsu and ta(tsu), whereas -�q has readings including omote, hyou and arawa(reru).",
        "Based on simple combinatorics, therefore, the kanji compound -R-�q happyou “announcement” can take at least 6 basic readings, and when one considers phonological and conjugational variation, this number becomes much greater.",
        "Learners presented with the string 4M for the first time will, therefore, have a possibly large number of potential readings (conditioned on the number of component character readings they know) to choose from.",
        "The problem is further complicated by the occurrence of character combinations which do not take on compositional readings.",
        "For example FJLJf kaze “common cold” is formed non-compositionally from FAL kaze/fuu “wind” and W yokoshima/ja “evil”.",
        "With paper dictionaries, lookup typically occurs in two forms: (a) directly based on the reading of the entire word, or (b) indirectly via component kanji characters and an index of words involving those kanji.",
        "Clearly in the first case, the correct reading of the word must be known in order to look it up, which is often not the case.",
        "In the second case, the complicated radical and stroke count systems make the kanji lookup process cumbersome and time consuming.",
        "With electronic dictionaries – both commercial and publicly available (e.g. EDICT (2000)) – the options are expanded somewhat.",
        "In addition to reading and kanji-based look-up, for electronic texts, simply copying and pasting the desired string into the dictionary lookup window gives us direct access to the word.'.",
        "Several reading-aid systems 'Although even here, life is complicated by Japanese being a non-segmenting language, putting the onus on the user to (e.g. Reading Tutor (Kitamura and Kawamura, 2000) and Rikai2) provide greater assistance by segmenting longer texts and outputing individual translations for each segment (word).",
        "If the target text is available only in hard copy, it is possible to use kana-kanji conversion to manually input component kanji, assuming that at least one reading or lexical instantiation of those kanji is known by the user.",
        "Essentially, this amounts to individually inputting the readings of words the desired kanji appear in, and searching through the candidates returned by the kana-kanji conversion system.",
        "Again, this is complicated and time inefficient so the need for a more user-friendly dictionary lookup remains.",
        "In this paper we describe the FOKS (Forgiving Online Kanji Search) system, that allows a learner to use his/her knowledge of kanji to the fullest extent in looking up unknown words according to their expected, but not necessarily correct, reading.",
        "Learners are exposed to certain kanji readings before others, and quickly develop a sense of the pervasiveness of different readings.",
        "We attempt to tap into this intuition, in predicting how Japanese learners will read an arbitrary kanji string based on the relative frequency of readings of the component kanji, and also the relative rates of application of phonological processes.",
        "An overall probability is attained for each candidate reading using the naive Bayes model over these component probabilities.",
        "Below, we describe how this is intended to mimic the cognitive ability of a learner, how the system interacts with a user and how it benefits a user.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the preprocessing steps of reading generation and ranking.",
        "Section 3 describes the actual system as is currently visible on the internet.",
        "Finally, Section 4 provides an analysis and evaluation of the system."

        "Our system, on the other hand, does not assume 100% accurate knowledge of readings, but instead expects readings to be predictably derived from the source kanji.",
        "What we do assume is that the user is able to determine word boundaries, which is in reality a non-trivial task due to Japanese being non-segmenting (see Kurohashi et al.",
        "(1994) and Na-gata (1994), among others, for details of automatic segmentation methods).",
        "In a sense, the problem of word segmentation is distinct from the dictionary lookup task, so we do not tackle it in this paper.",
        "To be able to infer how kanji characters can be read, we first determine all possible readings a kanji character can take based on automatically-derived alignment data.",
