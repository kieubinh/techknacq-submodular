        "In recent years, significant progress has been made in using text analysis methods to extract information from document text, with the ultimate goal of supporting a variety of applications that rely on document meaning.",
        "Starting with the simplest word-based feature extractors (see, for example, BaezaYates and Ribeiro-Neto, 1999), these methods are maturing into a rich set of symbolic and numerical methods (as, for example, in Rindflesch2000) for identifying and organizing text segments that correspond to human conceptual understanding of the texts' meaning.",
        "This paper describes glossary extraction, an important component of text understanding systems.",
        "The objective of glossary extraction is to identify and organize words and phrases from documents into sets of \"glossary items\".",
        "Domain-specific glossaries, consisting of items drawn from large collections of documents for particular domains, contain an account of the important conceptual material in the domains.",
        "Specifically, glossary items name and describe the domain concepts in a way that can be exploited by applications.",
        "The items can consist of canonical and variant forms of the concepts' names, syntactic information about the forms, definitions of the underlying concepts, and relationships that link concepts.",
        "Glossary items are different from technical terms as described, for example, by Justeson and Katz (1995).",
        "In the present paper, we will show that glossary items result from the identification of single-word forms, abbreviations, verbs, and salience.",
        "The techniques used to make these identifications include part-of-speech tagging and parsing, induction and application of abbreviation rules, aggregation of multiple forms, and statistical computations of item distribution.",
        "These all go significantly beyond the manipulation of noun phrases typically used for term identification.",
        "Nevertheless, the principles of term identification play an important role in the recognition of forms of which glossary items may consist.",
        "In glossary-based applications, we use the following three-part scenario.",
        "We begin with glossary extraction to automatically extract candidate items from a large collection of documents from the application domain.",
        "Next, using a glossary administration system, we present the candidate glossary to a domain expert or librarian for review, modification, and approval.",
        "The final approved glossary is made available, through suitable APIs, to the application system.",
        "Applications for domain-specific glossaries range from those that support direct human use to those that address the needs of computers.",
        "Human use is supported by published glossaries, on-line glossary reference tools, and authoring environments that use glossaries to enable or enforce terminological consistency.",
        "An example we've seen is in an engineering environment where glossary items are the only approved names of features in CAD drawings.",
        "Computers can use glossaries for document indexing and search, federation of heterogeneous document collections, document summarization and keyword extraction, and automated construction of domain taxonomies and ontologies.",
        "Many of these applications appear in knowledge portals (Mack et al.",
        ", 2001).",
        "Glossary extraction is one application of Textract, the text analysis system being developed by the Text Analysis and Language Engineering (\"Talent\") project at IBM Research.",
        "In Textract, text analysis is performed by flexible configurations of analyzers (also called \"annotators\" or \"plugins\") which interact by communicating their various analyses of a document's text through annotations.",
        "Textract currently contains some tens of analyzers for functions such as tokenization, lexical lookup and morphological analysis (IBM Research, 2001), named-entity identification, part-of-speech tagging, shallow parsing, anaphora resolution, topic segmentation, and relation extraction.",
        "Talent applications, also built from configurable Textract plugins, use the resulting annotations for various purposes such as summarization (Boguraev and Neff, 2000), lexical network extraction (Cooper and Byrd, 1997), document collection indexing, as well as glossary extraction.",
        "Our approach to building text analyzers allows us to achieve several crucial goals: through reconfiguration, we can address diverse applications; by using shallow and finite-state methods, we obtain the speed and scale required by realistic applications; with analysis methods which are either trainable (e.g., HMM part-of-speech taggers) or easily parameterized (e.g., finite-state transducers), we can customize our analyzers and address applications in multiple languages.",
        "The remainder of the paper details the glossary extraction process.",
        "We first identify candidate glossary item forms, by recognizing specific syntactic structures in POS-tagged text (section 2.2).",
        "Second, we filter generic (Le, non-domain-specific) pre-modifiers from the candidate forms (section 2.3).",
        "Third, we aggregate forms that are variant names for the same concept into candidate glossary items (section 3).",
        "Finally, we use statistical information to rank candidate items and to compute confidence values which can be used for subsequent filtering of the candidate glossary (section 4).",
        "Section 5 presents sample output from glossary extraction, along with an informal evaluation of its accuracy.",
        "Section 6 concludes the paper and describes ongoing work based on glossary extraction.",
        "2 A Glossary Extraction Algorithm We identify single-word and multi-word glossary items in text.",
        "Most terminology extraction systems (Dias et al.",
        "�2000; Damerau, 1993; Jacquemin, 1995) have been focused only on extracting multi-word noun phrases.",
        "However, verbs and single-word nouns in domain-specific documents also contain domain information.",
        "We also pay attention to out-of-vocabulary words 1 because most technical jargon is not likely to be included in a general-purpose dictionary."

        "For noun phrases, we derived the structure",
        "of noun phrases based on the study by Justeson and Katz (1995), and domain experts' analysis on the documents in one of our experiment domains.",
        "Figure 1 shows how noun phrases are recognized.",
        "In this figure, lexical units are represented by Penn Treebank Tag codes (Marcus and Santorini, 1993), where DT denotes a determiner, VBG and VBN denote participle forms of verbs, JJ denotes an adjective, CC denotes a conjunction, and NN, NP, NPS denote nouns."

      "heading": "2.2 Identification of Candidate Glossary Items",
      "text": [
        "A common strategy for technical terminology identification, given the relatively simple \"contour\" of a term noun phrase, is to detect such phrases by means of lexical, part-of-speech driven, filtering (see Justeson and Katz, 1995, for an argument in favour of such an approach).",
        "The identification of candidate glossary items, however, poses challenges which cannot be met by a simple lexical filter.",
        "For one thing, the noun phrase structure defined in Figure 1 is more complex than that of a term phrase, and the length of a glossary item does regularly exceed the average length of technical terms (even without accepting trailing prepositional phrases.",
        "Greater length makes a recognizer more susceptible to part-of-speech ambiguities.",
        "In addition, identification of verbal glossary items is equally open to problems of ambiguity, which cannot be resolved by lexical lookup alone.",
        "This leads us to adopt a \"pipeline\" architecture, where look-up, morphological analysis, and part-of-speech tagging run as preprocessors to the glossary extraction process.",
        "Note that such an architecture allows for natural \"insertion\" into the pipeline of additional filters (such as named entity or URL recognition; see below) prohibiting certain phrases which fit the contour of Figure 1 from being considered as good glossary item candidates.",
        "The grammar sketched in Figure 1 is derivative of a larger grammar for noun phrases, itself a part of a shallow parser (for English) realized as a cascade of finite-state (FS) transducers (Boguraev, 2000).",
        "There are a number of reasons for using FS technology for a task like the one here (see, for instance, Karttunen et al., 1996; Kornai, 1999).",
        "We are particularly concerned with issues of re-usability of grammars (in the sense just described, where a general-purpose NP grammar with known properties and coverage is trimmed/modified in an adaptation for a narrower range of patterns), adaptability to different domains and/or applications (where the overall contour of a glossary item would remain substantially unchanged, but for relatively minor/local domain-specific changes), and portability across languages.",
        "This last consideration is essential for a number of applications, where glossary extraction needs to be carried out over multilingual text collections.",
        "In principle, it is easier to adapt an implementation to a different language, if phrasal patterns are specified as linguistic abstractions, interpreted by a language-independent engine.",
        "Moreover, using FS techniques, it is possible to focus on a class of relatively simple (and, specifically, context-independent) linguistic patterns such as noun phrases, verb groups, subordinate clauses and specify these as cascaded constraints, largely language-independent (see Kinyon, 2001, for compiling language-independent \"chunkers\").",
        "Our pipeline architecture requires a special-purpose FS parsing regime.",
        "In order to be able to integrate, seamlessly, a number of preprocessors and filters in a reconfigurable environment for document collection processing, the results of linguistic analysis of any type are couched in terms of posting annotations over text spans.",
        "Noun phrases are just one example of such annotations; in principle, there is no a priori limit on the annotations' number and types: words, named entities, special tokens, phrases, chunks, sentences, and so forth are all annotations.",
        "While allowing for very tight coupling among arbitrary sets of linguistic analysis components, this representation effectively \"hides\" the view of a document as a sequence of characters.",
        "We have developed a generalization of the notion of character-based finite state transduction, in order to be able to define patterns in terms of annotations, and have a finite-state executor read from, and write to, an annotation repository.",
        "The details of this FS model are outside the scope of this paper, but we will note here that in general, this approach not only improves, substantially, the efficiency of an FS-based recognizer, but also makes it very natural to implement finite-state cascades, such as the one employed by our glossary extraction procedure, incorporating look-up, named entity identification, part-of-speech tagging, and candidate glossary item identification.",
        "We discard some kinds of the recognized forms from the candidate set.",
        "These forms are as follows:",
        "• Forms having more than 6 words • Person names and place names (Ravin et al.",
        "1997) • Special tokens such as URLs and words containing special symbols except hyphens and dashes",

        "Many pre-modifiers in noun phrases, even in domain-specific noun phrases, act as general-purpose modifiers rather than representing domain-specific information.",

        "First, these adjectives may weaken the domain-specificity of the term they modify.",
        "As a result, the terms may have lower confidence values.",
        "Second, there may exist many essentially identical forms with slightly different modifiers, which we don't want to keep separately in a domain-specific dictionary.",
        "For example, we would like to have a term vehicle instead of having three different terms such as particular vehicle, other vehicle and real vehicle.",
        "Thus, if a candidate noun phrase contains a generic pre-modifier, we remove it from the noun phrase and take the remaining noun phrase as a candidate form.",
        "How can we decide if a pre-modifier is domain-specific or generic?",

        "The decision process is shown in Figure 2.",
