        "It is commonly believed that word segmentation accuracy is monotonically related to retrieval performance in Chinese information retrieval.",
        "In this paper we show that, for Chinese, the relationship between segmentation and retrieval performance is in fact nonmonotonic; that is, at around 70% word segmentation accuracy an over-segmentation phenomenon begins to occur which leads to a reduction in information retrieval performance.",
        "We demonstrate this effect by presenting an empirical investigation of information retrieval on Chinese TREC data, using a wide variety of word segmentation algorithms with word segmentation accuracies ranging from 44% to 95%.",
        "It appears that the main reason for the drop in retrieval performance is that correct compounds and collocations are preserved by accurate segmenters, while they are broken up by less accurate (but reasonable) segmenters, to a surprising advantage.",
        "This suggests that words themselves might be too broad a notion to conveniently capture the general semantic meaning of Chinese text."

        "Automated processing of written languages such as Chinese involves an inherent word segmentation problem that is not present in western languages like English.",
        "Unlike English, Chinese words are not explicitly delimited by whitespace, and therefore to perform automated text processing tasks (such as information retrieval) one normally has to first segment the text collection.",
        "Typically this involves segmenting the text into individual words.",
        "Although the text segmentation problem in Chinese has been heavily investigated recently (Brent and Tao, 2001; Chang, 1997; Ge et al., 1999; Hockenmaier and Brew, 1998; Jin, 1992; Peng and Schuurmans, 2001; Sproat and Shih, 1990; Teahan et al., 2001) most research has focused on the problem of segmenting character strings into individual words, rather than useful constituents.",
        "However, we have found that focusing exclusively on words may not lead to the most effective segmentation from the perspective of broad semantic analysis (Peng et al., 2002).",
        "In this paper we will focus on a simple form of semantic text processing: information retrieval (IR).",
        "Although information retrieval does not require a deep semantic analysis, to perform effective retrieval one still has to accurately capture the main topic of discourse and relate this to a given query.",
        "In the context of Chinese, information retrieval is complicated by the fact that the words in the source text (and perhaps even the query) are not separated by whites-pace.",
        "This creates a significant amount of additional ambiguity in interpreting sentences and identifying the underlying topic of discourse.",
        "There are two standard approaches to information retrieval in Chinese text: character based and word based.",
        "It is usually thought that word based approaches should be superior, even though character based methods are simpler and more commonly used (Huang and Robertson, 2000).",
        "However, there has been recent interest in the word based approach, motivated by recent advances in automatic segmentation of Chinese text (Nie et al., 1996; Wu and Tseng, 1993).",
        "A common presumption is that word segmentation accuracy should monotonically influence subsequent retrieval performance (Palmer and Burger, 1997).",
        "Consequently, many researchers have focused on producing accurate word segmenters for Chinese text indexing (Teahan et al., 2001; Brent and Tao, 2001).",
        "However, we have recently observed that low accuracy word segmenters often yield superior retrieval performance (Peng et al., 2002).",
        "This observation was initially a surprise, and motivated us to conduct a more thorough study of the phenomenon to uncover the reason for the performance decrease.",
        "The relationship between Chinese word segmentation accuracy and information retrieval performance has recently been investigated in the literature.",
        "Foo and Li (2001) have conducted a series of experiments which suggests that the word segmentation approach does indeed have effect on IR performance.",
        "Specifically, they observe that the recognition of words of length two or more can produce better retrieval performance, and the existence of ambiguous words resulting from the word segmentation process can decrease retrieval performance.",
        "Similarly, Palmer and Burger (1997) observe that accurate segmentation tends to improve retrieval performance.",
        "All of this previous research has indicated that there is indeed some sort of correlation between word segmentation performance and retrieval performance.",
        "However, the nature of this correlation is not well understood, and previous research uniformly suggests that this relationship is monotonic.",
        "One reason why the relationship between segmentation and retrieval performance has not been well understood is that previous investigators have not considered using a variety of Chinese word segmenters which exhibit a wide range of segmentation accuracies, from low to high.",
        "In this paper, we employ three families of Chinese word segmentation algorithms from the recent literature.",
        "The first technique we employed was the standard maximum matching dictionary based approach.",
        "The remaining two algorithms were selected because they can both be altered by simple parameter settings to obtain different word segmentation accuracies.",
        "Specifically, the second Chinese word segmenter we investigated was the minimum description length algorithm of Teahan et al.",
        "(2001), and the third was the EM based technique of Peng and Schuurmans (2001).",
        "Overall, these segmenters demonstrate word identification accuracies ranging from 44% to 95% on the PH corpus (Brent and Tao, 2001; Hockenmaier and Brew, 1998; Teahan et al., 2001).",
        "Below we first describe the segmentation algorithms we used, and then discuss the information retrieval environment considered (in Sections 2 and 3 respectively).",
        "Section 4 then reports on the outcome of our experiments on Chinese TREC data, and in Section 5 we attempt to determine the reason for the over-segmentation phenomenon witnessed."

        "We considered a refined term weighting scheme based on the the standard term weighting function",
        "where N is the number of indexed documents in the collection, and n is the number of documents containing a specific term (Spark Jones, 1979).",

        "Here tf is within-document term frequency, qtf is within-query term frequency, dl is the length of the document, avdl is the average document length, and c1, c2, c3 are tuning constants that depend on the database, the nature of the queries, and are empirically determined.",
        "However, to truly achieve state-of-the-art retrieval performance, and also to allow for the quality of retrieval to be manipulated, we further augmented this standard term weighting scheme with an extra correction term",

        "The observations were surprising to us at first, although they suggest that there is an interesting phenomenon at work.",
        "To attempt to identify the underlying cause, we break the explanation into two parts: one for the first part of the curves where retrieval performance increases with increasing segmentation accuracy, and a second effect for the region where retrieval performance plateaus and eventually decreases with increasing segmentation accuracy.",
        "The first part of these performance curves seems easy to explain.",
        "At low segmentation accuracies the segmented tokens do not correspond to meaningful linguistic terms, such as words, which hampers retrieval performance because the term weighting procedure is comparing arbitrary tokens to the query.",
        "However, as segmentation accuracy improves, the tokens behave more like true words and the retrieval engine begins to behave more conventionally.",
        "However, after a point, when the second regime is reached, retrieval performance no longer increases with improved segmentation accuracy, and eventually begins to decrease.",
        "One possible explanation for this which we have found is that a weak word segmenter accidentally breaks compound words into smaller constituents, and this, surprisingly yields a beneficial effect for Chinese information retrieval.",
        "For example, one of the test queries, Topic 34, is about the impact of droughts in various parts of China.",
        "Retrieval based on the EM-70% segmenter retrieved 84 of 95 relevant documents in the collection, whereas retrieval based on the PPM-95% segmenter retrieved only 52 relevant documents.",
        "In fact, only 2 relevant documents were missed by EM70% but retrieved by PPM-95%, whereas 34 docu",
        "ments retrieved by EM-70% and not by PPM-95%.",
        "In investigating this phenomenon, one finds that the performance drop appears to be due to the inherent nature of written Chinese.",
        "That is, in written Chinese many words can often legally be represented their subparts.",
        "For example, V 1T 4�j(agriculture plants) is sometimes represented as JT44�(plants).",
        "So for example in Topic 34, the PPM-95% segmenter correctly segments t k as t k(drought disaster) and V 1T 4� correctly as V 1T 4� (agriculture plants), whereas the EM-70% segmenter incorrectly segments t k as t(drought) and k(disaster), and incorrectly segments V JT 4� as V(agriculture) and JT44� (plants).",
        "However, by inspecting the relevant documents for Topic 34, we find that there are many Chinese character strings in these documents that are closely related to the correctly segmented word t-k(drought disaster).",
        "These alternative words are �` , �` , A �` , T �` , r �` , T C etc.",
        "For example, in the relevant document “pd9105-832”, which is ranked 60th by EM-70% and 823rd by PPM-95%, the correctly segmented word t k does",
        "not appear at all.",
        "Consequently, the correct segmentation for t k by PPM-95% leads to a much weaker match than the incorrect segmentation of EM-70%.",
        "Here EM-70% segments t k into �T- and k , which is not regarded as a correct segmentation.",
        "However, there are many matches between the topic and relevant documents which contain only .",
        "This same phenomenon happens with the query word V JT 4� since many documents only contain the fragment ITA instead of V JIF4t, and these documents are all missed by PPM-95% but captured by EM70%.",
        "Although straightforward, these observations suggest a different trajectory for future research on Chinese information retrieval.",
        "Instead of focusing on achieving accurate word segmentation, we should pay more attention to issues such as keyword weighting (Huang and Robertson, 2000) and query keyword extraction (Chien et al., 1997).",
        "Also, we find that the weak unsupervised segmentation method",
        "based yields better Chinese retrieval performance than the other approaches, which suggests a promising new avenue to apply machine learning techniques to IR (Sparck Jones, 1991).",
        "Of course, despite these results we expect highly accurate word segmentation to still play an important role in other Chinese information processing tasks such as information extraction and machine translation.",
        "This suggests that some different evaluation standards for Chinese word segmentation should be given to different NLP applications."
