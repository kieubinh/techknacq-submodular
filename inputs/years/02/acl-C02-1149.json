        "Electronic machinery is becoming smaller; recent developments in palmtop and mobile-phone technologies offer dramatic examples of this process.",
        "Since smaller machines are more portable, their users have freer access to information.",
        "Here, however, the user interface is a major issue.",
        "If a machine is being used as a medium for person-to-person communications, a natural interface might be speech-based.",
        "For other tasks, however, like browsing through Internet pages or looking up databases, the most natural tool for control and data entry is still the keyboard.",
        "Mobile machines offer little surface space, so only a few buttons are available for the entry of text.",
        "The most representative form is the use of 10 keys for text entry on mobile phones.",
        "However, even smaller machines continue to appear, such as watch-sized computers.",
        "It might not be possible to equip such machines with more than four or five buttons.",
        "Questions then arise.",
        "Is it possible to enter text with a small number of buttons?",
        "What about four buttons?",
        "How efficient can we make this?",
        "Other potential applications for text entry with four buttons include the control panels of office machines and household machines.",
        "Although these machines increasingly contain functions that allow access to the Internet, sufficient surface space for a full keyboard is often not available.",
        "Another potential application is in text-entry interfaces for elderly and disabled people.",
        "A report (of Advanced Design of Integrated Information Society, 2000) indicates that keyboard operation is the highest hurdle to the use of computers by the aged.",
        "The situation is even worse for people with hand-related disabilities.",
        "A text-entry device with four large buttons might facilitate human-machine communications by such people.",
        "The idea of decreasing the number of keys on the keyboard in itself is not new.",
        "The oldest realization of this idea is the stenotype keyboards.",
        "With the recent popularity of mobile machines, researchers have become increasingly interested in one-handed keyboards (Mathias et al., 1996).",
        "Most of the work to date in this field has been related to mobile phones.",
        "Text entry on current-generation devices remains cumbersome, so innovative companies(Tegic 9, 2000)(ZI-Corp., 2000)(Slangsoft, 2000) have proposed predictive methods for the more efficient entry of text by implementing a method that had first been proposed some years earlier(Rau and Skiena, 1994).",
        "The results of several studies have verified its effi-ciency(James and Reischel, 2001)(Tanaka-Ishii et al., 2000), so the technology looks promising in the context of mobile phones.",
        "Our study goes further in decreasing the number of buttons than the above-cited studies.",
        "In our study, we tried various text-entry methods and found the predictive method to be the best.",
        "As far as we know, no other study that includes the application of a language model has yet been carried out in this context; neither has the efficiency of this approach been examined.",
        "Additionally, the major contribution is our study of the potential power of a language model by examining its actual efficiency on a device with few buttons.",

        "We also impose the constraint that the buttons may only be pressed one at a time, because the inclusion of key-chords increases the actual number of buttons by including the combinations of keys.",

        "We have presented TouchMeKey4, a text entry device that requires only four buttons, and aspects of its design and testing.",
        "Several characters of the alphabet are assigned to each of four buttons and the user enters a document with the aid of a predictive text-entry system.",
        "The device is realized by software that estimates the word that most probably corresponds with",
        "the user input.",
        "The estimate is based on an adaptive-statistical language model.",
        "Firstly, a base model is constructed from a large body of text from newspapers; the model is then adapted to the local context by using a smaller user corpus of 10 thousand words.",
        "Our evaluation shows that text entry with this system is as efficient as text entry on a mobile phone.",
        "The number of keystrokes is reducible to a number below that required on a full keyboard.",
        "The average speed of our test subjects was 14 words per minute, and the fastest subject recorded 23 wpm.",
        "We also discussed the possibility of entering text via even fewer keys, e.g., three keys.",
        "However, the usability of a three-key device turned out to be questionable, because the number of keys needed to enter text becomes large.",
        "Our future direction will be to investigate the actual application of the system on smaller machines and to develop a text-entry system for use by elderly and disabled people."
