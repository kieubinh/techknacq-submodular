        "The XTAG Project (Joshi, 2001) is an ongoing project at the University of Pennsylvania since about 1988, aiming at the development of natural language resources based on Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAGs) (Joshi and Schabes, 1997).",
        "Perhaps the most successful experience in it has been the construction of a wide-coverage Lexicalized TAG for English (Doran et al., 2000; XTAG Research Group, 2001), based on ideas initially developed in (Krock and Joshi, 1985).",
        "As the grammar grew larger, the process of consistent grammar development and maintenance became harder (Vijay-Shanker and Schabes, 1992).",
        "An LTAG is a set of lexicalized elementary trees that can be combined, through the operations of tree adjunction and tree substitution, to derive syntactic structures for sentences.",
        "Driven by locality principles, each elementary tree for a given lexical head is expected to contain its projection, and slots for its arguments (e.g., (Frank, 2001)).",
        "Keeping up with these principles, one can easily see that the number of required elementary trees is huge for a grammar with reasonable coverage of syntactic phenomena.",
        "Under the XTAG project, for engineering reasons, the grammar has been split up in (roughly) two main components1: a set tree templates lexicalized by a 1 For a more accurate description of the XTAG system architecture, see (XTAG Research Group, 2001) or (Doran et al., syntactic category, and a lexicon with each word selecting its appropriate tree templates.",
        "Figure 1 shows typical grammar template trees that can be selected by lexical items and combined to generate the structure in Figure 2.",
        "The derivation tree, to the right, contains the history of the tree grafting process that generated the derived tree, to the left.2",
        "dow Although various syntactic categories have multiple syntactic frames available (e.g., prepositions may have different kinds of arguments, nouns and adjectives may have arguments or not, etc.",
        "), it is the verbs that exhibit the most wild variety of domains of locality: from the 1004 template trees in",
        "the XTAG grammar, 783 are for verbs, almost 80%.",
        "That happens because the grammar tries to capture in elementary trees the locality for each of the diverse syntactic structures related transformationally to each other (the effect of long distance movement is captured by adjunction of the intervening material).",
        "Examples of required tree templates are: declarative transitive (the example above); ditransi-tive passive with wh-subject moved; and intransitive with PP object with the PP-object relativized.",
        "As early noticed by (Vijay-Shanker and Schabes, 1992) the information regarding syntactic structure and feature equations in (feature-based) LTAGs is repeated across templates trees in a quite regular way, that perhaps could be more concisely captured than by just having a plain set of elementary trees.",
        "Besides the obvious linguistic relevance, as a pure engineering issue, the success of such enterprise would result in enormous benefits for grammar development and maintenance.",
        "Several approaches have been proposed in the literature describing compact representations methods for LTAGs, perhaps the best known being (Vijay-Shanker and Schabes, 1992), (Candito, 1996; Can-dito, 1998), (Evans et al., 1995; Evans et al., 2000), (Xia et al., 1998; Xia, 2001), and (Becker, 1993; Becker, 1994; Becker, 2000).",

        "We present in this section an introductory example of metarules.4 Consider the two trees in Figure 3 3 This work started years ago, already mentioned in (Doran et al., 2000, p. 388).",
        "There has been some confusion on the issue, perhaps driven by a somewhat ambiguous statement in (Becker, 2000, p. 331): “In this paper, we present the various patterns which are used in the implementation of metarules which we added to the XTAG system (Doran et al.",
        "2000)”.",
        "The work of Becker conceived and developed the idea of metarules for TAGs (Becker, 1993; Becker, 1994).",
        "He also created the original implementation of the metarule interpreter as part of the XTAG software, from 1993 to 1995, thereafter improved to reach a first stable form as documented in (XTAG Research Group, 1998).",
        "However, with respect to grammar development, he only created the necessary example patterns to support the concepts of metarules, while the work described here is the first",
        "anchored by verbs that take as arguments an NP and a PP (e.g., put).",
        "The one to the left corresponds to its declarative structure; the other to the wh-subject extracted form.",
        "Despite their complexity, they share most of their structure: the only differences being the wh-site in the right tree (higher NP) and the trace at subject position.",
        "That observation would not be very useful if the differential description we have made was idiosyncratic to this pair, which is not the case.",
        "Clearly, many other pairs all over the grammar will share the same differential description.",
        "Figure 4 shows a metarule for wh-subject extraction that captures the similarities mentioned above.",
        "It describes how to automatically generate the tree in Figure 3.b, given as input the tree in Figure 3.a.",
        "Here is how it works.",

        "In the example, the lhs tree requires the candidate tree to have its root labeled S,.. Then, its leftmost child has to be an NP, as indicated by the node ?2NP?",
        "in lhs: ?2 indicates it is the variable #2; NP?",
        "indicates we need an NP, regardless of the subscript.",
        "Next, the lhs tree requires the rest of the tree to match variable ?1.",
        "That is trivial, because such variables with just an identification number are “wild cards” that match any range of subtrees.",
        "The matches of each variable in lhs, for the application to the input tree in Figure 3.a, are shown in Figure 5.",
        "Had the matching process failed no new tree would have been generated.",
        "Since in the example above the matching succeeded, the processor move",
        "to the final step, which is to generate the new tree.",
        "We look at the right-hand side of the metarule rhs and just replace the instances of the variables there with their matched values, obtaining the tree in Figure 3.b.",
        "The same process can be applied for the many other pairs related by the same metarule.",
        "In a feature-based grammar as the one we are focusing on, to create tree structures without the proper feature equations is of little use.",
        "On the other hand, experience has shown that feature equations are much harder to maintain correct and consistent in the grammar than the tree structures.",
        "The XTAG metarules use features in two ways: as matching requirements, and for transformation purposes."

        "Given the experiment we have reported in this paper, it seems undeniable that such approach should be considered at least valid.",

        "The ideas of compact representation of the lexicon are certainly not new, with well known concrete proposals for diverse frameworks (Bresnan, 1982; Gazdar et al., 1985; Pollard and Sag, 1997).",
        "For LTAGs, in particular, there has been quite a few proposals, as we have already mentioned (Vijay-Shanker and Schabes, 1992; Becker, 1993; Candito, 1996; Evans et al., 1995; Xia, 2001), and even large-scale grammars built with them, e.g., the French grammar in (Abeille and Candito, 2000) and an English one in (Xia, 2001).",
        "The work we described in this paper evaluates a particular approach to grammar generation from compact representation.",
        "On the one hand, it tests the hypothesis that Becker’s tree-transformation rules, the ’metarules’, fit well the LTAG formalism and can be effectively and efficiently used to build large-scale such grammars.",
        "On the other hand, the facility with which a natural partial ordering of such rules is obtained (here simplified as a total order for practical reasons), dismisses the debate concerning free-generation, unboundedness, and also weakens the arguments concerning the non-directionality of the metarules, suggesting that they might be more of an academic nature.",
        "A major strength of the approach is to have set a target grammar with which to compare.",
        "A detailed qualitative evaluation of the mismatches between the existing and generated grammars was obtained that allows us to access not only the weaknesses of the generation process but also the problems of the original grammar development: e.g., the inconsistency in the treatment of the interface between the lexicon and the tree templates.",
        "Future work in the XTAG group includes the construction of a graph based interface for metarules that allows the application of metarules according 10Of course, this may not reflect Becker’s view.",
        "to a partial order, as well as distinct treatment for different families.11 We are also interested in aspects of the use of metarules to enhance extracted grammars (Kinyon and Prolo, 2002)."
