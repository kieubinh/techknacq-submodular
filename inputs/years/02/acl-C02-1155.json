        "In the past, most of previous works on text classification focus on classifying text documents into a set of flat categories.",
        "The task is to classify documents into a predefined set of categories (or classes) (Lewis and Ringuetee, 1994; Eui-Hong and Karypis, 2000) where there are no structural relationships among these categories.",
        "Many existing databases are organized in this type of flat structure, such as Reuters newswire, OHSUMED and TREC.",
        "To improve classification accuracy, a variety of learning techniques are developed, including regression models (Yang and Chute, 1992), nearest neighbour classification (Yang and Liu, 1999), Bayesian approaches (Lewis and Ringuetee, 1994; McCallum et al., 1998), decision trees (Lewis and Ringuetee 1994), neural networks (Wiener et al.,1995) and support vector machines (Dumais and Chen, 2000).",
        "However, it is very difficult to browse or search documents in flat categories when there are a large number of categories.",
        "As a more efficient method, one possible natural extension to flat categories is to arrange documents in topic hierarchy instead of a simple flat structure.",
        "When people organize extensive data sets into fine-grained classes, topic hierarchy is often employed to make the large collection of classes (categories) more manageable.",
        "This structure is known as category hierarchy.",
        "Many popular search engines and text databases apply this structure, such as Yahoo, Google Directory, Netscape search and MEDLINE.",
        "There are many recent works attempting to automate text classification based on this category hierarchy (McCallum et al., 1998; Chuang W. T. et al., 2000).",
        "However, with a large number of classes or a large hierarchy, the problem of sparse training data per class at the lower levels in the hierarchy raises and results in decreasing classification accuracy of lower classes.",
        "As another problem, the traditional category hierarchy may be too rigid for us to construct since there exist several possible category hierarchies for a data set.",
        "To cope with these problems, this paper proposes a new framework, called multidimensional framework, for text classification.",
        "The framework allows multiple predefined sets of categories (viewed as multiple dimensions) instead of a single set of categories like flat categories.",
        "While each set of classes with some training examples (documents) attached to each class, represents a criterion to classify a new text document based on such examples, multiple sets of classes enable several criteria.",
        "Documents are classified based on these multiple criteria (dimensions) and assigned a class per criterion (dimension).",
        "Two merits in the multidimensional approach are (1) the support of multiple viewpoints of classification, (2) a solution to data sparseness problem.",
        "The efficiency of multidimensional classification is investigated using three classifiers: k-NN, naïve Bayes and centroid-based methods."

        "Category is a powerful tool to manage a large number of text documents.",
        "By grouping text documents into a set of categories, it is possible for us to efficiently keep or search for information we need.",
        "At this point, the structure of categories, called category model, becomes one of the most important factors that determine the efficiency of organizing text documents.",
        "In the past, two traditional category models, called flat and hierarchical category models, were applied in organizing text documents.",
        "However, these models have a number of disadvantages as follows.",
        "For the flat category model, when the number of categories becomes larger, it faces with difficulty of browsing or searching the categories.",
        "For the hierarchical category model, constructing a good hierarchy is a complicated task.",
        "In many cases, it is not intuitive to determine the upward/downward relations among categories.",
        "There are several possible hierarchies for the same document set.",
        "Since hierarchies in the hierarchical category model are static, browsing and searching documents along the hierarchy are always done in a fix order, from the root to a leaf node.",
        "Therefore, the searching flexibility is lost.",
        "As an alternative to flat and hierarchical category models, the multidimensional category is introduced.",
        "So far the concept of multidimensional data model has been very well known in the field of database technology.",
        "The model was shown to be powerful in modeling a data warehouse or OLAP to allow users to store, view and utilize relational data efficiently (Jiawei and Micheline, 2001).",
        "This section describes a way to apply multidimensional data model to text classification, so called multi",
        "dimensional category.",
        "The proposed model is an extension of flat category model, where documents are not classified into a single set of categories, instead they are classified into multiple sets.",
        "Each set of categories can be viewed as a dimension in the sense that documents may be classified into different kinds of categories.",
        "For example in Figure 1, a set of news issues (documents) can be classified into three dimensions, say TOPIC, ZONE and TOPIC, each including {sports, economics, politics, social, entertainment, science and technology}, {domestic, intra-continental, intercontinental} and {good news, bad news, neutral news}, respectively.",
        "A news issue in a Thailand newspaper titled “Airplanes attacked World Trader Center” can be classified into “social news”, “inter-continental”, “bad news” in the first, second and third dimensions, respectively.",
        "Comparing with flat and/or hierarchical category models, the multidimensional model has the following merits.",
        "First, it is more natural than flat model in the sense that a document could be classified basing on not a single criterion (one dimension) but multiple criteria (multiple dimensions).",
        "Secondly, in contrast with hierarchical model, it is possible for us to browse or search documents flexibly without the order constraint defined in the structure.",
        "Lastly, the multidimensional category model can be basically transformed to and represented by flat category or hierarchical category models, even the converses are not always intuitive.",
        "In the previous example, the corresponding flat and hierarchical models for the multidimensional model in Figure 1 are illustrated Figure 2 and 3, respectively.",
        "The total number of derived flat categories equals to the product of the number of categories in each dimension, i.e., 54(=6x3x3).",
        "In the derived hierarchical model, the number of leaf categories is also equivalent to 54 but there exist 24 (=6+6x3) internal categories.",
        "Note that the figure shows only one possible hierarchy where the dimensions ordered by TOPIC, ZONE and MOOD.",
        "However, there are totally 6 (=3!)",
        "possible hierarchies for the model in Figure 1.",
        "From a viewpoint of category representation, the fact that the derived flat model enumerates all combinations among categories, makes the representation of a class be more precise than the class in multidimensional model.",
        "However, from the viewpoint of relationship constraints in these models, the derived flat category model ignores the relationship among categories while the derived hierarchical model explicitly declares such relationship in a rigid manner, and the multidimensional model is a compromise between these two previous models.",
        "These different aspects affect classification efficiency as shown in the next section."
