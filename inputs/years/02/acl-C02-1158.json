        "MT have been proposed to overcome the difficulties of Rule-Based MT.",
        "These approaches correspond to Corpus-Based approach.",
        "Corpus Based approach uses translation examples that keep including linguistic knowledge.",
        "This means that the system can improve the quality of its translation only by adding new translation examples.",
        "However, in Statistical MT(Brown et al., 1990), large amounts of translation examples are required in order to obtain high-quality translation.",
        "Moreover, Example Based MT(Sato and Nagao, 1990; Watanabe and Takeda, 1998; Brown, 2001; Carl, 2001) which relies on various knowledge resources results in the same difficulties as Rule-Based MT.",
        "Therefore, Example-Based MT, which automatically acquires the translation rules from only bilingual text corpora, is very effective.",
        "However, existing Example-Based MT systems using the learning algorithms require large amounts of translation pairs to acquire high-quality translation rules.",
        "In Example-Based MT based on analogical reasoning(Malavazos, 2000; Guvenir, 1998), the different parts are replaced by variables to generalize translation examples as shown in (1) of Figure 1.",
        "However, the number of different parts of the two SL sentences must be same as the number of different parts of the two TL sentences.",
        "This means that the condition of acquisition of translation rules is very strict because this method allows only n:n mappings in the number of the different parts between the SL sentences and the TL sentences.",
        "As a result, many translation rules cannot be acquired.",
        "(McTait, 2001) generalizes both the different parts and the common parts as shown in Figure 1(2).",
        "This means that (McTait, 2001) allows m:n mappings in the number of the different parts, or the number of the common parts.",
        "However, it is difficult to acquire the translation rules that correspond to the lexicon level.",
        "On the other hand, we have proposed a method of Machine Translation using Inductive Learning with Genetic Algorithms (GA-ILMT) (Echizenya et al., 1996).",
        "This method automatically generates the similar translation examples from only given translation examples by applying genetic algorithms (Goldberg, 1989) as shown in (3a) of Figure 1.",
        "Moreover, the system performs Inductive Learning.",
        "By using Inductive Learning, the abstract translation rules are acquired by performing phased extraction of different parts as shown in Figure 1(3b) and (3c).",
        "In all methods shown in Figure 1, the condition of acquisition of translation rules is that two similar translation examples must exist.",
        "As a result, the systems require large amounts of translation examples.",
        "We propose a method of MT using Recursive Chain-link-type Learning as a method to overcome the above problem.",
        "In our method, the system acquires new translation rules from sparse data using other already acquired translation rules.",
        "For example, first, translation rule B is acquired by using translation rule A when the translation rule A exists in the dictionary.",
        "Moreover, translation rule C is acquired by using the translation rule B.",
        "Such a process of acquisition of translation rules is like a chain where each ring is linked.",
        "Therefore, we call this mechanism Recursive Chain-link-type Learning(RCL).",
        "This method can effectively acquire many translation rules from sparse data without depending on the different parts of similar translation pairs.",

        "In existing Example-Based MT systems based on learning algorithms, similar translation pairs must exist to acquire high-quality translation rules.",

        "On the other hand, a system with RCL can acquire many new translation rules from sparse translation examples because it uses other already acquired translation rules based on the learning algorithms described in section 2.",
        "As a result, the quality of the translation and the effective translation rate of our system is higher than other Rule-Based MT systems.",
        "However, our system still does not reach the level of a practical MT system and requires more translation rules to realize the goal of a practical MT system.",
        "Although our system is not a practical enough MT system, the system can effectively acquire the translation rules from sparse data by using RCL.",
        "Therefore, we consider that the quality of translation improves only by adding new translation examples without the difficulty of Rule-Based MT systems in which a developer must completely describe large-scale knowledge.",
        "In the future, we plan to add a mechanism that effectively combines the acquired translation rules so that the system realizes the translation of practical SL sentences."
