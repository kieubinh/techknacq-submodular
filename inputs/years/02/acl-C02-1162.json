        "The growing importance of multilingual information retrieval and machine translation has made multilingual ontologies an extremely valuable resource.",

        "These two ontologies have structures which are very different from each other, as well as being constructed for two very different languages, which makes this an appropriate and challenging task for our algorithm."

        "In this paper, we address the problem of automatic multilingual ontology alignment.",
        "Multilingual ontologies are very useful, but are also very time-consuming and expensive to build.",
        "For example, Euro WordNet (Vossen, 1998), a multilingual ontology for 8 European languages, involved 11 academic and commercial institutions and took 3 years to complete.",
        "Furthermore, for many of the world’s major languages, monolingual ontologies already exist in some shape or form.",
        "Therefore, it is reasonable and attractive to investigate whether a multilingual ontology could be quickly and robustly constructed from monolingual resources.",
        "Given the easy availability of bilingual dictionaries, the task might seem easy at a first blush.",
        "However, given two independently constructed ontologies, there always exists some difference in their structure that makes it difficult to perform a purely structural alignment.",
        "These differences arise from different approaches and philosophies taken during the construction of the ontology; and for ontologies in different languages, differences which stem from dissimilarities between the languages concerned.",
        "In addition, multilingual ontology alignment also has to deal with machine translation issues.",
        "Since an ontology arranges words in a semantic hierarchy, it is possible for a word to appear in several different places in the hierarchy depending on its semantic sense.",
        "However, words and concepts in a given language do not always translate cleanly into a second language; a word often has multiple translations, and they do not always share the same meanings.",
        "In the absence of any ambiguity resolution, synonym sets in one ontology will be erroneously aligned to multiple synonym sets in the second ontology.",
        "This is a serious problem: an investigative experiment with two ontologies, the American English WordNet and the Mandarin Chinese HowNet, found that, in the absence of any word sense disambiguation, each HowNet definition (the equivalent of a synonym set from WordNet) corresponded to an average of 8.1 WordNet synonym sets.",
        "The approach taken in this paper works upon the assumption that even though a word may have different translations that correspond to different semantic senses, it is not likely that its synonyms will have the same exact set of translations.",
        "Given a synonym set, or synset, in one ontology, our approach considers the average similarity between its words and words from all potential alignment candidates: Given two ontologies o and o', a synonym set (synset) s E o, and a similarity score sim(w27 wj ) between any two words:",
        "1.",
        "For each word w E s, find the synsets in o' that it appears in (in the cross-lingual case, find the synsets in o' in which the translations of w appear.)",

        "For each of these candidate synsets s': (a) if words w E s (or their translations) appear in the direct hyperset or hyposet, add them to s'.",
        "(b) if s' contains a single word (I s' I = 1), expand it by adding words from its direct hyperset.",
        "(c) Calculate sim(s, s'):",
        "The candidate synsets from o' are then ranked according to their similarity with s, and the synset with the largest similarity is considered to be the alignment “winner”."

      "text": [
        "Since automatic ontology alignment involves the comparison of sets of words to each other, it is necessary to define some measure for semantic similarity.",
        "Much work has been done on this topic, but most of it has been in monolingual semantic similarity calculation.",
        "Our problem is more complicated, as a cross-lingual ontology alignment will require measuring semantic similarity of words from different languages.",
        "The method used in this paper is an extension of work from Fung and Lo (1998).",
        "The assumption is that there is a correlation between word cooccur-rence patterns that persists across languages, and the similarity between word cooccurrence patterns is indicative of the semantic similarity.",
        "To construct a representation of the cooccurrence patterns, a list of seedwords is compiled.",
        "The seedwords in one language is a direct translation of those in the other language.",
        "Given a bilingual corpus, a context vector can then be constructed for each of the words of interest, where each element in the vector is a weight corresponding to a function of the significance of a particular seedword and its cooccurrence frequency with the word of interest.",
        "This method, which was applied to the problem of automatic dictionary induction, has the advantage of being able to utilize non-parallel bilingual corpora, which is by nature much more plentiful than parallel corpora.",
        "The most important extension that our work makes to the work of Fung et al.",
        "is the introduction of translation groups of words.",
        "A major issue with translation research is that, given two arbitrary languages, it is common for a word in one language to have multiple translations in the other.",
        "It is also common for a given translation of a particular word to be a translation of one of its synonyms as well.",
        "To address this problem, this work uses seedword groups, m-to-n translations of sets of words, rather than 1-to-1 translations of single words.",
        "This increases the robustness of the method, since a word need not be consistently translated for its context to be accurately identified.",
        "An additional benefit is that the sparse data problem is alleviated somewhat: the increased number of seedwords increases the coverage of the corpus, which reduces the possibility that a rare word whose translation we are interested in does not occur with any of the seedwords.",

        "Ties were broken randomly and the synset with the highest number of corresponding translations was selected as the alignment candidate.",
        "Because there is no annotated data available for the evaluation, two judges who speak the languages involved were asked to hand-evaluate the resulting alignments, based on, firstly, the set of sememes that make up the definition, with the words that are contained in the definition only as a secondary aid.",
        "Table 1 shows the overall performance of our algorithm, and Table 2 show the highest-scoring alignment mappings.",
        "In addition to the overall results, it is also interesting to examine the rankings of the alignment candidates for some of the more difficult HowNet definitions.",
        "Table 3 shows an example definition and the candidate rankings.",
        "This definition includes the words “population” and “number of people”, however, “number of people” was filtered out as it does not occur in WordNet as a single collocation, leaving only “population”, a noun with 6 senses in WordNet, to work with.",
        "This example is a good illustration of the strength and power of the cross-lingual 3 The original number of definitions chosen for the test set was higher.",
        "However, upon inspection, it was found that a number had no corresponding WordNet synset and thus cannot be aligned.",

        "Another very good example of the algorithm’s strength can be found in the rankings for the HowNet definition “TakeAwaylz *,patient=family JC” (Table 4).",

        "However, as the table shows, the algorithm correctly assigns the “change residence” sense of “move” to the HowNet definition, which is appropriate for the Chinese words it contains, which include “ ;L J:” (move house), “i Pte” (change one’s dwelling), and “� il” (tear down one’s house and move)."

        "Even though the final goal of our work is to construct a full mapping from HowNet to WordNet, there will be quite a number of HowNet definitions which do not have a WordNet synset equivalent.",
        "The reason is that given an arbitrary pair of languages, there will exist some words in one language which do not have a translation in the other language.",
        "In the case of English and Chinese, many of the encountered problems came from Chinese idiomatic expressions, which are common in everyday usage and are considered to be single words, but do not usually translate to a single word in English.",
        "In addition, the inherent difference in sense granularity and structure between any given two ontologies means that a full-scale mapping of synsets from one ontology to another will not usually be possible.",
        "For example, HowNet’s “livestock” definition covers words which are as diverse as “cow”, “cat” and “dog”, while the finest-grained WordNet synset that covers all these definitions is {placental, placental mammal, eutherian, eutherian mammal}.",
        "One of the most troublesome problems encountered in this work was in the selection of seedwords, which define set for the automatic lexicon induction.",
        "If the seedwords occur so frequently in the corpus that other words co-occur with them too easily, they will provide little useful discriminatory information to the algorithm; but if they are too rare, they will",
        "not co-occur often enough with other words to be able to provide enough information, either.",
        "This problem can be solved, however, by a better selection of seedwords, or, more easily, simply by using a bigger corpus to alleviate the sparse data problem.",
        "A more serious problem was introduced by the comparability of the corpora involved in the experiment.",
        "Even though both English and Chinese halves were extracted from news articles, the newspapers involved are very different in content and style: the People’s Daily is a government publication, written in a very terse and brief style, and does not concern itself much with non-government affairs.",
        "The Wall Street Journal, on the other hand, caters to a much broader audience with a variety of news articles from all sources.",
        "This creates a problem in the co-occurrence patterns of a word and its translations.",
        "The assumption that word co-occurrence patterns tend to hold across language boundaries seems to be less valid with corpora that differ too much from each other.",
        "An observation made during the experiments was some words occurred much more frequently (relative to the half of the corpus they were in) than their translated counterparts.",
        "The result of this is that their context vectors may not be as similar as desired.",
        "The difference in the co-occurrence patterns between the two halves of the corpora are best illustrated by a dotplot (Church, 1993).",
        "The total term frequency (TF) of each seedword group is plotted against that of its translations.",
        "Figure 1 shows the resulting dotplot.",
        "If the two halves of the corpora were exact copies of each other, the frequencies of the seedwords would be equal and the points would therefore be aligned along the x = y diagonal.",
        "The further the points diverge from the diagonal, the more different the two halves of the corpus are from each other.",
        "This",
        "is quite obviously the case for this particular corpus – the overall point pattern is fan-shaped, with the diagonal only faintly discernible.",
        "This suggests that the word usage patterns of the English and Chinese halves of the corpus are quite dissimilar to each other.",
        "It is, of course, reasonable to ask why parallel or comparable corpora had not been used in the experiments.",
        "The reason is, as noted in Section 2, that noncomparable corpora are easier to come by.",
        "In fact, the only Chinese/English corpus of comparable origin that was available to us was the parallel Hong Kong News corpus, which is about half the size.",
        "Furthermore, the word entries in HowNet were extracted from Mandarin Chinese corpora, which differs enough from the style of Chinese used in Hong Kong such that many words from HowNet do not exist in the Hong Kong News corpus.",
        "Feasibility experiments with that corpus showed that many of the seedwords either did not occur, or did not co-occur with the words of interest, which resulted in sparse context vectors with only a few non-zero co-occurrence frequencies.",
        "The result was that the similarity between many of the candidate WordNet synset-HowNet definition pairs was reduced to zero.",
        "Despite all these problems, our method is successful at aligning some of the more difficult, single-word HowNet definitions to appropriate WordNet synsets, thus creating a partial mapping between two ontologies with very different structures from very different languages.",
        "The method is completely unsupervised and therefore cheap on resource requirement – it does not use any annotated data, and the only resource that it requires – beyond the ontologies that are to be aligned – is a bilingual machine-readable dictionary, which can usually be obtained for free or at very low cost."
