        "Humans generally have language capability, mostly for their mother tongue and to a lesser extent for foreign languages.",
        "This leads us to making the most of our mother language, even in conducting translation.",
        "That is, when we translate our language into a foreign one unfamiliar to us, we may try to paraphrase the source input into easier expressions we can translate.",
        "In contrast, there is no such machine translation (MT) model so far proposed where the source language module is biased over the bilingual language module.",
        "All of the MT models are either those where the bilingual processor takes the initiative over the source language analyzer (conventional analyze-transfer-generate model) or integration models of analyzer and transfer, such as example-based or statistical models.",
        "Although some MT models have a paraphraser (also called a ‘pre-editor’), such as that of Shirai et al.",
        "(1993), paraphrasing is performed in these models because it is necessary to prepare for the subsequent bilingual process.",
        "In other words, the paraphraser operates as a sub-module for successful transfer.",
        "We have proposed a new MT model that is more similar to the human translation process than other MT systems (Yamamoto et al., 2001).",
        "This model, called the SANDGLASS model, is designed so that the system can generate a translation through source language paraphrasing, even if the system does not have sufficient bilingual knowledge.",
        "In this sense, our model design can be considered a nonprofessional translator’s model.",
        "From the engineering point of view, our model has an advantage in language portability; it is easy to construct an MT for a new language, since our model depends only on source language and thus can reduce dependence on bilingual knowledge.",
        "Moreover, the better source language paraphraser we make, the easier the implementation of other language MT becomes.",
        "Another advantage is task portability, since all of the paraphrasing knowledge, except for lexical paraphrasing knowledge, is independent of the task, so we do not need to fit most of the paraphrasing knowledge to the required task.",
        "It is also significant that this model’s paraphraser can be employed not only for MT but also for most natural language processing (NLP) applications.",
        "This is possible because both the input and output of a paraphraser is the same natural language.",
        "We have been building the SANDGLASS MT system for the Japanese-Chinese, Chinese-Japanese language pairs (Yamamoto et al., 2001; Zhang and Yamamoto, 2002).",
        "We have already constructed a prototype for Japanese-Chinese.",
        "In this paper, we report the core concepts of this prototype and discuss issues of both our principle and our implementation."

        "This suggests that it is not useful to apply bilingual-corpus-based approaches to situations not involving English.",
        "Moreover, conventional approaches based on handwritten rules are also unsuccessful due to lack of bilingual speakers of non-English pairs.",
        "We also assume that reduction of bilingual processing costs is crucial for multilingual MT construction.",

        "The SANDGLASS translation model has a source language paraphraser (hereafter the paraphraser) and a bilingual language transfer (hereafter the transfer), which have high modularity with each other in order to develop them as independently as possible.",
        "One of our aims in this model is to develop a general-purpose paraphraser that can also be used in other NLP applications.",
        "When the system has modularity, the paraphraser does not need to consider the knowledge or translation capability of the transfer.",
        "However, the paraphraser has trouble in planning a paraphrasing strategy, since the purpose of paraphrasing in this model is to help small-knowledge transfer.",
        "One may think of it as a solution to generate all possible paraphrases, transfer them into the target language, and select the best one among the successful outputs.",
        "We believe that, although this strategy works, it is not practical due to the computation cost.",
        "In many cases, there are local paraphrases possible for one input, which may result in combinatorial explosion for generating paraphrases.",
        "Moreover, this strategy leads to a more serious problem in speech translation that requires real-time computation.",
        "As an alternative, we propose the following strategy for planning paraphrases.",
        "We first put the controller between the paraphraser and the transfer.",
        "The controller communicates with both the paraphraser and the transfer and exchanges information between them on the target sentence be translated.",
        "As opposed to the one-way information path from the paraphraser to the transfer, a bidirectional information flow enables cooperation by allowing each module to provide its counterpart with information on what is possible and what is impossible.",
        "This kind of process is not necessary in the typical MT model, since each process has the responsibility to perform its mission successfully and giving up is never allowed.",
        "If one of the processes gives up its mission, the entire translation process also gives up and fails.",
        "On the contrary, our model (sometimes) allows the transfer to give up generating the target language.",
        "Although this responsibility continuously enlarges the transfer knowledge, it is one of the critical problems of the typical MT.",
