        "A scenario is a set of predefined facts to be extracted from a large text corpus, such as news articles, and organized in output templates.",
        "Our experience with customizing our IE system called Proteus (Grishman, 1997; Grishman et al., 2002) to new scenarios suggests that the lexical and structural properties of the scenario affect the performance of the system.",
        "To make an IE system flexible for tasks of varying complexity, it is essential to conduct a linguistic analysis of the texts relating to different scenarios.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the Infectious Disease Outbreak scenario (Grishman et al., 2002), and the Natural Disaster scenario (Hirschman et al., 1999) collectively called the \"Nature\" scenarios.",
        "During the customization of the IE system to the Nature scenarios, we encountered problems that did not arise in the traditional scenarios of the Message Understanding Conferences (MUCs).",
        "This included, in particular, delimiting the scope of a single event and organizing the events into templates.",
        "We identify two structural factors that contribute to the complexity of a scenario: first, the scattering of events in text, and second, inclusion relationships between events.",
        "These factors cause difficulty in representing the facts in an unambiguous way.",
        "We proposed that such event relationships can be described with a modular, hierarchical model (Huttunen et al., 2002).",
        "The phenomenon of inclusion is widespread in the Nature scenarios, and the types of inclusions are numerous.",
        "In this paper we present preliminary results obtained from our corpus analysis, with a classification and distribution of inclusion relationships.",
        "We discuss the potential for recovery of these inclusions from text with the help of the linguistic cues, of which we show some examples.",
        "This paper will argue that a thorough linguistic analysis of the corpus is needed to help recovery of the complex event structure in the text.",
        "In the next section we give a brief description of the scenarios we are investigating.",

        "• Locative or temporal expressions that are in a hierarchical relationship in a location hierarchy or in the implicit time hierarchy, often indicate presence or direction of inclusion.",

        "In paragraph (3) of table 4, in the parent incident we observe a case descriptor, deaths, which is elided in the two sub-incidents.",

        "Additional information is obtained from the case-descriptors, related in the concept hierarchy.",
