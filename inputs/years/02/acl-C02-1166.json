        "The growing availability of comparable corpora, through the Internet or via distribution agencies providing newspapers articles in different languages, has led researchers to develop methods to extract bilingual lexicons from such corpora, in order to enrich existing bilingual dictionaries, and help cross the language barrier for cross-language information retrieval.",
        "The results obtained thus far on comparable corpora, even though encouraging, are not completely satisfactory yet.",
        "(Fung, 2000) reports, for the Chinese-English language pair an accuracy of 76% to find the correct translation in the top 20 candidates, a figure we do not believe to be good enough to consider manual revision.",
        "Furthermore, the evaluation is carried out on 40 English words only.",
        "(Rapp, 1999) reaches 89% on the German-English language pair, when considering the top 10 candidates.",
        "If this figure is rather high, it was obtained on a set of 100 German words, which, even though not explicit in Rapp's paper, seem to be high frequency words, for which accurate and reliable statistics can be obtained.",
        "We want to show in this paper how previously proposed methods can be extended to and improved for specialized domains.",
        "In particular we will focus on the use and enrichment of multilingual thesauri, which, even though partially related they may be to the texts under consideration, are nonetheless an available and valuable resource for the task.",
        "We rely in this work on two main linguistic resources: a general bilingual dictionary (available through the ELRA consortium1) and a specialized multilingual thesaurus (the Medical Subject Headings, MeSH, provided through the metathesaurus Unified Medical Language System, UMLS2).",
        "Without anticipating too much on the linguistic preprocessing we use, it has to be noted that, unless otherwise stated, when we speak of a “word” we refer to a single (as opposed to compound), lexical word (as opposed to stop word).",
        "All our examples and experiments use the (German, English) language pair."

        "Bilingual lexicon extraction from non-parallel but comparable corpora has been studied by a number of researchers, (Peters, 1995; Tanaka, 1996; Shahzad 1999; Rapp, 1999; Fung, 2000) among others.",
        "Their work relies on the assumption that if two words are mutual",
        "translations, then their more frequent collocates (taken here in a very broad sense) are likely to be mutual translations as well.",
        "Based on this assumption, a standard approach consists in building context vectors, for each source and target word, which aim at capturing the most significant collocates.",
        "The target context vectors are then translated using a general bilingual dictionary, and compared with the source context vectors.",
        "Our implementation of this strategy relies on the following steps, and follows the one given in (Rapp, 1999): - for each word w, build a context vector by considering all the words occurring in a window encompassing several sentences that is run through the corpus.",
        "Each word i in the context vector of w is then weighted with a measure of its association with w. We chose the log-likelihood ratio test, (Dunning, 1993), to measure this association - the context vectors of the target words are then translated with our general bilingual dictionary, leaving the weights unchanged (when several translations are proposed by the dictionary, we consider all of them with the same weight) - the similarity of each source word s, for each target word t, is computed on the basis of the cosine measure - the similarities are then normalized to yield a probabilistic translation lexicon, P(t|s).",
        "To illustrate the above steps, we give here the first 5 words of the context vector of the German word Leber (liver), together with their associated score: (Transplantation 138, Resektion 53, Metastase 41, Arterie 38, cirrhose 26).",
        "Once this context vector translated, the English top five becomes: (transplant 138, tumour 48, secondary 42, metastatis 41, artery 38).",
        "One can note that the German term Resektion was not found in our bilingual dictionary, and thus not translated.",
        "However, the translated context vector contains English terms characteristic of the co-occurrence pattern for liver, allowing one to associate the two words Leber and liver.",
        "We refer to the above method as the standard method."

        "For example, concept class C0751521, for which the main entry is splenic neoplasms, also contains cancer of spleen, splenic cancer, spleen neoplasms).",
        "The correspondence can be one-to-one, i.e. the same concept classes are used in the different languages, or many-to-many, i.e. different concept classes are used in different languages, and a given concept class in a given language corresponds to zero, one or more concept classes in the other languages.",
        "The correspondence between concept classes across languages helps us write the probability P(t |s) of selecting word t as a translation of word s in the following general way, where C represents a multilingual concept class in MeSH (we omit the derivation, which is mainly technical, and uses the fact that the correspondence between concept classes in MeSH is one-to-one):",
        "a formula which can be interpreted as follows: from a source word s of the source corpus, select a (interlingual) concept class in the thesaurus, according to P(C|s), then generate a target word t of the target corpus from the concept class and the source word, according to P(t |C,s).",
        "The dependence on s in the last probability distribution (P(t |C,s)) allows one to privilege one possible lexicalization of a given concept class.",
        "It could be used, for example, to choose spleen neoplasms from concept class C0751521 as the translation of Milztumoren.",
        "However, since such a distinction between the different lexicalizations of a given concept is beyond the scope of the current paper, we make the additional simplifying assumption that, given a concept class, the target word t is independent of the source word s, which leads to the simplified formula:",
        "The above equation views the thesaurus as a trellis linking source and target words.",
        "As such, given probabilities P(C|s) and P(t|C) (see section 2.2 for the way we estimate these probabilities), there are several ways to compute an association score between source and target words.",
        "The most obvious one is to carry the sum over all concept classes, or a large subset of them, as indicated by the formula.",

        "We then extend this set of classes by adding new classes using the hierarchy in the thesaurus.",
        "Intuitively, if two or more classes in the selected subset have the same parent class, then the source word is likely to be related to this parent as well as to the classes themselves, since the parent is the direct node \"conceptually’’ linking the classes.",
        "For example, if a source word s selects the two classes Hepatitis and Cirrhosis, then s is likely to be related to Liver Diseases, the parent class.",
        "We make use of this intuition in the following way: for each pair of classes from the set of the n best classes associated with source word s, select the subtree formed by the classes, their common ancestor, and all the nodes that appear between the classes and their ancestor.",
        "This algorithm provides a set of subtrees from the 15 sub-thesauri corresponding to the 15 main categories of the MESH classification (MeSH, rather than being a single thesaurus, contains 15 different sub-thesauri, artificially related through a common root node in UMLS.",
        "We do not make use of this distinction in the complete and Viterbi methods, but use it for the subtree search to avoid linking classes via the artificial root concept).",
