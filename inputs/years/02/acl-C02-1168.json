        "One of the fundamental problems of natural language processing is resolving ambiguities, present in stemming, part-of-speech (POS) tagging, word sense disambiguation (WSD), anaphora resolution, etc.",
        "Word sense disambiguation, the task of determining the correct sense of a polysemous word, remains an open problem in natural language processing (NLP).",
        "Early NLP systems limited their domains and required manual knowledge engineering.",
        "More recent works take advantage of machine readable dictionaries such as WordNet (Miller, 1990).",
        "Statistical techniques, such as supervised learning from tagged corpora (Yarowsky, 1992), and unsupervised learning (Resnik, 1997), have been investigated, as well as hybrid models that incorporate both statistical and symbolic knowledge (Agirre and Rigau, 1996).",
        "Supervised models have shown promising results, but the lack of sense tagged corpora often requires the need for ad-hoc smoothing techniques.",
        "And for unsupervised models, they sometimes can result in ill-defined senses.",
        "Many models have not been evaluated with large vocabularies or full sets of senses.",
        "Hybrid models, using various heuristics, have demonstrated good accuracy but are difficult to compare due to variations in the evaluation procedures.",
        "Following the results presented at the SENSEVAL2 workshop, where the WSD system trained on the SemCor corpora (Miller et al., 1993) performed well on the English-all-words task, we evaluated the efficacy of maximum entropy (ME) models on the same task.",
        "Maximum entropy modeling has been used on various areas of NLP with great success, such as speech recognition (Rosenfeld, 1994), POS tagging (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), and translation (Berger et al., 1996).",
        "In applying maximum entropy to WSD, one ME model is built per word, i.e., word experts, and is trained on data from multiple, publicly available sources, including both labeled and partially labeled corpora.",
        "Furthermore, the issue of contextual features is explored, where the traditional word-window based context is augmented with structurally related words.",
        "We show that while keeping the word-window small (4 surrounding words), ME models perform quite well, and the accuracy is further improved by adding words from the rest of the sentence that are determined to be structurally related.",
        "Additionally, we introduce an accurate search algorithm that finds the sense assignments that are maximized across the whole sentence efficiently, by taking advantage of keeping the context small.",
        "Lastly, we present an ongoing project that this WSD model is part of, which is an integrated recurrent NLP system that encompasses POS tagging, parsing, and WSD.",
        "In this recurrent model, information from downstream processes is fed back to earlier processes, such as structural information and word senses are presented to the POS tagger as additional context.",
        "The hypothesis is that as more information is fed back recurrently in successive passes, this integral way of processing natural language will improve the accuracy of the processes on their own.",
        "Once this integrated system is in place, it then becomes a bootstrapping model, where unlabeled or partially labeled corpora can be tagged, parsed, and sense disambiguated automatically.",
        "The goal is to demonstrate that, without any human intervention, WSD accuracy will improve with each iteration of training on the automatically generated corpora, and then to reprocess them to generate more accurate corpora."

        "WSD is treated in this system as a classification task, where the k 1 sense of a word (Wi) is classified as the correct sense tag (Mi = k), given the word Wi and usually some surrounding context.",
        "In the SENSEVAL-2 English-all-words task, most ambiguous content words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs) are classified with a sense tag from the Word-Net 1.7 lexical database (Miller, 1990).",
        "We will refer to this task using the following notation:",
        "where S is the input sentence and M represents the semantic tags assigned to each word.",
        "While a context larger than the sentence S can be used, we will refer to the context as S. In this formulation, each word Wi in the sentence is treated as a random variable Mi taking on the values {1..Ni}, where Ni is the number of senses for the word Wi.",
        "Therefore, we wish to find instantiations of M such that P(MIS) is maximized.",
        "To make the computation of Mb,,, (S) more tractable, it can be decomposed into Mbest(S) ï¿½ arg max(HZP(MiJS)), where it is assumed that each word can be disambiguated independently.",
        "However, this assumption does not always hold, since disambiguating one word often affects the sense assignment of another word within the same sentence.",
        "Alternatively, the process can be modeled as a Hidden Markov model, e.g.,",
        "While the Markov model requires fewer parameters, it is unable to capture the long-distance dependencies that occur in natural languages.",
        "Although the first decomposition better captures these dependencies, computing P(MiIS) using the full sentential context is rarely used, since the number of parameters required grows exponentially with each added context.",
        "Therefore, one can further simplify this model by narrowing the context to 2n number of surrounding words, i.e., PAS) :: P(Mil wi--, ...Wi-1, Wi, Wi+1, ...Wi+..).",
        "However, narrowing the context also discards long-distance relationships, making it closer to a Markov model.",
        "The difficulty is in choosing the context that would maximize the accuracy while allowing for reliable parameter estimation from training data.",
        "In our model, we aim to strike this balance by choosing the context words based not only on positional, but also structural information.",
        "The hypothesis is that an ambiguous word is probabilistically dependent on its structurally related words and is independent of the rest of the sentence.",
        "Therefore, long-distance dependencies can still be captured, while the context is kept small.",
        "Therefore, our model is a combination of the decompositions described above, by selectively making independence assumptions on a per-word basis to best model P(MiIS), while computing Mb,,, (S) in one query to allow for interactions between the word senses Mi."

        "The intuition behind the maximum entropy principle can be stated as: Given a set of training data, model what is known and assume no further knowledge about the unknown by assigning them equal probability.",
        "That is, given N training samples S = (c, 0)1..(c, o)N, where c is the context and o is the outcome, construct a model p* (S) that estimates the empirical distribution p(S) while maximizing the its entropy.",
        "It has been shown that p*(S) is unique and must be in the following form (Ratnaparkhi, 1998):",

        "The feature functions fj are indicator functions representing meaningful statistics from the training data a modeler wishes to include, and they can be diverse.",

        "The statistics of a feature function is captured by ensuring the model adheres to the following equality:",
        "where Ep (f j) = E(, o) p(c, o) f j (c, o), which is the expectation of feature function fj, and EP(fj) = E(, o) p(c, o) f j (c, o) is the empirical expectation of fj.",
        "Using the same example above, one first determines the empirical distribution from the training data via maximum likelihood estimation, i.e., p(next word(c)=\"storm\", o=#2) ., count(next word(c)=\"storm\", o=#2)IN, where N is the total number of training events.",
        "The empirical expectation is then simply EP(fsto,,,,,) â p(next word(c)=\"storm\", o=#2) since f storm is 0 for all other (o, c) combinations.",
        "Using this expectation, the model must adjust the parameter castor,,, such that its expectation of fstorm matches the empirical one, while simultaneously matching the rest of the feature functions with their expectations.",
        "Therefore, the model estimates p*(S) by adjusting the k model parameters aj, 1 < j < k, subject to the constraints imposed by the k feature functions.",
        "This can be accomplished by using the Generalized Iterative Scaling (GIS) algorithm (Darroch and Rat-cliff, 1972).",

        "The hypothesis is that this integrated approach will produce a globally consistent and coherent interpretation of an input sentence by eliminating between each pass unlikely candidates and promoting ones that are consistent across POS tagging, structural relations, and word sense distinction.",
        "Once the overall system is in place, it will be used to process the partially labeled training corpora, namely set two through four used in this evaluation.",
        "Once all of the corpora are automatically labeled, they will then be used to retrain each of the three processes.",
        "As indicated by the experiments described here, WSD accuracy should improve with parsed training data, which will then be used to further improve POS tagging and parsing accuracy.",
        "And with more reliable POS tags and structural information, WSD accuracy should improve further.",
        "This process can continue until accuracy no longer improves, having reached a globally consistent interpretation of each sentence.",
        "The goal is to demonstrate that all processes, POS tagging, parsing, and WSD, improve their accuracy using this bootstrapping procedure.",
        "A more ambitious goal is to use the system to process the definitions within WordNet and automatically generate a representation of the meaning for each sense.",
        "While the topic of knowledge representation is beyond the scope of this paper, its utility in WSD is to be able to extract from the definition the deciding feature used to distinguish two close senses.",
        "For example, the distinction between two of the senses for the word \"vicar\" seems to be the church the clergyman is associated with.",
        "Such distinction is probably too subtle to derive from the corpora or the synonym lists, and is only described in the definitions.",
        "However, if known, such knowledge can be added to the word expert for \"vicar\" easily, by adding a feature function indicating if surrounding context refers to the type of church.",
        "How to automatically acquire this knowledge and represent them by adding \"knowledge-based\" feature functions to the ME models remains an open question, but we believe the bootstrapping system described here is a step towards that goal."
