        "In this paper, we describe a first prototype of a pattern-based analyzer developed in the context of a speech-to-speech translation project using a pivot-based approach (the pivot is called IF).",
        "The chosen situation involves a French client talking to an Italian travel agent (both in their own language) to organize a stay in the Trentino area.",
        "An IF consists of a dialogue act, and a list, possibly empty, of argument values.",
        "The analyzer applies a \"phrase spotting\" mechanism on the output of the speech recognition module.",
        "It finds well-formed phrases corresponding to argument values.",
        "A dialogue act is then built according to the instantiated arguments and some other features of the input.",
        "The current version of the prototype has been involved in an evaluation campaign on an unseen corpus of four dialogues consisting of 235 speech turns.",
        "The results are given and commented in the last part of the paper.",
        "We think they pave the way for future enhancements to both the coverage and the development methodology."

        "In the framework of the NESPOLE! project [Besacier, L., & al., 2001; Lazzari, G., 2000] funded by the EU and the NSF we are exploring future applications of automatic speech-to-speech translation in the e-commerce and e-services areas.",
        "For the actual translation we are using a pivot-based approach (the pivot is called IF for Interchange Format).",
        "Thus, we have to develop the analysis from the textual output of an automatic speech recognition module towards the IF and the generation from the IF towards a text-to-speech input text.",
        "In this context, the analyzer has to be robust against ill-formed input (in terms of syntax) and recognition errors, both likely to be quite common.",
        "To cope with these problems several families of methods may be used: a rule-based approaches with rules being relaxed if needed, a “let the number do every thing” approaches (using aligned source language inputs and their pivot representations), a pattern-based approaches (focusing on important features of the input), and finally a mixture of the previous ones.",
        "Taking into account the way the pivot represents the information present in the input and the possible methods, we chose to investigate a pattern-based approach (as in [Zong, C., & al., 2000]).",
        "In this paper we will focus on the first prototype of an analysis module from French to a pivot called IF (Interchange Format).",
        "We will justify our choices with regard to the pivot specification and describe the realization; finally we will give several numbers about an evaluation this analyzer was involved in."

        "The IF we are currently using is an extension of the one used in the C-STAR II context [Levin, L., & al., 2000; Levin, L., & al., 1998].",
        "It is designed to abstract away from peculiarities of any particular language in order to allow for translation that are non-literal but capture the speaker’s intent.",
        "The IF is based on domain actions (DAs) that consist of speech act and concepts. We have currently defined 62 general speech acts (e.g. acknowledge, introduce-self, give-information,).",
        "The concepts are split into 9 attitudes (e.g. disposition, feasibility, obligation), and 97 main predications or predication participants (e.g. p r i c e , room, activity).",
        "In addition to the DA, an IF representation may contain arguments (e.g. disposition, price, room-spec).",
        "The arguments have values that represent information about the speech acts and the concepts.",
        "There is currently about 280 arguments, 150 of them being top-level (e.g. disposition, price, room-spec).",
        "The others arguments do not exist on their own, they are embedded within the top-level arguments (e.g. quantity, currency, identifiability).",
        "For an utterance meaning \"je voudrais la chambre à 70 euros\"1 the IF would be: c: indicates that the client is speaking. give-information+disposition+price+room is the DA. disposition, price, room-spec are the top-level arguments. quantity, currency, identifiability are embedded arguments."

        "We are using the IF specification files to automatically produce parts of the dictionaries and the grammars.",
        "The IF is parsed into a French linguistic tree passed to a generalpurpose French generation module.",
        "This approach forces us to develop a specification as clean as possible describing all the possible \"events\".",
        "At the end, every potential IF input should be covered.",
        "The drawbacks of this approach are the bootstrapping process, which takes a huge amount of time, and the continuous changes in the IF specification we have to cope with.",
        "For the generation, we are also experimenting a pattern-based approach in which DA families are associated with template sentences (a fill in the blanks sentence).",
        "If possible, the blanks are filled, with the French phrase associated with the right argument value.",
        "For the analysis we are also pursuing two tracks.",
        "When the generation module will be available we are thinking of reversing the process to build an analysis module (an analyzer realized for C-STAR II is described in [Blanchon, H. and Boitet, C., 2000, Boitet, C. and Guilbaud, J.-P., 2000]).",
        "We are also using a pattern-based approach that is very convenient to deal with the output that may be produced by the speech recognition module.",
        "The operation of the analyzer can be viewed as \"phrase spotting\" among the input so that insertion, deletion, and wrong agreements and word can be dealt with.",
