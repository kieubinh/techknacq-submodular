        "Dynamic lexical acquisition is a procedure where the lexicon of an NLP system is updated automatically during sentence analysis.",
        "In our system, new words and new attributes are proposed online according to the context of each sentence, and then get accepted or rejected during syntactic analysis.",
        "The accepted lexical information is stored in an auxiliary lexicon which can be used in conjunction with the existing dictionary in subsequent processing.",
        "In this way, we are able to process sentences with an incomplete lexicon and fill in the missing info without the need of human editing.",
        "As the auxiliary lexicons are corpus-based, domain-specific dictionaries can be created automatically by combining the existing dictionary with different auxiliary lexicons.",
        "Evaluation shows that this mechanism significantly improves the coverage of our parser."

        "The quality of many NLP systems depends heavily on the completeness of the dictionary they use.",
        "However, no dictionary can ever be complete since new words are being coined constantly and the properties of existing words can change over time.",
        "In addition, a dictionary can be relatively complete for a given domain but massively incomplete for a different domain.",
        "The traditional way to make a dictionary more complete is to edit the dictionary itself, either by hand or through batch updates using data obtained from other sources.",
        "This approach is undesirable because",
        "(1) it can be very expensive due to the amount of hand work required; (2) the job will never be complete since new words and new usages of words will continue to appear.",
        "(3) certain words and usages of words decay",
        "after a while or only exist in a certain domain, and it is inappropriate to make them a permanent part of the dictionary.",
        "This paper discusses an alternative approach where, instead of editing a static dictionary, we acquire lexical information dynamically during sentence analysis.",
        "This approach is currently implemented in our Chinese system and Chinese examples will be used to illustrate the process.",
        "In Section 1, we will discuss how the new lexical information is discovered.",
        "Section 2 discusses how such information is filtered, lexicalized, and used in future processing.",
        "Section 3 is devoted to evaluation."

        "Two major types of lexical information are being acquired dynamically in our current Chinese system: new words and new grammatical attributes such as parts of speech (POS) and sub-categorization frames.",
        "The acquisition assumes the availability of an existing dictionary which is relatively mature though incomplete in many ways.",
        "In our case, we have a lexicon of 88,000 entries with grammatical attributes in most of them.",
        "Our assumption is that, once a dictionary has reached this scale, we should have enough information to predict the missing information in the context of sentence analysis.",
        "We can then stop hand-editing the static dictionary and let dynamic lexical acquisition take over.",
        "In most cases, the grammatical properties of a word define the syntactic context in which this word may appear.",
        "Therefore, it is often possible to detect the grammatical properties of a word by looking at the surrounding context of this word in a sentence.",
        "In fact, this is one of the main criteria used by lexicographers, who often apply a conscious or subconscious contextual “template” for each grammatical property they assign.",
        "We have coded those templates in our system so that a computer can make similar judgments.1 When a word is found to fit into a template for a given property but we do not have that property in the dictionary yet, we can make a guess and propose to add that property.",
        "Our current Chinese system has 29 such templates, 14 for detecting new words and 15 for detecting new grammatical attributes for new or existing words."

        "This is a bound morpheme in our dictionary, appearing only as a part in words like ft�L f (have a good chat).",

        "The usual response to this problem is to treat it as a lexical gap and edit the entry of ft to make it a verb in the dictionary.",
        "This is undesirable for at least two reasons.",
        "First of all, many bound morphemes in Chinese can be occasionally used as words and making all of them independent words will introduce a lot of noise in sentence analysis.",
        "Secondly, it will be a difficult task for lexicographers, not just because it takes time, but because the lexicographers will often be unable to make the decision unless they see sentences where a given bound morpheme is used as a word.",
        "In our system, we leave the existing dictionary untouched.",
        "Instead, we “promote” a bound",
        "morpheme to be a word dynamically when it appears in certain contextual templates.",

        "Currently we have 4 such templates, promoting morphemes to nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs respectively.",
        "Examples of Type (2) are found all the time and adding them all to the existing dictionary will be a never-ending job.",
        "Here is an example: � a 19r p� Vt 7� �Tx' _4 NTx' not need again start then can dock or undock fE� t easy-to-carry computer You can dock and undock your laptop without restarting.",
