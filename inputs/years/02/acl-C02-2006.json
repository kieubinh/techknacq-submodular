        "Natural language processing (NLP) programs are confronted with various difficulties in processing HTML and XML documents, and have the potential to produce better results if linguistic information is annotated in the source texts.",
        "We have therefore developed the Linguistic Annotation Language (or LAL), which is an XML-compliant tag set for assisting natural language processing programs, and NLP tools such as parsers and machine translation programs which can accept LAL-annotated input.",
        "In addition, we have developed a LAL-annotation editor which allows users to annotate documents graphically without seeing tags.",
        "Further, we have conducted an experiment to check the translation quality improvement by using LAL annotation."

        "Recently there has been increasing interest in applying natural language processing (NLP) systems, such as keyword extraction, automatic text summarization, and machine translation, to Internet documents.",
        "However, there are various obstacles that make it difficult for them to produce good results.",
        "It is true that NLP technologies are not perfect, but some of the difficulties result from problems in HTML.",
        "Further, in general, if linguistic information is added to source texts, it greatly helps NLP programs to produce better results.",
        "In what follows, we would like to show some examples related to machine translation.",
        "In general, it is very helpful for machine translation programs to know boundaries on many levels (such as sentence, phrases, and words) and to know word-to-word dependency relations.",
        "For instance, in the following example, since \"St.\" has two possible meanings, \"street\" and \"saint,\" it is difficult to determine whether the following example consists of one or two sentences.",
        "I went to Newark St. Paul lived there two years ago.",
        "As another example, the following sentence has two interpretations; one interpretation is that what he likes is people and the other interpretation is that what he likes is accommodating.",
        "He likes accommodating people.",
        "If there are tags indicating the direct-object modifier of the word \"like,\" then the correct interpretation is possible.",
        "NLP may be able to resolve these ambiguities eventually by using advanced context processing techniques, but current NLP technology generally needs a hint from the author for these sorts of ambiguities.",
        "Further, there are issues in HTML/XML.",
        "When MT systems are applied to Web pages, most of the errors are generated by the linguistic incompleteness of MT technology, but some are generated by problems in HTML and XML tag usage.",
        "For instance, writers often use <br> tag to sentence termination.",
        "Sometimes writers intend that a <br> tag should terminate the sentence (even without terminating punctuation such as a period), and in other cases writers intend <br> only as a formatting device.",
        "In the HTML <table> shown in Figure 1, the writer intends each line of a cell to express one linguistic unit.",
        "The MT program cannot tell whether each line is a unit for translation, or, instead, the two lines form one unit.",
        "In this example, some MT programs would try to produce a translation of a unit \"NetVista Models ThinkPad News.\"",
        "As shown in the above examples, NLP applications do not achieve their full potential, on account of problems unrelated to the essential NLP processes.",
        "If tags expressing linguistic information",
        "are inserted into source documents, they help NLP programs recognize document and linguistic structures properly, allowing the programs to produce much better results.",
        "At the same time, it is true that NLP technologies are incomplete, but their deficiencies can sometimes be circumvented through the use of such tags.",
        "Therefore, this paper proposes a set of tags for helping NLP programs, called Linguistic Annotation Language (or LAL)."

        "(3) Users should be able to view and modify linguistic information such as feature values, but only if they want to.",

        "To satisfy the last requirement, this editor has two presentation modes: the reduced presentation view and the expanded presentation view.",
        "In the reduced presentation view, a main verb and its modifiers are basic units for presenting dependencies, and they are located on different lines, keeping the surface order.",

        "Figure 4 (a, b) shows examples of this expanded view.",
        "In these views, to satisfy the former requirement, dependencies between basic units are expressed by using indentation.",

        "In fact, for most of sentences whose translation is worse when annotation is used, we can provide structural conversion routines for linguistic structures included in them.",
