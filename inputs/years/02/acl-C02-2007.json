        "As the processing of content information has nowadays become the center of NLP, a bilingual concept MRD is of increasingly great significance for IE, MT, WSD and the like.",
        "And it is for sure that the computational linguists would find such a lexicon indispensable and useful as semantic information when facing ambiguities in languages in their applications.",
        "At the same time, Princeton University’s WordNet, after so many years’ development, has exerted a profound influence on semantic lexicons [Vossen, 1998].",
        "When building a Chinese-English bilingual concept MRD, we must take the issue of compatibility with WordNet into account.",
        "In other words, for each English concept in WordNet, there should exist a corresponding Chinese concept in the bilingual lexicon and vice versa.",
        "Such a bilingual lexicon can offer better reusability and openness.",
        "The Institute of Computational Linguistics (ICL), Peking University, with this point of view, has launched the Project CCD (Chinese Concept Dictionary).",
        "The expectant CCD might be described as follows [Yu et al., 2001]: it should carry the main relations already defined in WordNet with more or less updates to reflect the reality of contemporary Chinese, and it should be a bilingual concept lexicon with the parallel Chinese-English concepts to be simultaneously included.",
        "Such a bilingual WordNet-like lexicon of Chinese-English concepts can largely meet our need of applications.",
        "However, it is by no means easy to build such a lexicon.",
        "It is quite obvious that there synchronously exist two ontologies in the same lexicon.",
        "One is in the English culture and the other is in the Chinese culture.",
        "As there might be different concepts and relations in each language, the mapping of the relevant concepts in different languages is inevitable.",
        "Also, the evolution of such a lexicon with passing of time, an issue linked closely to the mapping issue, is quite challenging.",
        "In conclusion, it’s a quite demanding job to build such a lexicon, especially for the design of the approach and the realization of the developing tool.",
        "Any fruitful solution should give enough consideration to the complexity of these issues."

      "text": [
        "The distinct principles of organization of WordNet can be described below: concepts, viz. synsets, act as the basic units of lexical semantics, and the hyponymy of the concepts acts as the basic relation among others.",
        "Upon this tree structure of hyponymy, there also exist some other semantic relations like holonymy, antonymy, attribute, entailment, cause, etc., which further interweave all the concepts in the lexicon into a huge semantic network, say 99,643 synset nodes all told in WordNet 1.6.",
        "What really counts and takes a lot of trouble in building WordNet itself is how to set up all these synsets and relations properly, and, how to maintain the semantic consistencies in case of frequent occurrences of modifications during the revision [Beckwith et al., 1993].",
        "As the desirable developing tool based directly on a large-scale network has not yet appeared, due to the connatural complexity of net structure, this problem is all the way a Gordian knot for the lexicographers.",
        "To build a Chinese WordNet in the same route just as Princeton had taken and then to construct the mapping between these two WordNets may be not a satisfying idea.",
        "So, it is crucial that we had better find an approach to reusing the English common knowledge already described in WordNet as the semantic basis for Chinese when building the bilingual lexicon.",
        "And this kind of reusing should contain some capabilities of adjustments to the bilingual concepts besides word-for-word translations.",
        "If we can manage it, not only the building of the monolingual Chinese lexicon benefits but also the mapping between Chinese-English [Liu et al., 2002].",
        "Actually, the practice of mapping has now become a direct and dynamic process and the evolution of the bilingual lexicon is no longer a problem.",
        "A comparatively high efficiency may be achieved.",
        "Such are the essential ideas of the new solution.",
        "A characteristic of this approach is to emphasize the inheritance and transformation of the already existent monolingual lexicon.",
        "Accordingly, it deals with 2 processes.",
        "The first process simply gets the semantic basis for further use and the lexicographers’ work always focuses on the second.",
        "In fact, the bilingual lexicon has just gradually come into being in this more natural process."

        "This process is intended to extract the common hyponymy information in WordNet as the semantic basis for future use.",
        "However, to extract the full hyponyms for a certain concept is by no means easy.",
        "As we have examined, the number of hyponyms for a synset ranges from 0 to 499 with a maximal hyponymy depth of 15 levels in WordNet.",
        "This shows the structure of the potential hyponymy tree is quite unbalanced.",
        "Due to this high complexity, the ordinary searching algorithm can hardly do.",
        "If one inputs the word entity as entry in WordNet 1.6 and tries to search its full hyponyms, he will get nothing but a note of failure.",
        "Sure enough, if the entry is not entity but another word, say entrance, the searching will probably do.",
        "The cases actually depend on the location of the entry word in the potential hyponymy tree in WordNet.",
        "The higher the level of the entry word, the less possibility of success the searching will have.",
        "By now, we have got a refined searching algorithm for getting the full hyponymy information in WordNet [Liu et al., 2002].",
        "By and large, it involves a series of Two Way Scanning action and of Gathering/Sieving and Encoding action, with each round of the series intending to get information of nodes on one same level in the hyponymy tree.",
        "By this special algorithm, the complexity of searching is greatly reduced.",
        "We can even get all the 45,148 hyponyms for the topmost entry word entity, in 100 or so seconds, on an ordinary PC.",

        "This process is for the lexicographers to interactively operate on the hyponymy tree to express the bilingual semantics.",
        "The bilingual lexicon will gradually come into being in this process.",
        "For this task, we have designed and realized a visualized and data-sensitive tree control with 8 well-defined operations on it, some of the pivotal algorithms for which will be discussed later.",
        "After extracting the hyponymy information for each initial semantic unit in WordNet respectively, we then organize the information into a hyponymy tree by using the above tree control.",
        "Every tree node, viz. synset, still carries all other semantic relations already described in WordNet.",
        "The lexicographers can now operate on the tree interactively.",
        "The actual practices of the lexicographers are as follows:",
        "(i) For each tree node in English, if there exists a corresponding Chinese concept, the lexicographers simply translate the English concept into Chinese.",
        "(ii) If there does not, cases may be that the English concept is either too general or too specific for Chinese.",
        "(ii1) For the former case, the lexicographers can create new hyponyms in Chinese for the English concept and link all these new hyponyms in Chinese with the English concept.",
        "(ii2) For the latter case, the lexicographers just delete the English concept in a special way, which means the English concept has no equivalent in Chinese and only links the English concept with its hypernym.",
        "In fact, all the above-mentioned semantic manipulations concerning hyponymy relation have already been encoded into the 8 visualized operations on the hyponymy tree.",
        "In addition, in the 8 operations, some other semantic relations already described in the synsets in WordNet are all properly dealt with through systematic and reasonable calculations.",
        "We can see these adjustments clearly in the description of the algorithms.",
        "Now, it is of much significance that the lexicographers need simply operate on the hyponymy tree to express their semantic intention and no longer care for lots of details about the background database, for the foreground operations have already fulfilled all the automatic modifications of the database.",
        "In this way, the problems of mapping between the bilingual concepts and evolution of the bilingual lexicon are dynamically resolved.",
        "Our developing tool for building the bilingual WordNet-like lexicon has come out as below.",
        "The interface view shows the hyponymy tree for the entry food, which is one of the 25 initial semantic units of noun in WordNet with the category value of 13.",
        "For the currently chosen node, the lexicographers can further adopt a proper operation on it when needed.",
        "This new kind of Visualized Auxiliary Construction of Lexicon is characteristic of the inheritance and transformation of the existent monolingual lexicon.",
        "We call it Vacol model for short.",

        "Among these 3 parts of information, {Posi} is used for the tree structure whereas both {Ptri1, Ptri2, ... , Ptrim} and {BasicInfoi} for lexical semantics.",
        "It should be noticed that Posi only stands for a special encoding for the tree in the foreground and is somewhat different from Ptri1, a relational pointer of hyponymy, which represents its specific semantics in the background database.",
        "And it is the relations in {Ptri2, ... , Ptrim} that have highly contributed to the dense net structure of WordNet.",
        "After these analyses, we find that each operation should just properly deal with these 3 parts of information.",
        "First, it is crucial that two sorts of consistencies should be maintained.",
        "One is that of the structural information {Posi} of the tree and the other is that of the relation information {Ptri1, Ptri2, ... , Ptrim} of the lexicon.",
        "Following that, the cases of the basic information {BasicInfoi} are comparatively simple for only English-Chinese translations are involved.",
        "Before we can go on to dwell on the algorithms, we still need a little while to touch on the structural information {Posi}.",
        "When we say a position Posi, we actually mean the location of a certain node in the tree and it serves to organize the tree.",
        "For example, a Posi by the value “005001002” is to represent such a location of a node in a tree: at the 1 st level, its ancestor being the 5th; at the 2nd level, its ancestor being the 1st; and at the 3rd level, its ancestor viz. itself now being the 2nd.",
        "In fact, such an encoding onto a linear string does fully express the structural information in a tree and makes all the tree operations algorithms feasible by direct and systematic calculations of the new position.",
        "If we don’t want to badger with much of the details, the algorithms for tree operations can be described in a general way.",

        "The algorithms described below are suitable for the non-batch-movement operations, viz. operations [1, 2, 3, 4].",
        "And the batch-movement operations, viz. operations [5, 6, 7, 8], can be regarded as their iterative practices.",
        "The lexicographers trigger an action on nodei; IF the action is in operations [1, 2, 3, 4]",

        "Since the structural information {Pos}, defined as the primary key of the table, is kept in order, the maintenance of tree structure can always be completed in a single pass.",

        "In the near future, ICL wants to come to a total amount of 100,000 or so bilingual concepts, which might largely meet our need of applications.",
        "What is more, as the byproducts of the new approach and experiences, we have even found some errors and faults of semantic expressing with WordNet 1.6.",
        "For example, in the lexicon there are many occurrences of a node with multiple-father in the identical category (772 times in noun, e.g. {radish}) or a node with single-father in the other category (2,172 times in noun, e.g. {prayer_wheel}).",
