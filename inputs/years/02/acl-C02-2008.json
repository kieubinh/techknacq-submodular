      "text": [
        "There is a large number of documents of great diversity on the Web, which makes some of the documents difficult to understand due to viewers’ lack of background knowledge.",
        "In particular, if technical terms or jargon are contained in the document, viewers who are unfamiliar with them might not understand their correct meanings.",
        "When we encounter unknown words in a document, for example scientific terms or proper nouns, we usually look them up in dictionaries or ask experts or friends for their meanings.",
        "However, if there are lots of unfamiliar words in a document or there are no experts around, the work of looking the words up can be very time consuming.",
        "To facilitate the effort, we need (1) machine understandable online dictionaries, (2) automated consultation of these dictionaries, and (3) effective methods to show the lookup results.",
        "There is an application which consults online dictionaries when the user clicks on a certain word on a Web page, then shows the lookup results in a popped up window.",
        "In this case, the application accesses its inner/online dictionaries and the consultation process is automated using the viewer’s mouse click as a cue.",
        "Popup windows correspond to the display method.",
        "Other related applications operate more or less in the same way.",
        "We encounter three big problems with the conventional method.",
        "First, due to the difficulty of word sense disambiguation, in the case of polysemic words, applications to date show all possible word sense candidates for certain words, which forces the viewer to choose the correct meaning.",
        "Second, the popup window showing the lookup results hides the area near the clicked word, so that the user tends to lose the context and has to reread the original document.",
        "Third, since the document and the dictionary lookup results are shown in different layers (e.g., windows), other natural language processing techniques such as summarization, translation, and voice synthesis cannot be easily applied to the results.",
        "To cope with these problems, we realized a systematic method to annotate words in a document with word senses in such a way that anyone (e.g., the author) can easily add word sense information to a certain word using a user-friendly annotating tool.",
        "This operation can be considered as a creation of a link between a word in the document and a node in a domain-specific ontology.",
        "The “Interactive Paraphrasing” that we propose makes use of word sense annotation and paraphrases words by embedding their word sense definitions into the original document to generate a new document.",
        "Embedding occurs at the user’s initiative, which means that the user decides when and where to embed the definition.",
        "The generated document can also be the target for another embedding operation which can be iterated until the document is understandable enough for the user.",
        "One of the examples of embedding a document into another document is quotation.",
        "Transcopyright (Nelson, 1997) proposes a way for quoting hypertext documents.",
        "However, quoting means importing other documents as they are.",
        "Our approach is to convert other documents so that they fit into the original context, preserving the semantics and improving the readability at the same time.",
        "As the result of embedding, there are no windows hiding any part of the original text, which makes the context easy to follow, and the new document is ready to be used for further natural language processing."

      "text": [
        "Semantically embedding word sense definitions into the original document without changing the original context is much more difficult than showing the definition in popup windows.",
        "For example, replacing some word in a sentence only with its word sense definition may cause the original sentence to be grammatically wrong or less cohesive.",
        "This is due to the fact that the word sense definitions are usually incapable of simply replacing original words because of their fixed forms.",
        "For appropriately integrating the word sense definition into the original context, we employ syntactic annotation (described in the next section) to both original documents and the word sense definitions to let the machine know their contexts.",
        "Thus, we need two types of annotations for Interactive Paraphrasing.",
        "One is the word sense annotation to retrieve the correct word sense definition for a particular word, and the other is the syntactic annotation for managing smooth integration of word sense definitions into the original document.",
