        "As the variety of users accessing the common resources on the World Wide Web, the importance of multimedia and multilingual information presentation technology has increased.",
        "Machine translation technology is essential for multilingual presentations, and many researchers pursue language independent structures ; i.e. Rassinoux et al.",
        "(1998), etc.",
        "Many semantic structures like `semantic frame' or `feature structures' have been developed and common language attributes were embedded in these structures.",
        "On the other hand, to store the resources, there were lots of databases all over the world.",
        "Those DBs stored in relational style with numerical data format would necessarily have language independent features.",
        "There, however, was a gap between DB structures and language independent semantic structures.",
        "Recently, the XML-DB technologies have been developed to support a more structured function for databases.",
        "The structuring techniques are useful not only for data structure but to represent linguistic structures.",
        "We developed the XML-based report generation system as in Figure 1.",
        "The system is based on a three-stage pipelined architecture : document planning, microplanning, and surface realization.",
        "This system produces four languages : Japanese, English, French, and German from the common resources.",
        "The system also supports the publishing in VoiceXML format' and synthesis function by using IBM websphere VoiceServer SDK 2.",
        "Therefore, this system is also useful for handicapped people like the visually handicapped to share information.",
        "This paper consists of four sections.",
        "In Section 2, we discuss language independent and dependent features.",
        "Section 3 details multilingual generation and voice synthesis technologies in our system.",
