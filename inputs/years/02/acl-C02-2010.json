      "text": [
        "The NGC was developed using Constraint Grammar (Karlsson et al.",
        "1995).",
        "Like the SGC the NGC has three main parts in addition to an initial tokenizer (spell checking is performed at a previous stage):",
        "• A morphological analyser (NOBTWOL), which provides each word form with all of its lexically possible readings (grammatical tags).",
        "• A morphological CG disambiguator, which eliminates incorrect tags according to the grammatical context (Karlsson et.",
        "al 1995, Hagen, Johannessen and Nøklestad 2000a and 2000b).",
        "• An error detector that identifies different kinds of grammatical errors.",
        "There is an interesting problem regarding the construction of a grammar checker.",
        "On the one hand it is necessary to have as much grammatical information as possible about the particular text that is going to be checked.",
        "On the other hand, it is very difficult to perform any such grammatical analysis, since grammatical features (“errors”) essential for the analysis might be missing.",
        "We tried to solve the problem by relaxing many of the requirements of the disambiguating tagger described above, since it was originally developed for grammatically correct texts.",
        "An example of this is the original CG rule assigning a determiner reading to a word that is next to a noun and agrees with it in number and gender:",
        "The rule (one of approximately 2000 rules) says that if a word is definite and has neuter determiner as one of its readings, but there is a neuter definite singular noun to its right, with nothing but adverbs and adjectives in between, then the determiner reading is correct.",
        "This rule ensures that the first word in the sentence below is correctly tagged as a determiner and not e.g. a pronoun: Det eplet likte han godt the.DEF.NEUTER.SG apple.DEF.NEUTER.SG liked he well ’That apple, he liked well.’ The tagger can then safely assume that whatever does not agree with the noun to its right is not part of the same noun phrase, and therefore is a pronoun.",
        "However, a grammar checker can never assume that anything is correct, and cannot rely on the agreement features of the determiner and the noun.",
        "Instead, it ought to be able to detect any missing agreement and point out the error.",
        "So the new relaxed tagger leaves more ambiguity.",
        "Instead, very specific error rules are introduced in the NGC.",
        "Rule (03) below (one of 700 error rules) detects gender disagreement between a determiner and the following noun (04).",
        "(3) (@w =s!",
        "(@ERR) (0 DET-DEF-NEUT) (NOT 1 DITRANS) (1 C NOUN-SG-DEF) (NOT 1 NEUT) (1 MASC)) (4) *Jenta så det bilen",
        "The.girl saw the.DEF.NEUT.SG car.DEF.MASC.SG 'The girl saw that car.'",
        "This method is reminiscent of that suggested by Schneider and McCoy (1998) for their ICICLE system designed to help second-language learners of English.",
        "However, since theirs is a grammar based on context-free rules, it is more difficult to implement; in order for a parse to be successful, all phrases have to be well-formed, which means that the grammar must include rules for ungrammatical structures.",
        "CG has an advantage; it does not have to build a full phrase structure, thus partial parses are fine, and local errors are easily detected."

        "There were 15 essays of an average of 300 words, altogether 4500 words, the same amount as for the other test groups.",
        "The vast majority of the detected errors are morphological ones, see table (05):",
        "However, in order to evaluate the NGC properly with respect to the Chinese students, we have to look at all errors made.",
        "In addition to the 32 errors detected by the NGC, the Chinese Level II students made 228 errors that were not detected by the NGC, i.e. only 12% were found.",
        "But notice that nearly half the errors (115) are lexical, idiomatic and pragmatic ones – error types that have not even been attempted to be detected by the NGC.",
        "(9) Example of idiomatic error: Nå er j eg i Norge som alle er dyre now am I in Norway which all are expensive (pl) *�Nå er jeg i Norge hvor alter dyrt (10) Example of lexical error: Jeg var veldig redd av blod",
        "I was very afraid of blood *�Jeg var veldig redd for blod",
        "Det er en vane du må etablere når du var barn It’s a habit you must establish when you were child *�Det er en vane du må etablere når du er barn ( Of the morphological mistakes made by the Chinese Level II students, the NGC detected 28 out of 73, a recall of 38% - considerably higher than the results for all categories taken together.",
        "It can also be improved by adding more morphological rules.",
        "This is similar to the error pattern of all the other non-standard language groups we have studied so far (Chinese Level III students, two levels of Slav students and deaf Norwegian pupils).",
        "The NGC finds 10% of the total number of errors in the essays written by Slav students.",
        "For the deaf students, the NGC findings rise slightly, to 14%.",
        "A reason for the higher percentage could be that the deaf pupils make many morphological mistakes, a feature the NGC is designed to detect.",
        "For example, these pupils typically use non-finite verb forms and wrong gender for nouns.",
        "Like the Chinese students, both the Slavs and the deaf pupils have a very high percentage of «non-grammatical» errors, i.e., lexical, idiomatic and pragmatic.",
        "The non-grammatical errors of the Slav students amount to 60% of all errors, while the number for the deaf pupils is 52%.",
        "However, there are also big differences between the groups, see table (12) below.",
        "For example, the foreign language students have fewer idiomatic and pragmatic errors than the deaf pupils (20% of all errors versus 31 %).",
        "This aspect is even more striking when we look at the pragmatic errors only.",
        "The Slav students have only 4% pragmatic errors (of all errors).",
        "The Chinese students have a higher number; 9%.",
        "The deaf students, however, have 22% pragmatic errors.",
        "The deaf students especially make two kinds of pragmatic errors: wrong choice of definiteness on the basis of given/new information, and wrong use of tense (typically a change of tense when none is called for).",
        "Related to this is the morphological kind of error mentioned above: lack of finiteness on verbs.",
        "These numbers, though interesting, are hardly surprising; to some extent they reflect the linguistic background of these language users.",
        "The Norwegian Sign Language and Chinese have no morphological verb marking or noun marking, while Slavic languages have a complex system of verb inflection.",
        "The results for the Norwegian control group are predictable.",
        "They make no non-grammatical mistakes, few grammatical mistakes4, and frequently split compounds incorrectly.",
        "16% of their errors were found by the NGC – slightly higher than the number for the other test groups, but much lower than the equivalent number of the SGC wich was reported to be 35% (Birn 2000) in Swedish newspaper texts.",
        "Obviously, the reason for the lower number is that the essays by the Norwegian pupils are originally written by hand, and thus lack easily detectable cut-and-paste and our word-processing errors.",
        "Our ongoing research will show us the results for the other \"non-standard\" language groups.",
        "The NGC gives surprisingly few «false alarms» (the precision is 95%, as opposed to 75% for the newspaper texts) in the texts by non-standard language groups, due to the fact that their language is very simple, suiting the shallow analysis performed by the NGC.",

        "With a larger-scale error analysis of authentic texts from the non-standard groups a lot of new knowledge could be found, which would make a good basis for improving the NGC.",

        "Idiomatic expressions are more of a problem, but given a large error corpus, it would be possible to extract the most common error types and look for these later.",
        "Pragmatic errors are notoriously difficult.",
