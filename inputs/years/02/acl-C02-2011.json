        "Information extraction (IE) from texts currently receives a large research interest.",
        "Traditionally, it has been associated with the – often verbatim – extraction of domain-specific information from free text (Riloff & Lorenzen 1999).",
        "Input documents are scanned for very specific relevant information elements on a particular topic, which are used to fill out empty slots in a predefined frame.",
        "Other types of systems try to acquire this knowledge automatically by detecting reoccurring lexical and syntactic information from manually annotated example texts (e.g. Soderland 1999).",
        "Most of these techniques are inherently limited because they exclude natural language semantics as much as possible.",
        "This is understandable for reasons of efficiency and genericity but it restricts the algorithms' possibilities and it disregards the fact that – at least in free text – IE has much to do with identifying semantic roles.",
        "In most of these systems, case role detection as a goal in itself has been treated in a rather trivial way.",
        "Our research will try to provide a systematic approach to case role detection as an independent extraction task.",
        "Using notions from systemic-functional grammar and presupposing a possible mapping between morphosyntactic properties and functional role patterns, we will develop a general model for case role extraction.",
        "The idea is to learn domain-independent case role patterns from a tagged corpus, which are then (automatically) specialized to particular domain-dependent case role sets and which can be reassigned to previously unseen text.",
        "In this paper, we will focus on the first part of this task.",
        "For IE, an accurate and speedy detection of functional case roles is of major importance, since they describe events (or states) and participants to these events and thus allow for identifying real-world entities, their properties and interactions between them."

        "One of the earliest and most notable accounts on case roles is without any doubt Charles Fillmore's groundbreaking article (Fillmore 1968).",
        "His most fundamental argument is that the notion of case is not so much connected to morphosyntactic surface realisation as to syntactico-semantic categories in the deep structure of a language.",
        "Particular constellations of case roles determine distinctive functional patterns, a considerable part of which (according to Fillmore) is likely to be universally valid.",
        "This deep-structure case system can be realized in the surface structure by means of a set of language-dependent transformation rules (see Fillmore 1968).",
        "As a consequence there has to be a regular mapping between the case system and its surface realization – which includes case markers, word order, grammatical roles, etc.",
        "For our research, we will disregard the transformational dimension in Fillmore's theory but we will nevertheless assume that there is at least some degree of correspondence between the case role system underlying a language and its (1) morphosyntax, (2) relative word order and (3) lexicon.",
        "In Halliday's systemic-functional grammar (Halliday 1994; Halliday & Matthiessen 1999), functional patterns that are part of the language's deep structure are organized as figures, i.e. configurations of case roles which consist of:",
        "1.",
        "A nuclear process, which is typically realized by a verb phrase.",
        "Processes express an event or state as it is distinctly perceived by the language user.",
        "2.",
        "A limited number of participants, which are inherent to the process and are typically realized by noun phrases.",
        "They represent entities or abstractions that participate in the process.",
        "3.",
        "An in theory unlimited number of circumstantial elements.",
        "Circumstances are in most cases optional and are typically realized by prepositional or adverbial phrases.",
        "They allocate the process and its participants in a temporal, spatial, causal, ... context.",
        "Processes are classified into types and subtypes, each having its particular participant combinations.",
        "We discern four main process types: Material, Mental, Verbal and Relational (Halliday 1994).",
        "Figure 1 is an example of a verbal process, the Sayer being the participant 'doing' the process and the Receiver the one to whom the (implicit) verbal message is directed.",
        "Since these main types (and some secondary ones) correspond to universal experiential modi, it is to be expected that they will have a certain universal validity, i.e. that they are in some way or another present in all languages of the world.",
        "For our preliminary experiments, we use a reduced version of the case role model proposed by Halliday (1994, p. 106-175), as it is a consistent, well-developed and relatively simple system, which makes it very suitable for testing the validity of our assumptions.",
        "For actual applications, we will replace it by a more elaborate variant, most likely Bateman's Generalized Upper Model (Bateman 1990; Bateman et al.",
        "in progress).",
        "Bateman's model is finer-grained than Halliday's; it is to a large extent language-independent; and it has been specifically developed for implementation into NLP systems (see Bateman et al.",
        "in progress)."

        "Given the framework outlined above, we consider case role detection to be a standard classification task.",
        "In pattern classification one attempts to learn certain patterns or rules from classified examples and to use them for classifying previously unseen instances (Hand 1997).",
        "In our case, a class is a concatenation of case roles that constitute one particular process (i.e. the deep structure figure) and the pattern itself is to be derived from the morphosyntactic and lexical properties corresponding to that process (its surface realisation).",
        "Taking that point-of-view, individual realisations of figures – roughly corresponding to stripped-down clauses – are translated into fixed-length sets of lexical and morphosyntactic features (word order is implicitly encoded) and a functional classification is manually assigned to them.",
        "For each verb the classification algorithm then attempts to match all functional patterns to one or a few relevant sets of distinctive features.",
        "The latter are translated into patterns that can be used to match an occurrence in a text to a particular constellation of case roles.",
        "The entire learning process consists of five main steps:",
        "1.",
        "Preprocessing 2.",
        "Annotation 3.",
        "Feature selection 4.",
        "Training of the classifier 5.",
        "Translation into rules",
        "In the preprocessing phase, the input text is tagged, lemmatised and chunked.",
        "The output is standardized and passed to the annotation tool,",
        "in which the user is asked to assign case role patterns to individual clauses.",
        "For now, we will only take into account processes, participants and circumstantial elements of Extent and Location.",
        "In a next step, individual training examples – each example corresponding to one figure – are converted to a fixed-length feature vector.",
        "For each phrase, the lexical and morphosyntactic features of the head and of the left and right context boundaries (i.e. the first and the last and each of its relevant features has a fixed position.",
        "We expect this vector representation to be relevant in most languages apart from free word order languages.",
        "Currently, our model focuses on English.",
        "In the fourth step, the classifier is trained to discriminate features that are distinctive for each process type associated with a particular verb.",
        "These features are again translated into rules that can be used for reassigning case roles that have been learned to previously unseen text.",
        "token of the strings pre and postmodifying the head) are automatically extracted from the tagged text and added to the vector.",
        "This enables us to align corresponding features quite accurately without having to resort to any complex form of phrasal analysis.",
        "Although this reduction of the context of the head word may seem to be counter-intuitive from a grammatical point-of-view, our initial tests indicate that it does capture most constructions that are relevant to the extraction task.",
        "Feature selection is necessary for two main reasons.",
        "Firstly, it is impossible to take into account all lexical and morphosyntactic features, since that would boost the time-complexity, incorporate many irrelevant features and bring down accuracy when a limited set of training examples is available.",
        "Secondly, natural language utterances have the uncanny habit of being of variable length.",
        "The latter aspect is problematic not only because classification algorithms usually expect a clearly delineated set of features, but also because it is crucial to align examples in order to compare correspondent features.",
        "In our test setting, we will constrain the maximal number of case roles per figure to four.",
        "Since each case role is transformed into a set of 10 features, a figure will be translated into a 40- dimensional feature vector (see Figure 2).",
        "As a result, a particular constellation of case roles is treated as one pattern in which each role This is necessary because the variable length of figures and – within figures – of phrases is bound to cause difficulties when applying the patterns that were learned to new sentences.",
        "Rules have the advantage over feature vectors in that they allow us to use head-centred stretching: when figures are assigned to previously unseen sentences and no pattern can immediately be matched, the nearest equivalent according to the head of the figure will be assigned; the rest of the pattern will be allocated by shifting the left and right context of the head towards the left and right sentence boundaries.",
        "A similar approach will be used for matching individual roles to phrases."

        "We are currently investigating whether both problems might be dealt with by encoding the relative position of case roles explicitly.",
