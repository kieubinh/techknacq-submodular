        "During the last ten years, research has been driven and products have been developed to provide efficient linguistic tools for many languages.",
        "For example, Unicode is more and more a reality in today's operating systems and Microsoft Office XP contains proofing tools for more than 40 languages.",
        "However, for most of the world's people, the Information Era is still limited to using hardware and software that do not meet their needs in terms of language and script resources.",
        "Following the SALTMIL1 terminology, we will call a minority language a language which has a smaller resource base than the major languages.",
        "According to the Ethnologue2, more than 6800 different languages are spoken in the world.",
        "This number of languages shows that we are still far from having a software answer for all of them."

        "Windows (since Windows NT 3.1), MacIntosh (since MacOS 8.5) and Unix/Linux now support Unicode and many fonts are available, especially TrueType fonts3 such as Arial Unicode MS which contains a large part of Unicode (51,180 glyphs but also 23 Mb that may slow our computers).",

        "Though we may find that the coverage of several tens of languages in tools such as a word processor is a significant evolution because it covers most of the languages in terms of number of speakers, we also have to notice that it still covers less than 1% of them in terms of number of languages.",
        "This question has been increasingly discussed in the recent years.",
        "The SALTMIL group was",
        "created to “promote research and development in the field of speech and language technology for lesser-used languages, particularly those of Europe”.",

        "After having verified that the need of script is covered by Unicode or at least by a de facto standard or simply by a font, one of the first difficulties generally met when starting with a new language is the lack of texts and dictionaries.",

        "Here raises a major problem: such resources are time consuming, in other terms expensive.",
