        "In this paper we describe a parser for robust and flexible interpretation of user utterances in a web-based multi-modal text retrieving system.",
        "The parser forms part of a system for web search in Austrian newspaper databases.",
        "In this system, users can formulate queries or navigation commands using utterances in both spontaneous spoken or written language, and they can navigate and follow links using mouse clicks.",
        "Users are completely free in formulating their utterances and in the use and combination of the input modes.",
        "Typed and spoken utterances may contain combinations of query expressions, browser commands and search space restrictions.",
        "Users may search for texts with a specific date, in a specific newspaper or in a specific section of a newspaper.",
        "They may give complex context descriptions of the texts and they may refer to previously found texts.",
        "A dialogue manager stores actions and results from previous states and supplies information in order to construct fully specified formal queries from underspecified user requests.",
        "In order to allow for this freedom in user behaviour, flexible processing modules are needed.",
        "For every utterance, the parser and the dialogue manager must come up with an adequate interpretation.",
        "At the same time, in interpreting the input, they have to be robust and fault-tolerant.",
        "They have to cope with typical phenomena of spontaneous speech like hesitation, correction and repetition.",
        "There may be typographical errors in written input or – even more difficult to deal with – speech recognition errors from the spoken queries.",
        "Such errors often distort the meaning of the utterance and are difficult to detect and correct.",
        "In our interpretation component, shallow parsing techniques and knowledge-based text retrieval methods are combined to allow for robust processing and coordination of input modes.",
        "We employ a two-layered approach.",
        "The first layer serves to separate structure from content, i.e., parts of utterances referring to browser commands and search restrictions (temporal expressions, newspaper types or sections) are analyzed with a combination of keyword spotting and pattern recognition.",
        "The underlying assumption is that users will restrict themselves to a rather small vocabulary and a limited range of expressions in expressing this sort of information (this assumption is also confirmed by our Wizard-of-Oz experiments).",
        "During this process, stop words (function words and other words typically not contributing to the content of the query) are also removed.",
        "The remaining words – which are assumed to describe the search content – are then grouped according to co-occurrence statistics which have been derived from a newspaper corpus.",
        "While text retrieval with the help of linguistic processing has become rather common, multimodal interaction with textual databases on the web is a fairly recent application of Natural Language Processing.",
        "Experience from text retrieval shows that most information is expressed in adjective-noun, noun-preposition-noun, and noun-verb groups (Grefenstette, 1992).",
        "In our specific domain, the third type can be neglected, because verbs typically denote the action – mostly search – which is already extracted in the first layer.",
        "Thus, co-occurrence statistics consist of typical noun phrases as they appear in newspaper texts."

        "In order to assess user behaviour, we carried out Wizard-of-Oz experiments (Fraser and Gilbert, 1991).",
        "Speech recognition and text retrieval were simulated.",
        "In different sessions the users interacted with a number of versions of the system: single input mode versions and versions with combinations of input modes.",
        "Their performance in terms of number of interactions as well as task completion time was measured, and their comments regarding the interface and the (simulated) system were collected in a questionnaire.",
        "Users were grouped according to previous experience with search engines and the web in general.",
        "Our results show that both, beginners and advanced users, preferred multimodal interaction over single input modes, and beginners in particular were able to speed up task completion times significantly with the help of a combination of spoken and written input with mouse clicks (Klein et al., 2001).",
        "From these experiments, we also obtained a corpus of written and spoken utterances which were considered in the further design of the system.",
        "The queries which were posed by the users in spoken language were recorded.",
        "The recorded utterances were later read to a speech recognition system.",
        "This gave us an impression of the number and type of errors to be expected in dealing with queries in spontaneous speech."

        "Users can access articles with spoken or typed utterances.",
        "Web queries may relate to the way some particular piece of infomation is presented and what this information refers to.",
        "They may also express browser commands or a combination of browser and query commands while referring either to structure (Search for Noll in the previous newspaper) or to content (Search for Noll in the sports’ section).1 Within our application web queries may relate to the way some particular piece of information is presented (e.g. the browser’s history about the accessed pages), and what this information refers to (e.g. the section a search string belongs to).",
        "To successfully interpret such an utterance, one needs to analyze its structure to find out which of these command modes the utterance can be assigned to.",
        "This is done in a two-step process.",
        "First, each word is looked up in a lexicon and assigned a semantic category.",
        "Second, certain rules are applied to strings of these semantic categories.",
        "As a result, commands and search restrictions are recognized and the rest of the utterance is passed to search expression interpretation."

        "We will now describe in more detail how the user’s input is parsed within the Natural Language Interface, and structured into either search patterns – consisting of search strings, sections, dates and timeranges, that are understood by the search engine of the newspaper – or commands for the Java browser.",
        "Structure is analyzed by a flexible bottom-up parser using a rule-based mechanism with simple syntactic patterns.",
        "In the user’s query input, each word of the utterance is looked up in a lexicon and - if found - assigned a corresponding semantic category.",
        "This lexicon contains a small list of semantic categories, that we consider important for the interpretation of an utterance in the domain of searching articles and browsing.",
        "The lexicon assigns semantic classes for closed categories that are:",
        "• nouns denoting search, newspaper, section, links like “Suche” (search) or “Artikel” (article).",
        "• nouns expressing a specific section like “Wirtschaft” (economy).",
        "• nouns expressing a specific page like “Homepage ”.",

        "• cardinal and ordinal numbers used in conjunction",
        "with temporal expressions and link expressions, like in “ zwei ” (two) years ago or when opening the “ersten ” (first) link.",
        "• adverbs and connectives indicating constraints on search mode, like “nur” (only) and “nicht” (not).",
        "• prepositions indicating whether the request was to browse or to search, cf “zum Sport” (to the sports’ section) versus “im Sport” (within the sports’section).",
        "• stop words.",
        "All words found within the lexicon are replaced by their corresponding semantic classes, search expressions are marked as such, and stop words are deleted.",
        "We distinguish between semantic atoms and semantic classes: atoms by itself do not have a meaning that can be used for searching or browsing commands.",
        "They have to be joined following a given set of rules to form a semantic class.",
        "To yield such a class, rules are applied in – mostly – one to three steps.",
        "However, rules are not always necessary, a word may also be mapped onto a semantic class right away.",
        "Our lexicon has about 30 semantic atoms, from which about 40 semantic classes can be formed.",
        "Certain patterns of semantic classes which we obtain through lexical lookup can be assigned new meanings via rules.",
        "So, by composing the individual meanings, another more abstract meaning is defined.",
        "This compositional approach to interpretation is supported by the layered approach.",
        "The result of this process is a list of chunks2, where stress is laid on the content words.",
        "The advantage of concentrating on chunks is – especially within German, a language with a relatively free word order – that the order in which chunks occur is much more flexible than the order of words within chunks.",
        "This approach might be too shallow for a deeper semantic analysis, but is sufficient for our needs.",
        "So, e.g.",
        "“letzte ” (last) plus a time expression would together yield the new meaning date-1w.",
        "To overcome ambiguities and avoid potential rule conflicts, rules spanning larger chunks have a higher priority and are thus preferred, such that “zur¨uck zum Sport” (back to sports) would win over “zur¨uck” (back).",
        "If no rules can be applied to a semantic class, it will be ignored in the final interpretation.",
        "Summing up the process of the structure analysis, the partial analyses are stored, a sequence of partial analyses from the set of rules is chosen, and then combined to yield larger structures."

        "These pairs were stored and consulted in query interpretation.",
        "Since the texts are tagged manually, the lists of adjectives and nouns/proper names contain a considerable number of errors.",

        "This of course can not prevent systematic tagging errors.",
        "A robust stemming algorithm maps all adjective-noun/proper-name pairs to an approximate ’stem’, thus eliminating flectional forms which result in morphological variation which is typical for the German language.",
        "For the purpose of creating a repository of co-occurrence pairs, we do not care about proper stemming.",
        "Rather, it is our aim to map various inflectional forms onto one base form.",
        "Spelling variations, numbers etc.",
        "are smoothed as far as it is possible in automatic processing.",
        "For example, ordinal numbers which are labelled as adjectives are reduced to a placeholder for numbers.",
        "Whenever a word is encountered in processing which can be considered an adjective, it is kept.",
        "Whenever the following word may be a noun or a proper name, it is checked whether the adjective-noun/proper-name combination is contained in the repository of adjective-noun/proper-name combinations which has previously been extracted from a corpus.",
        "If the adjective-noun/proper-name combination is found, it is passed on to the search engine as a query.",
        "Whenever the combination has not occurred in the corpus, only the noun or proper name is considered a key word.",
        "Again, inflectional variations as well as different spellings etc.",
        "are mapped onto base forms as far as possible.",
        "The same stemming algorithm is used which was employed in creating the repository of adjective-noun/proper name pairs.",
        "The robust (and rough) stemming and categorization algorithms produce a certain amount of mistakes in the lists of pairs as well as in the mapping process, but taking into account larger text corpora evens out these problems as more text is processed.",
        "Our approach distinguishes noun phrases which have a record of co-occurrence from noun phrases which may be spontaneous expressions or modifications or even errors created by users.",
        "For example, the phrase “europ¨aische Staaten ” (European countries) would be retained while “beteiligte Staaten ” (participating countries) would be reduced to the noun.",
        "Some adjectives used in search expressions serve to qualify the global search expression rather than the noun or proper name in quesion.",
