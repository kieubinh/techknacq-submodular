      "text": [
        "The sentence In the far reaches of her mind, Anne believed that Kyle was having an affair1 can be analyzed as depending on metaphorical views of MIND AS PHYSICAL SPACE and IDEAS AS PHYSICAL OBJECTS (see Barnden 2001a).",
        "These views are, plausibly, familiar to typical users of English.",
        "However, it is reasonable to assume that typical users do not already have a mapping into the mental domain of the physical notion of \"far reaches\".",
        "Our approach to metaphor is predicated on the notion that one should, when possible, avoid constructing source-to-target mappings for such elements of a metaphorical utterance that transcend the already known mappings in the metaphorical views underlying the utterance.",
        "Instead, we advocate the use of metaphor-pretence \"cocoons\" (reasoning spaces) where the utterance is taken as literally true.",
        "Within",
        "cocoon reasoning will attempt to connect these \"map-transcending\" elements to aspects of the source using a set of specified conversion rules.",
        "The far-reaches qualification in the sentence implies by source-domain reasoning that Anne could only to a very low degree physically manipulate the idea that Kyle was having an affair.",
        "Then, if we can appeal to a conversion rule, i.e. a known mapping of ability to physically manipulate an idea to ability to consciously process it, we can draw the reasonable conclusion that Anne only had a very low degree of ability to consciously process the idea.",
        "In our presentation, we shall demonstrate how the ATT-Meta system deals with this example.",
        "Note that the rules of reasoning are given a qualitative certainty level, and that predicates can be graded, using a scale of qualitative degrees.",
        "For instance, someone can be represented as understanding a situation to a \"medium\" degree.",
        "Our approach also makes heavy use of \"viewneutral mapping adjuncts\" (VNMAs).",
        "These are general mapping principles (inspired by the work of Carbonell 1982) that apply, though only by default, no matter what metaphorical views are in play.",
        "For instance, the ability to do things and the degrees with which states of affairs hold are automatically mapped by VNMAs.",
        "In many examples of metaphor, most of the real mapping work is done by VNMAs.",
        "Much of the approach has been implemented in the ATT-Meta system, which is an uncertain rule-based system operating by backchaining (see also Barnden 1998, Barnden 2001, Lee & Barnden, 2001a).",
        "ATT-Meta performs reasoning, but does not yet interface directly to natural language.",
        "Instead, hand-constructed logical forms couching the source-domain meaning of metaphorical sentences are passed to it.",
        "In the above example, the source-domain meaning is that Anne’s believing was literally physically located in the physical far reaches of her mind.",
        "The following sections summarize various abilities of the system, principles of the approach, and aspects of ongoing theoretical work aimed at further extensions to the system.",
        "A major item of current implementational work is a fuller realization of VNMAs."

      "heading": "1 Uncertainty",
      "text": [
        "Although reasoning conflict and uncertainty are intricately involved in metaphor, very few approaches attempt to grapple with the issues.",
        "Propositions and reasoning within both the target and source domains, being largely of common-sense varieties, are typically uncertain.",
        "It can be uncertain what metaphorical views are involved; information transferred from the source domain can conflict with target-domain information; and transfers can even conflict with each other.",
        "The ATT-Meta system handles all these types of uncertainty and conflict.",
        "Its uncertainty handling is based on fairly crude qualitative uncertainty annotations on rules and propositions, but there is a sophisticated conflict-resolution mechanism.",
        "The uncertainty-handling and conflict-resolution are almost entirely orthogonal to the provisions for metaphor.",
        "This leads to clean design and helps to address long-standing issues about metaphor.",
        "One such issue is the conflict between information transferred from the source domain and the target information.",
        "ATT-Meta allows either side to win, depending on standard specificity principles.",
        "This goes against a naive assumption in most of the literature that target information should automatically override transfers.",
        "But, this is only convincing when the target information is certain.",
        "Indeed, we claim that metaphor is often used precisely to describe an exception to a target-domain default."

      "heading": "2 Mixed Metaphors",
      "text": [
        "Issues such as reasoning about uncertainty are particularly important in the processing of mixed metaphors.",
        "Mixed metaphors need not feature obvious cases of conflict but can include graceful combinations of metaphors, such as the following sentence to be examined below: One part of John hotly resented the verdict.",
        "This combines a view of John as made up of sub-agents and a view of agents’ emotional states as things that can have temperature.",
        "It is possible to distinguish two types of mixed metaphor: parallel mixes and serial mixes.",
        "In a parallel mixed metaphor, the target (A) is seen partly through an A-as-B metaphor and partly through another metaphor, A-as-B’.",
        "B and B’ are in general different domains, but may overlap.",
        "Also, different aspects of A may be involved in the two metaphors.",
        "In a serial mixed metaphor (commonly called a chained metaphor), the target (A) is seen as a source (B), which is in turn then seen as a different source (C).",
        "Previous work on the understanding of metaphor has assumed that mixing is a relatively rare phenomenon that can be handled once a more theory of simple metaphor is developed.",
        "We argue that this assumption is detrimental to progress since mixed metaphors rely on the same conceptual knowledge as simple metaphors and can, therefore, provide valuable insight into the processes and representations underlying metaphorical reasoning.",
        "Moreover, we claim that the reasoning processes and data structures involved in understanding mixed metaphors are identical to those used in understanding simple metaphors.",
        "Therefore, any current theory of metaphor should (at least in principle) be extensible to deal with mixing.",
        "To this end, ATT-Meta handles mixed metaphor in a manner consistent with the way it handles simple metaphors.",
        "The two types of metaphor are processed in subtly different ways.",
        "Parallel mixed metaphors create separate pretence-cocoons that are mapped in parallel to the target domain where their respective contributions are understood.",
        "Serial mixed metaphors create nested pretence cocoons where the metaphorical view of B as C is nested within a pretence cocoon with the view of A as B."

      "heading": "3 Reverse Transfers in Metaphor",
      "text": [
        "The use of metaphor involves a flow of effects of some kind from the source domain to the target domain, where effects can include insights into the target, hypotheses about the target, or the highlighting of parts of the target.",
        "However, although the overall effect flow is always from source to target, in many cases, this does not preclude a reverse flow where a literal proposition, command, or question is mapped onto an equivalent within the current metaphorical domain.",
        "The ATT-Meta system allows conversion rules to map from propositions in the source domain to propositions in the target domain and also in the opposite direction.",
        "So a source domain proposition such as \"Socrates was the midwife for an idea\" might be mapped onto the target domain proposition \"Socrates helped in the production of the idea\".",
        "However, the rules would equally allow the proposition \"Socrates helped in the production of the idea\" to be mapped to the source domain proposition \"Socrates was the midwife for an idea\".",
        "We argue that there are at least three reasons why ATT-Meta should have this ability: (1) Given that metaphors are ultimately used to have an effect on the target domain, the use of a metaphorical utterance can be seen as answering, in some sense, a target domain query.",
        "This sets up a choice between taking the metaphorical utterance and applying all conversion rules to it in the hope that one of the resulting propositions might provide a suitable answer, or taking the question and converting it into a question in terms of the current metaphor.",
        "We argue that the latter is often more efficient.",
        "(2) Certain source domain propositions would allow ATT-Meta to draw a tentative conclusion, which would, were it more strongly supported, provide an argument via a chain of reasoning for some other, target level, proposition or query.",
        "A target-level statement might give the added support, but for this to be the case it would first need to be converted into its source-level equivalent.",
        "(3) The combination of source and target domain information within a discourse that only intermittently maintains a metaphorical view of the target domain may best be done in the source domain after the target domain information has been \"metaphorized\".",
        "This would be especially so if the source domain was information-rich compared to the target domain, so allowing much more reasoning to be carried out than would be possible in the target domain."

      "heading": "4 Non-Declarative Metaphor",
      "text": [
        "Almost all examples of metaphorical language discussed in the literature are of declarative utterances rather than questions, commands, ejaculations, etc.",
        "However, these other forms of utterance can obviously occur.",
        "For instance, just as one can state \"John is a steamroller’’ one can ask \"Is John a steamroller?’’ Just as one can state \"The champion knocked the cream-puff out’’ one can issue the command \"Knock that cream-puff out!’’ The observation that questions, in particular, can be metaphorical, plays a significant role in our theoretical approach.",
        "This is because their processing is contiguous with that of implicit queries generated within the metaphorical pretence cocoon (see Introduction) during ATT-Meta’s goal-directed reasoning.",
        "However, the theoretical significance of non-declarative metaphorical utterances is even greater, because such utterances call into question accounts of metaphor that assume the task of understanding is to work out what claim about the target domain the metaphorical utterance is making.",
        "Compiling such examples is an additional goal of our corpus work (see section 6)."

        "Preliminary investigations confirm the expectation that such aspectual information is preserved in the majority of cases.",
        "Exceptions exist, however, and these merit further study.",
        "The mapping of temporal duration between domains is also being investigated.",
        "In some cases, a mapping appears to exist whereby an event of long duration relative to the source domain maps to an event with long duration relative to the target domain.",
        "This can be captured by an appropriate VNMA, which maps relative durations between domains.",
        "The logic of ATT-Meta is episode-based, which means that it is relatively straightforward to express this kind of constraint and employ it in reasoning.",

        "Moon 1998), and (d) to uncover (in small numbers of documents) the degree to which metaphorical utterances relate to context: how much their understanding depends on context and how much the understanding of the context depends in turn on them.",
        "We are interested in (d) because in the ATT-Meta approach the process of metaphorical understanding is partially guided by discourse goals set up by context.",
        "This feature goes a long way to sidestepping problems of apparent indeterminacy of meaning of metaphorical utterances when taken in isolation.",
        "We also have the methodological objectives of developing a good annotation regime for metaphor and better-automated search techniques for metaphor.",
        "As part of the latter, we plan to investigate the usefulness of a large set of morphological, lexical, syntactic and phraseological clues to the presence of metaphor, inspired by the clues discussed by Goatly (1997).",
        "These clues are only present in a minority of metaphorical utterances but could nevertheless form a useful weapon in the automated search armoury.",

        "The ATT-Meta project is making headway in showing how metaphorical utterances can be computationally processed.",
        "It is based on a distinctive set of principles as to how to understand metaphor, some of which are original and some related to those of previous researchers.",
        "In particular, it seeks to avoid expensive computation of new analogical mappings between domains as a regular part of metaphorical understanding.",
        "This is inspired partly by the observation that genuinely novel pairings of domains are relatively rare in real discourse.",
        "What are more common are novel extensions of familiar metaphorical views, and novel mixes of views.",
        "This is true even in poetry (Lakoff and Turner 1989).",
