        "Work in automated natural language generation (NLG) has typically focused on specific types of text, such as advices (e.g., on correcting program errors), reports (e.g., of project activities), or persuasions (e.g., to stop smoking).",
        "The \"Polibox\" generator, whose first prototype is just being completed, combines in a single system three different discourse purposes: describe an object, compare an object to another, evaluate one object with respect to another.",
        "A mixture of these purposes can be found in discourses that inform about certain products and possibly involve recommendations on choosing one rather than the other.",
        "In a typical scenario, a client asks an expert about a particular type of product suitable for the client's needs, and the expert responds with descriptions of several candidates, compares them, and possibly singles out one candidate as especially well-suited.",
        "While in general this amounts to a dialogue application, Polibox merely handles the text generation side.",
        "The client thus provides a description of their needs via a menu, and Polibox selects suitable products and generates descriptions.",
        "However, rather than combining them all into a single text, individual descriptions are kept distinct, and the user can select the order in which they are presented.",
        "This takes up the idea of \"adaptive hypertext\" realised in ILEX (Mellish et al.",
        "1998) or Peba-II (Milosavljevic 1997).",
        "The following section describes the overall architecture of Polibox, and subsequent sections explain in more detail how content selection, text planning, and sentence planning are being done.",
        "Finally, Polibox is compared to related earlier research."

        "The student specifies topics they want to see covered by the book, the language, the programming language used, the desired presence of code examples and exercises.",
        "Polibox determines a small number of books that match the requirements and generates a description of the first, accompanied by hyperlinks to further descriptions, if any.",
        "When the student selects a link, a text on the second title is generated and presented, and this description is very likely to contain explicit comparisons to the book that has been presented before.",
        "Hence, all but the first book description pay attention not only to the \"target features\" specified by the user, but also to the prior descriptions, as stored in the discourse history.",
        "Furthermore, the generator may decide that one book is a clear favourite and actively recommend this one, using various In contrast to TITLEI, TITLE2 by AUTHOR2 uses Lisp as the underlying programming language.",
