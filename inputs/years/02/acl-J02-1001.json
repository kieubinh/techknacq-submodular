        "Since the so-called integrative approach to anaphor resolution was developed in the late 1980s (Carbonell and Brown 1988; Rich and LuperFoy 1988; Asher and Wada 1989), and its practical viability extensively tested (e.g., Lappin and Leass 1994; Mitkov 1997, 1998), it has been common wisdom that factors determining the antecedents of anaphors divide into filters and preferences.",
        "The former exclude impossible antecedents and help to circumscribe the set of antecedent candidates; the latter help to pick the most likely candidate, which will be proposed as the antecedent.",
        "Binding constraints are a significant subset of such filters.",
        "As they delimit the relative positioning of anaphors and their possible antecedents in grammatical geometry, these constraints are crucial to restricting the search space for antecedents and enhancing the performance of anaphor resolvers.1 From an empirical perspective, they stem from quite robust generalizations and exhibit a universal character, given their parameterized validity across natural languages.",
        "From a conceptual point of view, in turn, the relations among binding constraints involve nontrivial symmetry, which lends them a modular nature.",
        "Accordingly, they have been considered one of the most robust and intriguing grammar submodules, usually referred to as binding theory.",
        "However, in contrast to this, the formal and computational handling of binding constraints has presented considerable resistance.",
        "Anaphor resolution typically builds on many sources of information – among them, information about the grammatical structure of the sentence – so that the different filters and preferences may be used.",
        "Consequently, it must in general be regarded as a postgrammatical process, in the sense that it is completed after sentences are parsed.",
        "Binding constraints, as a subset of the filters for anaphor resolution, are a special case",
        "in this respect.",
        "Given that they form a submodule of grammar, they are specified on a par with other grammatical submodules and constraints, and they are thus expected to be integrated already into the processing of grammar.",
        "Nevertheless, this integration cannot be considered to have been adequately achieved.",
        "As we will discuss at length, the original methodology for verifying the compliance of grammatical representations with binding constraints requires extragrammatical processing steps delivering a forest of indexed trees to anaphor resolvers (Chomsky 1981).",
        "More recently, constraint-based grammatical frameworks either require special-purpose extensions of the description formalism, though ensuring only a partial handling of these constraints, as in Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG; Dalrymple 1993), or do not offer a solution yet to integrate them into grammar, as in Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG; Pollard and Sag 1994).2 Our primary goal here is thus to bridge the gap between the grammatical nature of binding constraints and their full integration into grammar processing.",
        "In particular, we aim at achieving this in such a way that a lean interface between grammar and reference processing emerges.",
        "In Section 2, we first underline the distinction, seldom taken into account, between specification and verification of binding constraints.",
        "We then review advances proposed in the literature concerning the completion of the verification task.",
        "We observe that three major lines of progress can be identified: packing of anaphoric ambiguity, packing of nonlocal context, and lexicalization of binding constraints.",
        "Building on these contributions, in Section 3 we argue that the remaining step forward is to harmonize these different advances.",
        "We suggest that a more accurate, semantics-driven comprehension of the nature of binding constraints is a relevant move toward this harmonization.",
        "On the basis of this revision, we introduce a methodology for verifying these constraints, which rests on the new concept of binding machine, to be defined.",
        "In Section 4, in the light of this new methodology, we show how binding constraints can be given a unification-based specification and can be fully integrated into grammar.",
        "In Section 5, we present an illustrative example and discuss in detail how binding constraints and reference-processing systems are coordinated, and how the previously identified drawbacks are overcome."

        "If one disregards step (b) – a disguised recency preference mixed with binding constraints – and considers the result of verifying these constraints to be the assignment to an NP of the set of indices of its grammatically admissible antecedents, then it is possible to discard the proliferation of indexed trees as a way to express anaphoric ambiguity.",

        "Some differences between versions are due just to this fact that binding constraints are supposed to be accommodated into different grammatical frameworks; some other differences, however, are real differences of specification in the sense that different variants may not have the same empirical coverage or be aimed at predicting the same (un)grammatical constructions.",
        "In the Appendix, we present a common and fairly well empirically tested version of binding theory given the current state of the art in this area, a version presently adopted in the HPSG framework.",

        "12 The internal state of the machine after its operation is a representation of the contextualized anaphoric capacity of n under the form of the set of reference markers of the grammatically admissible antecedents of n. This internal state results when the binding constraint associated with n is applied to the input, and it is the interface point between grammar and reference processing.",
        "This set of reference markers collects the antecedent candidates, and its elements are submitted to other filters and preferences by the anaphor resolvers so that one of them ends up being chosen as the antecedent.",
        "The input, in turn, is a representation of the aspects of the context relevant to help circumscribe the anaphoric potential of nominal anaphors.",
        "It is coded under the form of three lists of reference markers, A, Z, and U.",
        "In list A, the reference markers of the local o-commanders of n are ordered according to their relative grammatical obliqueness; Z includes the o-commanders of n, possibly observing a multiclausal obliqueness hierarchy; and U is the list of all reference markers in the discourse context, including those not linguistically introduced.",
        "Given this setup, the contribution of binding constraints in circumscribing the anaphoric potential of nominals is explicitly acknowledged.",
        "The particular contextualized instantiation of that potential and the verification of binding constraints coincide and consist of a few simple steps.",
        "If n is a short-distance reflexive, its internal state is set UP as A', where A' contains the reference markers of the o-commanders of n in A.",
        "If n is a long-distance reflexive, its semantic representation includes Z', such that Z' contains the o-commanders of n in Z.",
        "If n is a pronoun, B = U \\ (A' U [r-mark„]) is encoded into its representation, where r-mark„ is the reference marker of n. Finally, if n is a nonpronoun, its updated semantics keeps a copy of C = U \\ (Z' U [r-mark„]).",
        "Besides adhering to an empirically grounded conception of binding constraints, this approach embodies, and harmonizes, the crucial contributions of previous proposals concerning the verification of these constraints.",
        "It assumes the lexicalization of binding constraints.",
        "Concomitantly, it builds on specific strategies for the packing of anaphoric ambiguity (viz., list of reference markers) and nonlocal context (viz., set of lists of reference markers).",
