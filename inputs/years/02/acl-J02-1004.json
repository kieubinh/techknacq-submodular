        "Part-of-speech (POS) tagging involves many difficult problems, such as insufficient amounts of training data, inherent POS ambiguities, and (most seriously) many types of unknown words.",
        "Unknown words are ubiquitous in any application and cause major tagging failures in many cases.",
        "Since Korean is an agglutinative language, it presents more serious problems with unknown morphemes than with unknown words because more than one morpheme can be unknown in a single word and morpheme segmentation is usually very difficult.",
        "Previous techniques for guessing unknown words mostly utilize the guessing rules to analyze the word features by looking at leading and trailing characters.",
        "Most of them employ the analysis of trailing characters and other features such as capitalization and hyphenation (Kupiec 1992; Weischedel et al.",
        "1993).",
        "Some of them use more morphologically oriented word features such as suffixes, prefixes, and character lengths (Brill 1995; Voutilainen 1995).",
        "The guessing rules are usually handcrafted using knowledge of morphology but sometimes are acquired automatically using lexicons and corpora (Brill 1995; Mikheev 1996; Oflazer and T¨ur 1996).",
        "Previously developed methods for guessing unknown morphemes in Korean are not much different from the methods used for English.",
        "Basically, they rely on the rules that reflect knowledge of Korean morphology and word formation.",
        "The usual way of handling unknown morphemes is to guess all the possible POS tags for an unknown morpheme by checking connectable functional morphemes in the same eojeol (Kang 1993).2 However, in this way, it is only possible to guess probable POS tags for a single unknown morpheme when it occurs at the beginning of an eojeol.",
        "Unlike in English, in Korean, more than one unknown morpheme can appear in a single eojeol because an eojeol can include complex components such as Chinese characters, Japanese words, and other foreign words.",
        "If an eojeol contains more than one unknown morpheme or if the unknown morphemes appear in other than first position in the eojeol, all previous methods fail to efficiently estimate them.",
        "This is the reason why we try to avoid conventional guessing rules using word morphology features such as those proposed in Mikheev (1996) and Oflazer and T¨ur (1996).3 In this paper, we propose a syllable-pattern-based generalized unknown-morpheme estimation method using a morpheme pattern dictionary that enables us to treat unknown morphemes in the same way as registered known morphemes, and thereby to guess them regardless of their numbers or positions in an eojeol.",
        "The method for estimating unknown morphemes using the morpheme pattern dictionary in Korean needs to be tightly integrated into morphological analysis and POS disambiguation systems.",
        "POS disambiguation has usually been performed by statistical approaches, mainly using the hidden Markov model (HMM) in English research communities (Cutting et al.",
        "1992; Kupiec 1992; Weischedel et al.",
        "1993).",
        "These approaches are also dominant for Korean, with slight improvements to accommodate the agglutinative nature of Korean.",
        "For Korean, early HMM tagging was based on eojeols.",
        "The eojeol-based tagging model calculates lexical and transition probabilities with eojeols as a unit; it suffers from severe data sparseness problems since a single eojeol consists of many different morphemes (Lee, Choi, and Kim 1993).",
        "Later, morpheme-based HMM tagging was tried; such models assign a single tag to a morpheme regardless of the space in a sentence.",
        "Morpheme-based tagging can reduce data sparseness problems but incurs multiple observation sequences in Viterbi decoding since an eojeol can be segmented in many different ways.",
        "Researchers then tried many ways of reducing computation due to multiple observation sequences, such as shared word sequences and virtual words (Kim, Lim, and Seo 1995) and two-ply HMM for morpheme unit computation but restricted within an eojeol (Kim, Im, and Im 1996).",
        "However, since statistical approaches take neighboring tags into account only within a limited win",
        "dow (usually two or three), sometimes the decision fails to cover important linguistic contexts necessary for POS disambiguation.",
        "Also, approaches using only statistical methods are inappropriate for idiomatic expressions, for which lexical terms need to be directly referenced.",
        "And especially, statistical approaches alone do not suffice for agglutinative languages, which usually have complex morphological structures.",
        "In agglutinative languages, a word usually consists of one or more stem morphemes plus a series of functional morphemes; therefore, each morpheme should receive a POS tag appropriate to its functional role to cope with the complex morphological phenomena in such languages.",
        "Recently, rule-based approaches, which learn symbolic tagging rules automatically from a corpus, have been reconsidered, to overcome the limitations of statistical approaches (Brill 1995).",
        "Some systems even perform POS tagging as part of a syntactic analysis process (Voutilainen 1995).",
        "Following the success of transformation-based approaches, attempts have been made to use transformation rules in systems for tagging Korean (Im, Kim, and Im 1996).",
        "However, in general, rule-based approaches alone are not very robust and are not portable enough to be adjusted to new tagsets or new languages.",
        "Also, they usually perform no better than their statistical counterparts (Brill 1995).",
        "To gain portability and robustness and also to overcome the limited coverage of statistical approaches, we need to somehow combine the two approaches to gain the advantages of each.",
        "In this paper, we propose a hybrid method that combines statistical and rule-based approaches to POS disambiguation and can be tightly coupled with generalized unknown-morpheme-guessing techniques."

      "text": [
        "Korean is classified as an agglutinative language.",
        "In Korean, an eojeol consists of several morphemes that have clear-cut morpheme boundaries.",
        "For example, na-neun gamgi-e geol-lyeoss-dda ‘I caught a cold’ consists of 3 eojeols and 7 morphemes:4 na(‘I’)/T + neun(‘auxiliary particle’)/jS, gam-gi(‘cold’)/MC + e(‘adverb and conjunctive particle’)/jO, geol-li(‘catch’)/DR + eoss(‘past tense’)/eGS + dda(‘final ending’)/eGE.",
        "Below are the characteristics of Korean that must be considered for morphological-level natural language processing and POS tagging.",
        "• POS tagging of Korean is usually performed on a morpheme basis rather than on an eojeol basis.",
        "Accordingly, morphological analysis is essential to POS tagging because morpheme segmentation is much more important and difficult than POS assignment.",
        "Moreover, morphological analysis should segment eojeols that contain unknown morphemes as well as known morphemes.",
        "Hence, unknown-morpheme handling should be integrated into the morphological analysis process.",
        "Because a single eojeol can have many possible analyses (e.g., na-neun: na(‘I’)/T + neun(‘topic marker’)/jS, na(‘sprout’)/DR + neun(‘adnominal’)/eCNMG, nal(‘fly’)/DI + neun(‘adnominal’)/eCNMG, morpheme segmentation is inherently ambiguous.",
        "• Korean is a postpositional language with many kinds of noun endings (particles), verb endings, and prefinal verb endings.",
        "It is these functional morphemes, rather than the order of eojeols, that determine grammatical",
        "relations such as a noun’s syntactic function, a verb’s tense, aspect, modals, and even modifying relations between eojeols.",
        "For example, ga/jC is a case particle, so the eojeol uri(we)-ga has a subject role due to the particle ga/jC.",
        "Korean has a clear syllable structure within the morpheme; most nominal content morphemes keep their surface form when they are combined with functional morphemes.",
        "• Korean is basically an SOV language but has relatively free word order compared with English.",
        "The weight a, 0 in Equation (1) (Section 4.1) reflects the fact that transition probability is less important in Korean than in English.",
        "However, Korean does have some word order constraints: verbs must appear in sentence-final position, and modifiers must be placed before the element they modify.",
        "So some order constraints must be selectively utilized as contextual information in the POS tagging process, which is taken well into account in the design of error correction rules (Section 4.3).",
        "• Complex spelling changes (irregular conjugations) frequently occur between morphemes when two morphemes combine to form an eojeol.",
        "These spelling changes make it difficult to segment the original morphemes before the POS tag symbols are assigned.",
        "• The unknown-morpheme problem in Korean differs in some ways from the unknown-word problem in English.",
        "In English, it is easy to identify unknown words because they occur between spaces.",
        "However, in Korean, since unknown morphemes are hidden in an eojeol, we only know that morphological analysis failed in that eojeol; pinpointing the exact unknown morphemes is usually difficult.",
        "This is why, unlike in English, it is not possible to fully guess an unknown morpheme using only affixes.",
        "The distribution of POS tags for unknown morphemes extracted from a 130,000-morpheme training corpus (9,718 unknown morphemes) is shown in Table 1.",
        "The distribution from even a small corpus shows that we need to estimate various parts of speech for unknown morphemes rather than simply guess them as nouns.",
        "Table 2 shows the tagset that was used in the experiments reported in Section 5.",
        "The tagset was selected from hierarchically organized POS tags for Korean.",
        "We defined about 100 different POS tags, which can be used in morphological analysis as well as in POS tagging.",
        "We also designed over 300 morphotactic adjacency symbols to be used in morpheme connectivity checks for correct morpheme segmentation (to be explained in the next section).",
        "The POS tags are hierarchically organized symbols",
        "that were iteratively refined from the eight major grammatical categories of Korean: nominal, predicate, modifier, particle, ending, affix, special symbol, and interjection.",
        "For a given morpheme, the acronym of a path name in the symbol hierarchy up to a certain level is assigned as a POS tag.",
        "The rest of the detailed hierarchies, which are related only to morpheme connectivity, are independently assigned as morphotactic adjacency symbols.",
        "Therefore, we can use either full or partial path names as POS tags in order to adjust the total number of tags.",
        "The size of the tagset can thus be adapted by refining grammatical categories that are more pertinent to a given application.",
        "For example, for text-indexing applications, we refine nominals more than predicates since index terms are usually nominals in these applications."

        "Once the unknown morphemes are identified and recovered using the pattern dictionary, when checking the unknown morphemes to see if they are connectable, the system can use the same information about adjacent morphemes in the unknown morphemes’ eojeol that it would use if they were known morphemes.",

        "For test sets, we carefully selected three different document sets, aiming for broad coverage.",

        "Version 3 is an even more degraded version that rejects all unknown morphemes as tagging failures; this version does not even perform unknown-morpheme segmentation during morphological analysis.",
        "This experiment verifies the effectiveness of our unknown-morpheme segmentation and guessing techniques, as shown by the sharp performance drops between Versions 1, 2, and 3.",

        "To see the independent performance of unknown-morpheme handling more precisely (explained in Sections 3 and 4.2), we separated the unknown-morpheme performance from hybrid tagging experiments.",
        "Using the same test corpus, we measured the coverage and correctness of our unknown-morpheme estimation techniques.",
        "Table 10 shows the results, which were evaluated by the metrics defined as follows:",
        "When the morphological analyzer meets an unknown morpheme, it is important to detect first whether it is unknown or not, because sometimes, due to incorrect segmentation, an unknown morpheme can be incorrectly processed as a known one.",
        "Our system reached an average recall level of 94.9%.",
        "Once the unknown morphemes are detected, the correct POS needs to be estimated.",
        "Our system tries to guess the POS",
        "of every open class item including common nouns, proper nouns, pronouns, numbers, adverbs, and others.",
        "12 The average precision of 89.7% reflects very accurate guessing considering the range of POSs that need to be estimated.",
        "Table 11 shows the system’s unknown-morpheme guessing performance for each POS tag.",
        "To show the pattern dictionary’s utility, we conducted another experiment in which we gradually reduced the morpheme dictionary size to see the smooth hybrid tagging performance (same as in Table 9) drops.",
        "As the morpheme dictionary gets smaller, POSTAG becomes more dependent on the morpheme pattern dictionary and also on the unknown-morpheme estimation process.",
        "From the full dictionary (with 65,000 nouns), we randomly deleted 5,000 nouns step by step for this series of experiments.",
        "(We deleted only nouns because noun estimation is the best arena for showing the system’s unknown-morpheme estimation power.)",
        "Figure 3 shows the results.",
        "Even if the POSTAG system relies heavily on unknown-morpheme estimation instead of on more accurate dictionary lookups, the performance drop is very slow.",
        "This result explains why POSTAG can be used on open domain materials such as Internet documents even when only a small morpheme dictionary is available."

      "text": [
        "This paper presents a pattern-dictionary-based unknown-morpheme estimation method for generalized and powerful unknown-morpheme segmentation and guessing for a hybrid POS tagging system.",
        "Generalized unknown-morpheme handling is a new and powerful idea that adopts a morpheme pattern dictionary and syllable-based lexical probability estimation.",
        "The morpheme pattern dictionary enables the system to segment unknown morphemes in the same way as registered morphemes without any separate rules for Korean, and thereby to handle them regardless of their numbers or positions in an eojeol.",
        "The paper also presents an error-corrective statistical and",
        "Hybrid tagging performance change (all in %), showing the utility of the pattern dictionary.",
        "Experiments were performed on three different document sets as before.",
        "The x-axis designates the number of deletion steps whereby the morpheme dictionary was decreased (by 5,000s) from its full size of 65,000 nouns (Step 0) to 5,000 nouns (Step 12).",
        "rule-based hybrid POS tagging method that exhibits many novel features such as an experiment-based statistical model for Korean, rule-based error correction, and hierarchically expandable tagsets.",
        "The POSTAG system was developed to test these novel ideas, especially for agglutinative languages such as Korean.",
        "(Japanese, being similar to Korean in linguistic characteristics, will be a good target for testing these ideas.)",
        "Unlike previous systems, POSTAG is a hybrid tagging system; such a system has never been tried before, but it turns out to be most suitable for agglutinative languages such as Korean.",
        "POSTAG mainly applies a state-of-the-art HMM tagger for morphemes but considers multiple observations in the Viterbi score calculation.",
        "Because of the complexity of the morpheme sequence in a Korean eojeol, a morpheme-based HMM’s tagging accuracy is relatively low for Korean, compared with its accuracy for English.",
        "POSTAG compensates extremely well for the limitations of HMMs by rule-based error correction.",
        "The error correction rules are automatically learned to selectively correct HMM tagging errors.",
        "Similar hybrid methods have been tried for English, but they integrate HMM tagging and rule-based tagging at the same level (Tapanainen and Voutilainen 1994).",
        "POSTAG integrates morphological analysis with the generalized",
        "unknown-morpheme segmentation so that unknown morphemes can be processed in the same manner as registered morphemes during tagging.",
        "POSTAG also employs hierarchical tagsets that are flexible enough to expand/shrink according to the given application.",
        "The hierarchical tagset is a novel idea.",
        "Most tagging systems for Korean have applied flat, fixed tagsets and have suffered from using varying tagsets in various applications.",
        "However, POSTAG’s tagsets, based on the over 100 finely differentiated POS symbols for Korean are hierarchically organized and are flexibly reorganizable according to the application at hand.",
        "The hierarchical tagsets can be mapped to any other existing tagset as long as they are fairly well classified and therefore can encourage corpus sharing in the Korean-tagging community.",
        "POSTAG is constantly being improved through expansion of its morpheme dictionary, pattern dictionary, and tagged corpus for statistical and rule-based learning.",
        "Since the generalized unknown-morpheme handling is integrated into the system, POSTAG proves to be a good tagger for open domain applications such as Internet indexing, filtering, and summarization, and we are now developing a Web indexer using POSTAG technology."
