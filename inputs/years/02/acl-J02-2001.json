        "This research has direct applications in machine translation and text generation.",
        "We first identify the problems of representing near-synonyms in a computational lexicon and show that no previous model adequately accounts for near-synonymy.",
        "We then propose a preliminary theory to account for near-synonymy, relying crucially on the notion of granularity of representation, in which the meaning of a word arises out of a context-dependent combination of a context-independent core meaning and a set of explicit differences to its near-synonyms.",
        "That is, near-synonyms cluster together.",
        "We then develop a clustered model of lexical knowledge, derived from the conventional ontological model.",
        "The model cuts off the ontology at a coarse grain, thus avoiding an awkward proliferation of language-dependent concepts in the ontology, yet maintaining the advantages of efficient computation and reasoning.",
        "The model groups near-synonyms into subconceptual clusters that are linked to the ontology.",
        "A cluster differentiates near-synonyms in terms offine-grained aspects of denotation, implication, expressed attitude, and style.",
        "The model is general enough to account for other types of variation, for instance, in collocational behavior.",
        "An efficient, robust, and flexible fine-grained lexical-choice process is a consequence of a clustered model of lexical knowledge.",
        "To make it work, we formalize criteria for lexical choice as preferences to express certain concepts with varying indirectness, to express attitudes, and to establish certain styles.",
        "The lexical-choice process itself works on two tiers: between clusters and between near-synonyns of clusters.",

        "A word can express a myriad of implications, connotations, and attitudes in addition to its basic “dictionary” meaning.",
        "And a word often has near-synonyms that differ from it solely in these nuances of meaning.",
        "So, in order to find the right word to use in any particular situation – the one that precisely conveys the desired meaning and yet avoids unwanted implications – one must carefully consider the differences between all of the options.",
        "Choosing the right word can be difficult for people, let alone present-day computer systems.",
        "For example, how can a machine translation (MT) system determine the best English word for the French b´evue when there are so many possible similar but slightly",
        "different translations?",
        "The system could choose error, mistake, blunder, slip, lapse, boner, faux pas, boo-boo, and so on, but the most appropriate choice is a function of how b´evue is used (in context) and of the difference in meaning between b´evue and each of the English possibilities.",
        "Not only must the system determine the nuances that b´evue conveys in the particular context in which it has been used, but it must also find the English word (or words) that most closely convey the same nuances in the context of the other words that it is choosing concurrently.",
        "An exact translation is probably impossible, for b´evue is in all likelihood as different from each of its possible translations as they are from each other.",
        "That is, in general, every translation possibility will omit some nuance or express some other possibly unwanted nuance.",
        "Thus, faithful translation requires a sophisticated lexical-choice process that can determine which of the near-synonyms provided by one language for a word in another language is the closest or most appropriate in any particular situation.",
        "More generally, a truly articulate natural language generation (NLG) system also requires a sophisticated lexical-choice process.",
        "The system must to be able to reason about the potential effects of every available option.",
        "Consider, too, the possibility of a new type of thesaurus for a word processor that, instead of merely presenting the writer with a list of similar words, actually assists the writer by ranking the options according to their appropriateness in context and in meeting general preferences set by the writer.",
        "Such an intelligent thesaurus would greatly benefit many writers and would be a definite improvement over the simplistic thesauri in current word processors.",
        "What is needed is a comprehensive computational model of fine-grained lexical knowledge.",
        "Yet although synonymy is one of the fundamental linguistic phenomena that influence the structure of the lexicon, it has been given far less attention in linguistics, psychology, lexicography, semantics, and computational linguistics than the equally fundamental and much-studied polysemy.",
        "Whatever the reasons – philosophy, practicality, or expedience – synonymy has often been thought of as a “non-problem”: either there are synonyms, but they are completely identical in meaning and hence easy to deal with, or there are no synonyms, in which case each word can be handled like any other.",
        "But our investigation of near-synonymy shows that it is just as complex a phenomenon as polysemy and that it inherently affects the structure of lexical knowledge.",
        "The goal of our research has been to develop a computational model of lexical knowledge that can adequately account for near-synonymy and to deploy such a model in a computational process that could “choose the right word” in any situation of language production.",
        "Upon surveying current machine translation and natural language generation systems, we found none that performed this kind of genuine lexical choice.",
        "Although major advances have been made in knowledge-based models of the lexicon, present systems are concerned more with structural paraphrasing and a level of semantics allied to syntactic structure.",
        "None captures the fine-grained meanings of, and differences between, near-synonyms, nor the myriad of criteria involved in lexical choice.",
        "Indeed, the theories of lexical semantics upon which present-day systems are based don’t even account for indirect, fuzzy, or context-dependent meanings, let alone near-synonymy.",
        "And frustratingly, no one yet knows how to implement the theories that do more accurately predict the nature of word meaning (for instance, those in cognitive linguistics) in a computational system (see Hirst [1995]).",
        "In this article, we present a new model of lexical knowledge that explicitly accounts for near-synonymy in a computationally implementable manner.",
        "The clustered model of lexical knowledge clusters each set of near-synonyms under a common, coarse",
        "grained meaning and provides a mechanism for representing finer-grained aspects of denotation, attitude, style, and usage that differentiate the near-synonyms in a cluster.",
        "We also present a robust, efficient, and flexible lexical-choice algorithm based on the approximate matching of lexical representations to input representations.",
        "The model and algorithm are implemented in a sentence-planning system called I-Saurus, and we give some examples of its operation."

        "Absolute synonyms would be able to be substituted one for the other in any context in which their common sense is denoted with no change to truth value, communicative effect, or “meaning” (however “meaning” is defined).",
        "Philosophers such as Quine (1951) and Goodman (1952) argue that true synonymy is impossible, because it is impossible to define, and so, perhaps unintentionally, dismiss all other forms of synonymy.",
        "Even if absolute synonymy were possible, pragmatic and empirical arguments show that it would be very rare.",
        "Cruse (1986, page 270) says that “natural languages abhor absolute synonyms just as nature abhors a vacuum,” because the meanings of words are constantly changing.",
        "More formally, Clark (1992) employs her principle of contrast, that “every two forms contrast in meaning,” to show that language works to eliminate absolute synonyms.",
        "Either an absolute synonym would fall into disuse or it would take on a new nuance of meaning.",
        "At best, absolute synonymy is limited mostly to dialectal variation and technical terms (underwear (AmE) : pants (BrE); groundhog: woodchuck; distichous : two-ranked; ple-sionym : near-synonym), but even these words would change the style of an utterance when intersubstituted.",
        "Usually, words that are close in meaning are near-synonyms (or plesionyms)1 – almost synonyms, but not quite; very similar, but not identical, in meaning; not fully intersubstitutable, but instead varying in their shades of denotation, connotation, im-plicature, emphasis, or register (DiMarco, Hirst, and Stede 1993).2 Section 4 gives a more formal definition.",
        "Indeed, near-synonyms are pervasive in language; examples are easy to find.",
        "Lie, falsehood, untruth, fib, and misrepresentation, for instance, are near-synonyms of one another.",
        "All denote a statement that does not conform to the truth, but they differ from one another in fine aspects of their denotation.",
        "A lie is a deliberate attempt to deceive that is a flat contradiction of the truth, whereas a misrepresentation may be more indirect, as by misplacement of emphasis, an untruth might be told merely out of ignorance, and a fib is deliberate but relatively trivial, possibly told to save one’s own or another’s face (Gove 1984).",
        "The words also differ stylistically; fib is an informal, childish term, whereas falsehood is quite formal, and untruth can be used euphemistically to avoid some of the derogatory implications of some of the other terms (Gove [1984]; compare Coleman and Kay’s [1981] rather different analysis).",
        "We will give many more examples in the discussion below.",
        "Error implies a straying from a proper course and suggests guilt as may lie in failure to take proper advantage of a guide....",
        "Mistake implies misconception, misunderstanding, a wrong but not always blameworthy judgment, or inadvertence; it expresses less severe criticism than error.",
        "Blunder is harsher than mistake or error; it commonly implies ignorance or stupidity, sometimes blameworthiness.",
        "Slip carries a stronger implication of inadvertence or accident than mistake, and often, in addition, connotes triviality.",
        "Lapse, though sometimes used interchangeably with slip, stresses forgetfulness, weakness, or inattention more than accident; thus, one says a lapse of memory or a slip of the pen, but not vice versa.",

        "The previous example illustrates merely one broad type of variation, denotational variation.",
        "In general, near-synonyms can differ with respect to any aspect of their meaning (Cruse 1986):",
        "• denotational variations, in a broad sense, including propositional, fuzzy, and other peripheral aspects • stylistic variations, including dialect and register • expressive variations, including emotive and attitudinal aspects • structural variations, including collocational, selectional, and syntactic variations",
        "Building on an earlier analysis by DiMarco, Hirst, and Stede (1993) of the types of differentiae used in synonym discrimination dictionaries, Edmonds (1999) classifies near-synonymic variation into 35 subcategories within the four broad categories above.",
        "Table 1 gives a number of examples, grouped into the four broad categories above, which we will now discuss.",
        "2.3.1 Denotational Variations.",
        "Several kinds of variation involve denotation, taken in a broad sense.4 DiMarco, Hirst, and Stede (1993) found that whereas some differentiae are easily expressed in terms of clear-cut abstract (or symbolic) features such as",
        "continuous/intermittent (Wine {seeped |dripped} from the barrel), many are not.",
        "In fact, denotational variation involves mostly differences that lie not in simple features but in full-fledged concepts or ideas – differences in concepts that relate roles and aspects of a situation.",
        "For example, in Figure 1, “severe criticism” is a complex concept that involves both a criticizer and a criticized, the one who made the error.",
        "Moreover, two words can differ in the manner in which they convey a concept.",
        "Enemy and foe, for instance, differ in the emphasis that they place on the concepts that compose them, the former stressing antagonism and the latter active warfare rather than emotional reaction (Gove 1984).",
        "Other words convey meaning indirectly by mere suggestion or implication.",
        "There is a continuum of indirectness from suggestion to implication to denotation; thus slip “carries a stronger implication of inadvertence” than mistake.",
        "Such indirect meanings are usually peripheral to the main meaning conveyed by an expression, and it is usually difficult to ascertain definitively whether or not they were even intended to be conveyed by the speaker; thus error merely “suggests guilt” and a mistake is “not always blameworthy.” Differences in denotation can also be fuzzy, rather than clear-cut.",
        "The difference between woods and forest is a complex combination of size, primitiveness, proximity to civilization, and wildness.5 2.3.2 Stylistic Variations.",
        "Stylistic variation involves differences in a relatively small, finite set of dimensions on which all words can be compared.",

        "2.3.3 Expressive Variations.",
        "Many near-synonyms differ in their marking as to the speaker’s attitude to their denotation: good thing or bad thing.",
        "Thus the same person might be described as skinny, if the speaker wanted to be deprecating or pejorative, slim or slender, if he wanted to be more complimentary, or thin if he wished to be neutral.",
        "A hindrance might be described as an obstacle or a challenge, depending upon how depressed or inspired the speaker felt about the action that it necessitated.6 A word can also indirectly express the emotions of the speaker in a possibly finite set of emotive “fields”; daddy expresses a stronger feeling of intimacy than dad or father.",
        "Some words are explicitly marked as slurs; a slur is a word naming a group of people, the use of which implies hatred or contempt of the group and its members simply by virtue of its being marked as a slur.",
        "restrictions upon deployment that come from other elements of the utterance and, reciprocally, restrictions that they place upon the deployment of other elements.",
        "In either case, the restrictions are independent of the meanings of the words themselves.",
        "The",
        "restrictions may be either collocational, syntactic, or selectional – that is, dependent either upon other words or constituents in the utterance or upon other concepts denoted.",
        "Collocational variation involves the words or concepts with which a word can be combined, possibly idiomatically.",
        "For example, task and job differ in their collocational patterns: one can face a daunting task but not ∗face a daunting job.",
        "This is a lexical restriction, whereas in selectional restrictions (or preferences) the class of acceptable objects is defined semantically, not lexically.",
        "For example, unlike die, pass away may be used only of people (or anthropomorphized pets), not plants or animals: ∗Many cattle passed away in the drought.",
        "Variation in syntactic restrictions arises from differing syntactic subcategorization.",
        "It is implicit that if a set of words are synonyms or near-synonyms, then they are of the same syntactic category.8 Some of a set of near-synonyms, however, might be subcategorized differently from others.",
        "For example, the adjective ajar may be used predicatively, not attributively (The door is ajar; ∗the ajar door), whereas the adjective open may be used in either position.",
        "Similarly, verb near-synonyms (and their nomi-nalizations) may differ in their verb class and in the alternations that they they may undergo (Levin 1993).",
        "For example, give takes the dative alternation, whereas donate does not: Nadia gave the Van Gogh to the museum; Nadia gave the museum the Van Gogh; Nadia donated the Van Gogh to the museum; ∗Nadia donated the museum the Van Gogh.",

        "In these models, the typical view of the relationship between words and concepts is that each element of the lexicon is represented as a conceptual schema or a structure of such schemata.",
        "Each word sense is linked to the schema or the conceptual structure that it lexicalizes.",
        "If two or more words denote the same schema or structure, all of them are connected to it; if a word is ambiguous, subentries for its different senses are connected to their respective schemata.",

        "Conversely, to choose a word when producing an utterance from a conceptual structure is to find a suitable set of words that “cover” the structure and assemble them into a sentence in accordance with the syntactic and pragmatic rules of the language (Nogier and Zock 1992; Stede 1999).",
        "A conceptual schema in models of this type is generally assumed to contain a set of attributes or attribute–value pairs that represent the content of the concept and differentiate it from other concepts.",

        "They do not lend themselves well to the kind of fine-grained and often fuzzy differentiation that we showed earlier to be found in near-synonymy, because, in these models, except as required by homonymy and absolute synonymy, there is no actual distinction between a word and a concept: each member of a group of near-synonyms must be represented as a separate concept schema (or group of schemata) with distinct attributes or attribute values.",
        "For example, Figure 5 shows one particular classification of the fib group of near-synonyms in English and French.10 A similar proliferation of concepts would be required for various error clusters (as shown earlier in Figures 1, 2, and 3).",

        "Edmonds and Hirst Near-Synonymy and Lexical Choice Although some systems have indeed taken this approach (Emele et al.",
        "1992), this kind of fragmentation is neither easy nor natural nor parsimonious.",
        "Hirst (1995) shows that even simple cases lead to a multiplicity of nearly identical concepts, thereby defeating the purpose of a language-independent ontology.",
        "Such a taxonomy cannot efficiently represent the multidimensional nature of near-synonymic variation, nor can it account for fuzzy differences between near-synonyms.",
        "And since the model defines words in terms of only necessary and sufficient truth-conditions, it cannot account for indirect expressions of meaning and for context-dependent meanings, which are clearly not necessary features of a word’s meaning.",
        "Moreover, a taxonomic hierarchy emphasizes hyponymy, backgrounding all other relations, which appear to be more important in representing the multidimensional nature of fine-grained word meaning.",
        "It is not even clear that a group of synonyms can be structured by hyponymy, except trivially (and ineffectively) as hyponyms all of the same concept.",
        "The model also cannot easily or tractably account for fuzzy differences or the full-fledged concepts required for representing denotational variation.",
        "First-order logic, rather than the description logic generally used in ontological models, would at least be required to represent such concepts, but reasoning about the concepts in lexical choice and other tasks would then become intractable as the model was scaled up to represent all near-synonyms.",
        "In summary, present-day models of the lexicon have three kinds of problems with respect to near-synonymy and fine-grained lexical knowledge: the adequacy of coverage of phenomena related to near-synonymy; engineering, both in the design of an efficient and robust lexical choice process and in the design of lexical entries for near-synonyms; and the well-known issues of tractability of reasoning about concepts during natural language understanding and generation.",
        "Nevertheless, at a coarse grain, the ontological model does have practical and theoretical advantages in efficient paraphrasing, lexical choice, and mechanisms for inference and reasoning.",
        "Hence, to build a new model of lexical knowledge that takes into account the fine-grainedness of near-synonymy, a logical way forward is to start with the computationally proven ontological model and to modify or extend it to account for near-synonymy.",
        "The new model that we will present below will rely on a much more coarsely grained ontology.",
        "Rather than proliferating conceptual schemata to account for differences between near-synonyms, we will propose that near-synonyms are connected to a single concept, despite their differences in meaning, and are differentiated at a subconceptual level.",
        "In other words, the connection of two or more words to the same schema will not imply synonymy but only near-synonymy.",
        "Differentiation between the near-synonyms – the fine tuning – will be done in the lexical entries themselves."

        "To introduce the notion of granularity to our discussion, we first return to the problem of defining near-synonymy.",
        "Semanticists such as Ullmann (1962), Cruse (1986), and Lyons (1995) have attempted to define near-synonymy by focusing on “propositional” meaning.",
        "Cruse, for example, contrasts cognitive synonyms and plesionyms; the former are words that, when intersubstituted in a sentence, preserve its truth conditions but may change the expressive meaning, style, or register of the sentence or may involve different idiosyn",
        " cratic collocations (e.g., violin : fiddle),11 whereas intersubstituting the latter changes the truth conditions but still yields semantically similar sentences (e.g., misty: foggy).",
        "Although these definitions are important for truth-conditional semantics, they are not very helpful for us, because plesionymy is left to handle all of the most interesting phenomena discussed in Section 2.",
        "Moreover, a rigorous definition of cognitive synonymy is difficult to come up with, because it relies on the notion of granularity, which we will discuss below.",
        "Lexicographers, on the other hand, have always treated synonymy as near-synonymy.",
        "They define synonymy in terms of likeness of meaning, disagreeing only in how broad the definition ought to be.",
        "For instance, Roget followed the vague principle of “the grouping of words according to ideas” (Chapman 1992, page xiv).",
        "And in the hierarchical structure of Roget’s Thesaurus, word senses are ultimately grouped according to proximity of meaning: “the sequence of terms within a paragraph, far from being random, is determined by close, semantic relationships” (page xiii).",
        "The lexicographers of Webster’s New Dictionary of Synonyms define a synonym as “one of two or more words ... which have the same or very nearly the same essential meaning.... Synonyms can be defined in the same terms up to a certain point” (Egan 1942, pages 24a–25a).",
        "Webster’s Collegiate Thesaurus uses a similar definition that involves the sharing of elementary meanings, which are “discrete objective denotations uncolored by ... peripheral aspects such as connotations, implications, or quirks of idiomatic usage” (Kay 1988, page 9a).",
        "Clearly, the main point of these definitions is that near-synonyms must have the same essential meaning but may differ in peripheral or subordinate ideas.",
        "Cruse (1986, page 267) actually refines this idea and suggests that synonyms (of all types) are words that are identical in “central semantic traits” and differ, if at all, only in “peripheral traits.” But how can we specify formally just how much similarity of central traits and dissimilarity of peripheral traits is allowed?",
        "That is, just what counts as a central trait and what as a peripheral trait in defining a word?",
        "To answer this question, we introduce the idea of granularity of representation of word meaning.",
        "By granularity we mean the level of detail used to describe or represent the meanings of a word.",
        "A fine-grained representation can encode subtle distinctions, whereas a coarse-grained representation is crude and glosses over variation.",
        "Granularity is distinct from specificity, which is a property of concepts rather than representations of concepts.",
        "For example, a rather general (unspecific) concept, say Human, could have, in a particular system, a very fine-grained representation, involving, say, a detailed description of the appearance of a human, references to related concepts such as Eat and Procreate, and information to distinguish the concept from other similar concepts such as Animal.",
        "Conversely, a very specific concept could have a very coarse-grained representation, using only very general concepts; we could represent a Lexicographer at such a coarse level of detail as to say no more than that it is a physical object.",
        "Near-synonyms can occur at any level of specificity, but crucially it is the fine granularity of the representations of their meanings that enables one to distinguish one near-synonym from another.",
        "Thus, any definition of near-synonymy that does not take granularity into account is insufficient.",
        "For example, consider Cruse’s cognitive synonymy, discussed above.",
        "On the one hand, at an absurdly coarse grain of representation, any two words are cognitive synonyms (because every word denotes a “thing”).",
        "But on the other hand, no two words could ever be known to be cognitive synonyms, because, even at a fine grain, apparent cognitive synonyms might be fur",
        "ther distinguishable by a still more fine-grained representation.",
        "Thus, granularity is essential to the concept of cognitive synonymy, as which pairs of words are cognitive synonyms depends on the granularity with which we represent their propositional meanings.",
        "The same is true of Cruse’s plesionyms.",
        "So in the end, it should not be necessary to make a formal distinction between cognitive synonyms and plesionyms.",
        "Both kinds of near-synonyms should be representable in the same formalism.",
        "By taking granularity into account, we can create a much more useful definition of near-synonymy, because we can now characterize the difference between essential and peripheral aspects of meaning.",
        "If we can set an appropriate level of granularity, the essential meaning of a word is the portion of its meaning that is representable only above that level of granularity, and peripheral meanings are those portions representable only below that level.",
        "But what is the appropriate level of granularity, the dividing line between coarse-grained and fine-grained representations?",
        "We could simply use our intuition – or rather, the intuitions of lexicographers, which are filtered by some amount of objectivity and experience.",
        "Alternatively, from a concern for the representation of lexical knowledge in a multilingual application, we can view words as (language-specific) specializations of language-independent concepts.",
        "Given a hierarchical organization of coarse-grained language-independent concepts, a set of near-synonyms is simply a set of words that all link to the same language-independent concept (DiMarco, Hirst, and Stede 1993; Hirst 1995).",
        "So in this view, near-synonyms share the same propositional meaning just up to the point in granularity defined by language dependence.",
        "Thus we have an operational definition of near-synonymy: If the same concept has several reasonable lexicalizations in different languages, then it is a good candidate for being considered a language-independent concept, its various lexicalizations forming sets of near-synonyms in each language.12 Granularity also explains why it is more difficult to represent near-synonyms in a lexicon.",
        "Near-synonyms are so close in meaning, sharing all essential coarse-grained aspects, that they differ, by definition, in only aspects representable at a fine grain.",
        "And these fine-grained representations of differences tend to involve very specific concepts, typically requiring complex structures of more general concepts that are difficult to represent and to reason with.",
        "The matter is only made more complicated by there often being several interrelated near-synonyms with interrelated differences.",
        "On the other hand, words that are not near-synonyms – those that are merely similar in meaning (dog: cat) or not similar at all (dog: hat) – could presumably be differentiated by concepts at a coarse-grained, and less complex, level of representation."

      "text": [
        "Our model is based on the contention that the meaning of an open-class content word, however it manifests itself in text or speech, arises out of a context-dependent combination of a basic inherent context-independent denotation and a set of explicit differences 12 EuroWordNet’s Inter-Lingual-Index (Vossen 1998) links the synsets of different languages in such a manner, and Resnik and Yarowsky (1999) describe a related notion for defining word senses cross-lingually.",
        " to its near-synonyms.",
        "(We don’t rule out other elements in the combination, but these are the main two.)",
        "Thus, word meaning is not explicitly represented in the lexicon but is created (or generated, as in a generative model of the lexicon [Pustejovsky 1995]) when a word is used.",
        "This theory preserves some aspects of the classical theories – the basic denotation can be modeled by an ontology – but the rest of a word’s meaning relies on other nearby words and the context of use (cf. Saussure).",
        "In particular, each word and its near synonyms form a cluster.",
        "13 The theory is built on the following three ideas, which follow from our observations about near-synonymy.",
        "First, the meaning of any word, at some level of granularity, must indeed have some inherent context-independent denotational aspect to it – otherwise, it would not be possible to define or “understand” a word in isolation of context, as one in fact can (as in dictionaries).",
        "Second, nuances of meaning, although difficult or impossible to represent in positive, absolute, and context-independent terms, can be represented as differences, in Saussure’s sense, between near-synonyms.",
        "That is, every nuance of meaning that a word might have can be thought of as a relation between the word and one or more of its near-synonyms.",
        "And third, differences must be represented not by simple features or truth conditions, but by structures that encode relations to the context, fuzziness, and degrees of necessity.",
        "For example, the word forest denotes a geographical tract of trees at a coarse grain, but it is only in relation to woods, copse, and other near-synonyms that one can fully understand the significance of forest (i.e., that it is larger, wilder, etc.).",
        "The word mistake denotes any sort of action that deviates from what is correct and also involves some notion of criticism, but it is only in relation to error and blunder that one sees that the word can be used to criticize less severely than these alternatives allow.",
        "None of these differences could be represented in absolute terms, because that would require defining some absolute notion of size, wildness, or severity, which seems implausible.",
        "So, at a fine grain, and only at a fine grain, we make explicit use of Saussure’s notion of contrast in demarcating the meanings of near-synonyms.",
        "Hence, the theory holds that near-synonyms are explicitly related to each other not at a conceptual level but at a subconceptual level – outside of the (coarser-grained) ontology.",
        "In this way, a cluster of near-synonyms is not a mere list of synonyms; it has an internal structure that encodes fine-grained meaning as differences between lexical entries, and it is situated between a conceptual model (i.e., the ontology) and a linguistic model.",
        "Thus the model has three levels of representation.",
        "Current computational theories suggest that at least two levels of representation, a conceptual–semantic level and a syntactic–semantic level, are necessary to account for various lexico-semantic phenomena in computational systems, including compositional phenomena such as paraphrasing (see, for instance, Stede’s [1999] model).",
        "To account for fine-grained meanings and near-synonymy, we postulate a third, intermediate level (or a splitting of the conceptual–semantic level).",
        "Thus the three levels are the following: A conceptual–semantic level.",
        "A syntactic–semantic level.",
        "13 It is very probable that many near-synonym clusters of a language could be discovered automatically by applying statistical techniques, such as cluster analysis, on large text corpora.",
        "For instance, Church et al.",
        "(1994) give some results in this area.",
        "A clustered model of lexical knowledge So, taking the conventional ontological model as a starting point, we cut off the ontology at a coarse grain and cluster near-synonyms under their shared concepts rather than linking each word to a separate concept.",
        "The resulting model is a clustered model of lexical knowledge.",
        "On the conceptual–semantic level, a cluster has a core denotation that represents the essential shared denotational meaning of its near-synonyms.",
        "On the subconceptual/stylistic–semantic level, we represent the fine-grained differences between the near-synonyms of a cluster in denotation, style, and expression.",
        "At the syntactic–semantic level, syntactic frames and collocational relations represent how words can be combined with others to form sentences.",

        "Thus, the core denotation of each cluster is the concept to which it points.",
        "Within each cluster, the near-synonyms are differentiated at the subconceptual/stylistic level of semantics, as indicated by dashed lines between the words in the cluster.",

        "We can now describe the internal structure of a cluster in more detail, starting with two examples.",

        "Thus, error conveys a degree of Blameworthiness compared to the higher degree that blunder conveys; error does not convey Stupidity whereas blunder does; blunder can also express a Pejorative attitude toward the actor, but error does not express any attitude; and error and blunder differ stylistically in their degree of Concreteness.",
        "Notice that the attitude connects to the concept Person, because all attitudes must be directed toward some entity in the situation.",
        "Stylistic dimensions such as Concreteness, on the other hand, are completely separate from the graph of concepts.",

        "Similarly, Figure 8 depicts the cluster of order verbs (order, enjoin, command, ... ), including three of its peripheral concepts and one stylistic dimension.",

        "1992), or lexical-conceptual structures in UNITRAN (Dorr 1993) is used in encoding lexical meaning (and all other meaning).",
        "But as we showed in Section 3, such methods don’t work at the fine grain necessary for near-synonymy, despite their effectiveness at a coarse grain.",
        "To overcome these problems but retain the interlingual framework, Barnett, Mani, and Rich (1994) describe a method of generating natural-sounding text that is maximally close in meaning to the input interlingual representation.",
        "Like us, they define the notion of semantic closeness, but whereas they rely purely on denotational representations and (approximate) logical inference in addition to lexical features for relative naturalness, we explicitly represent fine-grained aspects on a subconceptual level and use constraints and preferences, which gives flexibility and robustness to the lexical-choice process.",
        "Viegas (1998), on the other hand, describes a preliminary solution that accounts for semantic vagueness and underspecification in a generative framework.",
        "Although her model is intended to account for near-synonymy, she does not explicitly discuss it.",
        "Transfer-based MT systems use a bilingual lexicon to map words and expressions from one language to another.",
        "Lists, sometimes huge, of handcrafted language-pair-specific rules encode the knowledge to use the mapping (e.g., in SYSTRAN [Gerber and Yang 1997]).",
        "EuroWordNet (Vossen 1998) could be used in such a system.",
        "Its Inter-Lingual-Index provides a language-independent link between synsets in different languages and has an explicit relation, EQNEARSYNONYM, for relating synsets that are not directly equivalent across languages.",
        "But, as in individual WordNets, there is no provision for representing differences between near-synonyms.",
        "In statistical MT, there would seem to be some promise for handling near-synonymy.",
        "In principle, a system could choose the near-synonym that is most probable given the source sentence and the target-language model.",
        "Near-synonymy seems to have been of little concern, however, in statistical MT research: The seminal researchers, Brown et al.",
        "(1990), viewed such variations as a matter of taste; in evaluating their system, two different translations of the same source that convey roughly the same meaning (perhaps with different words) are considered satisfactory translations.",
        "More recently, though, Foster, Isabelle, and Plamondon (1997) show how such a model can be used in interactive MT, and Langkilde and Knight (1998) in text generation.",
        "Such methods are unfortunately limited in practice, because it is too computationally expensive to go beyond a trigram model (only two words of context).",
        "Even if a statistical approach could account for near-synonymy, Edmonds (1997) showed that its strength is not in choosing the right word, but rather in determining which near-synonym is most typical or natural in a given context.",

        "Every natural language processing system needs some sort of lexicon, and for many systems, the lexicon is the most important component.",
        "Yet, real natural language pro",
        "Edmonds and Hirst Near-Synonymy and Lexical Choice cessing systems today rely on a relatively shallow coverage of lexical phenomena, which unavoidably restricts their capabilities and thus the quality of their output.",
        "(Of course, shallow lexical semantics is a necessary starting point for a practical system, because it allows for broad coverage.)",
        "The research reported here pushes the lexical coverage of natural language systems to a deeper level.",
        "The key to the clustered model of lexical knowledge is its subconceptual/stylistic level of semantic representation.",
        "By introducing this level between the traditional conceptual and syntactic levels, we have developed a new model of lexical knowledge that keeps the advantages of the conventional model – efficient paraphrasing, lexical choice (at a coarse grain), and mechanisms for reasoning – but overcomes its shortcomings concerning near-synonymy.",
        "The subconceptual/stylistic level is more expressive than the top level, yet it allows for tractable and efficient processing because it “partitions,” or isolates, the expressiveness (i.e., the non-truth-conditional semantics and fuzzy representations) in small clusters.",
        "The model reconciles fine-grained lexical knowledge with coarse-grained ontologies using the notion of granularity of representation.",
        "The next stage in this work is to build a more extensive lexicon of near-synonym clusters than the few handwritten clusters that were built for the simple implementation described in this article.",
        "To this end, Inkpen and Hirst (2001a, 2001b) are developing a method to automatically build a clustered lexicon of 6,000 near-synonyms (1,000 clusters) from the machine-readable text of Hayakawa’s Choose the Right Word (1994).",
        "Besides MT and NLG, we envision other applications of the model presented in this article.",
        "For instance, an interactive dictionary – an intelligent thesaurus – would actively help a person to find and choose the right word in any context.",
        "Rather than merely list possibilities, it would rank them according to the context and to parameters supplied by the user and would also explain potential effects of any choice, which would be especially useful in computer-assisted second-language instruction.",
        "Or the model could be applied in the automatic (post)editing of text in order to make the text conform to a certain stylistic standard or to make a text more readable or natural to a given audience.",
        "We leave a number of open problems for another day, including recovering nuances from text (see Edmonds [1998] for a preliminary discussion); evaluating the effectiveness of the similarity measures; determining the similarity of conceptual structures; understanding the complex interaction of lexical and structural decisions during lexical choice; exploring the requirements for logical inference in the model; modeling other aspects of fine-grained meaning, such as emphasis; and understanding the context-dependent nature of lexical differences and lexical knowledge."
