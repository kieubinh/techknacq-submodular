        "We address the following issues, which are intrinsic to spoken-dialogue summarization and typically can be ignored when summarizing written text such as news wire data: (1) detection and removal ofspeech disfluencies; (2) detection and insertion ofsentence boundaries; and (3) detection and linking of cross-speaker information units (question-answer pairs).",
        "A system evaluation is performed using a corpus of 23 dialogue excerpts with an average duration of about 10 minutes, comprising 80 topical segments and about 47,000 words total.",
        "The corpus was manually annotatedfor relevant text spans by six human annotators.",
        "The global evaluation shows that for the two more informal genres, our summarization system using dialogue-specific components significantly outperforms two baselines: (1) a maximum-marginal-relevance ranking algorithm using TF*IDF term weighting, and (2) a LEAD baseline that extracts the first n words from a text."

        "Although the field of summarizing written texts has been explored for many decades, gaining significantly increased attention in the last five to ten years, summarization of spoken language is a comparatively recent research area.",

        "Summarization of spoken dialogues, in particular, may aid in the archiving, indexing, and retrieval of various records of oral communication, such as corporate meetings, sales interactions, or customer support.",
        "The purpose of this article is to explore the issues of spoken-dialogue summarization and to describe and evaluate an implementation addressing some of the core challenges intrinsic to the task.",
        "We will use an implementation of a state-of-the-art text summarization method (maximum marginal relevance, or MMR) as the main baseline for comparative evaluations, and then add a set of components addressing issues specific to spoken dialogues to this MMR module to create our spoken dialogue summarization system, which we call DIASUMM.",
        "We consider the following dimensions to be relevant for our research; the combination of these dimensions distinguishes our work from most other work in the field",
        "of summarization: • spoken versus written language • multiparty dialogues versus texts written by one author • unrestricted versus restricted domains • diverse genres versus a single genre The main challenges this work has to address, in addition to the challenges of written-text summarization, are as follows: • coping with speech disfluencies • identifying the units for extraction • maintaining cross-speaker coherence • coping with speech recognition errors",
        "We will discuss these challenges in more detail in the following section.",
        "Although we have addressed the issue of speech recognition errors in previous related work (Zechner and Waibel 2000b), for the purpose of this article, we exclusively use human transcripts of spoken dialogues.",
        "Intrinsic evaluations of text summaries usually use sentences as their basic units.",
        "For our data, however, sentence boundaries are typically not available in the first place.",
        "Thus we devise a word-based evaluation metric derived from an average relevance score from human relevance annotations (section 6.2).",
        "The organization of this article is as follows: Section 2 provides the motivation for our research, introducing and discussing the main challenges of spoken-dialogue summarization, followed by a section on related work (section 3).",
        "Section 4 describes the corpus we use to develop and evaluate our system, along with the procedures employed for corpus annotation.",
        "The system architecture and its components are described in detail in section 5, along with evaluations thereof.",

        "This mismatch between acoustic and linguistic segmentation is reflected in the output of a speech recognizer, which typically generates a sequence of speaker turns whose boundaries are marked by periods of silence (or nonspeech).",

        "A number of other important issues for summarization in general and for speech summarization in particular are either simplified or not addressed in this article and left for future work in this field.",
        "In the following, we briefly mention some of these issues, indicating their potential relevance and promise.",
        "2.4.1 Topic Segmentation.",
        "In many cases, spoken dialogues are multitopical.",
        "For the English CALLHOME corpus, we determined an average topic length of about one to two minutes’ speaking time (or about 200–400 words).",
        "Summarization can be accomplished faster and more concisely if it operates on smaller topical segments rather than on long pieces of input consisting of diverse topics.",
        "Although we have implemented a topic segmentation component as part of our system for these reasons, all of the evaluations are based on the topical segments determined by human annotators.",
        "Therefore, this component will not be discussed in this article.",
        "Furthermore, topical segmentation is not an issue intrinsic to spoken dialogues, which in our opinion justifies this simplification.",
        "2.4.2 Anaphora Resolution.",
        "An analogous reasoning holds for the issue of anaphora resolution: Although it would certainly be desirable, for the sake of increased coherence and readability, to employ a well-working anaphora resolution component, this issue is not specific to the task at hand, either.",
        "One could argue that particularly for summarization of more informal conversations, in which personal pronouns are rather frequent, anaphora resolution might be more helpful than for, say, summarization of written texts.",
        "But we conjecture that this task might also prove more challenging than written-text anaphora resolution.",
        "In our system, we did not implement a module for anaphora resolution.",
        "less exploration has been done, however, in the area of automatic analysis of discourse structure for non-task-oriented spoken dialogues in unrestricted domains, such as CALLHOME (LDC 1996).",
        "Research for those kinds of corpora reported in Jurafsky et al.",

        "(2000), Levin et al.",
        "(1999), and Ries et al.",
        "(2000) focuses more on detecting localized phenomena such as speech acts, dialogue games, or functional activities.",
        "We conjecture that there are two reasons for this: (1) free-flowing spontaneous conversations have much less structure than task-oriented dialogues, and (2) the automatic detection of hierarchical structure would be much harder than it is for written texts or dialogues based on a premeditated plan.",
        "Although we believe that in the long run attempts to automatically identify the discourse structure of spoken dialogues may benefit summarization, in this article, we greatly simplify this matter and exclusively look at local contexts in which speakers interactively construct shared information (the question-answer pairs).",
        "is that our input comes from a perfect speech recognizer; that is, we use human textual transcripts of the dialogues in our corpus.",
        "Although there are cases in which this assumption is justifiable, such as transcripts provided by news services in parallel to the recorded audio data, we believe that in general a spoken dialogue summarizer has to be able to accept corrupted input from an automatic speech recognizer (ASR), as well.",
        "Our system is indeed able to work with ASR output; it is integrated in a larger system (Meeting Browser) that creates, summarizes, and archives meeting records and is connected to a speech recognition engine (Bett et al.",
        "2000).",
        "Further, we have shown in previous work how we can use ASR confidence scores (1) to reduce the word error rate within the summary and (2) to increase the summary accuracy (Zechner and Waibel 2000b).",
        "2.4.5 Prosodic Information.",
        "A further simplifying assumption of this work is that prosodic information is not available, with the exception of start and end times of speaker turns.",
        "Considering the results reported by Shriberg et al.",
        "(1998) and Shriberg et al.",
        "(2000), we conjecture that future work in this field will demonstrate the additional benefit of incorporating prosodic information, such as stress, pitch, and intra-turn pauses, into the summarization system.",

        "After the first annotation phase, in which each coder worked independently according to the guidelines described above, we devised a second phase, in which two coders from the initial group were asked to create a common-ground annotation, based on the majority opinion of the whole group.",
        "To construct such a majority opinion guideline automatically, we assigned weights to all words in nucleus IUs and satellite IUs and added all weights for all marked words of all coders for every turn.",
        "The total turn weights were then sorted by decreasing value to provide a guide for the two coders in the second phase as to which turns they should focus their annotations on for the common-ground or gold-standard summaries.",
        "Other than this guideline, the requirements were almost exactly identical to those in phase 1, except that (1) the pair of annotators was required to work together on this task to be able to reach a consensus opinion, and (2) the preset relative word length of the gold summary (10–20%) applied only to the nucleus IUs.",
        "As for the topical boundaries, which obviously vary among coders, a list of boundary positions chosen by the majority (at least half) of the coders in the first phase was provided.",
        "In this gold-standard phase, the two coders mostly stayed with these suggestions and changed less than 15% of the suggested topic boundaries, the majority of which were minor (less than two turns’ difference in boundary position).",
        "4.2.3 General Annotation Analysis.",
        "Table 2 provides the statistics on the frequencies of the annotated nucleus and satellite IUs.",
        "We make the following observations: • On average, about 23% of all tokens were assigned to a nucleus IU and 5% to a satellite IU; counting only the +-marked tokens, this reduces to about 11% and 2% of all tokens, respectively.",
        "• The average total lengths of nuclei and satellites vary widely across corpora: between 17.1 (13.1) tokens for CALLHOME and 37.7 (23.4) tokens for GROUP MEETINGS data.",
        "This is most likely a reflection on the typical length of turns in the different subcorpora.",
        "• A similar variation is also observed across annotators: between 12 and 40 tokens for nucleus-IUs and between 9 and 20 tokens for satellites.",
        "The granularity of IUs is quite different across annotators.",
        "• Since some annotators mark a larger number of IUs than others, there is an even larger discrepancy in the relative number of words assigned to nucleus IUs and satellite IUs among the different annotators: 11–44% (nucleus IUs) and 0–13% (satellite IUs).",
        "• The ratio of nucleus versus satellite tokens also varies greatly among the annotators: from about 1:1 to 40:1.",
        " • The ratio of nucleus and satellite tokens that are +-marked varies greatly: between 36 and 77% for nucleus IUs and between 2 and 80% for satellite IUs.",
        "From these observations, we conclude that merging the nucleus and satellite IUs into one class would yield a more consistent picture than keeping them separate.",
        "A similar argument can be made for the +-marked passages, in which we also find a quite high intercoder variation in relative +-marking.",
        "This led us to the decision of giving equal weight to any word in an IU, irrespective of IU type or marking, for the purpose of global system evaluation.",
        "Finally, we conjecture that the average length of our extraction units should be in the 10–40 words range, which roughly corresponds to about 3–12 seconds of real time, assuming an average word length of 300 milliseconds.",
        "As a comparison, we note that Valenza et al.",

        "We compute agreements for each dialogue separately and report the arithmetic means for the five subcorpora in Table 3.",
        "We observe that agreement for topical boundaries is much higher than for relevance markings.",

        "For training, we used a part of the SWITCHBOARD transcripts that was manually annotated for sentence boundaries, POS, and the following types of disfluent regions (LDC 1999b): • {A... }: asides (very rare; we ignore them in our experiments) • {C... }: empty coordinating conjunctions (e.g., and then) • {D... }: discourse markers (i.e., lexicalized filled pauses in our terminology, e.g., you know) • {E... }: editing terms (within repairs; e.g., I mean) • {F... }: filled pauses (nonlexicalized; e.g., uh) • [... + ...]: repairs: the part before the + is called reparandum (to be removed), the part after the + repair (proper)",
        "Sentence boundaries can be at the end of completed sentences (ES) or of noncompleted sentences, such as false starts or abandoned clauses (NS).",
        "5.3.6 POS Tagger.",
        "We are using Brill’s rule-based POS tagger (Brill 1994).",
        "Its basic algorithm at run time (after training) can be described as follows: 1.",
        "Tag every word with its most likely tag, predicting tags of unknown words based on rules.",
        "2.",
        "Change every tag according to its right and left context (both words and tags are considered), following a list of rules.",
        "For preprocessing, we replaced the tags in the regions of {C... }, {D... }, and {E... } with the tags CO (coordinating), DM (discourse marker), and ET (editing term), respectively.",
        "(The filler regions {F... } are already tagged with UH in the corpus.)",
        "Lines that contain typographical errors were excluded from the training corpus.",
        "We further eliminated all incomplete words (XX tag) and combined multiwords, marked by a GW tag, into a single word (hence eliminating the GW tag).11 The entire resulting new tag set had 42 tags.12 Training of the POS tagger proceeded in three stages, using about 250,000 tagged words for each stage.",
        "The trained POS tagger’s performance on an unseen test set of about 185,000 words is 94.1% tag accuracy (untrained baseline: 84.8% accuracy).",
        "Table 5 shows precision, recall, and F1-scores for the four categories of disfluency tags, measured on the test set after the last training phase.",
        "We see that the nonlexicalized filler words are almost perfectly tagged (F1 = 0.98), whereas the hardest task for the tagger is the empty coordinating conjunctions (F1 = 0.88): There are a few highly ambiguous words in that set, such as and, so, and or.",
        "Table 6 shows the POS tagging accuracy on the five subcorpora of our dialogue corpus, evaluated on a sample of 500 words per subcorpus.",
        "We see that the POS-tagging accuracy is slightly lower than for the SWITCHBOARD set that was used for",
        "training (approximately 90–93%; global average: 91.1%).",
        "Further we observe that with the exception of the CALLHOME corpora, the majority of unknown words were actually tagged correctly.",
        "The most frequent errors were (1) conjunctions tagged as empty coordinated conjunctions, (2) proper names tagged as regular nouns, and (3) adverbs tagged as adjectives.",
        "Finally, we look at the POS tagger’s performance for the four disfluency tags CO, DM, ET, and UH in our five subcorpora; the results of this evaluation are presented in Table 7.",
        "We can see that the detection accuracy is generally lower than for the corpus on which we trained the tagger (SWITCHBOARD), but still quite good in general.",
        "The major exceptions are the UH tags, on which the F1-scores are comparatively low for all subcorpora.",
        "The reason for this can be found mostly in words like yes, no, uh-huh, right, okay, and yeah, which are often tagged with UH in SWITCHBOARD but frequently are not considered to be irrelevant words in our corpus and hence not marked as disfluent (e.g., if they are considered to be the answer to a question or a summary-relevant acknowledgment).",
        "We circumvent potential exclusion from the summary output of these and other words that might be erroneously tagged as nonlexicalized filled pauses (UH) by marking a small set of words as exempt from removal (see section 5.5.6).",
        "5.3.7 False Start Detection.",
        "False starts are quite frequent in spontaneous speech, occurring at a rate of about 10–15% of all sentences (SWITCHBOARD, CALLHOME).",
        "They involve less than 10% of the total words of a dialogue; about 34% of the words in these incomplete sentences are part of some other disfluencies, such as filled pauses or repairs.",
        "(In complete sentences, only about 15% of the words are part of these disfluencies.)",
        "For CALLHOME, the average length of complete sentences is about 6 words, of incomplete sentences about 4.1 words (including disfluencies).",
        "We trained a C4.5 decision tree (Quinlan 1992) on 8,000 sentences of SWITCHBOARD.",
        "As features we use the first and last four trigger words (words that have a high incidence around sentence boundaries) and POS of every sentence, as well as the first and last four chunks from a POS-based chunk parser.",
        "This chunk parser is based on a simple context-free POS grammar for English.",
        "It outputs a phrasal bracketing of the input string (e.g., noun phrases or prepositional phrases).",
        "Further, we encode the length of the sentence in words and the number of the words not parsed by the chunk parser.",
        "We observed that whereas the chunk information itself does not improve performance over the baseline of using trigger words and POS information only, the derived feature of “number of not parsed words” actually does improve the results.",
        "We ran the decision tree on data with perfect POS tags (for SWITCHBOARD only), disfluency tags (except for repairs), and sentence boundaries.",
        "The evaluations were performed on independent test sets of about 3,000 sentences for SWITCHBOARD and of our complete dialogue corpus.",
        "Table 8 shows the results of these experiments.",
        "Typical errors, where complete sentences were classified as incomplete, are inverted forms or",
        "ellipsis at the end of a sentence (e.g., neither do I, it seems to).",
        "The performance for the informal corpora (CALLHOME, GROUP MEETINGS) is better than that for the formal corpora (NEWSHOUR, CROSSFIRE); this is related to the fact that the relative frequency of false starts is markedly lower in these latter data sets and that these corpora are more dissimilar to the training corpus (SWITCHBOARD).",

        "Repeated phrases can potentially be interrupted by other disfluencies, such as filled pauses or editing terms.",
        "Repetition detection is performed with a script that can identify repetitions of word/POS sequences of length one to four (longer repetitions are extremely rare: on average, less than 1% of all repetitions).",
        "Words that have been marked as disfluent by the POS tagger are ignored when the repeated sequences are considered, so we can correctly detect repetitions such as [ he said uh to + he said to ] him.... We are evaluating the precision, recall, and F1-scores for this component at the level of individual words when the POS tagger and the sentence boundary detection component are used.",
        "Table 9 shows the results.",
        "We see that for the informal subcorpora, we get very good precision (only a few repetitions detected are incorrect), and recall is in the 25–45% range (since we cannot detect substitution or insertion type of repairs).",
        "The results for the formal subcorpora are considerably worse, so this filter should probably not be used for corpora with as few repetitions as NEWSHOUR or CROSSFIRE.",
        "We checked all of the 95 false positives of this evaluation and observed that in the majority of cases (41%), the repetition was correctly detected but was not marked by the human annotator, since it might be considered a case of emphasis.",
        "We believe that although some nuances of the sentence(s) might be lost, for the purpose of summarization it makes perfect sense to reduce this information.",
        "Sometimes, individual words are repeated for emphasis, sometimes whole sentences (e.g., “Good./ Good./”).",
        "In the following example from English CALLHOME, the emphasis is rather extreme:",
        "Further, about 19% of false positives were correct but not annotated because they span multiple turns, and about 14% were erroneously missed by the human annotator.",
        "Only the remaining cases (26%) were actual false positives, caused by incorrect POS tags (5%, typically an incorrectly tagged “that/WDT that/DT” sequence at the beginning of a relative clause) or incorrect sentence boundaries (21%).",
        "There have been attempts to get a more complete coverage of detection and correction of all types of speech repairs (Heeman and Allen 1999).",

        "As we would expect, given the much higher frequency of disfluencies in the two informal subcorpora (CALLHOME, GROUP MEETINGS), the relative performance increase of DFF-ONLY over the MMR baseline is much higher here (about 10–15%) than for the two more formal subcorpora (5% and below).",
        "Looking at the performance increase of SB-ONLY, we find marked improvements over the MMR baseline for those two subcorpora that use the true original turn boundaries in the MMR baseline: GROUP MEETINGS and NEWSHOUR (>10%); for the two other subcorpora, the improvement is below 5%.",

        "The problem of how to generate readable and concise summaries automatically for spoken dialogues of unrestricted domains involves many challenges that need to be addressed.",
        "Some of the research issues are similar or identical to those faced in summarizing written texts (such as topic segmentation, determining the most salient/relevant information, anaphora resolution, summary evaluation), but other additional dimensions are added on top of this list, including speech disfluency detection, sentence boundary detection, cross-speaker information linking, and coping with imperfect speech recognition.",
        "The line of argument of this article has been that whereas using a",
        "traditional approach for written text summarization (such as the MMR-based sentence selection component within DIASUMM) may be a good starting point, addressing the dialogue-specific issues is key for obtaining better summaries for informal genres.",
        "We decided to focus on the three problems of (1) speech disfluency detection, (2) sentence boundary detection, and (3) cross-speaker information linking and implemented trainable system components to address each of these issues.",
        "Both the evaluations of the individual components of our spoken-dialogue summarization system and the global evaluations as well have shown that we can successfully make use of the SWITCHBOARD corpus (LDC 1999b) to train a system that works well on two other genres of informal dialogues, CALLHOME and GROUP MEETINGS.",
        "We conjecture that the reasons why the DIASUMM system was not able to improve over the MMR baseline for the two other corpora, which are more formal, lies in their very nature of being of a quite different genre: the NEWSHOUR and CROSSFIRE corpora have longer turns and sentences, as well as fewer disfluencies.",
        "We would also conjecture that their sentence structures are more complex than what we typically find in the other corpora of more colloquial, spontaneous conversations.",
        "Future work will have to address the issue of whether the availability of training data for more formal dialogues (in size and annotation style comparable to the SWITCHBOARD corpus, though) could lead to an improvement in performance on those data sets, as well, or if even then a standard written-text-based summarizer would be hard to improve upon.",
        "Given the complexity of the task, we had to make a number of simplifying assumptions, most notably about the input data for our system: We use perfect transcripts by humans instead of ASR transcripts, which, for these genres, typically show word error rates (WERs) ranging from 15% to 35%.",
        "Previous related work (Valenza et al.",
        "1999; Zechner and Waibel 2000b) demonstrated that the actual WERs in summaries generated from ASR output are usually substantially lower than the full-ASR-transcript WER and can further be reduced by taking acoustically derived confidence scores into account.",
        "We further did not explore the potential improvements of components as well as of the system overall when prosodic information such as stress and pitch is added as an input feature.",
        "Past work in related fields (Shriberg et al.",
        "1998; Shriberg et al.",
        "2000) suggests that particularly for ASR input, noticeable improvements might be achievable when such input is provided.",
        "Although presegmentation of the input into topically coherent segments certainly is a useful step in summarization for any kind of texts (written or spoken), we have not addressed and discussed this issue in this article.",
        "Finally, we think that there is more work needed in the area of automatically deriving discourse structures for spoken dialogues in unrestricted domains, even if the text spans covered might be only local (because of a lack of global discourse plans).",
        "We believe that a summarizer, in addition to knowing about the interactively constructed and coherent pieces of information (such as in question-answer pairs), could make good use of such structured information and be better guided in making its selections for summary generation.",
        "In addition, this discourse structure might aid modules that perform automatic anaphora detection and resolution."

        "uses trainable components to detect and remove speech disfluencies (making the output more readable and less noisy), to determine sentence boundaries (creating suitable text spans for summary generation), and to link cross-speaker information units (allowing for increased summary coherence).",
        "We used a corpus of 23 dialogue excerpts from four different genres (80 topical segments, about 47,000 words) for system development and evaluation and the disfluency-annotated SWITCHBOARD corpus (LDC 1999b) for training of the dialogue-specific components.",
        "Our corpus was annotated by six human coders for topical boundaries and relevant text spans for summaries.",
        "Additionally, we had annotations made for disfluencies, sentence boundaries, question speech acts, and the corresponding answers to those question speech acts.",
        "In a global system evaluation we compared the MMR-based sentence selection component with the DIASUMM system using all of its components discussed in this article.",
        "The results showed that (1) both a baseline MMR system as well as DIASUMM create better summaries than a LEAD baseline (except for NEWSHOUR) and that (2) DIASUMM performs significantly better than the baseline MMR system for the informal dialogue corpora (CALLHOME and GROUP MEETINGS)."
