        "Rational relations on strings have become widespread in language and speech engineering (Roche and Schabes, 1997).",
        "Despite bounded memory they are well-suited to describe many linguistic and textual processes, either exactly or approximately.",
        "A relation is a set of (input, output) pairs.",
        "Relations are more general than functions because they may pair a given input string with more or fewer than one output string.",
        "The class of so-called rational relations admits a nice declarative programming paradigm.",
        "Source code describing the relation (a regular expression) is compiled into efficient object code (in the form of a 2-tape automaton called a finite-state transducer).",
        "The object code can even be optimized for runtime and code size (via algorithms such as deter-minization and minimization of transducers).",
        "This programming paradigm supports efficient nondeterminism, including parallel processing over infinite sets of input strings, and even allows “reverse” computation from output to input.",
        "Its unusual flexibility for the practiced programmer stems from the many operations under which rational relations are closed.",
        "It is common to define further useful operations (as macros), which modify existing relations not by editing their source code but simply by operating on them “from outside.” *A brief version of this work, with some additional material, first appeared as (Eisner, 2001a).",
        "A leisurely journal-length version with more details has been prepared and is available.",
        "The entire paradigm has been generalized to weighted relations, which assign a weight to each (input, output) pair rather than simply including or excluding it.",
        "If these weights represent probabilities P(input, output) or P(output |input), the weighted relation is called a joint or conditional (probabilistic) relation and constitutes a statistical model.",
        "Such models can be efficiently restricted, manipulated or combined using rational operations as before.",
        "An artificial example will appear in §2.",
        "The availability of toolkits for this weighted case (Mohri et al., 1998; van Noord and Gerdemann, 2001) promises to unify much of statistical NLP.",
        "Such tools make it easy to run most current approaches to statistical markup, chunking, normalization, segmentation, alignment, and noisy-channel decoding,1 including classic models for speech recognition (Pereira and Riley, 1997) and machine translation (Knight and Al-Onaizan, 1998).",
        "Moreover, once the models are expressed in the finite-state framework, it is easy to use operators to tweak them, to apply them to speech lattices or other sets, and to combine them with linguistic resources.",
        "Unfortunately, there is a stumbling block: Where do the weights comefrom?",
        "After all, statistical models require supervised or unsupervised training.",
        "Currently, finite-state practitioners derive weights using exogenous training methods, then patch them onto transducer arcs.",
        "Not only do these methods require additional programming outside the toolkit, but they are limited to particular kinds of models and training regimens.",
        "For example, the forward-backward algorithm (Baum, 1972) trains only Hidden Markov Models, while (Ristad and Yianilos, 1996) trains only stochastic edit distance.",
        "In short, current finite-state toolkits include no training algorithms, because none exist for the large space of statistical models that the toolkits can in principle describe and run.",
        "This paper aims to provide a remedy through a new paradigm, which we call parameterized finite-state machines.",
        "It lays out a fully general approach for training the weights of weighted rational relations.",
        "First §2 considers how to parameterize such models, so that weights are defined in terms of underlying parameters to be learned.",
        "§3 asks what it means to learn these parameters from training data (what is to be optimized?",
        "), and notes the apparently formidable bookkeeping involved.",
        "§4 cuts through the difficulty with a surprisingly simple trick.",
        "Finally, §5 removes inefficiencies from the basic algorithm, making it suitable for inclusion in an actual toolkit.",
        "Such a toolkit could greatly shorten the development cycle in natural language engineering."

        "• Most simply, the algorithm can be asked to tune the 17 numbers in Fig. 1a separately, subject to the constraint that the paths retain total probability 1.",
        "A more specific version of the constraint requires the FST to remain Markovian: each of the 4 states must present options with total probability 1 (at state 1Q, 15+.7+.03.+.12=1).",
        "This preserves the random-walk interpretation and (we will show) entails no loss of generality.",
        "The 4 restrictions leave 13 free params.",
        "• But perhaps Fig. 1a was actually obtained as the composition of Fig. 1b–c, effectively defining P(input, output) = Emid P(input, mid) · P(output |mid).",
        "If Fig. 1b–c are required to remain Markovian, they have 5 and 1 degrees of freedom respectively, so now Fig. 1a has only 6 parameters total .2 In general, composing machines multiplies their arc counts but only adds their parameter counts.",
        "We wish to optimize just the few underlying parameters, not independently optimize the many arc weights of the composed machine.",
        "• Perhaps Fig. 1b was itself obtained by the probabilistic regular expression (a: p)∗λ(b : (p +µ q))∗ν with the 3 parameters (λ, µ, ν) = (.7, .2, .5).",
        "With ρ = .1 from footnote 2, the composed machine",
        "(Fig.",
        "1a) has now been described with a total of just 4 parameters !3 Here, probabilistic union E +µ F def = µE + (1 − µ)F means “flip a µ-weighted coin and generate E if heads, F if tails.” E∗λ def = (λE)*(1−λ) means “repeatedly flip an λ-weighted coin and keep repeating E as long as it comes up heads.” These 4 parameters have global effects on Fig. 1a, thanks to complex parameter tying: arcs 4b:p −→ 5@, 5b:q −→5 in Fig. 1b get respective probabilities (1 − λ)µν and (1 − µ)ν, which covary with ν and vary oppositely with µ.",
        "Each of these probabilities in turn affects multiple arcs in the composed FST of Fig. 1a.",
        "We offer a theorem that highlights the broad applicability of these modeling techniques.4 If f (input, output) is a weighted regular relation, then the following statements are equivalent: (1) f is a joint probabilistic relation; (2) f can be computed by a Markovian FST that halts with probability 1; (3) f can be expressed as a probabilistic regexp, i.e., a regexp built up from atomic expressions a: b (for a ∈ Σ ∪ { e}, b ∈ Δ ∪ { e}) using concatenation, probabilistic union +p, and probabilistic closure ∗p.",
        "For defining conditional relations, a good regexp language is unknown to us, but they can be defined in several other ways: (1) via FSTs as in Fig. 1c, (2) by compilation of weighted rewrite rules (Mohri and Sproat, 1996), (3) by compilation of decision trees (Sproat and Riley, 1996), (4) as a relation that performs contextual left-to-right replacement of input substrings by a smaller conditional relation (Gerdemann and van Noord, 1999),5 (5) by conditionalization of a joint relation as discussed below.",
        "A central technique is to define a joint relation as a noisy-channel model, by composing a joint relation with a cascade of one or more conditional relations as in Fig. 1 (Pereira and Riley, 1997; Knight and Graehl, 1998).",
        "The general form is illustrated by 3Conceptually, the parameters represent the probabilities of reading another a (λ); reading another b (ν); transducing b to p rather than q (µ); starting to transduce p to a rather than x (ρ).",

        "Arbitrary weights such as 2.7 may be assigned to arcs or sprinkled through a regexp (to be compiled into E:E�7 arcs).",
        "A more subtle example is weighted FSAs that approximate PCFGs (Nederhof, 2000; Mohri and Nederhof, 2001), or to extend the idea, weighted FSTs that approximate joint or conditional synchronous PCFGs built for translation.",
        "These are parameterized by the PCFG’s parameters, but add or remove strings of the PCFG to leave an improper probability distribution.",
        "Fortunately for those techniques, an FST with positive arc weights can be normalized to make it jointly or conditionally probabilistic:",
        "• An easy approach is to normalize the options at each state to make the FST Markovian.",
        "Unfortunately, the result may differ for equivalent FSTs that express the same weighted relation.",
        "Undesirable consequences of this fact have been termed “label bias” (Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "Also, in the conditional case such per-state normalization is only correct if all states accept all input suffixes (since “dead ends” leak probability mass).8 • A better-founded approach is global normal",
        "ization, which simply divides each f (x, y) by Ex,,y, f (x', y') (joint case) or by Ey, f (x, y') (conditional case).",
        "To implement the joint case, just divide stopping weights by the total weight of all paths (which §4 shows how to find), provided this is finite.",
        "In the conditional case, let g be a copy of f with the output labels removed, so that g(x) finds the desired divisor; determinize g if possible (but this fails for some weighted FSAs), replace all weights with their reciprocals, and compose the result with f.9 6P(w, x) defines the source model, and is often an “identity FST” that requires w = x, really just an FSA.",

        "9It suffices to make g unambiguous (one accepting path per string), a weaker condition than determinism.",
        "When this is not possible (as in the inverse of Fig. 1b, whose conditionaliza-Normalization is particularly important because it enables the use of log-linear (maximum-entropy) parameterizations.",

        "Now for some important remarks on efficiency: • Computing ti is an instance of the well-known algebraic path problem (Lehmann, 1977; Tarjan, 1981a).",

        "Then ti is the total semiring weight w0n of paths in Ti from initial state 0 to final state n (assumed WLOG to be unique and unweighted).",
        "It is wasteful to compute ti as suggested earlier, by minimizing (c ×xi) ◦ f ◦ (yi × E), since then the real work is done by an c-closure step (Mohri, 2002) that implements the all-pairs version of algebraic path, whereas all we need is the single-source version.",
        "If n and m are the number of states and edges,19 then both problems are O(n3) in the worst case, but the single-source version can be solved in essentially O(m) time for acyclic graphs and other reducible flow graphs (Tarjan, 1981b).",
        "For a general graph Ti, Tarjan (198 1b) shows how to partition into “hard” subgraphs that localize the cyclicity or irreducibility, then run the O(n3) algorithm on each subgraph (thereby reducing n to as little as 1), and recombine the results.",
        "The overhead of partitioning and recombining is essentially only O(m).",
        "• For speeding up the O(n3) problem on subgraphs, one can use an approximate relaxation technique",

        "• In many cases of interest, Ti is an acyclic graph.20 Then Tarjan’s method computes w0j for each j in topologically sorted order, thereby finding ti in a linear number of ⊕ and ⊗ operations.",
        "For HMMs (footnote 11), Ti is the familiar trellis, and we would like this computation of ti to reduce to the forward-backward algorithm (Baum, 1972).",
        "But notice that it has no backward pass.",
        "In place of pushing cumulative probabilities backward to the arcs, it pushes cumulative arcs (more generally, values in V) forward to the probabilities.",
        "This is slower because our ⊕ and ⊗ are vector operations, and the vectors rapidly lose sparsity as they are added together.",
        "We therefore reintroduce a backward pass that lets us avoid ⊕ and ⊗ when computing ti (so they are needed only to construct Ti).",
        "This speedup also works for cyclic graphs and for any V. Write wjk as (pjk, vjk), and let w1jk = (p1jk, v1 jk) denote the weight of the edge from j to k.19 Then it can be shown that w0n= (p0n, Ej,k p0jv1jkpkn).",
