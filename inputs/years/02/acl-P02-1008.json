        "Comprehension has not been much studied in OT; we show that unlike production, it does not always yield a regular set, making finite-state methods inapplicable.",
        "However, after giving a suitably flexible presentation of OT, we show carefully how to treat comprehension under recent variants of OT in which grammars can be compiled into finite-state transducers.",

        "To produce language is to convert utterances from their underlying (“deep”) form to a surface form.",
        "Optimality Theory or OT (Prince and Smolensky, 1993) proposes to describe phonological production as an optimization process.",
        "For an underlying x, a speaker purportedly chooses the surface form z so as to maximize the harmony of the pair (x, z).",
        "Broadly speaking, (x, z) is harmonic if z is “easy” to pronounce and “similar” to x.",
        "But the precise harmony measure depends on the language; according to OT, it can be specified by a grammar of ranked desiderata known as constraints.",
        "According to OT, then, production maps each underlying form to its best possible surface pronunciation.",
        "It is akin to the function that maps each child x to his or her most flattering outfit z.",
        "Different children look best in different clothes, and for an oddly shaped child x, even the best conceivable outfit z may be an awkward compromise between style and fit – that is, between ease of pronunciation and similarity to x.",
        "Language comprehension is production in reverse.",
        "In OT, it maps each outfit z to the set of chil-'Thanks to Kie Zuraw for asking about comprehension; to Ron Kaplan for demanding an algebraic construction before he believed directional OT was finite-state; and to others whose questions convinced me that this paper deserved to be written.",
        "dren x for whom that outfit is optimal, i.e., is at least as flattering as any other outfit z':",
        "In general z and z' may range over infinitely many possible pronunciations.",
        "While the formulas above are almost identical, comprehension is in a sense more complex because it varies both the underlying and surface forms.",
        "While PRODUCE(x) considers all pairs (x, z'), COMPREHEND(z) must for each x consider all pairs (x, z').",
        "Of course, this nested definition does not preclude computational shortcuts.",
        "This paper has three modest goals:",
        "1.",
        "To show that OT comprehension does in fact present a computational problem that production does not.",
        "Even when the OT grammar is required to be finite-state, so that production can be performed with finite-state techniques, comprehension cannot in general be performed with finite-state techniques.",
        "2.",
        "To consider recent constructions that cut through this problem (Frank and Satta, 1998; Karttunen, 1998; Eisner, 2000; Gerdemann and van Noord, 2000).",
        "By altering or approximating the OT formalism – that is, by hook or by crook – these constructions manage to compile OT grammars into finite-state transducers.",
        "Transducers may readily be inverted to do comprehension as easily as production.",
        "We carefully lay out how to use them for comprehension in realistic circumstances (in the presence of correspondence theory, lexical constraints, hearer uncertainty, and phonetic postprocessing).",
        "3.",
        "To give a unified treatment in the extended finite-state calculus of the constructions referenced above.",
        "This clarifies their meaning and makes them easy to implement.",
        "For example, we obtain a transparent algebraic version of Eisner’s (2000) unbearably technical automaton construction for his proposed formalism of “directional OT.”",

        "Fosler (1996) noted the existence of the OT comprehension task and speculated that it might succumb to heuristic search.",

        "Hale and Reiss (1998) pointed out in response that any comprehension-by-optimization strategy would have to arrange for multiple optima: after all, phonological comprehension is a one-to-many mapping (since phonological production is many-to-one).1 The correctness of Smolensky’s proposal (i.e., whether it really computes COMPREHEND) depends on the particular harmony measure.",
        "It can be made to work, multiple optima and all, if the harmony measure is constructed with both production and comprehension in mind.",

        "In particular, all objects are represented as strings, or as functions that map strings to strings.",
        "This will enable us to use finite-state techniques later.",
        "The underlying form x and surface form z are represented as strings.",
        "We often refer to these strings as input and output.",
        "Following Eisner (1997), each candidate (x, z) is also represented as a string y.",
        "The notation (x, z) that we have been using so far for candidates is actually misleading, since in fact the candidates y that are compared encode more than just x and z.",
        "They also encode a particular alignment or correspondence between x and z.",
        "For example, if x = abdip and z = a[ di] [ bu] , then a typical candidate would be encoded",
        "which specifies that a corresponds to a, b was deleted (has no surface correspondent), voiceless p surfaces as voiced b, etc.",
        "The harmony of y might depend on this alignment as well as on x and z (just as an outfit might fit worse when worn backwards).",
        "Because we are distinguishing underlying and surface material by using disjoint alphabets Σ = {a, b,... } and Δ = {[ , ] , a, b,... },2 it is easy to extract the underlying and surface forms (x and z) from y.",
        "Although the above example assumes that x and z are simple strings of phonemes and brackets, nothing herein depends on that assumption.",
        "Autosegmental representations too can be encoded as strings (Eisner, 1997).",
        "In general, an OT grammar consists of 4 components: a constraint ranking, a harmony ordering, and generating and pronouncing functions.",
        "The constraint ranking is the language-specific part of the grammar; the other components are often supposed to be universal across languages.",
        "The generating function GEN maps any x ∈ Σ* to the (nonempty) set of candidates y whose underlying form is x.",
        "In other words, GEN just inserts",
        "arbitrary substrings from Δ* amongst the characters of x, subject to any restrictions on what constitutes a legitimate candidate y.3 (Legitimacy might for instance demand that y’s surface material z have matched, non-nested left and right brackets, or even that z be similar to x in terms of edit distance.)",
        "A constraint ranking is simply a sequence C1, C2,... Cn of constraints.",
        "Let us take each Ci to be a function that scores candidates y by annotating them with violation marks *.",
        "For example, a NODELETE constraint would map y = aab0c0[ ddii] [ pb0u] toy¯=NODELETE(y) = aab*0c 0[ ddii] [ pb0u] ,inserting a*after each underlying phoneme that does not correspond to any surface phoneme.",
        "This unconventional formulation is needed for new approaches that care about the exact location of the *’s.",
        "In traditional OT only the number of *’s is important, although the locations are sometimes shown for readability.",
        "Finally, OT requires a harmony ordering >on scored candidates y¯ ∈ (Σ ∪ Δ ∪ {*})*.",

        "Given an underlying form x, let",

        "In particular, one can define GEN so that each candidate y encodes not just an alignment between x and z, but an alignment among x, z, and some other strings that are neither underlying nor surface.",
        "These other strings may represent the surface forms for other members of the same morphological paradigm, or intermediate throwaway candidates to which z is sympathetic.",

        "It is dominated by C1, which penalizes brackets that do not fall at either edge of the string.",
        "Note that this grammar is completely permissive as to the number and location of surface characters other than brackets.",

        "And if a’s and b’s appear equally often in x, then PRODUCE(x) is the union of the two sets.",
        "Thus, while the x-to-z mapping is not a regular relation under this grammar, at least PRODUCE(x) is a regular set for each x – just as finite-state OT constraints, notably Koskenniemi’s (1983) two-level model, which like OT used finite-state constraints on candidates y that encoded an alignment between underlying x and surface z. guarantees.",

        "Unfortunately this is unlikely to succeed.",

        "Yet even these primitive constraints retain enough power to simulate any finite-state constraint.",
        "In any case, C1 and C2 themselves are fairly similar to “domain” constraints used to describe tone systems (Cole and Kisseberth, 1994).",
        "While C2 is somewhat odd in that it penalizes two distinct configurations at once, one would obtain the same effect by combining three separately plausible constraints: C2 requires a’s between brackets (i.e., in a tone domain) to receive surface high tones, C3 requires b’s outside brackets to receive surface high tones, and C4 penalizes all surface high tones.5 Another obvious if unsatisfying hack would impose heuristic limits on the length of x, for example by allowing the comprehension system to return the approximation COMPREHEND(z) ∩ {x : |x |≤ 2 · |z|}.",

        "Extending the pretty notation of (Karttunen, 1998), we may use (4) to define a left-associative generalized optimality operator ooH : Y ooH C def = (Y◦C◦¬range(Y◦C◦H))◦D (14) Then for any regular OT grammar, PRODUCE = GEN ooH C1 ooH C2 · · · ooH Cn ◦ PRON and can be inverted to get COMPREHEND.",

        "Their regular expressions can be used to implement it, simply replacing their add_violation by our H. Typically, H ignores surface characters when comparing starred candidates.",

        "He argues that violation counting (o+) is a bug in OT rather than a feature worth approximating, since it predicts unattested phenomena such as “majority assimilation” (Bakovi´c, 1999; Lombardi, 1999).",
        "Conversely, he argues that comparing violations directionally is not a hack but a desirable feature, since it naturally predicts “iterative phenomena” whose description in traditional OT (via Generalized Alignment) is awkward from both a linguistic and a computational point of view.",
