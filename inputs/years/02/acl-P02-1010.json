        "Explicit computation of all scope configurations is apt to slow down an NLP system considerably.",
        "Therefore, underspecification of scope ambiguities is an important prerequisite for efficient processing.",
        "Many tasks, like ellipsis resolution or anaphora resolution, are arguably best performed on a representation with fixed scope order.",
        "An underspecification formalism should support execution of these tasks.",
        "This paper aims to upgrade an existing underspecification formalism for scope ambiguities, Underspecified Discourse Representation Theory (UDRT) (Reyle, 1993), so that both ellipsis and anaphora resolution can work on the underspecified structures.",
        "Several proposals have been made in the literature on how to integrate scope underspecification and ellipsis resolution in a single formalism, e.g. Quasi-Logical Forms (QLF) (Crouch, 1995) and the Constraint Language for Lambda Structures (CLLS) (Egg et al., 2001).",
        "That work has primarily aimed at devising methods to untangle quantifier scoping and ellipsis resolution which often interact closely (see Section 6).",
        "To this end, description languages have been modelled in which the disambiguation steps of a derivation need not be executed but rather can be explicitly recorded as constraints on the final structure.",
        "Constraints are only evaluated when the underspecified representation is finally interpreted.",
        "In contrast, UDRT aims at providing a representation formalism that supports interpretation processes such as theorem proving and anaphora resolution.",
        "Understood in this sense, underspecification often obviates the need for complete disambiguation.",
        "Another consequence is, however, that the strategy of postponing disambiguation steps is in some cases insufficient.",
        "A case in point is the phenomenon dubbed Missing Antecedents by Grinder and Postal (1971), illustrated in sentence (1): One of the pronoun’s antecedents is overt, the other is supplied by ellipsis resolution.",

        "(2) Harry sometimes reads a book about a sea-battle and so does Bill.",
        "They borrow those books from the library.",
        "Example (2) still retains five readings (Are there two or even more books?",
        "are there one, two, or more than two sea-battles?).",
        "An underspecified representation should not be committed to any of these readings, but it should specify that “a book” has narrow scope with respect to the conjunction.",
        "Furthermore, an approach to underspecification and ellipsis resolution should make clear why this representation is to be constructed for the discourse (2).",
        "While QLF fails the first requirement (a single representation), CLLS fails the second (triggers for construction).",
        "(3) * A destroyers went down in some battle and a cruiser did too.",

        "The discourse in (3) is not well-formed.",
