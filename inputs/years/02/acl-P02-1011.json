        "Automated techniques for pronoun interpretation have generally tried to resolve only those pronouns that corefer with another noun phrase (henceforth NPC pronouns).",
        "Choosing an antecedent based on the attentional state of the discourse works well for NPC pronouns; so for quite some time, pronoun resolution work has been dominated by salience-based techniques.",
        "While a fruitful line of research for NPC pronouns, salience-based techniques do not work for pronouns whose antecedent is not a noun phrase.",
        "Such pronouns are common in spoken discourse.",
        "Eckert and Strube (2000) note that 22% of pronouns in a set of Switchboard dialogs had other-than-noun-phrase antecedents, and 33% had no antecedent.",
        "Byron and Allen (1998) report that only 50% of pronouns in the TRAINS93 corpus are NPC, and Botley (1996) found 20% of pronouns in his corpus to have no noun phrase antecedent.",
        "This data suggests that spoken dialog understanding systems must be able to interpret both NPC and non-NPC pronouns.",
        "The PHORA pronoun resolution algorithm, implemented within the TRIPS spoken dialog system at the University of Rochester, does just that.",
        "PHORA applies semantic filtering as a complement to salience calculations, which enables it to resolve pronouns referring to less salient abstract entities such as actions, propositions, and kinds.",
        "As a result, PHORA works equally as well on personal (e.g. it, him, them) as on demonstrative (e.g. this, those) pronouns.",
        "It is based on the observation that a pronoun that does not refer to the most salient item is typically constrained by its context to be incompatible with items more salient than the intended referent.",
        "Sidner (1983) describes this tradeoff between semantics and focus, but it has not been incorporated into pronoun resolution software until now.",
        "The details of PHORA will be described in Section 3; but first, Section 2 reviews relevant prior work that provided a basis for PHORA.",
        "2 Background and Related Work This section describes relevant prior work on anaphoric pronoun resolution.",
        "Anaphora resolution has been defined as a two-phase process: 1) identify what a text makes available for anaphoric reference and 2) constrain the candidates down to one choice for a given anaphor (Webber, 1979).",

        "Each DE represents a particular concept's participation in the discourse.",
        "Most previous anaphora resolution algorithms only create DE's for the referents of NPs; but it is well known that this provides insufficient support for all anaphoric pronouns, for example (inspired by (Webber, 1988)):",
        "(AO) Each Fall, penguins migrate to Fiji.",
        "(Ala) That's where they wait out the winter.",
        "(Alb) That's when it's too cold even for them.",
        "(Ale) That's why I'm going there next month.",
        "(A1d) It happens just before the eggs hatch.",
        "The pronouns in Ala and Alb depend only on noun phrases in AO (Fiji and Fall), but Alc refers to all of AO characterized as a fact, and the pronoun in Ald refers to the migration event.",
        "This example demonstrates that the same discourse unit (AO) can be characterized in a variety of ways by the anaphoric reference (a fact and an event in this case).",
        "These referents built from constituents other than noun phrases are called abstract referents.",
        "Webber (1990) suggests that each discourse unit produce a pseudo-DE that \"stands proxy for its propositional content\".",
        "Proxies can be coerced into different types of referents by applying referring functions (Nunberg, 1979).",
        "Each referring function recharacterizes the discourse unit in a particular way.",
        "To interpret the pronouns in example A, two functions are needed: one that takes the proxy for AO and creates a fact referent, and one for the event.'",
        "Asher (1993) details the syntactic and semantic conditions in which abstract referents are available for anaphoric reference.",
        "In dialog, Walker and Whittaker (1990) point out that once a question is asked, it remains salient until answered.",
        "As a result, in problem-solving conversations, particular aspects of the solution that are important for determining how well the proposed solution addresses the overall goal are salient even if they were not explicitly mentioned.",
        "These referents must be available 'Webber (1990) additionally describes a model of discourse structure that explains which discourse units are in focus at any point in the discourse, but PHORA does not employ a sophisticated model of discourse structure so those details are outside the scope of this discussion.",
        "for interpreting anaphoric pronouns.",
        "Which aspects of the problem state are salient after each action depends on the task underway.",
        "These salient aspects of the solution can be inferred using referring functions in a process similar to evoking abstract referents.",

        "Most extant algorithms operate by linking an anaphoric pronoun with the noun phrase that is judged to be its antecedent.",
        "The search is ordered either using syntactic structure (Hobbs, 1986) or an estimation of discourse salience (e.g. (Brennan et al., 1987; Baldwin, 1997; Tetreault, 2001).",
        "Although different techniques use different evidence for judging salience (grammatical role, information structure, coherence structure, etc.",
        "), it is generally agreed that items that appear as NP's in the sentence are most salient.2 Other items, such as the situation described by the sentence, are less salient.",
        "Therefore, pronouns that refer to these less salient items are simply not addressed in the salience paradigm because they cannot be resolved correctly.",
        "The salience paradigm was originally motivated by the fact that some pronouns have more than one candidate referent with equally valid semantic properties, yet human readers do not find the sentence ambiguous.",
        "In example C from Sidner (1983, pg.",
        "373), the pronoun in sentence C1 can refer to either the dog or the bull, but the dog is chosen because it is more focused.",
        "Sidner explains that the focused entity is chosen as the referent for a pronoun unless its semantic properties are incompatible with the predicative",
        "context of the pronoun.",
        "When multiple entities with equal semantics are available as candidate antecedents, salience provides a useful heuristic for choosing between them.",
        "(CO) Pam walked her dog near a bull one day.",
        "(C1) He trotted quietly along.",
        "Relying on salience to guide pronoun interpretation does not work for demonstrative pronouns, which differ from personal pronouns along several interrelated dimensions.",
        "First, they tend to have clausal antecedents or NP antecedents that were not in subject position (Pas-sonneau, 1993).",
        "Second, they tend to refer to semantically complex items for which the speaker cannot quickly compute agreement features that would be required for a personal pronoun (Chan-non, 1980).",
        "Notice the subtle difference between DOa and DOb.",
        "The demonstrative pronoun in DOb refers to the complex object apple+napkin.",
        "Is that object plural or singular?",
        "The demonstrative pronoun allows the speaker to hedge: (DOa) Put the apple on the napkin and then move it to the side.",
        "(DOb) Put the apple on the napkin and then move that to the side.",
        "Third, demonstrative pronouns tend to refer to an entity not in focus (Linde, 1979).",
        "Schuster (1988) found that her subjects interpreted sentences like Ela and Elb differently: (EO) John thought about {becoming a bum}i.",
        "(E1a) Iti would hurt his mother and iti would make his father furious.",
        "(E1b) {Iti would hurt his mother}j and than would make his father furious.",
        "The first it in El a refers to \"becoming a bum\" and thereby focuses attention on this referent.",
        "A second it maintains that reference, while the demonstrative pronoun prefers an unfocused entity.",
        "This contrast was formalized in the Givenness Hierarchy developed by Gundel et al.",
        "(1993), which distinguishes the in focus status, marked by personal pronouns, from the activated status, marked by demonstratives.",
        "Activated entities are in short-term memory because they were mentioned in the discourse or because they are in the physical context, but are not currently at the center of attention.",
        "Because of these differences, anaphoric demonstrative pronouns have typically been excluded from pronoun resolution studies.",
        "A notable exception is the model by Eckert and Strube (2000), which matches anaphoric pronouns with their antecedents (pronouns for which no antecedent is identified are labeled vague pronouns).",
        "This algorithm uses the predication context of the pronoun to label it as incompatible with either abstract (clausal) or individual (noun phrase) referents.",
        "For example, the pronoun in \"That's right\" would be labeled individual-incompatible.",
        "When the predication does not constrain the pronoun, demonstratives prefer abstract referents and personal pronouns prefer individuals.",
        "Their pronoun resolution technique is an extension of the S-list technique (Strube, 1998), which incrementally updates the relative salience of NP-evoked DEs based on information structure, and judges the salience of clausal antecedents using discourse structure.",
        "This model was designed for spoken dialog, so it requires antecedents to be in the discourse common ground before they are available for anaphora resolution.",
        "This model assumes that referring functions are available to coerce clausal antecedents into the intended referents, but does not specify the details for those functions.",
        "Although not implemented, this technique performed well in hand-simulation on a set of Switchboard dialogs."
