        "Pronominalization is an important element in the automatic creation of multi-paragraph and multi-page texts using natural language generation (NLG).",
        "Authors routinely use pronouns in texts spanning all types of genres, such as newspaper copy, science fiction and even academic papers.",
        "Indeed, without pronouns, texts quickly become confusing as readers begin to pay more attention to the writing style than to the content that makes the text informative or enjoyable (Callaway and Lester, 2001a).",
        "Even worse, incorrect pronouns can lead readers to misinterpret the text or draw unsound inferences.",
        "Furthermore, current pronominalization strategies are ill-equipped to deal with the wide variety of reasons that pronouns are used in naturally occurring texts.",
        "Almost without exception, they focus on anaphoric pronouns as described in Focus/Centering Theory (Webber, 1979; Sidner, 1983; Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Walker, 1998), ignoring the multitude of other possible types.",
        "However, it is certainly true that authors make use of pronouns which are not motivated by anaphoric reference.",
        "In addition, because such approaches are oriented towards anaphora resolution during parsing, they ignore structures such as the discourse plan which are present during generation but not parsing.",
        "A typical discourse plan can include vital information for pronominalization such as time and clause boundaries, ordering of propositions, and semantic details verbal arguments.",
        "Current approaches based on Centering algorithms thus attempt to recreate a text coherence structure that duplicates work already done by the discourse planner.",
        "Finally, there are significant obstacles to verifying the correctness of existing pronominalization algorithms for any pronominalization theory (Not, 1996; Yeh and Mellish, 1997; McCoy and Strube, 1999; Henschel et al., 2000; Kibble and Power, 2000): the lack of natural language generation systems that can produce large enough texts to bring discourse-level processes into play.",
        "Because of this, researchers are forced to simulate by hand how their algorithms will work on a given text.",
        "It is also not sufficient to use template generation systems to perform this task because they lack the low-level discourse representation needed to provide the information upon which most algorithms base their decisions.",
        "In this paper we first summarize related work in both anaphora resolution and anaphora generation.",
        "We next describe the range of pronoun types that we found in a wide variety of texts.",
        "We proceed to describe an algorithm for determining appropriate pronominalizations that uses existing NLG structures and simple numeric techniques.",
        "We also briefly describe an implemented generation system that contains enough low-level discourse information to motivate pronominalization decisions using this method.",
        "Finally, we quantitatively demonstrate the performance of this simple numerical approach in both a newspaper and fictional narrative domain."

      "heading": "2 Background and Related Work",
      "text": [
        "Because most NLG systems have focused on linguistic phenomena at the paragraph level and below, there has been intensive investigation into the core areas of generation that are required to produce them: discourse planning, sentence planning and surface realization.",
        "Since pronouns are more likely to be a multiparagraph, discourse-level phenomenon, it has been possible to ignore their inclusion into working NLG systems which are not called upon to generate lengthy passages.",
        "Indeed, most work on pronouns in computational linguistics has come under the heading of anaphora resolution as an element of parsing rather than the heading of pronominalization as an element of generation.",
        "Since discourse anaphora resolution was first studied theoretically (Grosz, 1977; Webber, 1979; Sidner, 1983; Grosz and Sidner, 1986), it has come to be dominated by Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995; Di Eugenio, 1998; Walker, 1998) which proposes rules for the determination of focus and salience within a given segment of discourse.",
        "Relatively little work has been done on alternate approaches to pronoun resolution (Hobbs, 1976; Baldwin, 1995).",
        "While many NLG researchers have attempted to transfer the ideas of Centering Theory to generation (Not, 1996; Yeh and Mellish, 1997; McCoy and Strube, 1999; Henschel et al., 2000; Kibble and Power, 2000), there has yet been no substantial return contribution to the field of anaphora resolution.",
        "There are two principal reasons for this.",
        "First, it is extremely difficult to create an NLG system that generates the large quantity of texts needed to exhibit discourse-level phenomena while consistently employing the deep linguistic representations needed to determine appropriate pronominal forms.",
        "Second, Centering Theory is still vague on the exact definition of terms such as “segment” (Poesio et al., 1999a), making it difficult to create a mutually agreeable implementation.",
        "An additional area of NLG research that deals with pronouns is that of referring expression generation (Appelt, 1985; Heeman and Hirst, 1986; Claassen, 1992; Dale, 1992), which attempts to find the optimal noun phrase (whether full description, definite description, deixis, pronoun, or reduced noun phrase) to enable a reader to mentally select the intended referent from the set of possible referents (Reiter and Dale, 1997).",
        "Comparatively, referring expression generation is a process for local disambiguation and is not generally concerned with single phenomena spanning multiple paragraphs.",
        "Because of this, and because the domains and genres we have studied typically do not involve sets of very similar referents, we concentrate on discourse-motivated sources of pronominalization."

        "Pronouns across boundaries: After a chapter, section or other obvious boundary, such as a change in time, place, or both, as in (McCoy and Strube, 1999), authors will typically “reset” pronominalization just as if it were the beginning of the entire text.",
        "Antecedent references that break these boundaries are sometimes marked by the authors in academic texts: As we saw in the previous section, ...",
        "7.",

        "A single algorithm may be tuned to match a particular author’s style, but parameterization will be necessary to match a variety of styles.",
        "Thus it is extremely difficult to exactly match any particular text without having the ability to adjust the pronominalization algorithm.",
