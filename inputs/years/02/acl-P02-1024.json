        "The goal of this study is to address the above three issues.",
        "We first present a formal definition of the ACM; then we describe in detail the methodology of constructing the ACM including (1) an asymmetric clustering algorithm in which different metrics are used for clustering the predicted and conditional words respectively; and (2) a method for model parameter optimization in which the optimal cluster numbers are found for different clusters.",

        "The discussion of the ACM in this paper is an extension of several studies below.",
        "The first similar cluster model was presented by Goodman and Gao [2000] in which the clustering techniques were combined with Stolcke’s [ 1998] pruning to reduce the language model (LM) size effectively.",
        "Goodman [2001] and Gao et al., [2001] give detailed descriptions of the asymmetric clustering algorithm.",
        "However, the impact of the asymmetric clustering on the performance of the resulting cluster model was not empirically studied there.",
        "Gao et al., [2001] presented a fairly thorough empirical study of clustering techniques for Asian language modeling.",
        "Unfortunately, all of the above work studied the ACM without applying it to an application; thus only perplexity results were presented.",
        "The first real application of the ACM was a simplified bigram ACM used in a Chinese text input system [Gao et al.",
        "2002].",
        "However, quite a few techniques (including clustering) were integrated to construct a Chinese language modeling system, and the contribution of using the ACM alone was by no means completely investigated.",
        "Finally, there is one more point worth mentioning.",
        "Most language modeling improvements reported previously required significantly more space than word trigram models [Rosenfeld, 2000].",
        "Their practical value is questionable since all realistic applications have memory constraints.",
        "In this paper, our goal is to achieve a better tradeoff between LM performance (perplexity and CER) and model size.",
        "Thus, whenever we compare the performance of different models (i.e. ACM vs. word trigram model), Stolcke’s pruning is employed to bring the models compared to similar sizes."

        "PW≠CW.",
        "Therefore, we used two separate trees to store probabilities and backoff weights, respectively.",
        "As a result, we used four tree structures to store ACMs in practice: two for the cluster sub-model P(PWi l |CWi-2jCWi-1j), and two for the word sub-model P(wi |CWi-2kCWi-1kPWil) .",
        "We found that the effect of the storage structure cannot be ignored in a real application.",
        "In addition, we used several techniques to compress model parameters (i.e. word id, n-gram probability, and backoff weight, etc.)",
        "and reduce the storage space of models significantly.",
        "For example, rather than store 4-byte floating point values for all n-gram probabilities and backoff weights, the values are quantized to a small number of quantization levels.",
        "Quantization is performed separately on each of the n-gram probability and backoff weight lists, and separate quantization level lookup tables are generated for each of these sets of parameters.",
        "We used 8-bit quantization, which shows no performance decline in our experiments.",
        "Our goal is to achieve the best tradeoff between performance and model size.",
        "Therefore, we would like to compare the ACM with the word trigram model at the same model size.",
        "Unfortunately, the ACM contains four sub-models and this makes it difficult to be pruned to a specific size.",
        "Thus for comparison, we always choose the ACM with smaller size than its competing word trigram model to guarantee that our evaluation is underestimated.",
        "Experiments show that the ACMs achieve statistically significant improvements over word trigram models at even smaller model sizes (p-value =8.0E-9).",
        "Some results are shown in Table 3.",
        "Now we discuss why the ACM is superior to simple word trigrams.",
        "In addition to the better structure as shown in Section 3.3, we assume here that the benefit of our model also comes from its better smoothing.",
        "Consider a probability such as P(Tuesday |party on).",
        "If we put the word “Tuesday” into the cluster WEEKDAY, we decompose the probability",
        "When each word belongs to one class, simple math shows that this decomposition is a strict equality.",
        "However, when smoothing is taken into consideration, using the clustered probability will be more accurate than using the non-clustered probability.",
        "For instance, even if we have never seen an example of “party on Tuesday”, perhaps we have seen examples of other phrases, such as “party on Wednesday”; thus, the probability P(WEEKDAY| party on) will be relatively high.",
        "Furthermore, although we may never have seen an example of “party on WEEKDAY Tuesday”, after we backoff or interpolate with a lower order model, we may able to accurately estimate P(Tuesday |on WEEKDAY).",
        "Thus, our smoothed clustered estimate may be a good one.",
        "Our assumption can be tested empirically by following experiments.",
        "We first constructed several test sets with different backoff rates4.",
        "The backoff rate of a test set, when presented to a trigram model, is defined as the number of words whose trigram probabilities are estimated by backoff bigram probabilities divided by the number of words in the test set.",
        "Then for each test set, we obtained a pair of CER results using the ACM and the word trigram model respectively.",
        "As shown in Figure 4, in both cases, CER increases as the backoff rate increases from 28% to 40%.",
        "But the curve of the word trigram model has a steeper upward trend.",
        "The difference of the upward trends of the two curves can be shown more clearly by plotting the CER difference between them, as shown in Figure 5.",
        "The results indicate that because of its better smoothing, when the backoff rate increases, the CER using the ACM does not increase as fast as that using the word trigram model.",
        "Therefore, we are reasonably confident that some portion of the benefit of the ACM comes from its better smoothing."

        "There are three main contributions of this paper.",
        "First, after presenting a formal definition of the ACM, we described in detail the methodology of constructing the ACM effectively.",
        "We showed empirically that both the asymmetric clustering and the parameter optimization (i.e. optimal cluster numbers) have positive impacts on the performance of the resulting ACM.",
        "The finding demonstrates partially the effectiveness of our research focus: techniques for using clusters (i.e. the ACM) rather than techniques for finding clusters (i.e. clustering algorithms).",
        "Second, we explored the actual representation of the ACM and evaluate it on a realistic application – Japanese Kana-Kanji conversion.",
        "Results show approximately 6-10% CER reduction of the ACMs in comparison with the word trigram models, even when the ACMs are slightly smaller.",
        "Third, the reasons underlying the superiority of the ACM are analyzed.",
        "For instance, our analysis suggests the benefit of the ACM comes partially from its better structure and its better smoothing.",
        "All cluster models discussed in this paper are based on hard clustering, meaning that each word belongs to only one cluster.",
        "One area we have not explored is the use of soft clustering, where a word w can be assigned to multiple clusters W with a probability P(W|w) [Pereira et al., 1993].",
        "Saul and Pereira [ 1997] demonstrated the utility of soft clustering and concluded that any method that assigns each word to a single cluster would lose information.",
        "It is an interesting question whether our techniques for hard clustering can be extended to soft clustering.",
        "On the other hand, soft clustering models tend to be larger than hard clustering models because a given word can belong to multiple clusters, and thus a training instance P(wi |wi-2wi-1) can lead to multiple counts instead of just 1."
