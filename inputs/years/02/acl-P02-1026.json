        "It is well-known from Information Theory that the most efficient way to send information through noisy channels is at a constant rate.",
        "If humans try to communicate in the most efficient way, then they must obey this principle.",
        "The communication medium we examine in this paper is text, and we present some evidence that this principle holds here.",
        "Entropy is a measure of information first proposed by Shannon (1948).",
        "Informally, entropy of a random variable is proportional to the difficulty of correctly guessing the value of this variable (when the distribution is known).",
        "Entropy is the highest when all values are equally probable, and is lowest (equal to 0) when one of the choices has probability of 1, i.e. deterministically known in advance.",
        "In this paper we are concerned with entropy of English as exhibited through written text, though these results can easily be extended to speech as well.",
        "The random variable we deal with is therefore a unit of text (a word, for our purposes1) that a random person who has produced all the previous words in the text stream is likely to produce next.",
        "We have as many random variables as we have words in a text.",
        "The distributions of these variables are obviously different and depend on all previous words produced.",
        "We claim, however, that the entropy of these random variables is on average the same2."

        "There has been work in the speech community inspired by this constancy rate principle.",
        "In speech, distortion of the audio signal is an extra source of uncertainty, and this principle can by applied in the following way: A given word in one speech context might be common, while in another context it might be rare.",
        "To keep the entropy rate constant over time, it would be necessary to take more time (i.e., pronounce more carefully) in less common situations.",
        "Aylett (1999) shows that this is indeed the case.",
        "It has also been suggested that the principle of constant entropy rate agrees with biological evidence of how human language processing has evolved (Plotkin and Nowak, 2000).",

        "For each word wi there will be some word wj, (j < i) which is the starting word of the sentence wi belongs to.",
        "We will combine random variables X1 ... Xi_1 into two sets.",
        "The first, which we call Ci (for context), contains X1 through Xj_1, i.e. all the words from the preceding sentences.",
        "The remaining set, which we call Li (for local), will contain words Xj through Xi_1 .",
        "Both Li and Ci could be empty sets.",
        "We can now write our variable Yi as Xi |Ci, Li.",
        "Our claim is that the entropy of Yi , H(Yi) stays constant for all i.",
        "By the definition of relative mutual information between Xi and Ci,",
        "where the last term is the mutual information between the word and context given the sentence.",
        "As i increases, so does the set Ci.",
        "Li, on the other hand, increases until we reach the end of the sentence, and then becomes small again.",
        "Intuitively, we expect the mutual information at, say, word k of each sentence (where Li has the same size for all i) to increase as the sentence number is increasing.",
        "By our hypothesis we then expect H(Xi |Li) to increase with the sentence number as well.",
        "Current techniques are not very good at estimating H(Yi), because we do not have a very good model of context, since this model must be mostly semantic in nature.",
        "We have shown, however, that if we can instead estimate H(Xi|Li) and show that it increases with the sentence number, we will provide evidence to support the constancy rate principle.",
        "The latter expression is much easier to estimate, because it involves only words from the beginning of the sentence whose relationship is largely local and can be successfully captured through something as simple as an n-gram model.",
        "We are only interested in the mean value of the H(Xj |Lj) for wj E Si, where Si is the ith sentence.",
        "This number is equal to FS – ii1H(Si), which reduces the problem to the one of estimating the entropy of a sentence.",
        "We use three different ways to estimate the entropy:",
        "• Estimate H(Si) using an n-gram probabilistic model • Estimate H(Si) using a probabilistic model induced by a statistical parser • Estimate H(Xi) directly, using a non-parametric estimator.",
        "We estimate the entropy for the beginning of each sentence.",
        "This approach estimates H(Xi), not H(Xi |Li), i.e. ignores not only the context, but also the local syntactic information."

        "We evaluate the per-word entropy for nouns, verbs, determiners, and prepositions.",
        "The results are given in Figure 3 (solid lines).",
        "The results indicate that entropy of the closed class words increases with sentence number, which presumably means that non-lexical effects (e.g. usage) are present.",

        "It has been shown by Kuhn and Mohri (1990) that lexical effects can be easily captured by caching.",
        "In its simplest form, caching involves keeping track of words occurring in the previous sentences and assigning for each word w a caching probability Pc(w) = C(w)(w), where",

        "More complex caching techniques are possible (Goodman, 2001), but are not necessary for this experiment.",
        "Thus, if lexical effects are present, we expect the model that uses caching to provide lower entropy estimates.",
        "The results are given in Figure 3 (dashed lines).",
        "We can see that caching gives a significant improvement for nouns and a small one for verbs, and gives no improvement for the closed-class parts of speech.",

        "We have proposed a fundamental principle of language generation, namely the entropy rate constancy principle.",

        "We have also examined the causes of this increase and shown that they are both lexical (primarily for open-class parts of speech) and non-lexical.",
        "These results are interesting in their own right, and may have practical implications as well.",
        "In particular, they suggest that language modeling may be a fruitful way to approach issues of contextual influence in text.",
        "Of course, to some degree language-modeling caching work has always recognized this, but this is rather a crude use of context and does not address the issues which one normally thinks of when talking about context.",
        "We have seen, however, that entropy measurements can pick up much more subtle influences, as evidenced by the results for determiners and prepositions where we see no caching influence at all, but nevertheless observe increasing entropy as a function of sentence number.",
        "This suggests that such measurements may be able to pick up more obviously semantic contextual influences than simply the repeating words captured by caching models.",
        "For example, sentences will differ in how much useful contextual information they carry.",
        "Are there useful generalizations to be made?",
        "E.g., might the previous sentence always be the most useful, or, perhaps, for newspaper articles, the first sentence?",
        "Can these measurements detect such already established contextual relations as the given-new distinction?",
        "What about other pragmatic relations?",
        "All of these deserve further study."
