        "Context plays an important role in many natural language tasks.",
        "For example, the accuracy of part of speech taggers or word sense disambiguation systems depends on the quality and quantity of contextual information these systems can extract from the training data.",
        "When predicting the sense of a word, for instance, the immediately preceding word is likely to be more important than the tenth previous word; similar observations can be made about POS taggers or chunkers.",
        "A crucial part of training these systems lies in extracting from the data high-quality contextual information, in the sense of defining contexts that are both accurate and correlated with the information (the POS tags, the word senses, the chunks) the system is trying to extract.",
        "The quality of contextual information is often determined by the size of the training corpus: with less data available, extracting context information for any given phenomenon becomes less reliable.",
        "However, corpus size is no longer a limiting factor: whereas up to now people have typically worked with corpora of around one million words, it has become feasible to build much larger document collections; for example, Banko and Brill (2001) report on experiments with a one billion word corpus.",
        "When using a much larger corpus and scaling the context space, there are, however, other trade-offs to take into consideration: the size of the corpus may make it unfeasible to train some systems because of efficiency issues or hardware costs; it may also result in an unmanageable expansion of the extracted context information, reducing the performance of the systems that have to make use of this information.",
        "This paper reports on experiments that try to establish some of the trade-offs between corpus size, processing time, hardware costs and the performance of the resulting systems.",
        "We report on experiments with a large corpus (around 300 million words).",
        "We trained a thesaurus extraction system with a range of context-extracting front-ends to demonstrate the interaction between context quality, extraction time and representation size."

        "Thesauri have traditionally been used in information retrieval tasks to expand words in queries with synonymous terms (e.g. Ruge, (1997)).",
        "More recently, semantic resources have also been used in collocation discovery (Pearce, 2001), smoothing and model estimation (Brown et al., 1992; Clark and Weir, 2001) and text classification (Baker and Mc-Callum, 1998).",
        "Unfortunately, thesauri are very expensive and time-consuming to produce manually, and tend to suffer from problems of bias, inconsistency, and lack of coverage.",
        "In addition, thesaurus compilers cannot keep up with constantly evolving language use and cannot afford to build new thesauri for the many subdomains that information extraction and retrieval systems are being developed for.",
        "There is a clear need for methods to extract thesauri automatically or tools that assist in the manual creation and updating of these semantic resources.",
        "Most existing work on thesaurus extraction and word clustering is based on the general observation that related terms will appear in similar contexts.",
        "The differences tend to lie in the way “context” is defined and in the way similarity is calculated.",
        "Most systems extract co-occurrence and syntactic information from the words surrounding the target term, which is then converted into a vector-space representation of the contexts that each target term appears in (Brown et al., 1992; Pereira et al., 1993; Ruge, 1997; Lin, 1998b).",
        "Other systems take the whole document as the context and consider term co-occurrence at the document level (Crouch, 1988; Sanderson and Croft, 1999).",
        "Once these contexts have been defined, these systems then use clustering or nearest neighbour methods to find similar terms.",
        "Finally, some systems extract synonyms directly without extracting and comparing contextual representations for each term.",
        "Instead, these systems recognise terms within certain linguistic patterns (e.g. X, Y and other Zs) which associate synonyms and hyponyms (Hearst, 1992; Caraballo, 1999).",
        "Thesaurus extraction is a good task to use to experiment with scaling context spaces.",
        "The vector-space model with nearest neighbour searching is simple, so we needn’t worry about interactions between the contexts we select and a learning algorithm (such as independence of the features).",
        "But also, thesaurus extraction is a task where success has been limited when using small corpora (Grefen-stette, 1994); corpora of the order of 300 million words have already been shown to be more successful at this task (Lin, 1998b)."

        "We define a context relation as a tuple (w, r, wW) where w is a thesaurus term, occurring in relation type r, with another word wW in the sentence.",
        "The type can be grammatical or the position of wW in a context window: the relation (dog, direct-obj, walk) indicates that the term dog, was the direct object of the verb walk.",
        "Often we treat the tuple (r, wW) as a single unit and refer to it as an attribute of w. The context extraction systems used for these experiments are described in the following section.",
        "The second step in thesaurus extraction performs clustering or nearest-neighbour analysis to determine which terms are similar based on their context vectors.",
        "Our second component is similar to Grefen-stette’s SEXTANT system, which performs nearest-neighbour calculations for each pair of potential thesaurus terms.",
        "For nearest-neighbour measurements we must define a function to judge the similarity between two context vectors (e.g. the cosine measure) and a function to combine the raw instance frequencies for each context relation into weighted vector components.",
        "SEXTANT uses a generalisation of the Jaccard measure to measure similarity.",
        "The Jaccard measure is the cardinality ratio of the intersection and union of attribute sets (atts(wn) is the attribute set for wn):",

        "where f(wi, aj) is the frequency of the relation and n(aj) is the number of different words aj appears in relations with.",
        "However, we have found that using the t-test between the joint and independent distributions of a word and its attribute:",

        "The first system is based on the syntactic relation extractor from SEXTANT with a different POS tagger and chunker.",
        "The SEXTANT-based extractor we developed uses a very simple Na¨ıve Bayes POS tagger and chunker.",

        "After the raw text has been POS tagged and chunked, the SEXTANT relation extraction algorithm is run over the text.",
        "This consists of five passes over each sentence that associate each noun with the modifiers and verbs from the syntactic contexts that it appears in.",
        "The second shallow parsing extractor we used was the CASS parser (Abney, 1996), which uses cascaded finite state transducers to produce a limited depth parse of POS tagged text.",
        "We used the output of the Na¨ıve Bayes POS tagger output as input to the CASS.",

        "one word to left or right one word to the left one or two words to the left one to three words to the left generality/specificity based on depth of the term in the Wordnet hierarchy; abstractness/concreteness based on even distribution across all Wordnet subtrees.",
        "Table 3 shows some of the selected terms with frequency and synonym set data.",
        "For each term we extracted a thesaurus entry with 200 potential synonyms and their weighted Jaccard scores.",
        "The most difficult aspect of thesaurus extraction is evaluating the quality of the result.",
        "The simplest method of evaluation is direct comparison of the extracted thesaurus with a manually created gold standard (Grefenstette, 1994).",
        "However on smaller corpora direct matching alone is often too coarse-grained and thesaurus coverage is a problem.",
        "Our experiments use a combination of three thesauri available in electronic form: The Macquarie Thesaurus (Bernard, 1990), Roget’s Thesaurus (Roget, 1911), and the Moby Thesaurus (Ward, 1996).",
        "Each thesaurus is structured differently: Roget’s and Macquarie are topic ordered and the Moby thesaurus is head term ordered.",
        "Roget’s is quite dated and has low coverage, and contains a deep hierarchy (depth up to seven) with terms grouped in 8696 small synonym sets at the leaves of the hierarchy.",
        "The Macquarie consists of 812 large topics (often in antonym related pairs), each of which is separated into 21174 small synonym sets.",
        "Roget’s and the Macquarie provide sense distinctions by placing terms in multiple synonym sets.",
        "The Moby thesaurus consists of 30259 head terms and large synonym lists which conflate all the head term senses.",
        "The extracted thesaurus does not distinguish between different head senses.",
        "Therefore, we convert the Roget’s and Macquarie thesaurus into head term ordered format by combining each small sense set that the head term appears in.",
        "We create a gold standard thesaurus containing the union of the synonym lists from each thesaurus, giving a total of 23207 synonyms for the 70 terms.",
        "With these gold standard resources in place, it is possible to use precision and recall measures to calculate the performance of the thesaurus extraction systems.",

        "Table 4 shows the improvement gained by morphological analysis of the attributes and relations for the SEXTANT 150M corpus.",
        "The improvement in results is quite significant, as is the reduction in the representation space and number of unique context relations.",
        "The reduction in the number of terms is a result of coalescing the plural nouns with their corresponding singular nouns, which also reduces data sparseness problems.",
        "The remainder of the results use morphological analysis of both the words and attributes.",
        "Table 5 summarises the average results of applying all of the extraction systems to the two 150M word corpora.",
        "The first thing to note is the time spent extracting contextual information: MINIPAR takes significantly longer to run than the other extractors.",
        "Secondly, SEXTANT and MINIPAR have quite similar results overall, but MINIPAR is slightly better across most measures.",
        "However, SEXTANT runs about 28 times faster than MINIPAR.",
        "Also, MINIPAR extracts many more terms and relations with a much larger representation than SEXTANT.",
        "This is partly because MINIPAR extracts more types of relations from the parse tree",
        "than SEXTANT, and partly because it extracts extra multi-word terms.",
        "Amongst the simpler methods, W(L1R1) and W(L1,2) give reasonable results.",
        "The larger windows with low correlation between the thesaurus term and context, extract a massive context representation but the results are about 10% worse than the syntactic extractors.",
        "Overall the precision and recall are relatively poor.",
        "Poor recall is partly due to the gold standard containing some plurals and multi-word terms which account for about 25% of the synonyms.",
        "These have been retained because the MINIPAR and CASS systems are capable of identifying (at least some) multi-word terms.",
        "Given a fixed time period (of more than the four days MINIPAR takes) and a fixed 150M corpus we would probably still choose to use MINIPAR unless the representation was too big for our learning algorithm, since the thesaurus quality is slightly better.",
        "Table 6 shows what happens to thesaurus quality as we decrease the size of the corpus to 164th of its original size (2.3M words) for SEXTANT.",
        "Halving the corpus results in a significant reduction for most of the measures.",
        "All five evaluation measures show the same log-linear dependence on the size of the corpus.",
        "Figure 1 shows the same trend for Inverse Rank evaluation of the MINIPAR thesaurus with a log-linear fitting the data points.",
        "We can use the same curve fitting to estimate the",
        "saurus quality on larger corpora for three of the best extractors: SEXTANT, MINIPAR and W(L1R1).",
        "Figure 2 does this with the direct match evaluation.",
        "The estimate indicates that MINIPAR will continue to be the best performer on direct matching.",
        "We then plot the direct match scores for the 300M word corpus to see how accurate our predictions are.",
        "The SEXTANT system performs almost exactly as predicted and the other two slightly under-perform their predicted scores, thus the fitting is accurate enough to make reasonable predictions.",
        "Figure 2 is a graph for making engineering decisions in conjunction with the data in Table 5.",
        "For instance, if we fix the total time and computational",
        "resources at an arbitrary point, e.g. the point where MINIPAR can process 75M words, we get a best direct match score of 23.5.",
        "However, we can get the same resultant accuracy by using SEXTANT on a corpus of 116M words or W(L1R1) on a corpus of 240M words.",
        "From Figure 5, extracting contexts from corpora of these sizes would take MINIPAR 37 hours, SEXTANT 2 hours and W(L1R1) 12 minutes.",
        "Interpolation on Figure 3 predicts that the extraction would result in 10M unique relations from MINIPAR and SEXTANT and 19M from W(L1R1).",
        "Figure 4 indicates that extraction would result in 550k MINIPAR terms, 200k SEXTANT terms and 600k W(L1R1) terms.",
        "Given these values and the fact that the time complexity of most thesaurus extraction algorithms is at least linear in the number of unique relations and squared in the number of thesaurus terms, it seems SEXTANT may represent the best solution.",
        "With these size issues in mind, we finally consider some methods to limit the size of the context representation.",
        "Table 7 shows the results of performing various kinds of filtering on the representation size.",
        "The FIXED and LEXICON filters run over the",
        "full 300M word corpus, but have size limits based on the 150M word corpus.",

        "The > 1 and > 2 filters prune relations with a frequency of less than or equal to one or two.",
        "The FIXED and LEXICON filters show that counting over larger corpora does produce marginally better results.",
        "The > 1 and > 2 filters show that the many relations that occur infrequently do not contribute significantly to the vector comparisons and hence don’t impact on the final results, even though they dramatically increase the representation size."

        "It is a phenomenon common to many NLP tasks that the quality or accuracy of a system increases log-linearly with the size of the corpus.",
        "Banko and Brill, (2001) also found this trend for the task of confusion set disambiguation on corpora of up to one billion words.",
        "They demonstrated behaviour of different learning algorithms with very simple contexts on extremely large corpora.",
        "We have demonstrated the behaviour of a simple learning algorithm on much more complicated contextual information on very large corpora.",
        "Our experiments suggest that the existing methodology of evaluating systems on small corpora without reference to the execution time and representation size ignores important aspects of the evaluation of NLP tools.",
        "These experiments show that efficiently implementing and optimising the NLP tools used for context extraction is of crucial importance since the increased corpus sizes make execution speed an important evaluation factor when deciding between different learning algorithms for different tasks and corpora.",
        "These results also motivate further research into improving the asymptotic complexity of the learning algorithms used in NLP systems.",
        "In the new paradigm, it could well be that far simpler but scalable learning algorithms significantly outperform existing systems.",
        "Finally, the mass availability of online text resources should be taken on board.",
        "It is important that language engineers and computational linguists continue to try and find new unsupervised or (as Banko and Brill suggest) semi-supervised methods for tasks which currently rely on annotated data.",
        "It is also important to consider how information extracted by systems such as thesaurus extraction systems can be incorporated into tasks which use predominantly supervised techniques, e.g. in the form of class information for smoothing.",
        "We would like to extend this analysis to at least one billion words for at least the most successful methods and try other tools and parsers for extracting the contextual information.",
        "However, to do this we must look at methods of compressing the vector-space model and approximating the full pairwise comparison of thesaurus terms.",
        "We would also like to investigate how this thesaurus information can be used to improve the accuracy or generality of other NLP tasks."
