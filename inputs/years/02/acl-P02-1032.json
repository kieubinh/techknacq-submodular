        "An important step towards being able to interpret such technical sentences is to analyze the meaning of noun compounds, and noun phrases more generally.",
        "*With apologies to Charles Darwin.",
        "Interpretation of noun compounds (NCs) is highly dependent on lexical information.",
        "Thus we explore the use of a large corpus (Medline) and a large lexical hierarchy (MeSH, Medical Subject Headings) to determine the relations that hold between the words in noun compounds.",
        "Surprisingly, we find that we can simply use the juxtaposition of category membership within the lexical hierarchy to determine the relation that holds between pairs of nouns.",
        "For example, for the NCs leg paresis, skin numbness, and hip pain, the first word of the NC falls into the MeSH A01 (Body Regions) category, and the second word falls into the C10 (Nervous System Diseases) category.",
        "From these we can declare that the relation that holds between the words is “located in”.",
        "Similarly, for influenza patients and aids survivors, the first word falls under C02 (Virus Diseases) and the second is found in M01.643 (Patients), yielding the “afflicted by” relation.",
        "Using this technique on a subpart of the category space, we obtain 90% accuracy overall.",
        "In some sense, this is a very old idea, dating back to the early days of semantic nets and semantic grammars.",
        "The critical difference now is that large lexical resources and corpora have become available, thus allowing some of those old techniques to become feasible in terms of coverage.",
        "However, the success of such an approach depends on the structure and coverage of the underlying lexical ontology.",
        "In the following sections we discuss the linguistic motivations behind this approach, the characteristics of the lexical ontology MeSH, the use of a corpus to examine the problem space, the method of determining the relations, the accuracy of the results, and the problem of ambiguity.",

        "One way to understand the relations between the words in a two-word noun compound is to cast the words into a head-modifier relationship, and assume that the head noun has an argument structure, much the way verbs do, as well as a qualia structure in the sense of Pustejovsky (1995).",
        "Then the meaning of the head noun determines what kinds of things can be done to it, what it is made of, what it is a part of, and so on.",
        "For example, consider the noun knife.",
        "Knives are created for particular activities or settings, can be made of various materials, and can be used for cutting or manipulating various kinds of things.",
        "A set of relations for knives, and example NCs exhibiting these relations is shown below: (Used-in): kitchen knife, hunting knife (Made-of): steel knife, plastic knife (Instrument-for): carving knife (Used-on): meat knife, putty knife (Used-by): chef’s knife, butcher’s knife Some relationships apply to only certain classes of nouns; the semantic structure of the head noun determines the range of possibilities.",
        "Thus if we can capture regularities about the behaviors of the constituent nouns, we should also be able to predict which relations will hold between them.",
        "We propose using the categorization provided by a lexical hierarchy for this purpose.",
        "Using a large collection of noun compounds, we assign semantic descriptors from the lexical hierarchy to the constituent nouns and determine the relations between them.",

        "Note that, in this analysis we focused on determining which sets ofNCs fall into the same relation, without explicitly assigning names to the relations themselves.",
        "Furthermore, the same relation may be described by many different category pairs (see Section 5.5).",
        "First, we extracted two-word noun compounds from approximately 1M titles and abstracts from the Medline collection of biomedical journal articles, resulting",
        "in about 1M NCs.",
        "The NCs were extracted by finding adjacent word pairs in which both words are tagged as nouns by a tagger and appear in the MeSH hierarchy, and the words preceding and following the pair do not appear in MeSH2 Of these two-word noun compounds, 79,677 were unique.",
        "Next we used MeSH to characterize the NCs according to semantic category(ies).",

        "Note that the same words can be represented at different levels of description.",
        "For example, fibroblast growth can be described by the MeSH descriptors A1 1.329.228 G07.553.481 (original level), but also by A1 1 G07 (Cell and Physiological Processes) or A1 1.329 G07.553 (Connective Tissue Cells and Growth and Embryonic Development).",

        "A visualization tool (Ahlberg and Shneiderman, 1994) allowed us to explore the dataset to see which areas of the category space are most heavily populated, and to get a feeling for whether the distribution is uniform or not (see Figure 1).",

        "If, on the other hand, several different paraphrases were found, then the analysis descended one level of the hierarchy.",
        "This repeated until the resulting partition of the NCs resulted in uniform relation assignments.",

        "On the other hand, the following NCs, having the CP A01 (Body Regions) and M01 (Persons), do not have the same relationship between the component words: abdomen patients, arm amputees, chest physicians, eye patients, skin donor.",
        "The relationships are different depending on whether the person is a patient, a physician or a donor.",
        "We therefore descend the M01 sub-hierarchy, obtaining the following clusters of NCs: A01 M01.643 (Patients): abdomen patients, ankle inpatient, eye outpatient",

        "The results were as follows.",
        "For 187 of 250 (74%) CPs with a noun in the Anatomy category, the classification remained at level 0 for both words (for example, A01 A07).",
        "For 55 (22%) of the CPs we had to descend 1 level (e.g., A01 M01: A01 M01.898, A01 M01.643) and for 7 CPs (2%) we descended two levels.",
        "We descended one level most of the time for the sub-hierarchies E (Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Techniques), G (Biological Sciences) and N (Health Care) (around 50% of the time for these categories combined).",
        "We never descended for B (Organisms) and did so only for A13 (Animal Structures) in A.",

        "We have provided evidence that the upper levels of a lexical hierarchy can be used to accurately classify the relations that hold between two-word technical noun compounds.",
        "In this paper we focus on biomedical terms using the biomedical lexical ontology MeSH.",
        "It may be that such technical, domain-specific terminology is better behaved than NCs drawn from more general text; we will have to assess the technique in other domains to fully assess its applicability.",
        "Several issues need to be explored further.",
        "First, we need to ensure that this technique works across the full spectrum of the lexical hierarchy.",
        "We have demonstrated the likely usefulness of such an exercise, but all of our analysis was done by hand.",
        "It may be useful enough to simply complete the job manually; however, it would be preferable to automate some or all of the analysis.",
        "There are several ways to go about this.",
        "One approach would be to use existing statistical similarity measures (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2001) to attempt to identify which subhierar-chies are homogeneous.",
        "Another approach would be to see if, after analyzing more CPs, those categories found to be heterogeneous should be assumed to be heterogeneous across classifications, and similarly for those that seem to be homogeneous.",
        "The second major issue to address is how to extend the technique to multi-word noun compounds.",
        "We will need to distinguish between NCs such as acute migraine treatment and oral migraine treatment, and handle the case when the relation must first be found between the leftmost words.",
        "Thus additional steps will be needed; one approach is to compute statistics to indicate likelihood of the various CPs.",
        "Finding noun compound relations is part of our larger effort to investigate what we call statistical semantic parsing (as in (Burton and Brown, 1979); see Grishman (1986) for a nice overview).",
        "For example, we would like to be able to interpret titles in terms of semantic relations, for example, transforming Congenital anomalies of tra-cheobronchial branching patterns into a form that allows questions to be answered such as “What kinds of irregularities can occur in lung structure?” We hope that by compositional application of relations to entities, such inferences will be possible.",
