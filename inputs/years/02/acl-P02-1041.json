        "The λ-calculus has enjoyed many years as the standard semantic encoding for categorial grammars and other grammatical frameworks, but recent work has highlighted its inadequacies for both linguistic and computational concerns of representing natural language semantics (Copestake et al., 1999; Kruijff, 2001).",
        "The latter couples a resource-sensitive cate-gorial proof theory (Moortgat, 1997) to hybrid logic (Blackburn, 2000) to formalize a dependency-based perspective on meaning, which we call here Hybrid Logic Dependency Semantics (HLDS).",

        "Traditionally, categorial grammar has captured meaning using a (simply typed) λ-calculus, building semantic structure in parallel to the categorial inference (Morrill, 1994; Moortgat, 1997; Steedman, 2000b).",
        "For example, a (simplified) CCG lexical entry for a verb such as wrote is given in (1).",
        "(1) wrote �- (s\\n)/n : λx.λy.write(y,x) Rules of combination are defined to operate on both categories and λ-terms simultaneously.",
        "For example, the rules allow the following derivation for Ed wrote books.",
        "(2) Ed wrote books",
        "Derivations like (2) give rise to the usual sort of predicate-argument structure whereby the order in which the arguments appear (and are bound by the λ’s) is essentially constitutive of their meaning.",
        "Thus, the first argument could be taken to correspond to the writer, whereas the second argument corresponds to what is being written.",
        "One deficiency of λ-calculus meaning representations is that they usually have to be type-raised to the worst case to fully model quantification, and this can reverberate and increase the complexity of syntactic categories since a verb like wrote will need to be able to take arguments with the types of generalized quantifiers.",
        "The approach we advocate in this paper does not suffer from this problem.",
        "For CCG, the use of the λ-terms is simply a convenient device to bind arguments when presenting derivations (Steedman, 2000b).",
        "In implementations, a more common strategy is to compute semantic representations via unification, a tactic explicitly employed in Unification Categorial Grammar (UCG) (Zeevat, 1988).",
        "Using a unification paradigm in which atomic categories are bundles of syntactic and semantic information, we can use an entry such as (3) for wrote in place of (1).",

        "For creating predicate-argument structures of this kind, strategies using either λ-terms or unification to bind arguments are essentially notational variants.",
        "However, UCG goes beyond simple predicate-argument structures to instead use a semantic representation language called Indexed Language (InL).",
        "The idea of using indexes stems from Davidson (event variables), and are a commonly used mechanism in unification-based frameworks and theories for discourse representation.",
        "InL attaches one to every formula representing its discourse referent.",

        "InL thus flattens logical forms to some extent, using the indexes to spread a given entity or event through multiple predications.",
        "The use of indexes is crucial for UCG’s account of modifiers, and as we will see later, we exploit such referents to achieve similar ends when coupling HLDS and CCG.",
        "Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) (Copestake et al., 1999; Copestake et al., 2001) is a framework for computational semantics that is designed to simplify the work of algorithms which produce or use semantic representations.",
        "MRS provides the means to represent interpretations with a flat, underspecified semantics using terms of the predicate calculus and generalized quantifiers.",
        "Flattening is achieved by using an indexation scheme involving labels that tag particular groups of elementary predications (EPs) and handles (here, h1, h2, ...) that reference those EPs.",
        "Underspecification is achieved by using unresolved handles as the arguments for scope-bearing elements and declaring constraints (with the =-q operator) on how those handles can be resolved.",
        "Different scopes can be reconstructed by equating unresolved handles with the labels of the other EPs obeying the =-q constraints.",

        "Copestake et al.",
        "argue that these flat representations facilitate a number of computational tasks, including machine translation and generation, without sacrificing linguistic expressivity.",

        "Terms of HLDS can thus be marshalled into terms of these other representations with the potential of taking advantage of tools developed for them or providing input to modules expecting them.",
        "In future work, we intend to combine techniques for building wide-coverage statistical parsers for CCG (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002; Clark et al., 2002) with corpora that have explicitly marked semantic dependency relations (such as the Prague Dependency Treebank and NEGRA) to produce HLDS terms as the parse output."
