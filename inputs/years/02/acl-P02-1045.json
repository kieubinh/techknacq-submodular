        "Supervised machine learning algorithms were used for pronoun resolution with good results (Ge et al., 1998), and for definite NPs with fairly good results (Aone and Bennett, 1995; McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995; Soon et al., 2001).",
        "However, the deficiency of supervised machine learning approaches is the need for an unknown amount of annotated training data for optimal performance.",
        "So, researchers in NLP began to experiment with weakly supervised machine learning algorithms such as Co-Training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998).",
        "Among others Co-Training was applied to document classification (Blum and Mitchell, 1998), named-entity recognition (Collins and Singer, 1999), noun phrase bracketing (Pierce and Cardie, 2001), and statistical parsing (Sarkar, 2001).",

        "Unsupervised learning might be an alternative, since it does not need any annotation at all.",
        "However, the cost is the decrease in performance to about 53% F-measure on the same data (Cardie and Wagstaff, 1999) which may be unsuitable for a lot of tasks.",
        "In this paper we tried to pioneer a path between the unsupervised and the supervised paradigm by using the Co-Training meta-learning algorithm.",

        "On the other hand, the definition of the feature views is non-trivial for the task of training a reference resolution classifier, where no obvious or natural feature split suggests itself.",
        "In practical terms, therefore, this could outweigh the advantage of annota",
        "tion work saved.",
