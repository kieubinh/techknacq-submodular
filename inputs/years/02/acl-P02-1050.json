        "Informed by the insights of this work, recent statistical machine translation (MT) models have become linguistically richer in their representation of monolingual relationships than their predecessors ((Wu, 1995; Alshawi et al., 2000; Yamada and Knight, 2001); cf. (Brown et al., 1990; Brown et al., 1993)).",
        "Using richer monolingual representations in statistical MT raises the challenge of how to characterize the cross-language relationship between two sets of monolingual syntactic relations.",
        "In this paper, we investigate a characterization that often appears implicitly as a part of newer statistical MT models, which we term the direct correspondence assumption (DC-4).",
        "Intuitively, the assumption is that for two sentences in parallel translation, the syntactic relationships in one language directly map to the syntactic relationships in the other.",
        "Since it has not been described explicitly, the validity and utility of the DCA are not well understood although, without identifying the DCA as such, other translation researchers have nonetheless found themselves working around its limitations.)",
        "In Section 2 we show how the DCA appears implicitly in several models, providing an explicit formal statement, and we discuss its potential inadequacies.",
        "In Section 3, we provide a way to assess empirically the extent to which the DCA holds true.",
        "Our results suggest that although the DCA is too restrictive in many cases, a general set of principled, elementary linguistic transformations can often resolve the problem.",
        "'For example, Yamada and Knight (2001) account for non-DCA-respecting variation by learning construction specific local transformations on constituency trees.",
        "There also exists a substantial literature in transfer-based MT on learning mapping patterns for syntactic relationships that do not correspond (e.g., (Menezes and Richardson, 2001; Lavoie et al., 2001) ).",

        "are largely preserved across the alignment, as illustrated in Table 1.",
        "Moreover, the DCA makes possible more elegant formalisms (e.g. SITG) and more efficient algorithms.",
        "It may allow us to use the syntactic analysis for one language to infer annotations for the corresponding sentence in another language, helping to reduce the labor and expense of creating treebanks in new languages (Cabezas et al., 2001; Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001.",

        "The implication of this work for statistical translation modeling is that a little bit of knowledge can be a good thing.",
        "The approach described here strikes a balance somewhere between the endless construction-by-construction tuning of rule-based approaches, on the one hand, and, on the other, the development of insufficiently constrained stochastic models.",
        "We have systematically diagnosed a common assumption that has been dealt with previously on a case by case basis, but not named.",
        "Most of the models we know of from early work at IBM to second-generation models such as that of Knight and Yamada rectify glaring problems caused by the failure of the DCA using a range of pre or post-processing techniques.",

        "In addition to resolving the remaining problematic cases for our projection framework, we are exploring ways to automatically create large quantities of syntactically annotated data.",
        "This will break the bottleneck in developing appropriately annotated training corpora.",
        "Currently, we are following two research directions.",
        "Our first goal is to minimize the degree of degradation in the quality of the projected trees when the input analyses and word alignments are automatically generated by a statistical parser and word alignment model.",
        "To improve the quality of the input analyses, we are adapting active learning and co-training techniques (Hwa, 2000; Sarkar, 2001) to exploit the most reliable data.",
        "We are also actively developing an alternative alignment model that makes more use of the syntactic structure (Lopez et al., 2002).",
        "Our second goal is to detect and reduce the noise in the projected trees so that they might replace the expensive human-annotated corpora as training examples for statistical parsers.",
