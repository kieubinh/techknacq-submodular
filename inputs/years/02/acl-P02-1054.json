        "Several systems apply answer validation techniques with the goal of filtering out improper candidates by checking how adequate a candidate answer is with respect to a given question.",
        "These approaches rely on discovering semantic relations between the question and the answer.",
        "As an example, (Harabagiu and Maiorano, 1999) describes answer validation as an abductive inference process, where an answer is valid with respect to a question if an explanation for it, based on background knowledge, can be found.",
        "Although theoretically well motivated, the use of semantic techniques on open domain tasks is quite expensive both in terms of the involved linguistic resources and in terms of computational complexity, thus motivating a research on alternative solutions to the problem.",

        "The hypothesis is that the number of documents that can be retrieved from the Web in which the question and the answer co-occur can be considered a significant clue of the validity of the answer.",
        "Documents are searched in the Web by means of validation patterns, which are derived from a linguistic processing of the question and the answer.",
        "In order to test this idea a system for automatic answer validation has been implemented and a number of experiments have been carried out on questions and answers provided by the TREC-2001 participants.",

        "Given a question q and a candidate answer a. the answer validation task is defined as the capability to assess the relevance of a. with respect to q.",
        "We assume open domain questions and that both answers and questions are texts composed of few tokens (usually less than 100).",
        "This is compatible with the TREC2001 data, that will be used as examples throughout this paper.",
        "We also assume the availability of the Web, considered to be the largest open domain text corpus containing information about almost all the different areas of the human knowledge.",
        "The intuition underlying our approach to answer validation is that, given a question-answer pair ([q,a.",
        "]), it is possible to formulate a set of validation statements whose truthfulness is equivalent to the degree of relevance of a. with respect to q.",
        "For instance, given the question “What is the capital of the USA?”, the problem of validating the answer “Washington” is equivalent to estimating the truthfulness of the validation statement “The capital of the USA is Washington”.",
        "Therefore, the answer validation task could be reformulated as a problem of statement reliability.",
        "There are two issues to be addressed in order to make this intuition effective.",
        "First, the idea of a validation statement is still insufficient to catch the richness of implicit knowledge that may connect an answer to a question: we will attack this problem defining the more flexible idea of a validation pattern.",
        "Second, we have to design an effective and efficient way to check the reliability of a validation pattern: our solution relies on a procedure based on a statistical count of Web searches.",
        "Answers may occur in text passages with low similarity with respect to the question.",
        "Passages telling facts may use different syntactic constructions, sometimes are spread in more than one sentence, may reflect opinions and personal attitudes, and often use ellipsis and anaphora.",
        "For instance, if the validation statement is “The capital of USA is Washington”, we have Web documents containing passages like those reported in Table 1, which can not be found with a simple search of the statement, but that nevertheless contain a significant amount of knowledge about the relations between the question and the answer.",
        "We will refer to these text fragments as validation fragments.",

        "A common feature in the above examples is the co-occurrence of a certain subset of words (i.e. “capital”,“USA” and “Washington”).",
        "We will make use of validation patterns that cover a larger portion of text fragments, including those lexically similar to the question and the answer (e.g. fragments 4 and 5 in Table 1) and also those that are not similar (e.g. fragment 2 in Table 1).",
        "In the case of our example a set of validation statements can be generalized by the validation pattern: [capital <text> USA <text> Washington] where <text> is a place holder for any portion of text with a fixed maximal length.",
        "To check the correctness of a. with respect to q we propose a procedure that measures the number of occurrences on the Web of a validation pattern derived from a. and q.",
        "A useful feature of such patterns is that when we search for them on the Web they usually produce many hits, thus making statistical approaches applicable.",
        "In contrast, searching for strict validation statements generally results in a small number of documents (if any) and makes statistical methods irrelevant.",
        "A number of techniques used for finding collocations and co-occurrences of words, such as mutual information, may well be used to search co-occurrence tendency between the question and the candidate answer in the Web.",
        "If we verify that such tendency is statistically significant we may consider the validation pattern as consistent and therefore we may assume a high level of correlation between the question and the candidate answer.",

        "An Asp is constructed in two steps.",
        "First, the answer type of the question is identified considering both morpho-syntactic (a part of speech tagger is used to process the question) and semantic features (by means of semantic predicates defined on the WordNet taxonomy; see (Magnini et al., 2001) for details).",
        "Possible answer types are: DATE, MEASURE, PERSON, LOCATION, ORGANIZATION, DEFINITION and GENERIC.",
        "DEFINITION is the answer type peculiar to questions like “What is an atom?” which represent a considerable part (around 25%) of the TREC-2001 corpus.",
        "The answer type GENERIC is used for non definition questions asking for entities that can not be classified as named entities (e.g. the questions: “Material called linen is made from what plant?” or “What mineral helps prevent osteoporosis?”) In the second step, a rule-based named entities recognition module identifies in the answer string all the named entities matching the answer type category.",
        "If the category corresponds to a named entity, an Asp for each selected named entity is created.",
        "If the answer type category is either DEFINITION or GENERIC, the entire answer string except the stop-words is considered.",
        "In addition, in order to maximize the recall of retrieved documents, the Asp is expanded with verb tenses.",
        "The following example shows how the Asp is created.",
        "Given the TREC question “When did Elvis Presley die?” and the candidate answer “though died in 1977 of course some fans maintain”, since the answer type category is DATE the named entities recognition module will select [ 1977] as an answer sub-pattern."
