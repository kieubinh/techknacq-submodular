        "Since the emergence of shallow techniques and the proof of their utility, the focus has been to exploit these technologies to the maximum, often ignoring certain complex issues, e.g. those which are typically well handled by deep NLP systems.",
        "Up to now, deep natural language processing (DNLP) has not played a significant role in the area of industrial NLP applications, since this technology often suffers from insufficient robustness and throughput, when confronted with large quantities of unrestricted text.",

        "In fact, (Appelt and Israel, 1997) have shown that the current IE technology seems to have an upper performance level of less than 60% in such cases.",
        "It seems reasonable to assume that if a more accurate analysis of structural linguistic relationships could be provided (e.g., grammatical functions, referential relationships), this barrier might be overcome.",

        "Owing to the fact that deep and shallow technologies are complementary in nature, integration is a non-trivial task: while SNLP shows its strength in the areas of efficiency and robustness, these aspects are problematic for DNLP systems.",
        "On the other hand, DNLP can deliver highly precise and fine-grained linguistic analyses.",
        "The challenge for integration is to combine these two paradigms according to their virtues.",
        "Probably the most straightforward way to integrate the two is an architecture in which shallow and deep components run in parallel, using the results of DNLP, whenever available.",
        "While this kind of approach is certainly feasible for a real-time application such as Verbmobil, it is not ideal for processing large quantities of text: due to the difference in processing speed, shallow and deep NLP soon run out of sync.",
        "To compensate, one can imagine two possible remedies: either to optimize for precision, or for speed.",
        "The drawback of the former strategy is that the overall speed will equal the speed of the slowest component, whereas in case of the latter, DNLP will almost always time out, such that overall precision will hardly be distinguishable from a shallow-only system.",
        "What is thus called for is an integrated, flexible architecture where components can play at their strengths.",
        "Partial analyses from SNLP can be used to identify relevant candidates for the focussed use of DNLP, based on task or domain-specific criteria.",
        "Furthermore, such an integrated approach opens up the possibility to address the issue of robustness by using shallow analyses (e.g., term recognition) to increase the coverage of the deep parser, thereby avoiding a duplication of efforts.",

        "New components can be integrated by implementing this interface and specifying DTDs and/or transformation rules for the chart.",

        "Similarily, general methods support navigating the type system and feature structures of the DNLP components.",
        "The resulting output of the WHAM can be accessed via the OOP interface or as XML markup.",
