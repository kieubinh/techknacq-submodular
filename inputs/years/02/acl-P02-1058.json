        "If even the human-made summaries score only 2.74 out of 4, it is unclear what this category means, or how the assessors arrived at these scores.",
        "However, the humans and baseline 1 (lead baseline) did score in the upper range of 2 to 3 and all others had scores lower than 2.5.",
        "Some of the systems (including B2) fell into the range of 1 to 2 meaning some or hardly any cohesion.",
        "The lead baseline (B 1), taking the first 50, 100, 200, 400 words from the last document of a topic, did well.",
        "On the contrary, the coverage baseline (B2) did poorly.",
        "This indicates the difficulty of fitting sentences from different documents together.",
        "Even selecting continuous sentences from the same document (B1) seems not to work well.",
        "We need to define this metric more clearly and improve the capabilities of systems in this respect.",
        "(3) Coherence scores roughly track cohesion scores.",
        "Most systems did better in coherence than in cohesion.",
        "The human is the only one scoring above 3.",
        "Again the room for improvement is abundant.",
        "(4) NeATS did not fare badly in quality",
        "measures.",
        "It was in the same categories as other top performers: grammaticality is between most and all, cohesion, some and most, and coherence, some and most.",
        "This indicates the strategies employed by NeATS (stigma word filtering, adding lead sentence, and time annotation) worked to some extent but left room for improvement."

        "We described a multi-document summarization system, NeATS, and its evaluation in DUC-2001.",
        "We were encouraged by the content and readability of the results.",
        "As a prototype system, NeATS deliberately used simple methods guided by a few principles:",
        "• Extracting important concepts based on reliable statistics.",
        "• Filtering sentences by their positions and stigma words.",
        "• Reducing redundancy using MMR.",
        "• Presenting summary sentences in their chronological order with time annotations.",
        "These simple principles worked effectively.",
        "However, the simplicity of the system also lends itself to further improvements.",
        "We would like to apply some compression techniques or use linguistic units smaller than sentences to improve our retention score.",
        "The fact that NeATS performed as well as the human in pseudo precision but did less well in retention indicates its summaries might include good but duplicated information.",
        "Working with sub-sentence units should help.",
        "To improve NeATS’s capability in content selection, we have started to parse sentences containing key unigram, bigram, and trigram concepts to identify their relations within their concept clusters.",
        "To enhance cohesion and coherence, we are looking into incorporating discourse processing techniques (Marcu 1999) or Radev and McKeown’s (1998) summary operators.",
        "We are analyzing the DUC evaluation scores in the hope of suggesting improved and more stable metrics."
