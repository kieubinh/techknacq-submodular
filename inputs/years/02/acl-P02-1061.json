        "Upper case NERs do not have case information to help them to distinguish named entities from non-named entities.",
        "When data is sparse, many named entities in the test data would be unknown words.",
        "This makes upper case named entity recognition more difficult than mixed case.",
        "Even a human would experience greater difficulty in annotating upper case text than mixed case text (Figure 1).",
        "We propose using a mixed case NER to “teach” an upper case NER, by making use of unlabeled mixed case text.",
        "With the abundance of mixed case unlabeled texts available in so many corpora and on the Internet, it will be easy to apply our approach to improve the performance of NER on upper case text.",
        "Our approach does not satisfy the usual assumptions of co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998).",
        "Intuitively, however, one would expect some information to be gained from mixed case unlabeled text, where case information is helpful in pointing out new words that could be named entities.",
        "We show empirically that such an approach can indeed improve the performance of an upper case NER.",

        "Considerable amount of work has been done in recent years on NERs, partly due to the Message Understanding Conferences (MUC-6, 1995; MUC-7, 1998).",
        "Machine learning methods such as BBN’s IdentiFinder (Bikel, Schwartz, and Weischedel, 1999) and Borthwick’s MENE (Borthwick, 1999) have shown that machine learning NERs can achieve comparable performance with systems using hand-coded rules.",
        "Bikel, Schwartz, and Weischedel (1999) have also shown how mixed case text can be automatically converted to upper case SNOR or OCR format to train NERs to work on such formats.",
        "There is also some work on unsupervised learning for mixed case named entity recognition (Collins and Singer, 1999; Cucerzan and Yarowsky, 1999).",
        "Collins and Singer (1999) investigated named entity classification using Ad-aboost, CoBoost, and the EM algorithm.",
        "However, features were extracted using a parser, and performance was evaluated differently (the classes were person, organization, location, and noise).",
        "Cucerzan and Yarowsky (1999) built a cross language NER, and the performance on English was low compared to supervised single-language NER such as IdentiFinder.",
        "We suspect that it will be hard for purely unsupervised methods to perform as well as supervised ones.",
        "Seeger (2001) gave a comprehensive summary of recent work in learning with labeled and unlabeled data.",
        "There is much recent research on co-training, such as (Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Collins and Singer, 1999; Pierce and Cardie, 2001).",
        "Most co-training methods involve using two classifiers built on different sets of features.",
        "Instead of using distinct sets of features, Goldman and Zhou (2000) used different classification algorithms to do co-training.",
        "Blum and Mitchell (1998) showed that in order for PAC-like guarantees to hold for co-training, features should be divided into two disjoint sets satisfying: (1) each set is sufficient for a classifier to learn a concept correctly; and (2) the two sets are conditionally independent of each other.",
        "Each set of features can be used to build a classifier, resulting in two independent classifiers, A and B. Classifications by A on unlabeled data can then be used to further train classifier B, and vice versa.",
        "Intuitively, the independence assumption is there so that the classifications of A would be informative to B.",
        "When the independence assumption is violated, the decisions of A may not be informative to B.",
        "In this case, the positive effect of having more data may be offset by the negative effect of introducing noise into the data (classifier A might not be always correct).",
        "Nigam and Ghani (2000) investigated the difference in performance with and without a feature split, and showed that co-training with a feature split gives better performance.",
        "However, the comparison they made is between co-training and self-training.",
        "In self-training, only one classifier is used to tag unlabeled data, after which the more confidently tagged data is reused to train the same classifier.",
        "Many natural language processing problems do not show the natural feature split displayed by the web page classification task studied in previous co-training work.",
        "Our work does not really fall under the paradigm of co-training.",
        "Instead of cooperation between two classifiers, we used a stronger classifier to teach a weaker one.",
        "In addition, it exhibits the following differences: (1) the features are not at all independent (upper case features can be seen as a subset of the mixed case features); and (2) The additional features available to the mixed case system will never be available to the upper case system.",
        "Co-training often involves combining the two different sets of features to obtain a final system that outperforms either system alone.",
        "In our context, however, the upper case system will never have access to some of the case-based features available to the mixed case system.",
        "Due to the above reason, it is unreasonable to expect the performance of the upper case NER to match that of the mixed case NER.",
        "However, we still manage to achieve a considerable reduction of errors between the two NERs when they are tested on the official MUC-6 and MUC-7 test data."
