        "Recent work in statistical approaches to parsing and tagging has begun to consider methods which incorporate global features of candidate structures.",
        "Examples of such techniques are Markov Random Fields (Abney 1997; Della Pietra et al.",
        "1997; Johnson et al.",
        "1999), and boosting algorithms (Freund et al.",
        "1998; Collins 2000; Walker et al.",
        "2001).",
        "One appeal of these methods is their flexibility in incorporating features into a model: essentially any features which might be useful in discriminating good from bad structures can be included.",
        "A second appeal of these methods is that their training criterion is often discriminative, attempting to explicitly push the score or probability of the correct structure for each training sentence above the score of competing structures.",
        "This discriminative property is shared by the methods of (Johnson et al.",
        "1999; Collins 2000), and also the Conditional Random Field methods of (Lafferty et al.",
        "2001).",
        "In a previous paper (Collins 2000), a boosting algorithm was used to rerank the output from an existing statistical parser, giving significant improvements in parsing accuracy on Wall Street Journal data.",
        "Similar boosting algorithms have been applied to natural language generation, with good results, in (Walker et al.",
        "2001).",
        "In this paper we apply rerank-ing methods to named-entity extraction.",
        "A state-of-the-art (maximum-entropy) tagger is used to generate 20 possible segmentations for each input sentence, along with their probabilities.",
        "We describe a number of additional global features of these candidate segmentations.",
        "These additional features are used as evidence in reranking the hypotheses from the max-ent tagger.",
        "We describe two learning algorithms: the boosting method of (Collins 2000), and a variant of the voted perceptron algorithm, which was initially described in (Freund & Schapire 1999).",
        "We applied the methods to a corpus of over one million words of tagged web data.",
        "The methods give significant improvements over the maximum-entropy tagger (a 17.7% relative reduction in error-rate for the voted perceptron, and a 15.6% relative improvement for the boosting method).",
        "One contribution of this paper is to show that existing reranking methods are useful for a new domain, named-entity tagging, and to suggest global features which give improvements on this task.",
        "We should stress that another contribution is to show that a new algorithm, the voted perceptron, gives very credible results on a natural language task.",
        "It is an extremely simple algorithm to implement, and is very fast to train (the testing phase is slower, but by no means sluggish).",
        "It should be a viable alternative to methods such as the boosting or Markov Random Field algorithms described in previous work."

        "The two methods were trained on the training portion (41,992 sentences) of the training set.",
        "We used the development set to pick the best values for tunable parameters in each algorithm.",
        "For boosting, the main parameter to pick is the number of rounds, N. We ran the algorithm for a total of 300,000 rounds, and found that the optimal value for F-measure on the development set occurred after 83,233 rounds.",
        "For the voted perceptron, the representation h(x) was taken to be a vector f �L(x), hl (x) ... h,,,,(x)I where � is a parameter that influences the relative contribution of the log-likelihood term versus the other features.",
        "A value of � = 0.5 was found to give the best results on the development set.",
        "Figure 5 shows the results for the three methods on the test set.",
        "Both of the reranking algorithms show significant improvements over the baseline: a 15.6% relative reduction in error for boosting, and a 17.7% relative error reduction for the voted perceptron.",
        "In our experiments we found the voted perceptron algorithm to be considerably more efficient in training, at some cost in computation on test examples.",
        "Another attractive property of the voted perceptron is that it can be used with kernels, for example the kernels over parse trees described in (Collins and Duffy 2001; Collins and Duffy 2002).",
