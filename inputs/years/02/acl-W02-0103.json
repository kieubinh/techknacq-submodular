        "Feature structures have been used prolifically at every level of linguistic theory, and they form the mathematical foundation of our most comprehensive and rigorous schools of syntactic theory, including Lexical-Functional Grammar and Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar.",
        "This data structure is popular because it shares many properties with the first-order terms of classical logic, and in addition provides named access to substructures through paths of features.",
        "Often it also includes a type system reminiscent of the taxonomical classification systems that are widely used in knowledge representation, psychology and the natural sciences.",
        "For teaching a subject like computational linguistics, which draws on a broad curriculum from many traditional disciplines to audiences with mixed backgrounds themselves, feature-structure-based theoretical and computational linguistics have three important properties.",
        "First, they are a mature discipline, in which a great deal of accomplishments have been made over the last 20 years, spanning from empirical and conceptual advances in linguistic theory to its mathematical and computational foundations, to grammar development and efficient processing.",
        "Second, they are pervasive as an already existing representation standard for many levels of linguistic study.",
        "Third, they are transparent, reducing complex theories of grammar to a basic collection of mathematical concepts and algorithms for answering formal questions about those theories.",
        "One can address the distinction between descriptions of objects and the objects themselves, the difference between consistency and truth, and what it means for a syntactic theory to be not only elegant but correct in a precise and provable sense.",
        "The purpose of this paper is to discuss how these three properties can be cast into an instructional setting to arrive at a framework for teaching computational linguistics that highlights the integrated nature and precision with which work in this very heterogeneous discipline can be presented.",
        "In principle, the framework we are proposing is open-ended, in the sense that additional modules should be added by students and other researchers, subject to the design principles given in Section 3.",
        "We are currently designing three of the core modules for this framework: formal foundations, constraint-based grammar implementation, and parsing."

      "heading": "2 Problems of seminar-style courses",
      "text": [
        "The contents of our core modules are based on a series of previous seminar-style courses, in particular on constraint-based grammar implementation, which also started integrating interactive components and web-based materials into traditional face-to-face teaching.",
        "These are described in detail in Section 5.",
        "The traditional seminar-style teaching method underlying the courses mentioned therein has a number of inherent problems, however.",
        "These problems become particularly pressing when topics as diverse as linguistic theory, grammar implementation, parsing, mathematical foundations of linguistic theory and feature logics are combined in a single course that is addressed to a mixed audience with varying backgrounds in computer science, knowledge representation, artificial intelligence and linguistics, in any combination of these subjects.",
        "First, the seminar-style teaching format as used in those grammar implementation courses presupposes a fairly coherent audience of linguists with a shared background of linguistic knowledge.",
        "Second, since computers are only used as a medium to implement grammars and since the implementation platform is not optimized for web-based training, it is necessary that there be a relatively low number of students per teacher.",
        "Third, the theoretical material is in the form of overheads and research papers, which are in electronic form but not easily accessible without the accompanying lecture as part of a seminar-style course.",
        "Fourth, the background lectures of the courses lack the support of the kind of graphical, interactive visualization that teaching software can in principle offer.",
        "Finally, the courses follow a single path through the materials as determined by the teacher, which the student cannot change according to their specific interests and their prior knowledge.",
        "We believe that these shortcomings can be overcome by shifting from a seminar-style to a web-based training format in a way that preserves the positive aspects of successful hands-on courses.",
        "On the other hand, to successfully shift from seminar-style to web-based training we believe it is essential to do this based on a scientific understanding of the nature and possibilities of web-based learning.",
        "In the next section we therefore embed our work in the context of education and collaborate learning technology research."

        "We thus intend to provide an environment that teaches students by actively encouraging them to participate in research that extends our collective knowledge in this area.",
        "In principle, there are no boundaries to the material that could be included in the evolving framework.",

        "The first two are extensions of tools we already used for our previous courses, and the third is an extension of the ALE source-level debugger, so we here focus on the last, new development.",
        "The main goal of the MorphMoulder (MoMo) is to project the formality of its subject, the formal foundations of constraint languages over typed feature structures, onto a graphical level at which it can be grasped more intuitively.",
        "The transparency of this level is essential for providing multiple points of entry (Section 3) to this fundamentally important module.",
        "The MoMo tool allows the user to explore the relationship between the two levels of the formal architecture: the descriptions and the elements described.",

        "Once a feature structure has been constructed, the user may examine its logical properties.",
        "The three main functions of the MoMo tool allow one to check (1) whether a feature structure complies with a given signature, (2) whether a well-formed feature structure satisfies a description or a set of descriptions, and (3) whether a well-formed feature structure is a model of a description or a set of descriptions.",
        "In the context of the course, the functions of MoMo thus lead the user from understanding the well-formedness of feature structures with respect to a signature to an understanding of feature structures in their role as a logical model of a theory.",

        "A typical choice for the interpretation of that kind of signature in constraint-based formalisms is the collection of totally well-typed and sort resolved feature structures.",
        "All nodes of totally well-typed and sort resolved feature structures are of a maximally specific type (types with no subtypes); and they have outgoing arcs for all and only those features that are appropriate to their type, with the feature values again obeying appropriateness.",
        "Our signature for lists thus declares an ontology of feature structures with nodes of type nelist or elist (but never of type list), where the former must bear the outgoing arcs HEAD and TAIL, and the latter have no outgoing arcs.",
        "They signal the end of the list.",
        "The HEAD values of non-empty lists must be in the denotation of the type bird.",

        "In the present example, parrot, woodpecker, and canary are the maximally specific subtypes of bird.",
        "Each color of edge represents a different attribute, and each color of node represents a different type.",
        "The grayed outlines on edges and nodes indicate that all of the respective edges and nodes in this particular example are licensed by the signature that was provided.",
        "The HEAD arc originating at the node of type elist, however, violates the appropriateness conditions of the signature.",
        "The feature structure de",
        "picted here, therefore, is not well-formed.",
        "The signature check thus fails on the given feature structure, as indicated by the red light in the upper function console to the right of the whiteboard.",
        "Similarly, MoMo can graphically depict satisfiability and modellability of a single description or set of descriptions.",
        "To this end, the user may be asked to construct a description that a given feature structure satisfies or models; or she may be asked to construct feature structures that satisfy or model a given description (or set of descriptions).",
        "The system will give systematic feedback on the correct or incorrect usage of the syntax of the description language as well as on to which extent a feature structure satisfies or models descriptions, systematically guiding the user to correct solutions.",

        "The feature structure is derived from the one in Figure 1 by removing the incorrect HEAD arc and its substructure from the elist node.",
        "The query, asked in a separate window, is whether the feature structure satisfies the constraint (nelist, head: (parrot, color:green), tail:nelist).",
        "Since this is the case, the green light on the function console to the right is signaling succeed.",
        "If we were to perform model checking of the same feature structure against the same constraint, checking would fail, and MoMo would indicate the nodes of the feature structure that do not satisfy the given constraint.",
        "MoMo’s descriptions are a syntactic parallel to TRALE’s descriptions, thus introducing the student not only to the syntax and semantics of constraint languages but also to the language that will be used for the implementation of grammars later in the course.",
        "The close relationship of description languages also facilitates a comparison of their model-theoretic semantics and the truth conditions of grammars with the structure and semantics of algorithms that use descriptions for constraint resolution and in parsing.",
        "Finally, their common structure allows for a tight network of hyperlinks across the boundaries of different course modules and course topics, linking them to a common source of mathematical, imple-mentational and linguistic indices, which explain the usage of common mathematical concepts across the different areas of application of typed feature structures."
