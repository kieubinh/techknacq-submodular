        "Most grammars of English encode in some form a rule akin to S 4 NP VP.",
        "This involves the assumption that for an expression to constitute a complete sentence it must contain a verbal constituent.",
        "If one identifies the start symbol of a grammar with the type sentence, or at least with a subclass of sentences, then we have as a consequence that complete utterances need to be verb-containing sentences.",
        "These assumptions constitute perhaps a more or less reasonably accurate description of the grammatical situation for texts.",
        "However, as is well known, dialogue is full of intuitively complete utterances that are not sentential in the above sense, most prototypically the `short answers' used to respond to queries.",
        "Processing such fragments, non-sentential utterances (NSUs), is commonly assumed to be a difficult problem on both theoretical and computational grounds, requiring in the general case sophisticated domain-based reasoning.1 To date, nonetheless, as far as we aware, there has not been an attempt to come up with a comprehensive, theoretically grounded classification of NSUs as they occur in a large scale corpus.",
        "Such a taxonomy should reflect the range of forms NSUs can present, together with the interpretations they can convey.",
        "The outcome of such work should be to provide indications as to what types of NSUs are relatively easy to accommodate using existing theoretical tools, and also to indicate the extent to which sophisticated domain-based reasoning is required in resolution.",
        "In this paper we undertake a corpus-based study of NSUs, specifically the British National Corpus (BNC) (Burnard, 2000), with these aims in mind.",
        "The structure of the paper is the following: we start by informally describing the classes of NSUs encountered in the BNC.",
        "'See in particular (Carberry, 1991) for a detailed analysis of fragments, with resolution based on plan recognition techniques.",
        "In Section 3 we discuss how our classification scheme was devised and applied to the BNC.",
        "The results of the corpus investigation are discussed in Section 4.",
        "We then sketch the theoretical framework that has underpinned this investigation a combination of KOS (Ginzburg, 1996; Ginzburg, 2002; Cooper et al., 2001), a theory of dialogue context, with the Head Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG) of (Ginzburg and Sag, 2001).",
        "Finally, we present our conclusions in Section 6: our basic claim will be that, to a large extent, the NSUs encountered in our study are amenable to resolution based on combining a fairly sophisticated grammar with an utterance dynamics strategy.",
        "That is, a strategy that keeps track of a highly structured dialogue record of entities that get introduced into context as a result of utterances.",
        "Complex, domain-based reasoning is not, on the whole, very much in evidence.",
        "2 A corpus-based taxonomy of NSUs In this section we present a corpus-based taxonomy of non-sentential utterances.",
        "It was designed after an exhaustive analysis of 10 dialogue transcripts randomly chosen from the BNC .2 The identification of the different types of phrasal utterances was performed mostly manually in order to capture the maximal number of phenomena, although the search engine SCoRE (Purver, 2001) was also used to detect specific examples.",
        "The taxonomy was then tested by annotating a 200- speaker-turn section from 30 dialogue transcripts using decision trees to guide the classification process.",
        "In the current investigation, the annotation was performed by the authors.",
        "The classification we present sets queries and answers apart from the remaining types of NSU.",

        "2Two of them are transcripts of completely unrestricted, free conversation (KST, KSV), three are informal interviews (K68, K69, JA2), two are more formal interviews (K6K, K65), another two are conversations in seminars (JJ7, JK1) and one is the transcript of a public county council meeting (J9T).",

        "In this paper, we have proposed a comprehensive, semantically grounded taxonomy of non-sentential utterances (NSUs) that occur in dialogue.",
        "The taxonomy is based on manual tagging of a random sample of the BNC.",
        "We have sketched a theoretical analysis of most of the NSU classes found in the corpus study, based on the KOS framework and the HPSG grammar presented in (Ginzburg and Sag, 2001).",
        "As a summary, Table 2 shows the correspondence between NSU classes in our taxonomy and grammatical types.",
        "Clarification Ellipsis and corrections has been analysed by means of coercion operations.",
        "On the other hand, we have only presented an intuitive analysis of fragments as answers to polar questions, acknowledgements and check questions.",
        "We don't have a proposal to analyse fragments introduced by connectives nor fillers yet.",
        "They are the subject of ongoing investigation.",
        "Perhaps the most striking result that emerges from this work concerns the nature of ellipsis resolution involved in the interpretation of NSUs.",
        "On the one hand, it is clear that this must involve a combination of syntactic and semantic information associated with a source utterance.",
        "The basic strategy we invoke for resolution is to use utterance dynamic tools, i.e. by means of keeping track of a limited dialogue record of entities that get introduced into context as a result of utterances or that arise as a consequence of attempts to elicit clarification.",
        "Phenomena such as CE and corrections require a highly structured utterance representation to be available in the resolution process.",
        "However, the relative complexity of the contents involved rules out the viability of simple operations such as copying or more complex ones such as higher order unification as catch all methods for resolution.12 And yet, our results also indicate that, with the context as given, the principles by means of which NSU content is resolved do not involve complex domain sensitive reasoning (for the suggestion that this is required see e.g. (Allen and Perrault, 1980) and (Carberry, 1991)).",
        "We do need to reiterate that our approach does not as yet offer means of determining which of a number of possible antecedents is preferred and this aspect might very well involve domain-based reasoning.",
        "Moreover, we do not of course wish to claim that such reasoning has no role to play in dialogue understanding.",
        "Nor even that there do not exist NSUs where such reasoning might need to be appealed to.",
        "We sim-12For a detailed evaluation of how copying or HOU cope with CE see (Ginzburg and Cooper, 2001a).",
        "ply observe that the role of such reasoning seems relatively insignificant in the corpus we have investigated, a significant proportion of which is free, unrestricted conversation.",
        "This suggests that using an utterance dynamics approach, combined with a relatively intricate grammar can serve as a viable basis for a comprehensive NSU resolving module in a dialogue system.",
        "As discussed in Section 5.6, we have in collaboration with colleagues, begun work on prototype systems that employ such a strategy.",
        "Whether this will be viable on a larger scale is still very much of an open question."
