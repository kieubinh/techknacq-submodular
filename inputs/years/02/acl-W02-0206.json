        "Authors of English-language print documents containing both text and graphics traditionally have used phrases such as 'See Figure 1'.",
        "Intuitively, these cross-media cues (CMCs) help the print reader to integrate information presented in different media, i.e., printed text and printed graphics.",
        "We are investigating how, if at all, these cues should be used in presentations delivered in computer media such as web pages.",
        "Our long-term goal is to develop a non-application-specific computational model for the decision of when to direct the reader's attention to related graphics, what kinds of things to say about them, and where to place the cross-media cues in the text.",
        "For exploratory purposes, we previously performed an informal corpus study of the use of cross-media cues in arguments (Green 2001).",
        "However, we contend that print-media-based corpus studies may not provide sound information on which to base a model for on-screen presentations.",
        "Human-computer interaction (HCI) studies have shown that there are significant differences between reading from print and computer media, e.g., that reading from screen is slower and comprehension is worse (Dillon, 1992; Muter, 1996).",
        "Thus, as an alternative to corpus analysis we have begun controlled user studies employing \"throwaway\" prototypes.",
        "In this paper, we present the design and preliminary results of an experiment on effective cross-media cue usage in computer media."

        "Cross-media cues are similar in some respects to discourse cue phrases.",
        "First, some functions of cross-media cues can be classified using discourse coherence relations such as Preparation, Restatement, Summary, Evaluation, and Elaboration (Green, 2001).",
        "Second, there is not a one-to-one correspondence between form and function.",
        "For example, the same CMC can be used to indicate different coherence relations between a span of text and the named figure, e.g., Restatement and Evaluation.",
        "On the other hand, a relation of Summary can be indicated, for example, by 'From Fig. 9.5, you can see that' or '(see Figure 4)'.",
        "Another similarity is that CMCs are not always provided to mark explicitly the relationship obtaining between text and graphic.",
        "Research on discourse cue placement has framed our thinking on asking when and where to generate CMCs (DiEugenio, Moore and Paolucci, 1997).",
        "A multimedia presentation may include multimodal referring expressions, references to things in the world made through a combination of text and graphics (McKeown et al., 1992; Andr√© and Rist, 1994).",
        "Such cross-references are similar to cross-media cues in that they direct the user's attention to a related graphic.",
        "However, their function is different, namely, to enable the user to perform reference resolution.",
        "Another form of cross-reference, discourse deixis is the use of an expression that refers to part of the document containing it, e.g., 'the next chapter' (Paraboni and van Deemter, 1999).",
        "Although a user's interpretation of a cross-media cue may depend on discourse deixis to determine the graphic in question, the problem of selecting an appropriate description to refer to a graphic (e.g. 'Figure 4' versus 'the Figure below') is not a concern of our work at present.",
        "In our previous corpus study of multimedia arguments, we classified text in a document as either argument-bearing or commentary-bearing, where the latter is text about a graphic included in the document (Green 2001).",
        "The topics of commentary-bearing text include the graphic's role in the argument (e.g. 'From Fig. 9.5, you can see that'), the interpretation of graphical elements in terms of the underlying domain and data, and salient visual features of the graphic.",
        "Furthermore, we noted that commentary-bearing and argument-bearing text may be interleaved, and that the ratio of the number of sentences of commentary to their related CMC may be many to one.",
        "Previous work in caption generation is relevant to the question of what kinds of things to say about accompanying graphics (Mittal et al., 1998; Fasciano and Lapalme, 1999).",
        "However, neither of those systems face the problem of integrating commentary-bearing text with text generated to achieve other presentation goals."

        "HCI research has focused on interaction techniques and features of layout that influence effectiveness.",
        "Use of contact points, control buttons in text on a web page that enable readers to control related animations (Faraday and Sutcliffe, 1999), is an interaction technique that, like CMCs, explicitly marks the relationship between information presented in two media.",
        "That paper provides experimental evidence that contact points improve comprehension of integrated text and animation.",
        "According to Moreno and Mayer's Spatial Contiguity Principle (2000), learning in multimedia presentations is improved when related text and graphics are spatially contiguous rather than separated.",
        "However, this does not imply that instead of providing CMCs a generator can rely on layout alone, for the following reasons.",
        "First, a generator may have responsibility for producing text but not have control over layout, e.g. when a document is displayed by a web browser.",
        "Second, a graphic may be relevant to multiple non-contiguous spans of text in a document."

        "As a first step, we must address a basic question: is it ever worthwhile to generate cross-media cues in computer presentations?",
        "Thus we designed a between-groups experiment (Lewis & Rieman, 1994) to test whether performance on tasks requiring a subject to skim for information presented in text and graphics via a web browser would benefit from the inclusion of cross-media cues in the text.",
        "Skimming, defined as \"moving rapidly through text to locate specific information or gain the gist\", is a type of reading strategy often used by readers of web pages (Dyson and Haselgrove 2001).",
        "Each of the three groups of subjects receives a different version of a presentation consisting of four articles.",
        "Each article fills a 19 inch computer screen and consists of a short text followed by several figures with information graphics such as line graphs and bar charts.",
        "The graphics are arranged in a row near the bottom of the screen so that the cost to the user of looking up and down between text and graphics is the same for each figure.",
        "Multiple figures are provided so that the reader is required to determine which figure is relevant to the task.",
        "In version 1, the layout of each article consists of text containing no cross-media cues followed by the figures.",
        "A short caption is given under each graphic.",
        "In version 2, the caption text has been removed from the figures and integrated into the paragraph of text above the figures, i.e., it now functions as commentary text.",
        "Version 3 is identical to version 2 except that for each figure a cross-media cue of the form 'See Figure n.' has been inserted in the text; the CMC is inserted following the commentary created from the corresponding caption in Version 1.",
        "Version 1 represents the case where it is feasible to design the layout so that text commenting upon a figure can be placed in proximity to the figure (i.e. maximizing adherence to the Spatial Contiguity Principle).",
        "We assume that task performance will be best for version 1 and include it in the experiment to provide a baseline.",
        "The main point of the experiment, however, is to compare performance on version 2 with performance on version 3.",
        "Then, if performance on version 3 is better, we have shown that CMCs can be useful to readers performing a similar task."
