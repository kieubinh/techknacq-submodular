        "Dialogue systems which deal with complex dialogues require the interaction of multiple knowledge sources, e.g. domain, discourse and user model (Flycht-Eriksson, 1999).",
        "Furthermore NLP systems have to adapt to different environments and applications.",
        "This can only be achieved if the system is able to determine how well a given speech recognition hypothesis (SRH) fits within the respective domain model and what domain should be considered by the system currently in focus.",
        "The purpose of this paper is to develop an annotation scheme for annotating a corpus of SRH with information on semantic consistency and domain specificity.",
        "We investigate",
        "the feasibility of an automatic solution by first looking at how reliably human annotators can solve the task.",
        "The structure of the paper is as follows: Section 2 gives an overview of the domain modeling component in the SmartKom system.",
        "In Section 3 we report on the data collection underlying our study.",
        "A description of the suggested annotation scheme is given in Section 4.",

        "A central goal is the development of new computational methods for disambiguating different modalities on semantic and pragmatic levels.",
        "The information flow in SmartKom is organized as follows: On the input side the parser picks an N-best list of hypotheses out of the speech recognizer’s word lattice (Oerder and Ney, 1993).",
        "This list is sent to the media fusion component and then handed over to the intention recognition component.",
        "The main task of intention recognition in SmartKom is to select the best hypothesis from the N-best list produced by the parser.",
        "This is then sent to the dialogue management component for computing an appropriate action.",

        "These tasks are inherently related to each other: It is possible to assign SRH to certain domains only if they are consistent with the domain model.",

        "The motivation for that was to find out whether it is feasible to develop and evaluate a computer program addressing the same task and implementing the algorithm reflected in the annotation scheme.",
        "We found that humans principally had problems in looking solely at the conceptualized speech recognition hypotheses.",
        "This, however, should not be a problem for a machine where the word-to-concept mapping is done automatically and all so-called function words are discarded.",
        "In the future it would be interesting to have humans annotate not speech recognition hypotheses per se, but only their automatically generated conceptual mappings.",
        "Another finding was that the originally proposed annotation scheme does not allow for a high level of agreement between human annotators with respect to semantic consistency.",
        "Eliminating the class semi-consistent led us, however, to a considerably better reliability of annotations.",
        "We consider this study as a first attempt to show the feasibility of determining semantic consistency of the output of the speech recognizer.",
        "We plan to integrate the results into the domain modeling component and conduct further experiments on semantic consistency and domain detection."
