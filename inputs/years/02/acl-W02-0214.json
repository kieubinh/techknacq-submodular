        "On a Finnish corpus of 57 dialogues the method is shown to work well for recognizing subjects of longer dialogue segments, whereas for individual utterances the subject recognition history should perhaps be taken into account.",
        "Second, we attempt to identify topically relevant words in the utterances and thus locate the old information (’topic words’) and new information (’focus words’).",
        "For this we define a probabilistic model and compare different methods for model parameter estimation on a corpus of 189 dialogues.",
        "Moreover, the utilization of information regarding the position of the word in the utterance is found to improve the results."

        "The analysis of the topic of a sentence or a document is an important task for many natural language applications.",
        "For example, in interactive dialogue systems that attempt to carry out and answer requests made by customers, the response strategy employed may depend on the topic of the request (Jokinen et al., 2002).",
        "In large vocabulary speech recognition knowledge of the topic can, in general, be utilized for adjusting the language model used (see, e.g., (Iyer and Ostendorf, 1999)).",
        "We describe two approaches to analyzing the topical information, namely the use of topically ordered document maps for analyzing the overall topic of dialogue segments, and identification of topic and focus words in an utterance for sentence-level analysis and identification of topically relevant specific information in short contexts.",
        "1.1 Document map as a topically ordered semantic space The Self-Organizing Map (Kohonen, 1982; Kohonen, 1995) is an unsupervised neural network method suitable for ordering and visualization of complex data sets.",
        "It has been shown that very large document collections can be meaningfully organized onto maps that are topically ordered: documents with similar content are found near each other on the map (Lin, 1992; Honkela et al., 1996; Lin, 1997; Kohonen et al., 2000).",
        "The document map can be considered to form an ordered representation of possible topics, i.e., a topical semantic space.",
        "Each set of map coordinates specifies a point in the semantic space, and additionally, corresponds to a subset of the corpus, forming a kind of associative topical-semantic memory.",
        "Document maps have been found useful in text mining and in improving information retrieval (Lagus, 2000).",
        "Recent experiments indicate that the document maps ordered using the SOM algorithm can be useful in focusing the language model to the current active vocabulary (Kurimo and Lagus, 2002).",
        "In this article we examine the usefulness of document maps for analyzing the topics of transcripts of natural spoken dialogues.",
        "The topic identification from both individual utterances and longer segments is studied."

      "text": [
        "Within a single utterance or sentence the speaker may provide several details that specify the request further or provide additional information that specifies something said earlier.",
        "Automatic extraction of the relevant words and the concepts they relate to may be useful, e.g., for a system filling out the fields of a database query intended to answer the user’s request.",
        "If a small set of relevant semantic concepts can be defined, and if the sentence structures allowed are strictly limited, the semantic concept identification problem can be solved, at least to some degree, by manually designed rule-based systems (Jokinen et al., 2002).",
        "However, if the goal is the analysis of free-form dialogues, one cannot count on hearing full sentences.",
        "It is therefore important to try to formulate the task as a learning problem into which adaptive, statistical methods can be applied.",
        "The major challenge in adaptive language modeling is the complexity of the learning problem, caused by large vocabularies and large amount of variation in sentence structures, compared to the amount of learning data available.",
        "For English there already exist various tagged and analyzed corpora.",
        "In contrast, for many smaller languages no tagged corpora generally exist.",
        "Yet the methods that are developed for English cannot as such be applied for many other languages, such as Finnish.",
        "In the analysis of natural language dialogues, theories of information structure (Sgall et al., 1986; Halliday, 1985) concern the semantic concepts and their structural properties within an utterance.",
        "Such concepts include the attitudes, prior knowledge, beliefs and intentions of the speaker, as well as concepts identifying information that is shared between the speakers.",
        "The terms ’topic’ and ’focus’ may be defined as follows: ’topic’ is the general subject of which the user is talking about, and ’focus’ refers to the specific additional information that the user now introduces about the topic.",
        "An alternative way of describing these terms is that ’topic’ constitutes of the old information shared by both dialogue participants and ’focus’ contains the new information which is communicated regarding the topic.",
        "A traditional way of finding the old and new information is the ’question test’ (see (Vilkuna, 1989) about using it for Finnish).",
        "For any declarative sentence, a question is composed so that the sentence would be a natural answer to that question.",
        "Then the items of the sentence that are repeated in the question belong to the topic and the new items to the focus.",
        "A usual approach for topic–focus identification is to use parsed data.",
        "The sentence, or it’s semantic or syntactic-semantic representation, is divided into two segments, usually at the location of the main verb, and the words or semantical concepts in the first segment are regarded as ’topic’ words/concepts and those in the second as ’focus’ words/concepts.",
        "For example in (Meteer and Iyer, 1996), the division point is placed before the first strong verb, or, in the absence of such a verb, behind the last weak verb of the sentence.",
        "Similar division is also the starting point for the algorithm for topic–focus identification introduced in (Hajiˆcov´a et al., 1995).",
        "The initial division is then modified according to the verb’s position and meaning, the subject’s definiteness or indefiniteness and the number, type and order of the other sentence constituents.",
        "In language modeling for speech recognition improvements in perplexity and word error rate have been observed on English corpora when using language models trained separately for the topic and the focus part of the sentence (Meteer and Iyer, 1996; Ma et al., 1998).",
        "Identification of these concepts is likely to be important also for sentence comprehension and dialogue strategy selection.",
        "In this article we examine the application of a number of statistical approaches for identification of these concepts.",
        "In particular, we apply the notions of topic and focus in information structure (Sgall et al., 1986) to tagging a set of natural dialogues in Finnish.",
        "We then try several approaches for learning to identify the occurrences of these concepts from new data based on the statistical properties of the old instances.",
        "2 Experiments on recognizing the dialogue topic of a dialogue turn The ordered document map can be utilized in the analysis of dialogue topics as follows: encode a dialogue turn, i.e., an utterance u (or an utterance combined with its recent history) as a document vector.",
        "Locate the best-matching map unit, or several such units.",
        "Utilize the identities of the best units as a semantic representation of the topic of the u.",
        "In effect, this is a latent semantic representation of the topical content of the utterance.",
        "Evaluation of such a latent representation directly amounts to asking whether the dialogue manager can benefit from the representation, and must therefore be carried out by the dialogue manager.",
        "This direct evaluation has not yet been done.",
        "Instead, we have utilized the following approach for evaluating the ordering of the maps and the generalization to new, unseen dialogues: An intermediate set of named semantic concepts has been defined in an attempt to approximate what is considered to be interesting for the dialogue manager.",
        "The latent semantic representation of the map is then labeled or calibrated to reflect these named concepts.",
        "In effect, each dialogue segment is categorized to a prior topical category.",
        "The organized map is labeled using part of the data (’training data’), and the remaining part is used to evaluate the map (’test data’)'.",
        "'Note that even in this case the map is ordered in Furthermore, a statistical model for document classification can be defined on top of the map.",
        "The probability model used for topic estimation is",
        "where Ai is the topic category, S denotes the text transcription of the spoken sentence and XN is the set of N best map vectors used for the classification.",
        "We approximate the probability P(XNIS) to be equal for each map vector in XN.",
        "We assume that XN conveys all information about S. The terms P(AiIXN) are calculated as the relative frequencies of the topics of the document vectors in the training data that were mapped to the nodes that correspond to XN.",
        "2.1 Corpus: transcripts of 57 spoken dialogues",
        "The data used in the experiments were Finnish dialogues, recorded from the customer service phone line of Helsinki City Transport.",
        "The dialogues, provided by the Interact project (Jokinen et al., 2002), had been transcribed into text by a person listening to the tapes.",
        "The transcribed data is extremely colloquial.",
        "Both the customers and the customer service personnel use a lot of expletive words, such as ’nii’ (’so’, ’yea’) and ’tota’ (’hum’, ’er’, ’like’), often the words appear in reduced or otherwise non-standard forms.",
        "The word order does not always follow grammatical rules and quite frequently there is considerable overlap between the dialogue turns.",
        "For example, the utterance of speaker A may be interjected by a confirmation from speaker B.",

        "and the 24 dialogues collected later for testing.",
        "A small number of broad topic categories were selected so that they comprehensively encompass the subjects of discussion occurring in the data.",
        "The categories were ’timetables’, ’beginnings’, ’tickets’, ’endings’, and ’out of domain’.",
        "The dialogues were then manually tagged and segmented, so that each continuous dialogue segment of several utterances that belonged to one general topic category formed a single document.",
        "This resulted in a total of 196 segments, 115 and 81 in training and test sets, respectively.",
        "Each segment contained data from both the customer and the assistant.",
        "Of particular interest is the analysis of the topics of individual customer utterances.",
        "The data was therefore split further into utterances, resulting in 450 and 189 customer utterances in the training and test set, respectively.",
        "The relative frequencies of utterances belonging to each topic category for both training and test data are shown in Table 1.",
        "Each individual utterance was labeled with the topic category of the segment it belonged to.",
        "2.3 Creation of the document map The documents, whether segments or utterances, were encoded as vectors using the methods described in detail in (Kohonen et al., 2000).",
        "In short, the encoding was as follows.",
        "Stopwords (function words etc.)",
        "and words that appeared fewer than 2 times in the training data were removed.",
        "The remaining words were weighted using their entropy over document classes.",
        "The documents were encoded using the vector space model by Salton (Salton et al., 1975) with word weights.",
        "Furthermore, sparse random projection of was applied to reduce the dimensionality of the document vectors from the original 1738 to 500 (for details of the method, see, e.g., (Kohonen et al., 2000)).",
        "In organizing the map each longer dialogue segment was considered as a document.",
        "The use of longer segments is likely to make the organization of the map more robust.",
        "The inclusion of the utterances by the assistant is particularly important given the small amount of data – all information must be utilized.",
        "The document vectors were then organized on a SOM of 6 x 4 = 24 units.",
        "2.4 Experiments and results We carried out three tests where the length of dialogue segments was varied.",
        "In each case, different values of N were tried.",
        "In the first case, longer dialogue segments in the training data were used to estimate the term P(Ai IXN) whereas recognition accuracy was calculated on customer utterances only.",
        "Next, individual customer utterances were used also in estimating the model term.",
        "The best recognition accuracy in both cases were obtained using the value N = 3, namely 60.3% for the first case and 65.1% for the second case.",
        "In the third case we used the longer dialogue segments both for estimating the model and for evaluation, to examine the effect of longer context on the recognition accuracy.",
        "The recognition accuracy was now 87.7%, i.e., clearly better for the longer dialogue segments than for the utterances.",
        "It seems that many utterances taken out of context are too short or nondescript to provide reliable cues regarding the topical category.",
        "An example of such an utterance is ’Onks sinne mit¨a¨a muuta?’ (lit.",
        "’Is to there anything else?’, the intended meaning probably being ’Does any other bus go there?’).",
        "In this case it is the surrounding dialogue (or perhaps the Finnish morpheme corresponding to ’to’) that would identify the correct category, namely ’timetables’.",
        "Moreover, results on comparing a document map to Independent Component Analysis on the same corpus are reported in (Bingham et al., 2002).",
        "The slightly higher percentages in that paper are due to evaluating longer segments and to reporting the results on the whole data set instead of a separate test set.",
        "3 Identification of old and new information in utterances We define this task as the identification of ’topic words’ and ’focus words’ from utterances of natural Finnish dialogues.",
        "There are thus no restrictions regarding the vocabulary or the grammar.",
        "By observing previous, marked instances of these concepts we try to recognize the instances in new dialogues.",
        "It should be noted that this task definition differs somewhat from those discussed in Section 1.2 in that we do not construct any conceptual representation of the utterances, nor do we segment them into a ’topic’ part and a ’focus’ part.",
        "This choice is due to utilizing natural utterances in which the sentence borders do not always coincide with the turn-taking of the speakers – a turn may consist of several sentences or a partial one (when interrupted by a comment from the other speaker).",
        "In other words, we try to identify the central words that communicate the topic and focus in an utterance.",
        "We assume that they can appear in any part of the sentence and between them there may be other words that are not relevant to the topic or focus.",
        "Whether these central words form a single topic or focus or several such concepts is left open."
