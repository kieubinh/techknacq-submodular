        "Within this taxonomy, a useful dialogue system for interaction with autonomous devices must be located at or near the “agent-based” point since we wish to communicate with devices about their possible actions, their plans, and the tasks they are currently attempting.",

        "Hypothesis: “The conversational competence required for practical dialogues, although still complex, is significantly simpler to achieve than general human conversational competence.” We also share with (Rich et al., 2001) the idea that declarative descriptions of the goal decomposition of activities (COLLAGEN’s “recipes”, our “Activity Models”) are a vital layer of representation, between a dialogue system and the device with which it interacts.",
        "In general we assume that a device is capable of performing some “atomic” activities or actions (possibly simultaneously), which are the lowest-level actions that it can perform.",
        "Some devices will only know how to carry out sequences of atomic activities, in which case it is the dialogue system’s job to decompose linguistically specified high-level activities (e.g. “record the film on channel 4 tonight”) into a sequence of appropriate atomic actions for the device.",
        "In this case the dialogue system is provided with a declarative “Activities Model” (see e.g.",
        "Figure 3) for the device which states how high-level linguistically-specified activities can be decomposed into sequences of atomic actions.",
        "This model contains traditional planning constraints such as precon",

        "At the other end of the spectrum, more intelligent devices are able to plan their own sequences of atomic actions, based on some higher level input.",
        "In this case, it is the dialogue system’s role to translate natural language into constraints (including temporal constraints) that the device’s planner recognizes.",
        "The device itself then carries out planning, and informs the dialogue manager of the sequence of activities that it proposes.",
        "Dialogue can then be used to respecify constraints, revise activities, and monitor the progress of tasks.",
        "We propose that the process of decomposing a linguistically specified command (e.g. “vacuum in the main bedroom and the lounge, and before that, the hall”) into an appropriate sequence of constraints for the device’s on-board planner, is an aspect of “conversational intelligence” that can be added to devices by dialogue-enabling them.",
        "We are developing one representation and reasoning scheme to cover this spectrum of cases from devices with no planning capabilities to some more impressive on-board AI.",
        "Both dialogue manager and robot/device have access to a single “Activity Tree” which is a shared representation of current and planned activities and their execution status, involving temporal and hierarchical ordering (in fact, one can think of the Activity Tree as a Hierarchical Task Network for the device).",
        "This tree is built top-down by processing verbal input from the user, and its nodes are then expanded by the device’s planner (if it has one).",
        "In cases where no planner exists, the dialogue manager itself expands the whole tree (via the Activity Model for the device) until only leaves with atomic actions are left for the device to execute in sequence.",

        "We explained the dialogue modelling techniques which we implemented in order to build a real-time multi-modal conversational interface to an autonomous device.",
        "The novel issues tackled by the system and its dialogue model are that it is able to manage conversations about multiple tasks and collaborative activities in a robust and natural way.",
        "We argued that in the case of dialogues with devices, a dialogue management mechanism has to be particularly robust and flexible, especially in comparison with finite-state or frame-based dialogue managers which have been developed for information-seeking dialogues, such as travel planning, where topics of conversation are predetermined.",
        "Another challenge was that conversations may have multiple open topics at any one time, and this complicates utterance interpretation and generation.",
        "We discussed the dialogue context model and algorithms used to produce a system with the following features:",
        "• supports multi-tasking, multiple topics, and collaboration, • support of commands, questions, revisions, and reports, over a dynamic environment, • multi-modal, mixed-initiative, open-ended dialogues, • echoic and variable message generation, filtered for relevance and recency • asynchronous, real-time operation.",
        "An video demonstration of the system is avail",
