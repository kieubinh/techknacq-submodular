        "The use of probabilistic and decision-theoretic inference in dialogue modelling and management has been explored in preliminary fashion by (Pulman, 1996) and (Keizer, 2001).",
        "Probabilistic methods look promising when modelling systems where there is uncertainty, and simple true/false judgements obscure some of the subtleties of representation and processing that are required of an accurate model.",
        "Dialogue systems are of this nature because uncertainty is present due to speech recognition noise, speech-act uncertainty, and so on.",
        "Epistemic uncertainty is rife in dialogue, and probability distributions provide a natural model of the ambiguities that thus arise.",
        "For these reasons it is natural to explore probabilistic representations and algorithms in dialogue management, rather than purely deterministic models.",
        "We have experience building deterministic dialogue managers (see e.g. (Lemon et al.,",
        "2001; Lemon et al., 2002)) which use deterministic context update rules.",
        "This paper briefly describes our construction of a Bayes Net modelling dialogue context.",
        "We will consider a series of examples of increasing complexity involving anaphoric resolution in Section 3.1.",
        "We will point out how they are to be resolved intuitively, and then discuss how our Bayesian net fares.",
        "We will see that many of the best insights of deterministic approaches (e.g. in the axiomatic BDI tradition and in the planning literature) can be preserved, often in less brittle forms, in a probabilistic setting."

      "heading": "1.1 Probabilistic modelling ideas",
      "text": [
        "Our approach to resolving anaphora (and dialogue moves) was to generate a probability distribution of the random variable of interest (e.g. salience of referent) and then choose the value of the variable corresponding to the highest probability as the interpretation (e.g. the referent).",
        "This decision has a theoretical justification that can be found in a theorem in (Parikh, 1990) in the context of his game-theoretic model of language use.",
        "The theorem states that under certain conditions (which hold in our context) the correct interpretation of an utterance is the most likely one."

        "The two major aspects of dialogue management are the interpretation of incoming (user) utterances, and the timely and appropriate generation of utterances by the dialogue system.",
        "To cover these aspects we have constructed a Bayes Net as shown in Figure 1.",
        "In the implementation of this network we used CIspace’s Java-based Bayes Net toolkit.",
        "The conditional probability table for the nodes representing the dialogue move at time t and salience list at time t are obviously the core of the network.",
        "These tables are too large to present in this paper.",
        "We constructed them by hand, using heuristics gained from experience in programming rule-based dialogue systems.",

        "Several different factors enter into the resolution of anaphora in a dialogue.",
        "How recently a potential referent was referred to is one important factor, another is the embedding activity within which the anaphoric reference was made (e.g. the type of verb phrase in which the referent appears), a third is the intra-sentential location of the relevant noun phrases in the preceding dialogue, a fourth is the relative prominence of a potential referent in the dialogue situation, and so on.",
        "The basic idea is that condi",
        "tional probability distributions are generated dynamically in the Bayesian network.",
        "When we look at a distribution corresponding to a node we are interested in, then the most salient object in the context will be the one whose value has the highest probability.",
        "We point out that an obvious deterministic way to rank different combinations of factors (in an optimality-theoretic way, for example), and choose the most salient object based on this ranking, does not seem to work – because any potential ranking of principles (e.g. “Recency overrides subject placement”) would have to be context-dependent, and this defeats the idea of a ranking.",

        "Here it is intuitively clear that “it” is intended to pick out the green car.",
        "The contribution of “see it” is modelled as an observed even distribution over all possible referents which can be seen (i.e. rs and gs each get a 0.5 weight).",
        "The conditional probability table for Salience List at time t is then used to compute the new probability distribution over the object-activity pairs (rm, gm, wm, vs, gs).",
        "Here we see that the green car is the most salient after the user’s second utterance (gm), and that this salience increases after the utterance “it”, because g was both the most recent NP, and is also a possible object in the context of the “seeing” activity.",
        "In the example in Figure 3, the anaphoric pronoun “it” should pick out the red car and not the waypoint, even though the waypoint was referred to more recently.",
        "Intuitively, this is because the embedding activity of looking for the red car is tied to the pronoun, and this fact overrides the most recent referent.",
        "Here, the waypoint is not a possible object in the “seeing” activity, whereas the red car has been introduced as part of that activity.",
        "Thus the pronoun “it” in the user’s final utterance has the effect of raising the probabilities of all the objects which can be seen, and this in fact overrides the recency effect of the utterance of “waypoint”.",
        "An extended example (not shown) shows how activity information can outweigh recency in an interleaved fashion and then that a newly introduced referent can become the most salient.",

        "In Figure 6 the red car is most salient after the second utterance, but the waypoint becomes more salient, even though the red car was in subject position, because the waypoint is involved in the activity of moving, as is the pronoun “it”, and so is a better candidate for anaphoric resolution.",
        "Combined with Figure 5 this shows that no static ranking of anaphoric binding principles will cover all situations, and that a probabilistic approach is useful – even as a theoretical model.",
