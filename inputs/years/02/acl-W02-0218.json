        "DMT is able to describe substantially more dialogues than its predecessor, and it identifies kinds of mechanisms not included in the predecessor.",
        "DMT is a step toward accounting for the coherence of entire dialogues.",
        "The major structures in DMT are based on intentions which are imputed to dialogue participants.",
        "The focus of this paper is on mechanisms.",
        "Dialogue Macrogames are defined.",
        "Another class of mechanisms, called Unilaterals, is also described.",
        "A DMT analysis is presented.",
        "The analyzed dialogue is an excerpt (41 turns) of actual dialogue from the Apollo 13 mission, from the emergency period after the explosion.",
        "DMT is then related to another dialogue analysis method (Carletta, Isard et al.",
        "1997).",
        "DMT is an exercised framework, meaning that it has been applied to dialogues from a diversity of situations.",
        "These include various emergency communications, tutoring, administrative interactions, online human computer help, medical interviews, laboratory conversational tasks, courtroom questioning of witnesses and hostage negotiation.",
        "The paper reports work in progress, and also indicates likely courses of further development."

        "Dialogue Macrogame Theory is designed to enable analysis of particular natural dialogues.",
        "Some dialogues can be analyzed with DMT; some cannot.",
        "Where it fits, DMT gives a partial technical characterization of the classes of dialogues represented in the analyses.",
        "This paper is focused on presenting the elements of the theory.",
        "Other presentations are expected to describe its application and validation.",
        "In the late 1970s a research team at USC-Information Sciences Institute (ISI) studied natural dialogues with particular interest in applying the results to human-computer interaction.",
        "The team produced a series of reports (Mann 1979) (Mann, Carlisle et al.",
        "1977) (Mann, Carlisle et al.",
        "1975), a published paper by Levin and Moore (Levin and Moore 1977) and later another paper, entitled Dialogue Games: Conventions of Human Interaction (Mann 1988).",
        "These publications arose out of the study of many natural dialogues.",
        "The final theoretical summary was presented in the form of a technical method for representing the short range and long range dialogue structures.",
        "Recent work has attempted to apply this set of structures to additional dialogues.",
        "This effort has identified a number of deficiencies of the framework, which have led to making a fresh start rather than adjustment.",
        "The central constructs in the prior work were called Dialogue Games, a name inspired by terminology of Wittgenstein (Wittgenstein 1973) but with only a distant family resemblance to his usage.",
        "Since the end of that work this term has been used in many other ways that are not technically related to the ISI usage.",
        "In addition, the terms dialogue act, conversational act, and conversational game are in wide use (Carlson 1983) (Kreutel and Matheson 2001) (Traum 1994; Poesio and Traum 1998; Traum 1999) .",
        "To simply resume using the old terminology now would invite confusion and misunderstanding.",
        "So this paper introduces a new term, Dialogue Macrogame, which represents some structures that resemble the dialogue games of the predecessor model.",
        "In this paper, Dialogue Macrogame may be abbreviated to dialogue game or even game.",
        "The term dialogue represents two party immediate interaction.1 Studies of dialogue from various points of view are numerous.",
        "There are dozens of technical fields with the word communication in their names (Craig 1999).",
        "Many of them study dialogue.",
        "There are structural views, communication views and many others.",
        "Linguistics tends to produce structurally oriented studies, but not exclusively.",
        "Even restricting attention to studies of dialogue coherence, there are many radically different viewpoints.",
        "Conversational Coherence: Form, Structure and Strategy (Craig and Tracy 1983) is a particularly relevant collection, now somewhat dated but representing ideas that persist in the wider literature.",
        "In this book, and in the wider literature as well, the distinction between coherence and cohesion is often not made.",
        "Studies of coherence are often really about abstract cohesive devices, in the sense of (Halliday and Hasan 1976).",
        "Some studies (Ellis 1983; Goldberg 1983) assume that coherence is produced by design, by appropriate use of cohesive devices.",
        "In some studies coherence is equated to topic continuity or to the appropriate use of topic shifting devices (Crow 1983; Sigman 1983).",
        "In others it is seen as conformity to expressive rules.",
        "Grice is often interpreted as believing that conversational coherence is based on rule (or maxim) following (Grice 1975).",
        "Still others see coherence as an identifiable outcome of rule governed (social or linguistic) behavior (Goldberg 1 Sometimes DMT structures can be applied to interactions that have more than two participants.",
        "Even so, dialogue macrogame theory would have to be significantly augmented in order to become a sound representation scheme for multiparty interaction.",
        "Knowing of these complications, we focus on two party interaction as a research tactic.",
        "1983).",
        "Hawes defends his views against this idea (Hawes 1983).",
        "Some studies of coherence in dialogue assume that people pursue a tacit goal of being coherent, in addition to any other goals, when they interact.",
        "It is a benefit which they seek.",
        "(Hopper attributes this orientation to interpreters of language, but not producers (Hopper 1983).)",
        "Others see coherence as an obligation that is attached to interaction.",
        "It is an added duty.",
        "(Sanders sees this view as widely accepted, and defends his views against it (Sanders 1983).)",
        "Some studies equate coherence with propositional consistency, see (Goldberg 1983) for citations.",
        "Others see coherence as a kind of summary impression that is a side effect of understanding an interaction, an understanding that is enabled by the processes that ordinarily govern interaction (Sanders 1983).",
        "The (Craig and Tracy 1983) book incorporates an admirable attempt to make the various approaches comparable.",
        "All of the chapter authors were given one particular 30 minute dialogue (included in the volume) and told to relate their approaches to it.",
        "In a volume summary, apropos of this paper, the editors note that “Conversationalists’ goals must play a central role in any adequate explanation of discourse production and interpretation in conversations.” p. 22.",
        "Global approaches to coherence, ones that attempt to address entire texts or dialogues, are often associated with some notion of genre or tradition, such as Rummelhardt’s story grammars (Rumelhart 1975) or Schank and Abelson’s scripts (Schank and Abelson 1977).",
        "(DMT addresses whole dialogues, but without resemblance to those approaches.)",
        "There is more recent progress in many aspects of understanding dialogue.",
        "A rich array of formal approaches has been built on the Discourse Representation Theory of Kamp and colleagues (Kamp and Reyle 1993) (Traum 1994).",
        "Agency theory, along with various vigorous efforts to develop data annotation methods, are also producing insightful views of natural dialogue.",
        "Clearly there is no consensus on the nature of coherence in dialogue.",
        "Although comparing views is typically difficult, as researchers we always find some views more credible than others.",
        "We may be able to make certain alternatives more distinct by an analogy concerning oral dialogue.",
        "What is the status of breathing?",
        "Do people breathe in dialogue because they believe it will make the dialogue more beneficial?",
        "Or is there a duty to breathe in dialogue?",
        "Is breathing simply following a tradition, or an attempt to perform smoothly?",
        "Are there rules of dialogue that would, for example, make a dialogue ill-formed if it did not involve breathing?",
        "Or is breathing regulated by processes that interact with the speaking processes?",
        "DMT is designed following assumptions that most resemble this latter alternative."

      "text": [
        "A major goal of Dialogue Macrogame Theory (DMT) is to provide a descriptive account for the coherence of a wide diversity of natural dialogues.",
        "A dialogue is said to be coherent if a person who has good access to the dialogue is left with the impression that every part of the dialogue contributed to the remainder, or equivalently that there are no parts whose presence is not easily explained .2 This definition of coherence is parallel to a definition for monologue texts.",
        "That definition says that every part of the text has an evident role, and that there are no apparent deletions.",
        "Notice that the definition of coherence does not refer to turns, does not require that there be distinct turns, and in particular does not require that turns be coherent monologues.",
        "The assumptions of DMT include saying that not all dialogue situations are alike, and that the differences between dialogue situations affect the dynamics of the dialogues which occur in them.",
        "We therefore do not expect to discover a single theory that accurately describes the coherence of all natural dialogues.",
        "2 For research purposes, the impressions of dialogue participants themselves are generally not available.",
        "Researchers’ impressions of dialogue transcripts and records are virtually the only source, so those impressions are the object of study.",
        "Instead, we seek to find a set of theories that can jointly account for the coherence of dialogues that arise in different kinds of situations.",
        "We hope that the set will be small, but also that the set of theories will be very informative.",
        "DMT is designed to be one such theory.",
        "Size limitations and incomplete development prevent this paper from describing all of the significant aspects of DMT.",
        "We choose to describe only the elements which are part of DMT analysis.",
        "In future presentations we expect to describe dialogue analysis methods, framework validation, some form/framework relationships, and relationships to prior methods.",
        "We also expect to provide a corpus of analyzed dialogues.",
        "This work puts a high value on expanding the coverage of the set of theories mentioned above.",
        "This is in effect a personal preference for placing a high value on breadth rather than depth or precision.",
        "We can say something preliminary about the degree of confirmation of DMT.",
        "As mentioned above, although the predecessor theory expressed some insights about dialogues, it was generally not precise enough to be applied reliably.",
        "Details had been missed.",
        "DMT has been applied to a much wider range of dialogues.",
        "The forthcoming release of a corpus of analyzed dialogues will show this, and the structures described below all reflect details of actual natural dialogues.",
        "Near the end of this paper there is an example of an analysis of a natural dialogue, illustrating use of each kind of element of DMT."

        "Either party can bid termination of a game, and the other can either accept termination or refuse it by continuing to pursue the game.",
        "Games often end by apparent accomplishment of the joint goals of the game, which is the most common form of bidding termination.",
        "Abandoning the goals of the game accepts termination.",

        "The scope of a game is the entire interval during which it is in use, including the initial bid of the game and the final acceptance of termination.",
        "If a bid to initiate a game is refused, as can happen for example when one person offers information that the other person does not need, then the game never becomes open, and the joint goal of providing the offered information is never taken up.",
        "Occurrences of games can contain occurrences of other games or the same game within their scopes; they are mutually recursive.",

        "What does the added complexity do?",
        "In DMT the baseline of representation is that both parties are in control of the course of the dialogue.",
        "It is negotiated cooperatively.",
        "This requires that each party be able to accept a new topic or set of goals, and each party must be able to abandon goals.",
        "The addition and dismissal of joint goals are negotiable.",
        "Some situations and some people very seldom reject any proposal, but it is possible in principle.",
        "In designing the MAP representation, this was recognized: “It is also theoretically possible at any point in the dialogue to refuse to take on the proposed goal... .Often refusal takes the form of ignoring the initiation ...",
        "However, it is also possible to make such refusals explicit... .",
        "These cases were sufficiently rare ...that it was impractical to include a category for them.” (Carletta, Isard et al.",
        "1997), p. 21,22.",
        "In the hope of broad coverage the possibilities of rejection are made explicit in DMT.",
        "So we conclude that although MAP and DMT are superficially quite different, their approaches to the Maptask are underlyingly quite similar.",
        "Other analysis methods are oriented to other tasks, with tutoring being perhaps the most common.",

        "As an exercised framework, DMT has an advantage over its predecessor.",
        "It can represent the entirety of a diverse collection of natural dialogues.",
        "Since it provides all of the previous mechanisms and more, and it also covers all of the dialogues that Dialogue Game Theory did.",
        "In addition, DMT gives a formal descriptive place for the many actions it calls Unilaterals, actions that are an integral part of dialogue but do not have a cooperative character.",
        "Because DMT macrogames consist entirely of sets of intentions, because those goals are accepted and dismissed together rather than individually, and because DMT is based on a negotiation metaphor, DMT provides a basis for describing two-party coordinated control of dialogue.",
        "The coverage of DMT is broader than task oriented dialogues, suitably identified.",
        "(While it is possible to label every dialogue as task oriented, which some researchers have done, that is simply a way of withdrawing the term from use.)",
        "If we define “task oriented” as requiring the presence of a joint goal, i.e. a goal that is known and actively pursued by both parties, then even in the narrow sample of use of DMT so far, many of the analyzed dialogues are not task oriented.",
        "DMT has also been able to analyze the entirety of all of the task oriented dialogues to which it has been applied.",
        "Comparing DMT to another analysis method for task oriented dialogue, DMT is able to represent the intention structure and coherence of such dialogues in a task independent manner.",
        "Representation of negotiation of the course of the dialogue is explicit in DMT.",
        "As we have seen, DMT is not linked to linguistic forms, since goals of interaction do not in general map to any specific words or forms.",
        "We could therefore suggest that DMT, perhaps with some augmentation of the set of games, would have a broad multilingual scope of coverage.",
        "It would be worth examining."
