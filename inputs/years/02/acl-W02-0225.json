        "We have described elsewhere (Wood, 2001; Wood and Craggs, 2002) the use of dialogue analysis in communication skills training for health professionals working with cancer patients.",
        "Our initial corpus arises from a study of Macmillan Cancer Care nurses undertaken by the Psychological Medicine Group, University of Manchester, funded by the Cancer Research Campaign.",
        "It consists of 37 dialogues between nurses and patients, each comprising 200-1200 utterances (mostly 300-600).",
        "The nurses’ goal is to learn as much as possible about the patients’ condition, both physical and mental, and to inform the patients about their condition and treatment.",
        "The dialogues are thus genuine, naturally occurring conversations, but occurring in an unusual, highly significant and emotionally charged situation.",
        "We have not yet fully annotated a statistically significant sample, but it is clear even from reading through the corpus that a group of thematically related DAs occur frequently which are rare in previously studied corpora such as Switchboard.",
        "These are DAs which explicitly establish or confirm accurate mutual understanding, either factual or emotional, between the participants (collaborative completions, summaries), or which build rapport through courtesy and appreciation (thanks, apologies).",
        "Protracted closing sequences are characteristic, and tend to have elements of both.",
        "We interpret these patterns as direct responses to the goal-directed and potentially health-critical nature of these dialogues."

        "We take as our point of comparison the corpus of some 200,000+ utterances from the Switchboard corpus tagged with the SWBD-DAMSL tagset (Ju-rafsky et al., 1998).",
        "Of these, 36% are “Statements”, 19% “Continuers”, and 13% “Opinions”, giving a total of 68% of all utterances in the three most common categories.",
        "At the other end of the scale, an original tagset of 220 was reduced to 42 because the rarity of many made statistical analysis impossible.",
        "Even of these 42, 32 occur with less than 1% frequency, 25 less than 0.5%.",
        "Four of the five DAs we will discuss here are among these last 25."

        "The first goal of the nurse in these dialogues is to ascertain the subjectively perceived physical condition of the patient, which reflects the success of previous treatment, and suggests directions for the future.",
        "Factual accuracy is clearly essential if future treatment is to be appropriate.",
        "It is also seen as important that the patient have accurate knowledge of his / her condition and treatment.",
        "Secondly, the nurse is trying to elicit the mental / emotional state of the patient, and any particular concerns or worries he or she has.",
