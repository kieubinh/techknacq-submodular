        "Due to the rapid progress of speech and language processing technologies (Cole et al., 1998; Juang and Furui, 2000), ever-increasing computing power, and vast quantity of social requirements, spoken dialogue systems (SDSs), which promise to provide natural and ubiquitous access to online information and service, have become the focus of many research groups (both academic and industrial) with many projects sponsored by EU, US (D)ARPA and others in the past few years (Zue and Glass, 2000; McTear, 2002; Xu, 2001).",
        "The last decade saw the emergence of a great deal of SDSs.",
        "Despite so much progress, some problems still remain, prominent among which are usability and reusability (or portability across domains and languages).",
        "Through a survey of typical working spoken (or natural language) dialogue systems in the nineties (Xu, 2001), we find their central controlling component – dialogue management – is relatively less well-established than other components.",
        "In most working SDSs, the design of dialogue management is usually guided by some principles (den Os et al., 1999), strategies (Souvignier et al., 2000), or objectives (Lamel et al., 2000).",
        "In some even these guidelines are implicit.",
        "The problem is more outstanding in those SDSs developed by the speech recognition community, in which most working SDSs come into being.",
        "Among many causes, we think, the most important is that dialogue management is short of solid theoretical support from dialogue models (the distinction between dialogue management and dialogue model will be explicated in section 2), in addition to the design of SDSs being a real world problem.",
        "The approach we adopt in building dialogue management model for SDSs is to study human-human dialogues solving the same or similar problem.",
        "Though human-computer dialogues may be different in some aspects from human-human dialogues, the design of human-computer dialogue will benefit a lot from the study of human-human dialogues.",
        "It will not be clear whether those that characterize human-human dialogues are applicable to human-computer dialogues until they are well studied.",
        "Applicable or not, they are sure to contribute some insights to the design of dialogue management.",
        "In what follows we first inspect main approaches to dialogue modeling and dialogue management and find two deep causes behind the gap between them (section 2).",
        "Against the causes we propose a generic dialogue model which distinguishes five ranks of discourse units and three levels of dialogue dynamics (section 3).",
        "Then we apply it to information-seeking (one of the most common tasks adopted in the study of SDSs) dialogues and elaborate interaction patterns as utterance groups, which are classified along two dimensions (initiative and direction of information flow) into four basic types with some variations (section 4).",
        "We also experiment on segmenting utterance groups in our corpus with a subject and three algorithms."

        "There are mainly two approaches to dialogue modeling: pattern-based and plan-based.2",
        "Patten-based approach models recurrent interaction patterns or regularities in dialogues at the illocutionary force level of speech acts (Austin, 1962; Searle, 1969) in terms of dialogue grammar (Sinclair and Coulthard, 1975), dialogue/conversational game (Carlson, 1983; Kowtko et al., 1992; Mann, 2001), or adjacency pairs (Sacks et al., 1974).",
        "It benefits a lot from the insights of discourse analysis (Sinclair and Coulthard, 1975; Coulthard, 1992; Brown and Yule, 1983) and conversation analysis (Levinson, 1983).",
        "Plan-based approach relates speech acts performed in utterances to plans and complex mental states (Cohen and Perrault, 1979; Allen and Perrault, 1980; Lochbaum et al., 2000) and uses AI planning techniques (Fikes and Nilsson, 1971).",
        "Later developments of plan-based dialogue models include multilevel plan extension (Litman and Allen, 1987; Litman and Allen, 1990; Carberry, 1990; Lambert and Carberry, 1991), theories of joint action (Cohen and Levesque, 1991) and SharedPlan (Grosz and Sidner, 1990; Grosz and Kraus, 1996).",
        "Pattern-based dialogue model describes what happens in dialogues at the speech act level and cares little about why.",
        "Plan-based dialogue model explains why agents act in dialogues, but at the expense of complex representation and reasoning.",
        "In other words, the former is shallow and descriptive and the latter is deep and explanatory.",
        "Hulstijn (2000) argues for the complementary aspects of the two approaches and claims that “dialogue games are recipes for joint action”.",
        "Since, on the one hand, our target tasks belong to the class of simple service, like information-seeking and simple transactions, which are relatively well-structured and well-defined and not too complex for pattern-based dialogue models, on the other hand, there are some significant problems in using plan-based models in practical SDSs – those of “knowledge representation, knowledge engineering, computational complexity, and noisy input” (Allen et al., 2000), we will choose pattern-based instead of plan-based dialogue model as our theoretical basis for practical dialogue management at present."

        "A more challenging task – group pattern recognition – is under way (Xu, 2002).",
        "After that we will investigate how local discourse structure in terms of utterance group structure could contribute to the recognition of dialogue act (UT-2).",
