        "The application of large-scale genomics and proteomics technologies towards a wide variety of biological questions has resulted in a continuous stream of information regarding thousands of genes and gene products into the Medline database of biomedical abstracts.",
        "This repository has been recognized as a rich knowledge source for biological information retrieval, information extraction and text mining.",
        "However, abbreviated scientific abstracts cannot contain the same volume of information as the full text articles that they represent.",
        "It was recently shown that only 30% of protein interactions contained in the Dictionary of Interacting Proteins (DIP) (Xenarios et al., 2000) could be found in Medline sentences containing DIP protein pairs (Blaschke et al., 2000).",
        "This finding suggests that current information extraction efforts being applied to biomedical abstracts should be extended to full text databases.",
        "The basic task of identifying gene and protein names is a necessary first step towards making full use of the information encoded in biomedical text.",
        "This remains a challenging task due to the irregularities and ambiguities in gene and protein nomenclature.",
        "The irregularities are mainly the result of a lack of naming conventions, as well as the widespread practice of using many synonyms for one gene or protein.",
        "A glance at the Nomenclature section of the Nature Genetics website (http://www.nature.com/ng/web specials/nomen /) shows the scope of the problem, as well as ideas for addressing it.",
        "The nomenclature guidelines implore authors to consult relevant nomenclature committees before announcing new genes, and to provide synonyms for genes in abstracts.",
        "Additional rules specify that:",
        "4.",
        "Gene symbols are always italicised and never contain hyphens, greek letters, roman numerals, subscripts or superscripts.",
        "5.",
        "All letters in human genes are upper-case ... all letters in mouse genes are lower-case...",
        "Unfortunately, we are currently at a stage where these types of rules are not consistently applied to most biomedical abstracts, let alone to full text documents.",
        "Until the biomedical community adheres uniformly to nomenclature guidelines, ambiguities regarding gene/protein names will continue to be an obstacle for natural language processing of biomedical text.",
        "These ambiguities become apparent at the morphological, syntactic and semantic levels.",
        "For example, caco-2 refers to a cell line, but pai-1 is a gene name.",
        "Gene and protein names can contain verbs and other parts of speech that are hard to distinguish from the surrounding text, as in deleted in azoospermia-like, son of sevenless, ran, man, young arrest and never in mitosis.",
        "Genes can be transfected into cells, or combined with chemicals, resulting in ambiguous terms like CHO -A(3) and ca2+/calmodulin.",
        "The semantic notion of a gene or protein is quite arbitrary – is ACTTGGAATGACC a gene name?",
        "In addition to sequences, there are mutations, motifs, receptors, antibodies, hormones, channels, chromosomal locations and disease loci to consider.",
        "The domain-specific irregularities and ambiguities just described are superimposed upon the ambiguities in the natural language itself, so it is not surprising that the identification of gene and protein names in biomedical text remains a difficult and challenging task.",
        "The methodologies applied to this fundamental problem include rule-based and/or pattern matching methods (Fukuda et al., 1998) (Thomas et al., 2000) (Yoshida et al., 2000) (Jenssen et al., 2001) (Ono et al., 2001) (Yu at al, 2002) (Bunescu et al., 2002), a modified BLAST algorithm (Krauthammer et al., 2000), Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (Collier et al., 2000) (Proux et al., 1998), Naive Bayes and decision trees (Nobata et al., 1999), under specified parsing with knowledge sources (Rindflesch et al., 2000), and context-free grammars (Gaizauskas, 2000).",
        "In this paper, we evaluate the application of a gene and protein name tagger trained on Medline abstracts (ABGene) (Tanabe and Wilbur, 2002) to a randomly selected set of 1,000 PUBMEDCENTRAL (PMC) articles.",
        "PMC is a digital archive of full text peer-reviewed biomedical articles launched in February 2000 by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) (Roberts et al., 2001).",

        "The context words were automatically generated by a probabilistic algorithm, using the LocusLink/Gene Ontology set and a large collection of texts in which these gene names occur.",
        "We computed a log odds score or Bayesian weight for all non-gene name words indicating their propensity to predict an adjacent gene name in the texts.",
        "Compound word names are recovered using terms that occur frequently in known gene names.",
        "Recombination of these terms produce compound words that also tend to be gene/protein names.",
        "These terms include the digits 1-9, the letters a-z, the roman numerals, the Greek letters, functional descriptors (adhesion), organism identifiers (hamster), activity descriptors (promoting), placement indicators (early), and generic descriptors (light).",
        "In addition to the 415 exact terms, we added regular expressions that allow for partial matches or special patterns such as words without vowels, words with numbers and letters, words in capital letters, and common prefixes and suffixes (-gene, -like, -ase).",
        "Finally, Bayesian learning (Langley 1996, Mitchell 1997, Wilbur 2000) is applied to rank documents by similarity to documents with known gene/protein names.",

        "High scoring windows often hid false positives, and low scoring windows could contain gene and protein name contexts infrequently encountered in Medline abstracts.",
