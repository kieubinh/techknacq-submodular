        "We propose two internal methods for accenting unknown words, which both learn on a reference set of accented words the contexts of occurrence of the various accented forms of a given letter.",
        "One method is adapted from POS tagging, the other is based on finite state transducers.",
        "We show experimental results for letter e on the French version of the Medical Subject Headings thesaurus.",
        "With the best training set, the tagging method obtains a precision-recall breakeven point of 84.2±4.4% and the transducer method 83.8±4.5% (with a baseline at 64%) for the unknown words that contain this letter.",
        "A consensus combination of both increases precision to 92.0±3.7% with a recall of 75%.",

        "The ISO-latin family, Unicode or the Universal Character Set have been around for some time now.",
        "They cater, among other things, for letters which can bear different diacritic marks.",
        "For instance, French uses four accented es (éèêë) besides the unaccented form e. Some of these accented forms correspond to phonemic differences.",
        "The correct handling of such accented letters, beyond US ASCII, has not been immediate and general.",
        "Although suitable character encodings are widely available and used, some texts or terminologies are still, for historical reasons, written with unaccented letters.",
        "For instance, in the French version of the US National Library of Medicine’s Medical Subject Headings thesaurus (MeSH, (INS, 2000)), all the terms are written in unaccented uppercase letters.",
        "This causes difficulties when these terms are used in Natural Language interfaces or for automatically indexing textual documents: a given unaccented word may match several words, giving rise to spurious ambiguities such as, e.g., marche matching both the unaccented marche (walking) and the accented marché (market).",
        "Removing all diacritics would simplify matching, but would increase ambiguity, which is already pervasive enough in natural language processing systems.",
        "Another of our aims, besides, is to build language resources (lexicons, morphological knowledge bases, etc.)",
        "for the medical domain (Zweigenbaum, 2001) and to learn linguistic knowledge from terminologies and corpora (Grabar and Zweigenbaum, 2000), including the MeSH.",
        "We would rather work, then, with linguistically sound data in the first place.",
        "We therefore endeavored to produce an accented version of the French MeSH.",
        "This thesaurus includes 19,971 terms and 9,151 synonyms, with 21,475 different word forms.",
        "Human reaccentuation of the full thesaurus is a time-consuming, error-prone task.",
        "As in other instances of preparation of linguistic resources, e.g., part-of-speech-tagged corpora or treebanks, it is generally more efficient for a human to correct a first annotation than to produce it from scratch.",
        "This can also help obtain better consistency over volumes of data.",
        "The issue is then to find a method for (semi-)automatic accentuation.",
        "The CISMeF team of the Rouen University Hospital already accented some 5,500 MeSH terms that are used as index terms in the CISMeF online catalog of French-language medical Internet sites (Darmoni et al., 2000) (www.chu-rouen.fr/cismef).",
        "This first means that less material has to be reac-cented.",
        "Second, this accented portion of the MeSH might be usable as training material for a learning procedure.",
        "However, the methods we found in the literature do not address the case of ‘unknown’ words, i.e., words that are not found in the lexicon used by the accenting system.",
        "Despite the recourse to both general and specialized lexicons, a large number of the MeSH words are in this case, for instance those in table 1.",
        "One can argue indeed that the compila",
        "tion of a larger lexicon should reduce the proportion of unknown words.",
        "But these are for the most part specialized, rare words, some of which we did not find even in a large reference medical dictionary (Garnier and Delamare, 1992).",
        "It is then reasonable to try to accentuate automatically these unknown words to help human domain experts perform faster post-editing.",
        "Moreover, an automatic accentuation method will be reusable for other unaccented textual resources.",
        "For instance, the ADM (Medical Diagnosis Aid) knowledge base online at Rennes University (Seka et al., 1997) is another large resource which is still in unaccented uppercase format.",
        "We first review existing methods (section 2).",
        "We then present two trainable accenting methods (section 3), one adapted from part-of-speech tagging, the other based on finite-state transducers.",
        "We show experimental results for letter e on the French MeSH (section 4) with both methods and their combination.",
        "We finally discuss these results (section 5) and conclude on further research directions."

      "heading": "2 Background",
      "text": [
        "Previous work has addressed text accentuation, with an emphasis on the cases where all possible words are assumed to be known (listed in a lexicon).",
        "The issue in that case is to disambiguate unaccented words when they match several possible accented word forms in the lexicon – the marche/marché examples in the introduction.",
        "Yarowsky (1999) addresses accent restoration in Spanish and in French, and notes that they can be linked to part-of-speech ambiguities and to semantic ambiguities which context can help to resolve.",
        "He proposes three methods to handle these: N-gram tagging, Bayesian classification and decision lists, which obtain the best results.",
        "These methods rely either on full words, on word suffixes or on parts-of-speech.",
        "They are tested on ‘the most problematic cases of each ambiguity type’, extracted from the Spanish AP Newswire.",
        "The agreement with human accented words reaches 78.4–98.4% depending on ambiguity type.",
        "Spriet and El-Bèze (1997) use an N-gram model on parts-of-speech.",
        "They evaluate this method on a 19,000 word test corpus consisting of news articles and obtain a 99.31 % accuracy.",
        "In this corpus, only 2.6% of the words were unknown, among which 89.5% did not need accents.",
        "The resulting error rate (0.3%) accounts for nearly one half of the total error rate, but is so small that it is not worth trying to guess accentuation for unknown words.",
        "The same kind of approach is used in project RÉACC (Simard, 1998).",
        "Here again, unknown words are left untouched, and account for one fourth of the errors.",
        "We typed the words in table 1 through the demonstration interface of RÉACC online at www-rali.iro.umontreal.ca/Reacc/: none of these words was accented by the system (7 out of 16 do need accentuation).",
        "When the unaccented words are in the lexicon, the problem can also be addressed as a spelling correction task, using methods such as string edit distance (Levenshtein, 1966), possibly combined with the previous approach (Ruch et al., 2001).",
        "However, these methods have limited power when a word is not in the lexicon.",
        "At best, they might say something about accented letters in grammatical affixes which mark contextual, syntactic constraints.",
        "We found no specific reference about the accentuation of such ‘unknown’ words: a method that, when a word is not listed in the lexicon, proposes an accented version of that word.",
        "Indeed, in the above works, the proportion of unknown words is too small for specific steps to be taken to handle them.",
        "The situation is quite different in our case, where about one fourth of the words are ‘unknown’.",
        "Moreover, contextual clues are scarce in our short, often ungrammatical terms.",
        "We took obvious measures to reduce the number of unknown words: we filtered out the words that can be found in accented lexicons and corpora.",
        "But this technique is limited by the size of the corpus that would be necessary for such ‘rare’ words to occur, and by the lack of availability of specialized French lexicons for the medical domain.",
        "We then designed two methods that can learn accenting rules for the remaining unknown words: (i) adapting a POS-tagging method (Brill, 1995) (section 3.3); (ii) adapting a method designed for learning morphological rules (Theron and Cloete, 1997) (section 3.4)."

        "stance, pilo/erection fails to receive the é of rne=é (^ érection), apic/ectomie erroneously receives an é as in cc=é (cécité).",
        "An accurate morpheme seg-menter would be needed to provide suitable input to this process without again adding noise to it.",
        "In some instances, no accentuation decision could be made because no example had been learnt for a specific context (e.g., accentuation of céfalo in ce-faloglycine).",
        "We also uncovered accentuation inconsistencies in both the already accented MeSH words and the validated sample (e.g., bacterium or bactérium in different compounds).",
        "Cross-checking on the Web confirmed the variability in the accentuation of rare words.",
        "This shows the difficulty to obtain consistent human accentuation across large sets of complex words.",
        "One potential development of the present automated accentuation methods could be to check the consistency of word lists.",
        "In addition, we discovered spelling errors in some MeSH terms (e.g., bethane-chol instead of betanechol prevents the proper accentuation of beta).",
        "Finally, further testing is necessary to check the relevance of these methods to other accented letters in French and in other languages."
