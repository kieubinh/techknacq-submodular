        "In a subsequent study, Chute and Elkin (1997) suggested that qualifiers (including adjectival modifiers) be available as a separate axis, in order to both increase the ex-pressivity of a terminology and reduce its complexity by limiting the number of pre-coordinated terms.",

        "This process makes the input and target terms potentially compatible by eliminating such inessential differences as inflection, case and hyphen variation, as well as word order variation.",

        "Step 2.",
        "Identifying (adj+, noun*, head) phrases Since this method is based on adjectival modification, the syntactic analysis was used to restrict the original sets of MEDLINE phrases and Metathesaurus terms to phrases and terms having the following structure: (adj+, noun*, head).",
        "The phrase is required to start with an adjectival modifier, possibly followed by other adjectives and end with a head noun, possibly preceded by other nouns.",

        "The number of demodified terms is 2m – 1, m being the number of adjectival modifiers.",
        "For example, the term chronic sciatic constriction injury starts with the two adjectival modifiers chronic and sciatic, so that the following three demodified terms are generated sciatic constriction injury, chronic constriction injury, and constriction injury.",
        "Although there is no need to demodify UMLS terms in this study, the removal of adjectival modifiers was used to establish a list of adjectives occurring in disorder and procedure terms.",

        "For a given category, an allowable modifier indicates that some terms from this category are modified by this modifier, i.e., that a similarly modified term exists in the Metathesaurus.",
        "Practically, MEDLINE phrases whose adjectival modifiers do not all belong to the list of allowable modifiers are excluded from further analysis, because, by definition, there will be no similarly modified term in the Metathesaurus.",

        "Searching for demodified terms in the Metathesaurus The second requirement for a MEDLINE phrase to become a candidate term is that a demodified term created from this phrase be found in the terminology.",

        "Step 6.",
        "Hooking candidate terms to the terminology The remaining step consists of finding the appropriate hook in the terminology for the candidate term.",
        "Based on the fact that modification is normally associated with a hyponymic relation, tentative parents for the candidate term will be those that map to the demodified terms generated from this term.",
        "When only one demodified term maps to a Metathesaurus concept, this concept is selected as the tentative parent for the candidate term.",
        "When several demodified terms map to Metathesaurus concepts, the preference is given to the concept that is likely to be closest to the term.",
        "As a surrogate for closeness, we use the following heuristics: 1) the fewer modifiers removed, the closer the terms, and 2) the candidate term and the demodified term are closer if the modifier removed is the leftmost modifier.",

        "The errors discovered during the manual review illustrate some of the limitations of this method.",
        "More exactly, these limitations are common to many NLP applications.",
        "Although acronyms were sometimes associated with their correct meaning in the Metathesaurus, in the set of terms reviewed manually, the presence of acronyms was responsible for 22% of the non-relevant associations.",
        "For example, the MEDLINE term individual black rats, whose two adjectival modifiers are allowable disease modifiers, is wrongly identified as a hypo-nym of recurrent acute tonsillitis because the acronym RAT is associated (as a synonym) with the disease recurrent acute tonsillitis in the Metathesaurus.",
        "In some cases, failure to identify the correct part of speech also resulted in inaccurate associations (e.g., controlling stress to stress where controlling was actually not an adjective).",
        "Not all truncated terms present in the Metathesaurus synonyms of some concepts are identified as such.",
        "When not identified, truncated terms are used for the mapping, sometimes resulting in inaccurate associations.",
        "For example, the candidate term urinary protein is wrongly associated with the concept protein measurement because protein is considered a synonym for the procedure protein measurement in the Metathesaurus.",
        "Sometimes, the association is not inaccurate, but the concept associated with the candidate term is very general, and the relationship weakly informative.",
        "For example, once demodified, aplastic syndrome is associated with syndrome, a concept close to the top of the hierarchy.",
        "Although aplastic syndrome is a valid hyponym of syndrome, it would be more accurately categorized as a kind of hematologic syndrome, which requires domain knowledge unavailable here.",
        "Finally, in some cases, because hyponymy is the only relation considered, the association of a candidate term with a Metathesaurus concept, although relevant, is not necessarily the closest possible.",
        "For example, the term colonic vaginal fistula is correctly associated with its hypernym vaginal fistula, but fails to be identified as a synonym of the concept fistula of vagina to large intestine.",
        "Practically, in a completely automatic setting, the use of this algorithm could result in creating several concepts for the same meaning."

        "This algorithm can be tuned from a strict mode, allowing fewer phrases to automatically become candidate terms, but with greater precision, to a relaxed mode, selecting a larger number of candidate terms when recall is the priority.",
        "The latter would require some supervision prior to integrating the candidate terms into the terminology.",
        "Almost all the limitations mentioned above can be addressed.",
        "Terms containing acronyms could be identified and eliminated before mapping to the Metathesaurus.",
        "Part of speech taggers trained on a terminology would more accurately identify the part of speech of words that can be both adjectives and nouns.",
        "Truncated Metathesaurus terms should be systematically excluded from the index used for mapping.",
        "Methods for identifying synonymy based on derivational variation or other techniques could also be investigated.",
        "Moreover, additional refinement could be brought to this method.",
        "For example, when demodified terms are created, the removal of adjectives could be restricted to the leftmost, thus maximally preserving the structure of the remaining noun phrase, and therefore limiting the risks of association with a semantically distant concept.",
        "Finally, using statistical information about the distribution of adjectival modifiers could provide a surrogate for the strength of the association.",
        "For example, knowing that many diseases can be acute, if this adjective is found in the corpus as the modifier of a disease concept, this association could be accepted with a confidence proportional to the relative frequency of this modifier for all diseases, in the case of acute for a disease, a high confidence."

        "This would include domains such as anatomy or physiology.",
