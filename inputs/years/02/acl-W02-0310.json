        "The practice of evidence-based medicine, which gained popularity in the last decade, has encouraged clinicians to understand and utilize critically appraised published research evidence.",
        "The tremendous increase of biomedical knowledge resources in electronic form, particularly on the World Wide Web, has generated a great deal of interest.",
        "The increased availability of information does not make it easy for clinicians to filter large amounts of information and incorporate evidence to clinical practice.",
        "Although the number of clinicians and medical students who routinely perform their own searches has increased, they still have difficulty keeping-up-to-date with advances in medical science.",
        "(Gorman and Helfand, 1995) Decision support tools designed to provide relevant and current evidence to clinicians promise to substantially improve health care quality (Haynes, Hayward, and Lomas, 1995 ;Rodrigues, 2000 ;Sim, et al., 2001) and potentially reduce medical errors.",
        "(Bates, et al., 2001) Such tools include those that facilitate the access to, extraction of, and summarization of evidence.",
        "The Evidence and Decision Support track of the 2000 AMIA Spring Symposium examined the challenges in the development and adoption of clinical decision support systems for evidence-based practice.",
        "(Sim, et al., 2001) The speakers for the Evidence and Decision Support track described five central areas of activity as essential for the adoption of those systems.",
        "Two of the areas were a) the capture of both literature-based and practice based research evidence into machine-interpretable form, and b) the establishment of a technical and methodological foundation for applying research evidence to individual patients at the point of care.",
        "Abstract We describe the use of clinical data present in the medical record to determine the relevance of research evidence from literature databases.",
        "We studied the effect of using automated knowledge approaches as compared to physician’s selection of articles, when using a traditional information retrieval system.",
        "Three methods were evaluated.",
        "The first method identified terms and their semantics and relationships in the patient’s record to build a map of the record, which was represented in conceptual graph notation.",
        "This approach was applied to data in an individual’s medical record and used to score citations retrieved using a graph matching algorithm.",
        "The second method identified associations between terms in the medical record, assigning them semantic types and weights based on the co-occurrence of these associations in citations of biomedical literature.",
        "The method was applied to data in an individual’s medical record and used to score citations.",
        "The last method combined the first two.",
        "The results showed that physicians agreed better with each other than with the automated methods.",
        "However, we found a significant positive relation between physicians’ selection of abstracts and two of the methods.",
        "We believe the results encourage the use of clinical data to determine the relevance of medical literature to the care of individual patients.",
        "Our goal is to improve the way retrieved medical literature is presented by identifying critical information in the individual medical record that is useful for determining the relevance of literature data, also called research evidence.",

        "Identifying the important terms, their semantic types, and common relationships maybe an interesting solution to the problem.",

        "The UMLS Semantic Net recommends which concepts and relations can be sensibly combined.",
        "Coded data (e.g., laboratory tests) were also represented as conceptual graphs.",
        "We used the MED to infer knowledge when appropriate.",
        "For instance, when a glucose measure of 150 mg/dl was retrieved, the information in the MED allowed us to infer that the result could also be interpreted as hyperglycemia.",
        "The MED was also used to map concepts in the electronic medical record to UMLS concepts in order to obtain their semantic types.",

        "(Maher, 1993 ;Poole and Campbell, 1995) It worked as follows:",
        "1. graphs on both sides (clinical data and citations) are broken into subgraphs; 2. subgraphs of clinical data are then compared to subgraphs of the citations; 3. if a perfect match is found (semantic type and relationship) a score of 1 is given.",
        "If not, points are reduced for each type of relation that did not match.",
        "Points are reduced based on the UMLS semantic types and relationship hierarchy (UMLS Semantic Net); 4. indirect matches are searched; 5. the score is then normalized based on the number of subgraphs generated by each graph, and the number of graphs in the document.",

        "A knowledge base containing the statistically significant semantic type associations found in MEDLINE by Mendonça and Cimino was built.",

        "The knowledge base contains three groups of associations: therapy, etiology and diagnosis.",
        "The associations are grouped based on the type of questions the citations were retrieved to answer.",

        "The association weights are based on the co-occurrence of these associations in citations of biomedical literature.",

        "(Wilczynski, McKibbon, and Haynes, 2001) No single physician stood out as significantly different from the others.",
        "The graph matching algorithm highly correlated with physicians’ average, although it did not perform as well as individual physicians.",
        "This finding encourages the use of clinical data to determine the relevance of medical literature to the care of individual patients.",
        "In an integrated system (medical record with information resources) this positive correlation suggests that our method can facilitate presentation of online biomedical literature.",
        "For instance, if the electronic medical record is integrated to an existent information retrieval, findings from an individual medical record can be used to rearrange the way retrieved information is presented; in a way that literature matching that individual’s medical record will be presented first, rather than the usual presentation in reverse chronological order.",
        "The combined method also correlated significantly with physicians’ average, although its performance was not as good as of the simple graph matching.",
        "This result may be due to a negative effect of the associations in the knowledge over the matching.",

        "The automated method based on the chronological order of articles did not correlate with physicians’ average.",

        "The terms used for indexing medical citations may not correspond well to data usually found in medical records.",
        "Approaches using the UMLS Semantic Net may be also somewhat limited by the fact approximately one fourth of the Metathesaurus concepts are assigned several semantic types, which makes it difficult to get a precise understanding of the co-occurrences.",
