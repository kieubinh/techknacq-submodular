        "The rapidly growing volume of scientific literature, a by-product of intensive research in molecular biology and bioinformatics, necessitates efficient and effective information access to the published text sources.",
        "Information retrieval (IR) techniques employed in WWW interfaces such as PubMed and Entrez are very useful in browsing bibliographic databases and in facilitating the linking between protein or genome sequences and related references.",
        "But the jobs of automatically locating and extracting specific information within the texts require more specialised Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and have been the object of work in information extraction (IE) or text mining ((Cowie and Lehnert, 1996)).",
        "While current work on IE in biology has concentrated by and large on the refinement of IE techniques and improving their accuracy, the incorporation of an IE system’s output into effective interfaces that genuinely assist the biological researcher in his/her work is equally important, and has been neglected to date.",
        "Of course improving IE techniques, their accuracy and cross-domain portability are important research objectives for language technology researchers.",
        "But given that the techniques will remain imperfect for the foreseeable future, we must also ask how biologists can benefit today from the limited capabilities of existing IE technology.",
        "In this paper we describe an approach to providing effective access to the results of the Protein Active Site Template Acquisition (PASTA) system (Humphreys et al., 2000; Demetriou et al., 2002), an IE system that extracts information about amino acid residues in protein structures and their roles in protein active sites directly from the published literature.",
        "To experiment with a mechanism for delivering PASTA results to biologist end-users, we have developed the PASTAWeb interface, a WWW-based interface that offers search and browsing facilities to the extracted protein structure information, as well as to the original text sources (MEDLINE",
        "abstracts).",
        "PASTAWeb provides transparent text access and advanced navigation capabilities to enable users to track and display the relevant information from text to text.",
        "The PASTAWeb facilities enable users to find answers to implicit questions such as What are the important residues for trypsin?",
        "or Is serine found in the active site of amylase?",
        "and to track the flow of information for specific classes of biological entities (residues, proteins, species) from text to text.",
        "Given the performance limitations of current IE technology, it is to be expected that some of the extracted information may only be partially correct, missing or spurious.",
        "The PASTAWeb interface compensates for the loss of information by supporting rapid, easy verification by scientists of the extracted information against the source texts."

        "Perhaps not surprisingly, the identification of biomedical terms in scientific texts has proved to be the easiest extraction task and has demonstrated acceptable levels of performance, not too far from the best results achieved in the NE task in the MUC competitions, despite differences between the domains (i.e. names of persons, organisations etc.",
        "in MUC vs. terms identifying proteins, genes, drugs etc.",

        "The techniques used for this task vary from rule-based methods (Fukuda et al., 1998; Humphreys et al., 2000), to statistical methods (Collier et al., 2000) and statistical-rule-based hybrids (Proux et al., 1998).",
        "More complex IE tasks involving the extraction of relational information have also been addressed by the bioinformatics community.",
        "These include protein or gene interactions (Sekimizu et al., 1998; Thomas et al., 2000; Pustejovsky et al., 2002), relations between genes and drugs (Rindflesh et al., 2000) and identification of metabolic pathways (Humphreys et al., 2000).",
        "The range of techniques used in these systems varies considerably, but in most cases requires the application of more sophisticated NLP methods including part-of-speech tagging, phrasal or syntactic parsing and (for some systems) semantic analysis and discourse processing.",
        "To date IE researchers working on biological texts have concentrated on building or porting systems to work in biological domains.",

        "Text Preprocessing The text preprocessing phase aims at low-level text processing tasks including the analysis of the structure of the MEDLINE abstracts in terms of separate sections (e.g. the title, author names, abstract etc.",

        "With respect to tokenisa-tion, tokens are identified at the subword level resulting in the splitting of biochemical compound terms into their constituents which need to be matched separately during the lexical lookup phase.",

        "Additional subcategorisation information is provided for multi-token terms by splitting the terms into their constituents and placing the constituents into subclasses whose combination is determined by grammar rules.",

        "The final index is used to assist the ‘fusion’ of the information in templates generated from multiple texts for the same protein.",
        "This index provides information about those proteins for which there are templates generated from multiple documents.",
        "Due to variations in the expression of the same protein name from text to text, the identification of suitable templates for fusion is not trivial.",
        "The problem of matching variant expressions of the same term in different databases is a well known problem in bioinformatics.",
        "The current implementation of the indexing addresses this problem using simple heuristic rules.",

        "The applicability of the heuristic for finding a “head term” is limited to constituent terms ending in - a s e or - i n (to exclude common words, such as “protein”, “domain” etc.).",
        "For example, the protein terms “scorpion toxin”, “diphtheria toxin” and “toxins” would match with each other because they all include the head term “toxin”.",
        "Consequently, the corresponding template information about the residues occurring in these proteins would be merged into a single table, though information about which slot fillers belong to which term variant is retained.",
        "The decision to do the matching of variant names at the index level and not at the interface level is simply due to operational issues.",
        "Matching the protein names from multiple texts involves the pairwise string comparisons between all proteins in the PASTA templates.",
        "The number of these comparisons increases very rapidly as new texts and templates are added to the database and it was found that is causes considerable delay to the operation of the PASTAWeb interface.",
        "Since information seeking tasks of molecular biologists may require complex navigation capabilities, the storing of the results in “static” HTML pages would have been unsuitable both practically (more difficult to implement pointers between different pieces of information and to alter and maintain pages) and economically (requires more disk space).",
        "We therefore opted for a dynamic page creator that is triggered by the users’ requests expressed as choices over hypertext links.",
        "The dynamic page creator compiles the information from the indices and the associated databases (texts and templates) and sends the results to the WWW browser via a Web server.",
        "In the dynamically created pages, each hypertext link encodes the current frame, the information to be displayed when the link is selected, and the frame in which this information is to be displayed.",
        "For example, the hypertext link for a title of a document encodes information about the document id of the document as well as about the target frame in which the text will be displayed.",
