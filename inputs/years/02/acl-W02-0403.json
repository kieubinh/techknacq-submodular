      "text": [
        "According to (Mani, 2000), the goal of automatic summarization is to take an information source, extract content from it, and present the most important content to the user in a condensed form and in a manner sensitive to the user's or application needs.",
        "In this paper we present an IE-based summarisation system (HaSIE), which aims at producing a summary from annual company reports about the compa-nies' performance on Health and Safety issues.",
        "The extracted summaries allow the automated production of statistical metrics describing the level of compliance with Health and Safety recommendations and any relevant legislation that may be implemented.",
        "The system detects whether or not the text contains information about health and safety and if so, it extracts relevant passages and conceptual information such as awards, accident rates and number of employees.",
        "In this particular application it is vital that we detect correctly whether the report contains health and safety information, because this is one of the main user requirements.",
        "The reason why a given report might not contain such information is because the annual company reports contain primarily financial, managerial and performance information.",
        "This summarisation work has been carried out using the GATE architecture.",
        "It offers support for the majority of tasks typically performed as part of building a new NLP application, e.g. module development and testing, corpus annotation, and performance evaluation.",
        "The framework also has a thorough Unicode support, which enables the development of applications and resources in multiple languages (see (Tablan et al., 2002)).",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the information extraction modules used to develop the HaSIE system.",
        "Section 3 describes in more detail the process of extracting information and creating the summaries.",
        "Next we discuss evaluation in Section 4 and give some preliminary results for our system.",
        "Finally, Section 5 discusses how the HaSIE system is related to other approaches to summarisation.",
        "2 GATE and the HaSIE system A set of reusable modules known as ANNIE (A Nearly New Information Extraction system) is provided with GATE.",
        "These are able to perform basic language processing tasks such as POS tagging and semantic tagging.",
        "This eliminates the need for users to keep reinventing the same resources, and provides a good starting point for new applications.",
        "We used these components as a basis for building the HaSIE summarisation system described below (see Section 2.2)."

      "heading": "2.1 Finite-state transduction support in GATE",
      "text": [
        "In order to make it easier to build new processing resources, GATE comes with built-in finite-state transduction capabilities, which we have used as the core of the summarisation process (see Section 3).",
        "The transducer runs on grammars written in the JAPE (Java Annotations Pattern Engine) language (Cunningham et al., 2002), which describes patterns to match and annotations to be created as a result.",
        "A JAPE grammar consists of a set of phases each of which consists of a set of pattern/action rules, and which run sequentially.",
        "Patterns can be specified by describing a specific text string, or existing annotations (e.g. annotations created by the tokeniser, gazetteer, part-of-speech tagger, or document format analysis).",
        "Rule prioritisation (if activated) prevents multiple assignment of annotations to the same text string.",
        "Creating new modules and applications on the basis of JAPE, such as a summarisation component for another domain, is a low-overhead task, because the user only needs to be concerned with writing new grammar rules (though other modules such as the gazetteer may also need to be updated or modified).",
        "The amount of tuning necessary for a new domain can vary depending on the type of information that needs to be extracted, and how similar the domain and text structure is to that which existing components are designed for.",
        "For example, we reuse much of the same information about companies, dates, numbers, etc from the default Information Extraction components, so very little tuning was needed in this case, especially since the patterns we aim to identify for health and safety are quite easy to define, but this cannot be guaranteed for all other domains or applications.",
        "So far, we have successfully used JAPE for named entity recognition, sentence splitting, and summarisation, and we intend to experiment with it in other fields such as shallow syntactic parsing.",
        "Although at the moment we are using hand-crafted rules, it would be possible for an application to learn rules automatically for the Jape transducers in a manner similar to (Day et al., 1997).",
        "These rules could then be verified or amended by a human if necessary, as they are human readable."

        "HaSIE uses a set of Named Entity Recognition modules adapted from the ANNIE information extraction system.",

        "The gazetteer lists were updated with keywords, and new rules were added to the semantic tagger.",
        "These modules annotate specific words and phrases related to health and safety (e.g. \"HSE\", \"Occupational Health\") with an HSE label, accidents (e.g. \"accident\", \"injury\", \"death\") with an Accident label, and dates, company names, etc.",

        "\"Environment\" annotations on their own again do not provide much evidence, but when combined with an HSE annotation are again much more strongly linked with health and safety.",

        "These are identified using rules based on entities such as percentages, accident entities, and numbers.",
        "We currently use two rules to identify accident statistics.",

        "The principle behind this was that the users considered it top priority for the system to find the highly relevant sections; ideally, the system should also find the moderately relevant sections, but this was not so important; the system should not identify any of the irrelevant sections, although this was again less important than finding the relevant sections.",
        "This meant that the system should be tuned slightly more towards recall than Precision.",

        "After these changes were implemented, 7 of the 10 problematic summaries no longer contained the irrelevant senteces.",
        "After improving the system to deal with keyword ambiguities, we then created a manually annotated HSE summary corpus for 80 of the company reports.",
        "To this end, we used HaSIE to bootstrap the annotation process and then correct its results manually, using the visual document annotation editor from GATE.",
        "This corpus was used to measure the system's performance, using GATE's evaluation tools described in Section 4.1.",
        "Results show that overall the system achieved 78% precision and 80% recall, which is consistent with the performance estimates we obtained from the formative evaluation, after we discarded the irrelevant sentences which were no longer included after the ambiguity improvements.",
        "Furthermore, in 70% of the reports, the system identified the presence of health and safety data correctly, and in 15% of these, the system found this data correctly where humans had failed to find it.",
        "The system only missed this data in 1 report, and in all the remaining reports, the system correctly identified that there was no health and safety data present.",
        "The system generated 70 pages output from approximately 6000 pages of reports, thereby creating a substantial reduction in the workload of the experts who wished to make use of the relevant data.",
        "Although 80 reports might seem a small number of texts on which to perform an evaluation, this is the current scale at which human analysts are performing this task manually each year.",
