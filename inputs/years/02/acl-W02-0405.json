        "The goal that motivated the creation of Searchable LEAD in news documents in the LexisNexis collection was to provide some customer segments with a tool that helps them focus their retrieval results on a limited number of highly relevant documents, where a highly relevant document with respect to some query is a document that is substantially about the query topic.",
        "A good, general purpose document summary should capture the major topics presented in a document.",
        "Presumably if we can capture major topics in summaries, then a search that is restricted to summaries should do a better job of limiting retrieval results to highly relevant documents about those topics.",
        "To support this, we created Searchable LEAD, a process that identifies and labels the leading sentences or paragraphs of news documents as a separate searchable LEAD field.",
        "A customer’s query, e.g., BUSH AND GORE, could easily be limited to the LEAD, e.g., LEAD(BUSH AND GORE), or HEADLINE and LEAD combination, e.g., HLEAD(BUSH AND GORE).",
        "Through three separate experiments, the value of leading text as a general purpose summary for news documents has been verified.",
        "This paper describes a fourth experiment that investigates whether and how searches limited to this type of summary benefit the targeted customers In many information retrieval experiments, a single user perspective, i.e., a single answer key, is used to evaluate the results.",
        "If that perspective matches that of the targeted customer set, the evaluation is meaningful.",
        "However, different customer segments perform information seeking tasks with different goals and perspectives in mind, even when they are interested in the same topic.",
        "Just as potential search tool enhancements are not one-size-fits-all, a one-size-fits-all answer key should not be used to determine the value of a search aid for two sets of customers with fundamentally different goals.",
        "In this experiment, the results of each query were evaluated using two different user perspectives, highly relevant references only and all references.",
        "Through this approach we were able to determine whether Searchable LEAD satisfied the goal that motivated its creation."

        "(1995) compared summaries they created using tf-idf-based sentence extraction to fixed amounts of leading text – approximately 60, 150 and 250 words long, in three separate trials – generated using a slightly modified version of our production Searchable LEAD text processing software.",
        "In that effort, Searchable LEAD-based extracts were judged to be acceptable as summaries for general news articles 92% of the time.",
        "This compared favorably to the 74% reported for those summaries created through sentence extraction.",

        "Searchable LEAD-based extracts resulted in an average compression ratio of 13% in that test.",
        "Compression ratios generally ranged between about 5-20% for most documents, depending on document length; with Searchable LEAD, the number of leading sentences and paragraphs included in the leading text field was linked to document length.",

        "For long documents, Searchable LEAD might consist of the first three paragraphs or more of the document.",

        "(1995) also reported on the results of a limited experiment examining the differences between summary-only versus full-text searching.",
        "In tests involving twelve Boolean queries applied to a corpus of about 20,000 documents extracted from the LexisNexis NEWS library, they found that average precision increased from 37% for searches applied to full-text to 45% for searches applied to sentence extraction-based extracts and 47% for searches applied to leading text-based extracts.",

        "(Relative recall assumes that the full-text queries achieved 100% recall; due to limited resources on the project, there was no attempt to determine actual recall rates.)",
        "In addition to its limited scale, there were two key problems with this evaluation.",
        "First, although Brandow et al.",
        "(1995) correctly reported that Searchable LEAD was introduced to enhance search precision, Searchable LEAD also targeted only a subset of our customer segments, specifically those customers who wanted to retrieve only highly relevant documents (in LexisNexis-internal jargon, we refer to these as on-point or major reference documents).",
        "This point was not mentioned in Brandow et al.",
        "(1995), nor was it reflected in their search evaluation.",
        "Second, the convenience of using relative recall notwithstanding, this approach to measuring recall will generally magnify the difference in recall that should be expected when comparing full-text and summary-only search results.",
        "Sumita & Iida (1997) tested both leading text-based extracts and tf-idf-based sentence extracts of up to three sentences in an experiment involving 10 queries and 600 Japanese language news articles.",
        "They reported that limiting searches to such summaries both improved the effectiveness for retrieving highly relevant documents, but also helped exclude other relevant documents with lower levels of relevance.",
        "Sakai & Sparck Jones (2001) examined the value of summaries for general information retrieval and a pseudo-relevance feedback model, in their case using 30 queries applied to a nearly-39,000 document corpus derived from the TREC collection.",
        "The Okapi Basic Search System was used.",
        "Precision evaluation focused on both the top 1000 and top 10 relevance ranked documents retrieved.",
        "The authors concluded that a summary-only search may be as effective as full-text for precision-oriented searching of highly relevant documents.",

        "It is not reasonable to assume that all of the people using those services have the same perspective on relevance, and yet that is often how we evaluate new search aids and features.",
        "Our customers employ a variety of search strategies, depending on their topics, information interests, and the point they are at in their information seeking task.",
        "At one end, we see some customers just starting out on an information seeking task, where they typically are looking for a few highly relevant documents to help introduce themselves to the topic.",
        "Basically they are trying to provide themselves with a good starting point.",
        "At the other extreme, we see customers in public relations, competitive intelligence or in the due diligence phase of their information seeking task.",
        "These customers often want to retrieve all references to the topic, even those documents that provide even the most limited or mundane information.",
        "Although some may see this simply as the customary recall-precision trade-off, that is not the case.",
        "A document that contains a passing reference to some topic is relevant to those with the all reference evaluation scope (retrieval of that document is considered successful recall), but it is irrelevant to those with a highly relevant reference evaluation scope (retrieval of that document is considered a precision error).",
        "A document’s relevance with respect to some customer’s evaluation scope is what drives customer perceptions of the resulting recall and precision.",
        "Instead of a recall-precision trade-off, we have multiple evaluation scopes for which recall and precision are determined.",
        "We recognize the differences in evaluation scopes in a single user over time when proposing learning systems and personalization tools that adapt retrieval or routing results to a user’s changing interests (e.g., Lam et al., 1996), but we do not recognize these differences when we use single answer key evaluations.",
        "As a result, over the years, we have seen a number of potentially useful search enhancements dismissed not because they failed to show improvement for any targeted subset of customers, but rather because they failed to show improvement when using a single general evaluation standard (Harmon, 1991; Voorhees, 1994; Sparck Jones, 1999).",
        "Query expansion functionality such as some types of morphological or synonym expansion, for example, may produce a drop in precision that offsets any improvements to recall, but we have found that customer segments who require retrieving all references to their topic are willing to put up with a lot of irrelevant information to make sure that they see everything.",
        "Of course, those customers would still like to have better precision, but they require better recall.",
        "This was also a problem with the limited retrieval experiment reported in Brandow et al.",
        "(1995).",
        "Although Searchable LEAD was introduced specifically to support the subset of users seeking only highly relevant documents, Brandow et al.",
        "(1995) did not make this distinction when evaluating their test of twelve Boolean queries.",
        "For each query evaluated in the experiment reported here, two user evaluation scopes were created.",
        "One represented Searchable LEAD’s targeted customer segment and its desire to retrieve only highly relevant documents; the other represented the due diligence customer segment, which prefers to retrieve all documents that contain information about the topic regardless of how little or how much."
