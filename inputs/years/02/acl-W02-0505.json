        "Human translators and machine translation systems are often faced with the task of transliterating phrases like person names and locations.",
        "Transliteration is the process of replacing words in the source language with their approximate phonetic or spelling equivalents in the target language.",
        "Transliterating names between languages that use similar alphabets and sound systems is often very simple, since the phrase mostly remains the same.",
        "However, the transliteration becomes far more difficult when transliterating between languages with very different sound and writing systems.",
        "When transliterating a name from Arabic into English, there are two types of transliterations:",
        "• Forward Transliteration: This refers to the",
        "transliteration of an Arab name into English.",
        "Typically, many variations of the transliterated name are acceptable.",
        "This is especially true when transliterating between two languages with many phonetic incompatibilities, such as Arabic and English.",
        "For example, the Arab name \"-A. yasr\" 1 can reasonably be transliterated in any of the following ways: Yasir, Yassir, Yaser, Yasser, etc.",
        "• Back-Transliteration: This refers to the reverse transliteration process in order to obtain the original of an English name that has already been transliterated into Arabic.",
        "In this case, typically, only one transliteration is acceptable.",
        "For example, when encountering the name � � � � �9_� rwbrt\" while translating Arabic text into English, the name should only be transliterated as Robert, not as Robert.",
        "Transliterating names from Arabic into English in either direction is a difficult task, mainly due to the differences in their sound and writing systems.",
        "For instance, vowels in Arabic come in two varieties, long and short.",
        "Short vowels are rarely written in Arabic in newspaper text, which makes pronunciation highly ambiguous.",
        "Also, because of the differences in their sound inventory, there is no one-to-one correspondence between Arabic sounds and English sounds.",
        "For example, English P and B are both mapped into Arabic �b\"; Arabic \"� h\" and \"A h-\" into English H; and so on.",
        "In this paper, we describe Arabic-to-English name transliteration system using probabilistic finite state machines' that address both the transliteration of Arab and foreign names into English."

        "However, the accuracy of our phonetic-based model remains almost the same as in the case of the exact-matching evaluation.",
        "This is because names that can be found in the dictionary have only a single spelling that for the most part agrees with our gold-standard.",
        "Also, most of the names in the dictionary are English names and with English names the human evaluator was rigid, mostly accepting only the exact-matching spelling."

        "This causes incorrect transliterations of theses names by our system.",
        "The transliteration accuracy on the blind test set for both our system and the human translator is significantly higher than the development test set.",
        "This is because the blind set is mostly of highly frequent, prominent politicians; whereas the development set contains also names of writers and less common political figures and hence are less likely to be in our unigram language model (and our pronunciation dictionary in the case of the phonetic-based model)."
