        "We describe the design and implementation of a question answering (QA) system called QARAB.",
        "It is a system that takes natural language questions expressed in the Arabic language and attempts to provide short answers.",
        "The system’s primary source of knowledge is a collection of Arabic newspaper text extracted from Al-Raya, a newspaper published in Qatar.",
        "During the last few years the information retrieval community has attacked this problem for English using standard IR techniques with only mediocre success.",
        "We are tackling this problem for Arabic using traditional Information Retrieval (IR) techniques coupled with a sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach.",
        "To identify the answer, we adopt a keyword matching strategy along with matching simple structures extracted from both the question and the candidate documents selected by the IR system.",
        "To achieve this goal, we use an existing tagger to identify proper names and other crucial lexical items and build lexical entries for them on the fly.",
        "We also carry out an analysis of Arabic question forms and attempt a better understanding of what kinds of answers users find satisfactory.",
        "The paucity of studies of real users has limited results in earlier research.",
        "1 Introduction In recent years, there has been a marked increase in the amount of data available on the Internet.",
        "Users often have specific questions in mind, for which they hope to get answers.",
        "They would like the answers to be short and precise, and they always prefer to express the questions in their native language without being restricted to a specific query language, query formation rules, or even a specific knowledge domain.",
        "The new approach taken to matching the user needs is to carry out actual analysis of the question from a linguistic point of view and to attempt to understand what the user really means.",
        "QARAB is the result of coupling traditional Information Retrieval (IR) techniques with a sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) approach.",
        "The approach can be summarized as follows: the IR system treats the question as a query in an attempt to identify the candidate documents that may contain the answer; then the NLP techniques are used to parse the question and analyze the top ranked documents returned by the IR system.",
        "Natural Language Processing (NLP) in the Arabic language is still in its initial stage compared to the work in the English language, which has already benefited from the extensive research in this field.",
        "There are some aspects that slow down progress in Arabic Natural Language Processing (NLP) compared to the accomplishments in English and other European languages [Al-Daimi & Abdel-Amir, 1994].",
        "These aspects include:",
        "• Arabic is highly inflectional and derivational, which makes morphological analysis a very complex task.",
        "• The absence of diacritics (which represent most vowels) in the written text creates ambiguity and therefore, complex morphological rules are required to identify the tokens and parse the text.",
        "• The writing direction is from right-to-left and some of the characters change their shapes based on their location in the word.",
        "• Capitalization is not used in Arabic, which makes it hard to identify proper names, acronyms, and abbreviations.",
        "In addition to the above linguistic issues, there is also a lack of Arabic corpora, lexicons, and machine-readable dictionaries, which are essential to advance research in different areas."

      "heading": "2 Background",
      "text": [
        "Advances in natural language processing (NLP), information retrieval techniques (IR), information extraction (IE), as well as the computer industry, have given QA a strong boost.",
        "Modern question-answering systems have started incorporating NLP techniques to parse natural language documents, extract entities and relations between entities, resolve anaphora, and other language ambiguities [Harabagiu et al., 2000; Vicedo & Ferrández, 2000].",
        "Research in Question-Answering (QA) is not new.",
        "The QA problem has been addressed in the literature since the beginning of computing machines.",
        "The AI/NLP communities initiated traditional work to address question-answering using structural methods.",
        "Early experiments in this direction implemented systems that operate in very restricted domains (e.g. SHRDLU [Winogard, 1972] and LUNAR [Woods, 1972]).",
        "In the QUALM system, Lehnert [1978] took a further step, based on the conceptual theories of Schank & Abelson [1977], to understand the nature of the questions and classify them in a way similar to how human beings understand and answer questions.",
        "SCISOR [Jacobs & Rau 1990] aimed at question answering and text extraction more than information retrieval.",
        "It combined natural language processing, knowledge representation, and information retrieval techniques with lexical analysis and word-based text searches.",
        "The MURAX system [Kupiec, 1993] used robust linguistic methods to answer closed-class natural language questions.",
        "It presented the user with relevant text in which noun phrases are marked.",
        "A less automated approach like Ask Jeeves [1996] approached the QA problem by pointing the questioner to Web links that might contain information relevant to the answer to the question.",
        "Ask Jeeves benefited from advanced natural language processing techniques combined with data mining processing and a huge expanding knowledge base.",
        "Another system, with a different approach, is the FAQFinder system [Burke et al., 1997], which attempted to solve the question-answering problem using a database of question-answer pairs built from existing frequently asked question (FAQ) files.",
        "Two other important systems are the START system [Katz, 1997], which is based on annotations from the Web and the Q&A system [Budzik & Hammond, 1999], which is a semiautomatic, natural language question-answering and referral system.",
        "The system is based on a huge knowledge base and human experts who volunteered their time to respond to the users’ questions.",
        "Recently, attention has begun to be focused on developing question-answering systems that do not rely on a knowledge base and that can fetch answers from huge unstructured text.",
        "New QA systems enhanced with NLP and IR techniques have been developed to extract textual answers for open-domain questions and provide a framework for modern information retrieval [TREC-8, 1999; TREC-9, 2000].",
        "The overall aim of this QA track was to retrieve small pieces of text that contain the actual answer to the question rather than the list of documents traditionally returned by retrieval engines [Voorhees & Tice, 2000].",
        "The TREC-8 QA track attracted researchers from both industry and academia.",
        "Twenty organizations participated in this track with different approaches and their systems were evaluated.",
        "The participating systems were tested on a huge set of unstructured documents and a set of fact-based questions.",
        "Generally speaking, most of the TREC-8 long-string answer (250-bytes) participants attempted to solve the QA problem from the information retrieval (IR) point of view by locating the most relevant documents from the collection and then extracting the sentences most relevant to the query from the documents just located.",
        "The systems relying on this “bag-of-words” approach (e.g. [Allan et al., 1999]; [Cormack et al., 1999]; [Lin & Chen, 1999]; [Shin et al., 1999] and the passage-retrieval run of AT&T [Singhal et al., 1999]) deal with the question without considering its grammatical or semantic characteristics and they apply conventional IR techniques to extract the answer.",
        "Even though the “bag-of-words” approach was commonly used in TREC-8, the systems based on this approach were inadequate to handle the short-string (50-byte) answers.",
        "On the contrary, the short string (50-byte) participants (e.g. [Breck et al., 1999]; [Ferret et al., 1999]; [Hull, 1999]; [Humphreys et al., 1999]; [Litkowski, 1999]; [Moldovan et al., 2000]; [Oard et al., 1999]; [Singhal et al., 1999]) agreed on the importance of applying several natural language processing techniques to solve the problem.",
        "Among these techniques are: part-of-speech tagging, shallow parsing, query type identification and named entity recognition.",
        "Because the number of test documents to be analyzed for each query was huge, the majority of the systems in this band used the “bag-of-words” approach as an initial step to retrieve the relevant passages that contain the possible answer.",
        "Another approach to the QA problem combines IR techniques with Information Extraction (IE) techniques for extracting named entities, e.g., [Ogden et al., 1999]; [Takaki, 1999]; and [Srihari & Li, 1999].",
        "A detailed description of the track and the results are available at [Voorhees & Tice, 1999].",
        "It is obvious from the increasing number of systems participating in TREC-9 and the worldwide interest in this research area that Question Answering is the most promising framework for finding answers to natural language questions from a huge amount of textual data.",
        "Cardie et al.",
        "[2000] pointed out that building “open-ended question answering systems that allow users to pose questions of any type and in any language, without domain restrictions, is still beyond the scope of any QA system today” (p. 180).",
        "Harabagiu et al.",
        "[2000] indicated that advanced tools (such as dialog understanding and text mining) are essential for the success of future QA systems.",
        "Until the advanced tools are implemented, she suggested that we keep approximating the complexity of Question Answering with NLP enhancements of IR and IE techniques [Harabagiu et al., 2000]."
