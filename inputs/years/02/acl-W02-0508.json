        "This article describes the construction of a morphological, syntactic and semantic analyzer to operate a high-grade search engine for Hebrew texts.",
        "A good search engine must be complete and accurate.",
        "In Hebrew or Arabic script most of the vowels are not written, many particles are attached to the word without space, a double consonant is written with one letter, and some letters signify both vowels and consonants.",
        "Thus, almost every string of characters may designate many words (the average in Hebrew is almost three words).",
        "As a consequence, deciphering a word necessitates reading the whole sentence.",
        "Our model is Fillmore’s framework of an expression with a verb as its center.",
        "The engine eliminates readings of words unsuited to the syntax or the semantic structure of the sentence.",
        "In every verbal entry of our conceptual dictionary the features of the noun phrases (NP’s) required by the verb are included.",
        "When all the correct readings of all the strings of characters in the sentence have been identified, the program chooses the proper occurrences of the searched word in the text.",
        "Approximately 95% of the results by our search engine match those in the query.",
        "1.Introduction It is easy to construct a search engine that, in a given text, will find all the occurrences of the string of characters specified in the query.",
        "In Hebrew script, however, the string of characters that makes up a word may also be interpreted as designating other words.",
        "Almost every word in Hebrew script can be read as one of an average of three words.",
        "This is because Hebrew script is fundamentally defective: (1) Most vowels in a given word have no sign in the script.",
        "(2) Particles are attached with no intervening space to the string of characters that makes up the following word.",
        "(3) A geminated consonant is written as one letter, like a not-geminated consonant.",
        "(4) Several letters serve as both vowels and consonants.",
        "Threfore, it is impossible to identify the word stated in the query by its form: if we try to do so, we would obtain all the occurrences which are written in the same way but are, in fact, different words.",
        "Since only 20-30% of the words so obtained are actually occurrences of the required word, the users have to check every word in the result obtained in order to decide whether it is actually the one they want.1 In order to solve this problem, some systems recommend that every query should contain some other words that are often found close to the stipulated word.2 But such a search may lead to a loss of important occurrences of the required word.",
        "Neither a frequency list of words nor another statistical device can be an ultimate answer in our search of accurate and full device.",
        "A statistical approach ensures that some mistakes or",
        "omissions will always exist.",
        "Also, eliminating certain readings by an examination of the words in the short context will not ensure completeness, nor will it ensure accuracy, since a large number of the strings that appear in the result will not be relevant to the question.",
        "(Choueka and Lusignan, 1985; Choueka, 1990).",
        "We can obtain a correct reading of a word only if we can make a correct reading of the whole sentence.",
        "In order to do this, we must eliminate all the unsuitable readings of every string of characters in the sentence, and leave only one reading.",
        "To this end, we had to go through the following stages: 1.",
        "First, we adopted a phonemic script, a method of writing Hebrew in Latin characters, in which each vowel has its character, the particles are separated from the following word, geminated consonants are represented by two identical letters, and vowels and consonants are given completely distinct letters .3",
        "2.",
        "Now we are able to carry out a morphological analysis revealing all the word’s components.",
        "By examining the results, the correct reading could be clearly seen.",
        "This would be",
        "impossible in Hebrew script.",
        "We constructed a complete, exact morphological analyzer for Hebrew words, which also identifies inflections and attached particles.",
        "3.",
        "Having perfected the morphological analyzer, which provides a complete set of details for the analysis of any possible reading of a string of characters, we could write a program",
        "which checks every suggested reading of a word, and eliminates readings unsuitable to the syntax of the possibly required sentence.",
        "4.",
        "Even a syntactic reading does not ensure that each of the strings in the sentence is indeed a proper reading of the relevant word.",
        "Syntactic elimination may leave many words that do not suit a meaningful sentence.",
        "Further semantic eliminating is required.",
        "5.",
        "For this purpose we compiled a complete conceptual dictionary of the Hebrew language.",
        "It is based on Fillmore’s ideas about case grammar (Fillmore, 1968), according to which the verb is the center of the expression: it is a function whose arguments are the noun phrases.",
        "In every conceptual entry in our dictionary of verbs there appear the semantic, syntactic and morphological features demanded by the verb to exist in the NP’s of the sentence, -- including the prepositions, which precede them.",
        "Since the dictionary includes also the features of the arguments (NP’s) in the sentence, it eliminates readings of words that are suitable syntactically but not semantically.",
        "Semantic check enables us to discriminate both between different readings of same string of Hebrew characters as well as between the different meanings of each of the readings.",
        "In this way we completed the necessary basis for the production of an excellent search engine: it will respond to any question only with the occurrences which bear the stipulated meaning, even though the same reading of the characters may have several meanings.",
        "The contents of the article are as follows: In section 2 we shall explain how we establish all possible readings of a string of characters.",
        "Section 3 shows how we use syntactic features to eliminate readings that do not fit the syntactic context; then we describe our conceptual dictionary.",
        "Section 4 shows how we can eliminate readings that are possible syntactically but not semantically.",
        "Finally, in section 5 we shall explain how we choose the appropriate meaning of the word by using the dictionary.",
        "Section 6 concludes the article."

        "The strings of characters are taken from the Hebrew text in Hebrew script, and every string is analyzed.",
        "As was mentioned above, Hebrew script containsonly some of the vowels4 attaches particles to the following word, and does not use double characters to specify geminated letters (see Ornan, 1991); also, some of the characters serve either as vowels or as consonants.",
        "It is advisable to be able to read the text in a script that does not have these disadvantages51.",
        "We use the phonemic script of ISO (FDIS 259-3).",

        "The last column specifies attached particles.",

        "Each of these lines presents one possible reading of the given word.",
        "But usually only one reading is acceptable in any given sentence.",
        "Therefore, we must eliminate those readings, which are morphologically correct, but incorrect in the given context.",
        "The first elimination is syntactic, and it is done in the realm of one “Syntactic Unit”, i.e., a clause which includes one verb and is bounded by a “sign of separation”, mainly subordinating or certain coordinating particles.8 At this stage all possible analyses of the strings of characters are displayed.",
        "Now, the program attempts to combine each line of every word with every one of the lines of all other words.",

        "The syntactic stage will eliminate the great majority of invalid sequences of possible readings.",
        "We shall not discuss them all here – only make some remarks about a few clear cases for elimination.",
        "For example, the readings boqr, boqer cannot function syntactically as the subject of the sentence, since they are masculine, and no verb in the rest of the sentence which is not preceded by subordinating ¡e- (“that”) is masculine (agreement is needed).",
        "Similarly, the second word cannot be zar×a: a feminine noun, and no verb agrees with zar×a (as subject) in the analyses of the other words.",
        "9 There has been much research on syntactic analysis by means of a computer program; for instance, Wintner and Ornan, 1995.",
        "Herz and Rimon, 1992, also deal mainly with syntactic problems.",
        "Levinger et al., 1995 demonstrate methods of eliminating syntactically incorrect morphological readings.",
        "See, too, Levinger, 1992.",
        "First, the program looks for a verb.",
        "When a verb is identified, the program checks possible nouns that can be the syntactic subject.",
        "It then checks other NP’s and PP’s, possible adjectives and adverbs.",
        "Mainly because the order of words in Hebrew is rather free, the syntactic stage usually leaves a few possible sentences that may be accepted as proper readings of the input sentence from the syntactic point of view.",
        "But some of these possibly correct syntactic readings may possess improper semantic!!",
        "features, which should not be accepted.",
        "We have a special treatment for sentences without a verb (this may occur in Hebrew and other languages, especially Semitic): if the program does not identify a verb in the input sentence, it adds the verb haya (“to be”) in the appropriate gender, number and person, and the review process is repeated.",
        "Our dictionary of verbs is described below.",
        "Here we may remark that the verb haya appears in more than one lexical entry.",

        "“Organizing Elements” also include morphological details which have a linguistic meaning, such as indications of gender (bianco – bianca in Spanish), of number, (boy – boys in English), or person (vide – videsti in Italian) a hint to the definiteness of what follows (a – the in English), case endings which indicate the syntactic function of the concept symbolized by a noun in relation to an operation in the world indicated by a verb in the expression (in Arabic, baytuun as subject – baytaan as object), and so forth.",

        "The analysis and identification of correct readings of words in Hebrew script is far from being a simple task.",
        "The correct reading of any word is achieved only as a result of reading the rest of the words of the complete clause and sentence.",
        "We had to invest much work to solve this problem and to build a complex system of programs before we could have achieved a high-grade search engine, which is far better than other existing suggestions.",
        "See appendix for comparison.",
        "As noted above we succeeded in producing this engine only on the assumption that a Hebrew word must be read not on its own but in accordance with the reading of a complete sentence.",
        "We found that we achieved a powerful program, constituting a comprehensive infrastructure, for processing the Hebrew language for the computer.",
        "This infrastructure has already produced other results (the reading machine for the blind, see note 12), and it enables us to begin to work on automatic translation from Hebrew to other languages -– a task which has never yet been attempted.",
        "184 It seems that this method of translation by computer may be suitable to any language, and could be a contribution to translations from other languages."
