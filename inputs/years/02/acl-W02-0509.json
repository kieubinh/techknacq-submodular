        "Moreover, the inflectional patterns and clitics are quite similar in form in most cases.",
        "Both languages exhibit construct formation (Iđa:fa /Smixut), which is similar in its structure and in its role.",

        "A consistent definition of lemma is crucial for a data retrieval system.",
        "A lemma can be said to be the equivalent to a lexical entry: the basic grammatical unit of natural language that is semantically closed.",
        "In applications such as search engines, usually it is the lemma that is sought, while additional information including tense, number, and person are dispensable.",
        "In MSA and MH a lemma is actually the common denominator of a set of forms (hundreds or thousands of forms in each set) that share the same meaning and some morphological and syntactic features.",
        "Thus, in MSA, the forms: ?awla: d, walada: ni, despite their remarkable difference in appearance, share the same lemma WALAD `a boy'.",
        "This is even more noticeable in verbs, where forms like kataba, yaktubu, kutiba, yuktabu, kita: ba and many more are all part of the same lemma: KATABA `to write'.",
        "The rather large number of inflections and complex forms (forms that include clitics, see below 1.5) possible for each lemma results in a high total number of forms, which, in fact, is estimated to be the same for both languages: around 70 million 3.",
        "The mapping of these forms into lemmas is inconclusive (See Dichy (2001), p. 24).",
        "Hence the question rises: what should be defined as lemma in MSA and MH.",
        "The fact that MSA and MH morphology is root-based might promote the notion of identifying the lemma with the root.",
        "But this solution is not satisfactory: in most cases there is indeed a diachronic relation in meaning among words and forms of the same consonantal root.",
        "However, semantic shifts which occur over the years rule out this method in synchronic analysis.",
        "Moreover, some diachronic processes result in totally coincidental \"sharing\" of a root by two or more completely different semantic domains.",
        "For example, in MSA, the words fajr `dawn' and infija: r `explo-sion' share the same root /fir/ (the latter might have originally been a metaphor).",
        "Similarly, in MH the verbs pasal `to ban, disqualify' and pisel `to sculp-ture' share the same root /psl/ (the former is an old loan from Aramaic).",
        "In Morfix, as described below (2.1), a lemma is defined not as the root, but as the manifestation of this root, most commonly as the lesser marked form of a noun, adjective or verb.",
        "There is no escape from some arbitrariness in the implementation of this definition, due to the fine line between inflectional morphology and derivational morphology.",
        "However, Morfix generally follows the tradition set by dictionaries, especially bilingual dictionaries.",
        "Thus, for example, difference in part of speech entails different lemmas, even if the morphological process is partially predictable.",
        "Similarly each verb pattern (Wazn / Binyan) is treated as a different lemma.",
        "Even so, the roots should not be overlooked, as they are a good basis for forming groups of lemmas; in other words, the root can often serve as a \"super-lemma\", joining together several lemmas, provided they all share a semantic field."

        "The inconclusive selection of lemmas in MSA and MH can be demonstrated by looking into an interesting phenomenon: the nominal inflections of verbs (roughly parallel to the Latin participle, see below).",
        "Since this issue is a good example both for a characteristic of Semitic NLP and for the similarities between MSA and MH, it is worthwhile to further elaborate on it.",
        "Both MSA and MH use the nominal inflections of verbs to convey tenses, moods and aspects.",
        "These inflections are derived directly from the verb according to strict rules, and their forms are predictable in most cases.",
        "Nonetheless, grammatically, these forms behave as nouns or adjectives.",
        "This means that they bear case marking in MSA, nominal marking for number and gender (in both languages) and they can be definite or indefinite (in both languages).",
        "Moreover, these inflections often serve as nouns or adjectives in their own right.",
        "This, in fact, causes the crucial problem for data retrieval, since the system has to determine whether the user refers to the noun/adjective or rather to the verb for which it serves as inflection.",
        "Nominal inflections of verbs exist in non-Semitic languages as well; in most European languages participles and infinitives have nominal features.",
        "However, two Semitic traits make this phenomenon more challenging in our case – the rich morphology which creates a large set of inflections for each base form (i.e. the verb is inflected to create nominal forms and then each form is inflected again for case, gender and number).",
        "Furthermore, Semitic languages allow nominal clauses, namely verbless sentences, which increase ambiguity.",
        "For example, in English it is easy to recognize the form `drunk' in `he has drunk' as related to the lemma DRINK (V) (and not as an adjective).",
        "This is done by spotting the auxiliary `has' which precedes this form.",
        "However in MH, the clause axi comer could mean `my brother is a guard' or `my brother guards/is guarding'.",
        "The syntactical cues for the final decision are subtle and elusive.",

        "From the viewpoint of NLP, especially commercially applicable NLP, it is important to note that the writing systems of both MSA and MH follow the same conventions, in which most vowels are not marked.",

        "Similarly in MH, the form yilmad `he will learn' is written {ylmd}.",
        "Both languages have a supplementary marking system for vocalization (written above, under and beside the text), but it is not used in the overwhelming majority of texts.",
        "In both languages, when vowels do appear as letters, letters of consonantal origin are used, consequently turning these letters ambiguous (between their consonantal and vocalic readings).",
        "It is easy to see the additional difficulty that this writing convention presents for NLP.",
        "The string {yktb} in MSA can be interpreted as yaktubu (future tense), yaktuba (subjunctive), yaktub Oussive), yuktabu (future tense passive) and even yuktibu `he dictates/will dictate' a form that is considered by Morfix to be a different lemma altogether (see above 1.2).",
        "Furthermore, ambiguity can occur between totally unrelated words, as will be shown in section 1.7.",
        "A trained MSA reader can distinguish between these forms by using contextual cues (both syntactic and semantic).",
        "A similar contextual sensitivity must be programmed into the NLP system in order to meet this challenge.",
        "Each language also has some orthographic peculiarities of its own.",
        "The most striking in MH is the multiple spelling conventions that are used simultaneously.",
        "The classical convention has been replaced in most texts with some kind of spelling system that partially indicates vowels, and thus reduces ambiguities.",
        "An NLP system has to take into account the various spelling systems and the fact that the classic convention is still occasionally used.",
        "Thus, each word often has more than one spelling.",
        "For example: the word shi?ur `a lesson' can be written {sLwr} or {syLwr}.",
        "The word kiven `to direct' can be written {kwn} or {kywwn}, the former is the classical spelling (Ktiv Xaser) while the later is the standard semi-vocalized system (Ktiv Male), but a some non-standard spellings can also appear: {kywn}, {kwwn}.",
        "MSA spelling is much more standardized and follows classic conventions.",
        "Nonetheless, some of these conventions may seem confusing at first sight.",
        "The Hamza sign, which represents the glottal stop phoneme, can be written in 5 different ways, depending on its phonological environment.",
        "Therefore, any change in vowels (very regular a phenomenon in MSA inflectional paradigms) results in a different shape of Hamza.",
        "This occurs even when the vowels themselves are not marked.",
        "Moreover – there is often more than one shape possible per form, without any mandatory convention.",
        "One could argue that all Hamza shapes should be encoded as one for our purposes.",
        "This may solve some problems, but then again it would deny us of crucial information about the vowels in the word.",
        "Since the Hamza changes according to vowels around it, it is a good cue for retrieving the vocalization of the word, and to reduce ambiguity."

        "For example, in MSA, the form: ?awla: dun `boys (nom.",

        "The phenomenon of incomplete agreement (see also above 1.6) does not require an actual change in the code of Morfix, since the term AGREEMENT (e.g. between noun and adjective) has an external definition, independent for each language.",
        "Syntactical rules in the system refer to the term AGREEMENT, hence, rules that make use of the term AGREEMENT will apply, in many cases, to both languages.",
        "In general, while some of the syntactical rules in the system are similar in both languages, other rules are defined specifically for each of the two languages.",
        "All rules for both languages are specified using the same mechanism.",
        "In the MH database there are supplementary placeholders for the semi-vocalized spelling alternatives, which are often redundant for MSA, though they do become useful especially in recent loan words.",
        "In MSA the verb predicate usually precedes its subject (VSO), while in MH the subject tends to appear first (SVO), though in both languages word order is not fixed.",
        "This difference is handled in the contextual analysis for disambiguation purposes.",
        "MSA is used in various countries, each having its own linguistic idiosyncrasies.",
        "This entails lexical differences and a few phonetic variations, as well as some minor writing convention differences.",

        "For example, the string {waldy} has several morphological analyses (dual construct form: `the two parents of, dual form with genitive pronominal enclitic: `my two parents', or singular form with genitive pronominal enclitic: `my father'); however, the lemmatizer produces just one lemma for all the above analyses: wa:lid `a parent'.",

        "The Hebrew version of Morfm has achieved the following results: Morfix generates exceptionally accurate lemmatization.",
        "When indexing for full text search, the matching rate of the lemma receiving the highest score to the correct lemma stands at above 98%.",
        "In typical Internet texts, between 1% and 2% of words remain unanalyzed (by and large, these are proper names not included in lexicon; in search engine application, these undergo a morphological soundex algorithm designed to enable the retrieval of proper names with prepositional proclitics).",
        "Performance depends on hardware and system environments.",
        "On a typical (as of date of publication) Intel 111800 MHz CPU, with 256 MB RAM running Windows 2000, Morfix analyzes c. 10,000 words per second.",
        "In text-to-speech (TTS) applications, the degree of words read correctly (fully correct phonetic transcription and stress location) is also 98%.",
        "This number is no different than the number for lemmatization, but is derived differently: on one hand, sometimes an error in lemmatization does not yield an error in phonetization (in case of homonymic tokens); on the other hand, TTS has to deal with phonetization of proper names not in the lexicon, which it carries out according to algorithms.",
        "The Hebrew TTS system is successfully implemented in systems for reading email and Internet texts.",
        "Performance of the TTS system is around 20% slower than lemmatization, due to extra processing that computes the phonetic transcription given the morphological analysis.",
        "The final equivalent numbers for Arabic are still not available as of date of publication.",
        "Nonetheless, because the system is similar, and MSA is quite close to MH in terms of total number of inflections and in degree of ambiguity, it is expected to reach similar results."

        "This work can be implemented in other NLP systems, mainly of other Semitic languages such as colloquial dialects of Arabic (e.g. Egyptian or Syrian which are more and more used in writing) and Maltese, but also languages that share some of the Semitic traits, mainly rich and complex morphology, or that use alternative writing conventions.",
        "This work lays the infrastructure for further adaptation, though creating special databases for each languages remains to be done."
