      "text": [
        "A number of properties are desirable in a learning model whose goal is to mimic human intuition.",
        "We have been motivated to develop our own model in part because these criteria have rarely been met by previous models.",
        "Such models include, for example, connectionist models (Rumelhart and McClelland 1986, Daugherty and Seidenberg 1994, MacWhinney and Leinbach 1991), neighborhood similarity models (Nakisa, Plunkett and Hahn 2001), decision tree/ILP models (Ling and Marinov 1993, Mooney and Califf 1996, Dzeroski and Erjavec 1997), and other rule-based models (Neuvel, to appear).1 Our first criterion is that a model should be able to generate complete output forms, rather than just grouping the outputs into (possibly arbitrary) categories such as “regular,” “irregular,” “vowel change,” etc.",
        "The reason is that people likewise generate fully specified forms, and a model’s predictions can be fully tested only at this level of detail.",
        "Second, a model should be able to make multiple guesses for each word and assign numerical well-formedness scores to each guess.",
        "People, too, often favor multiple outcomes, and they also have gradient preferences among the various possibilities (Prasada and Pinker 1993).2 Third, a model should be able to locate detailed generalizations.",
        "Here is an example: English past tenses are often formed by changing [] to [] when the final consonant of the word is [] (fling-flung, cling-clung, sting-stung).",
        "As experiments show, such generalizations are learned by speakers of English (that is, speakers do more than just memo",
        "rize each irregular verb).",
        "For example, experimental participants often volunteer splung as the past tense of spling, extending the generalization to a novel verb.",
        "The importance of detailed generalizations is not limited to irregular forms.",
        "We have found that speakers are often sensitive to detailed generalizations even among regulars.",
        "For example, verbs in English ending in voiceless fricatives ([f, T, s, S]) are always regular.",
        "Our experiments indicate that English speakers are tacitly aware of this pattern.",
        "Thus, an accurate model of their linguistic intuitions must be able to detect and learn the pattern in the training data.",
        "Although detailed generalizations are important, it is also crucial for a learning model to be able to form very broad generalizations.",
        "The reason is that general morphological patterns cannot be learned simply as the aggregation of detailed patterns.",
        "Speakers can generate novel inflected forms even for words that don’t fit any of the detailed patterns (Pinker and Prince 1988, Prasada and Pinker 1993).",
        "Thus, a general rule is needed to derive an output where no close analogues occur in the training set.",
        "A special case of this sort is where the base form ends in a segment that is not phonologically legal in the language (Halle 1978).",
        "Thus, the German name Bach can be pronounced by some English speakers with a final voiceless velar fricative [x].",
        "Speakers who can pronounce this sound agree firmly that the past tense of to out-Bach must be [aUtbaxt] (Pinker 1999), following a generalization which is apparently learned on the basis of ordinary English words.",
        "In summary, we believe it is important that a learning model for morphology and phonology should produce complete output forms, generate multiple outputs, assign each output a well-formedness score, and discover both specific and broad generalizations."

        "The result of this procedure is a large list of rules, describing all of the phonological contexts in which each change applies.",

        "The problem we are faced with is to let the model identify cases of distributional encroachment as such, and not be fooled into grouping burnt and laughed together under the same [-t] generalization.",
        "Intuitively, the problem with the rule attaching [-t] after any consonant is that it is internally heterogeneous; it consists of one very consistent subset of cases (the obstruent-final stems) and one fundamentally different case (burnt).",
        "We can characterize internal heterogeneity more precisely if we compare the scope and hits of the “correct” rule (after obstruents) and the “spurious” rule (after any consonant):",

        "We see that the rule adding [-t] after any consonant gains just one hit, but adds a significant number of exceptions (150).",
        "Formalizing this intuition, we propose a refinement of the way that confidence is calculated, in order to diagnose when a subpart of a generalization is doing most of the work of the larger generalization.",
        "When we consider the confidence of a context ℂ associated with a change A → B, we must consider every other context ℂ′ associated with A → B, checking to see whether ℂ′ covers a subset of the cases that ℂ covers.",
        "In the present case, when we assess the confidence of adding [-t] after any consonant, we would check all of the other rules adding [-t], including the one that adds [-t] after obstruents.",
        "For each ℂ′ that covers a subset of ℂ, we must ask whether the rule A → B / ℂ′ is actually “doing most of the work” of the larger rule A → B / ℂ.",
        "To find out if the smaller rule is doing most of the work, we calculate how well the larger rule (ℂ) performs outside the area covered by the smaller rule (ℂ′).",
        "The reliability of the residue area (ℂ – ℂ′) is calculated as follows:",
        "From the reliability of this residue area (ℂ – ℂ′), we can then calculate its confidence, using confidence limit statistics in a way similar to that described above in section 3.2.",
        "However, there is a crucial difference: when we are assessing whether a rule explains enough cases to be trustable, we are interested in the denseness of cases within the generalization.",
        "But when we are assessing whether a rule offers an improvement over a subpart, we are interested in the sparseness of cases in the residue outside of the subpart.",
        "Therefore, when calculating the confidence of the residue, we must use the upper confidence limit rather than the lower confidence limit.",
        "If the upper confidence limit of the reliability of the residue (ℂ – ℂ′) is lower than the lower confidence limit of the reliability of the larger context (ℂ), then we can infer that the smaller rule (A → B / ℂ′) is doing most of the work of the larger rule (A → B / ℂ).",
        "Therefore, we penalize the larger rule by replacing its confidence value (Lower confidence(ℂ)) with the confidence value of the residue (Upper confidence(ℂ – ℂ′)).",
        "We call",
        "this penalty impugnment, because the validity of the larger rule is being called into question by the smaller rule.",
        "Impugnment is carried out for all contexts of all rules.",
        "This impugnment algorithm is similar to the pruning algorithm proposed by Anthony and Frisch (1997).",
        "However, their algorithm requires that the smaller rule cover at least as many positive cases (hits) as the larger rule.",
        "In this case, the larger rule does cover one more case than the smaller rule (the form burnt), so it would not be eligible for pruning under their system.",
        "Impugnment is also similar to the pruning strategies based on “minimum improvement” or “lift” (e.g., Bayardo, Agrawal and Gunopulos 1999), but in this case, we are considering the improvement of a more general (less specified) context, rather than a more specific one, and the criterion of improvement is built in rather than user-specified."
