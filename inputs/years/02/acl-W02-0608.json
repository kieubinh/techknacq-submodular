        "In this paper, we present an approach to supervised learning and automatic detection of syllable structure.",
        "The primary goal of the paper is to show that probabilistic context-free grammars can be used to gain substantial phonological knowledge about syllable structure.",
        "Beyond an evaluation of the trained model on a real-world task documenting the performance of the model, we focus on an extensive qualitative evaluation.",
        "In contrast to other approaches which work with syllable structures extracted from a pronunciation dictionary, our approach focuses on the probability of use of certain syllable structures.",
        "Among other approaches that deal with syllable structure, there are example-based approaches (Hall (1992), Wiese (1996), F´ery (1995), Kenstowicz (1994), Morelli (1999)), symbolic approaches (Belz, 2000), connectionist phonotactic models (Stoianov and Nerbonne, 1998), stochastic models describing partial structures (Pierrehumbert (1994), Coleman and Pierrehumbert (1997)), or application-based approaches for syllabification (Van den Bosch, 1997) or text-to-speech systems (Kiraz and M¨obius, 1998).",
        "Our method builds on two resources.",
        "The first one is a large written text corpus, which is looked-up in a pronunciation dictionary resulting in a large transcribed and syllabified corpus.",
        "The second resource is a manually written context-free grammar describing German and English syllable structure.",
        "We code the assumptions (similar to Goldsmith (1995)) that the phonological material that can occur in the onsets or codas might differ depending on the syllable positions: word-initial, word-final, word-medial, versus monosyllabic words.",
        "We train the context-free grammar for German on the transcribed and syllabified training corpus with a simple supervised training method (M¨uller, 2001a).",
        "The main idea of the training method is that after a grammar transformation step, the grammar together with a parser can predict syllable boundaries of unknown phoneme strings.",
        "The trained model is evaluated on a syllabification task showing a high precision on a test corpus.",
        "We exemplify that the method can be easily transferred to related languages (here English) by adding rules for missing phonemes to the grammar.",
        "In an qualitative evaluation, we compare German and English syllable structure by interpreting the probability weights of the preterminal grammar rules.",
        "In sum, we aim to show that our method (i) models all possible words of a language, (ii) models how likely certain structures are used (in comparison to pure dictionary-based approaches), (iii) yields good results in an application-oriented evaluation, (iv) is able to disambiguate competing structures, (v) can be easily applied to other languages, (vi) produces mathematically well-defined models.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "We present our method in Section 2, the experiments in Section 3, and our evaluation in Section 4.",
        "In Section 5, we discuss the results, and in Section 6, we conclude."

        "We build on the novel approach of M¨uller (2001 a) which aims to combine the advantages of treebank and bracketed corpora training.",
        "In general, this approach consists of four steps: (i) writing a (symbolic i.e. non-probabilistic) context-free phonological grammar with syllable boundaries, (ii) training this grammar on a large automatically transcribed and syllabified corpus, (iii) transforming the resulting probabilistic phonological grammar by dropping the syllable boundaries, and (iv) predicting syllable boundaries of unseen phoneme strings by choosing their most probable phonological tree according to the transformed probabilistic grammar.",
        "The advantages of this approach are, that simple and efficient supervised training on bracketed corpora can be used (the brackets guarantee that all syllabified words of the training corpus receive only one single analysis), and that raw phoneme strings can be parsed and syllabified after the grammar transformation.",
        "Preserving these advantages, our approach differs in several important details.",
        "First, we write a more advanced phonological grammar for German, yielding a more fine-grained probabilistic model of syllable structure.",
        "Second, it is easily possible to enrich our phonological grammar by adding grammar rules for missing phonemes to adapt our phonological grammar to other languages (here English).",
        "Third, in addition to an evaluation on a real-world task (syllabification for German), we qualitatively evaluate the resulting probabilistic versions of our phonological grammar for German and English.",
        "according to our phonological grammar for German.",
        "Our phonological grammar divides a word into syllables, which are in turn rewritten by onset, nucleus, and coda.",
        "Furthermore, the phonological grammar differentiates between monosyllabic and polysyllabic words.",
        "In polysyllabic words, the syllables are divided into syllables appearing word-initially, word-medially, and word-finally.",
        "Additionally, the grammar distinguishes between consonant clusters of different sizes (ranging from one to five consonants), as well as between consonants occurring in different positions within a cluster.",
        "Figure 1 displays the structure of the German word “Abfall” (waste) according to our phonological grammar.",
        "In the following sections, we especially focus on the rewriting rules involving phonemic terminal nodes: X✗✘✗✚✗✢ ✣ ✥ and Y✗✘ ✣ ✧✗ The rules of the first type bear three of the above mentioned features for a consonant ✥ inside an onset or a coda (X=On, Cod), namely: the position of the syllable in the word (✘=ini, med, fin, one), the cluster size (✢ ☆ ✫✗✗✗ ✯), and the position of a consonant within a cluster (✚ ☆ ✫✗✗✗ ✯).",
        "Obviously, vowels or diphthongs ✧ of a nucleus (Y=Nucleus) do not need the position and size features (✢ and ✚).",
        "The probabilities of these phonological rules (after supervised training) are exactly the basis for our description and evaluation of the syllable parts in Section 4."

        "Since our approach is multilingual (only training is language dependent), we evaluated two languages (German and English) showing that probabilistic context-free grammars add linguistic knowledge to phonology.",

        "A more general model was introduced by M¨uller et al.",

        "However, the approach treats the onsets and codas as one string.",
        "In our method, we describe in more detail the internal structure of onsets and codas.",

        "(ii) Moreover, using probabilistic context-free grammars, alternative syllabifications of phoneme strings can be disambiguated.",
        "(iii) Our model is able to analyze unexpected phoneme strings.",
        "For instance, the onset [bRd] of the proper name “Brdaric” ([bRda:RItS]) is not allowed according to German phonotactics.",
        "Table 7 correctly displays that neither [b] occurs as a first, nor [R] as a second, or [d] as a third consonant in initial triconsonantal German onset clusters.",

        "(iv) The syllable structure of nonsense words can be predicted.",
        "The model can be exploited in two ways: first, it predicts the most probable syllabification, second, it can be used to model the lexical decision task.",

        "Although the triconso-nantal cluster should be rather an onset cluster than a coda cluster, the model prefers [str] as a cluster, whereas a syllable boundary is added between [m] and [pl], and [l] and [fl].",
        "A further example mentioned in the literature is [brIk], [blIk], and [bnIk].",
        "The first one is a possible word of English [brIk], which receives a probability of 1.16e-08, the second non-occurring word [blIk] (7.2391e-09), and the non-English word [bnIk] (4.3249e-09).",
        "The least probable one is the non-English word, followed by the non-occurring one, and the highest probability is assigned to the real word brick.",
        "Beside the good performance of the current models in applications, further improvements of the present approach can possibly be achieved by embedding more prior phonotactic knowledge.",

        "We introduced a multilingual approach to probabilistic modeling of syllable structure using probabilistic context-free grammars.",
        "We exemplified our approach for two languages, German and English.",
        "Evaluation on a syllabification task shows a small improvement in word accuracy rate compared to other state-of-the-art systems for German.",
        "Additionally, we presented an extensive qualitative evaluation of German and English syllable, onset, and coda structure (section 4) showing which structures are preferably used.",
        "However, the presented work is a starting point of analyzing in detail the huge amount of data with regard to phonological regularities.",
        "For instance, we found evidence that in consonant clusters sonorous consonants (like [R], [l]) are more restricted to appear next to the nucleus than less sonorous consonants.",
        "Clearly, this is promising work for future investigations.",
        "We believe that our method can be easily transferred to a variety of other languages, and aim in future work at embedding more fine-grained phonotactic constraints to our grammar."
