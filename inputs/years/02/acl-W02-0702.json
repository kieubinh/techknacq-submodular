        "In this paper, we propose a topic detection method using a dialogue history for selecting a scene in the automatic interpretation system (Ikeda et al., 2002).",
        "■ The method uses a k-nearest neighbor method for the algorithm, automatically clusters target topics into smaller topics grouped by similarity, and incorporates dialogue history weighted in terms of time to detect and track topics on spoken phrases.",
        "From the evaluation of detection performance using test corpus comprised of realistic spoken dialogue, the method has shown to perform better with clustering incorporated, and combined with time-weighted dialogue history of three sentences, gives detection accuracy of 77.0%."

        "In recent years, speech-to-speech translation systems have been developed that integrate three components: speech recognition, machine translation, and speech synthesis (Watanabe et al., 2000).",
        "However, these systems cannot guarantee accurate translation because the individual components do not always provide correct results.",
        "To overcome this restriction, we proposed a method to use parallel text based translation for supporting freestyle sentence translation.",
        "In addition, we built a prototype automatic interpretation system for Japanese overseas travelers (Ikeda et al., 2002).",
        "With this system, the user searches for an appropriate sentence in source language from the registered parallel text by using the criteria of an utterance, a scene, and a situation, and then uses the target language sentence for a translation.",
        "Although parallel text based translation provides guaranteed translation results, it has two problems as the user searches for the sentence.",
        "One is difficulty in searching an appropriate sentence from user’s short utterance, which is often heard in travel conversation.",
        "Short phrases provide only a few keywords and make the search result too broad.",
        "Specifying the exact scene and action helps narrow down the result, but the task may cause user frustration in having to select the right option from the vast categories of scenes and actions.",
        "The other problem is existence of nonadaptive sentences that may be inappropriate in some of the scenes.",
        "Users usually select sentences according to the scenes so they can exclude those inapplicable sentences, but some new users may accidentally select those nonadaptive sentences by failing to specify a scene.",
        "Here, we propose a method to detect a topic for each utterance.",
        "We define a topic as corresponding to a scene that is a place or a situation in which the user converses.",
        "The proposed method is based on the k-nearest neighbor method, which is improved for dialogue utterances by clustering training data and using dialogue history.",
        "We use the detected topic for specifying a scene condition in parallel text based translation, and thereby solve the two problems described above.",
        "Detecting topics also helps improve accuracy of the automatic interpretation system by disambiguating polysemy.",
        "Some words should be translated into different words according to the scene and context selection.",
        "Topic detection can enhance speech recognition accuracy by selecting the correct word dictionary and resources, which are organized according to the topic.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the constraints in detecting a topic from dialogue utterances.",
        "Section 3 describes our topic detection algorithm to overcome these constraints.",
        "Section 4 explains the evaluation of our method by using a travel conversation corpus and Section 5 presents the evaluation result.",
        "Section 6 discusses the effect of our method from a comparison of the results on typical dialogue data and on real situation dialogue data.",
        "We conclude in Section 7 with some final remarks and mention of future work."

        "Among conventional topic detection methods, one uses compound words that features certain topic as trigger information for detecting a topic (Hatori et al., 2000), and another uses domain-dependant dictionaries and thesauruses to construct knowledge applicable to a certain topic (Tsunoda et al., 1996).",
        "In the former method, a scene-dependant dictionary provides the knowledge relevant to the scene and compound words in the dictionary are used for detecting a topic.",
        "In the latter method, words appearing in a scene are defined as the knowledge relevant to the scene and superordinate/subordinate relation and synonyms provided by thesauruses are used to enhance the robustness.",
        "These conventional methods are suitable for written texts but not for dialogue utterances in a speech translation system.",
        "The following two major constraints make the topic detection for dialogue utterances more difficult.",
        "(1) Constraint due to single sentence process - Sentences in a dialogue are usually short with few keywords.",
        "- In a dialogue, the frequency values of the word in a sentence are mostly one, making it difficult to apply a statistical method.",
        "(2) Constraint due to the nature of spoken dialogue - In a dialogue, one topic is sometimes",
        "expressed with two or more sentences.",
        "- The words appearing in a sentence are sometimes replaced by anaphora or omitted by ellipsis in the next sentence.",
        "- Topics frequently change in a dialogue.",
        "On the other hand, a speech translation system requires the following: - Topic detection for each utterance in a dialogue; - Prompt topic detection in real time processing; - Dynamic tracking of topic transition.",
        "To make topic detection adaptive to the speech translation system, we propose a method applicable to one utterance in a dialogue as an input, which can be used for tracking the topic transitions dynamically and outputting most appropriate topic for the latest utterance.",
        "The k-nearest neighbor method (Yang, 1994) is used with the clustering method linked with the dialogue history as a topic detection algorithm for dialogue utterance.",
        "The k-nearest neighbor method is known to have high precision performance with less restriction in the field of document categorization.",
        "This method is frequently used as a baseline in the field and also applied to topic detection for story but not for a single sentence (Yang et al., 1999).",
        "This paper incorporates two new methods to the k-nearest neighbor method to overcome two constraints mentioned above.",
        "To overcome the first constraint, we cluster a set of sentences in training data into subsets (called subtopics) based on similarity between the sentences.",
        "A topic is detected by calculating the relevance between the input sentence and these subtopics.",
        "Clustering sentences on the same subtopic increases number of characteristic words to be compared with input sentence in calculation.",
        "To overcome the second constraint, we group an input sentence with other sentences in the dialogue history.",

        "Looking at the results on the typical dialogue data, it can be argued that the one-sentence-per-cluster case shows the highest accuracy because the data is a typical dialogue and each sentence is short, so that feature words in the input sentences and those of the learning data are likely to match.",
        "On the other hand, it can be argued that the one-topic-per-cluster case shows the lowest accuracy because feature words become less effective when so many subtopics are in one cluster.",
        "For example, let us look at the sentence in the learning data, “Is it all right to pick it up with my hand?” This sentence can be used when deciding what to buy, and so is categorized under the topic “Shopping”.",
        "When a cluster is one sentence, the result will likely be satisfactory if you input the sentence, “Is it all right to pick it up with my hand?” because the input sentence is similar to the cluster.",
        "However, when a cluster is one topic, this sentence might be categorized under the topic “Others”, along with sentences used to express physical conditions such as “My hand hurts” or “I am all right”.",
        "Therefore, it can be concluded that it is better to divide a large topic into smaller groups or even into single sentences.",
        "Looking at the results on real situation dialogue data, we find the ratio of correct answers is almost the same for the one-sentence-per-cluster and the medium-cluster cases, but the actual sentences correctly detected topics differed significantly between them.",
        "In the former case, topics are identified correctly when there are strong feature words, while in the latter case, it works well when there is no strong feature word but the topics can be determined by sets of words.",
        "From this fact, we can conclude that typical input sentences can be compared easily with the one-sentence-per-cluster case, and real situation input sentences can be",
        "compared with the medium-cluster case even though the sentences are different from those in typical dialogue in terms of content and expressions.",
        "We find that with typical dialogue data, the accuracy level is almost the same for the one-sentence-per-cluster and the medium-cluster cases, but with the real situation dialogue data, the accuracy level is slightly improved.",
        "Therefore, it might be possible to improve the practicality of topic detection by collecting a large amount of data, dividing the data into typical and real situation dialogues, and setting the appropriate clusters to each type."
