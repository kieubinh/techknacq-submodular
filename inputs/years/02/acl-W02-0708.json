        "Several speech translation projects have chosen interlingua-based approaches because of its convenience (especially in adding new languages) in multilingual projects.",
        "However, interlingua design is notoriously difficult and inexact.",
        "The main challenge is deciding on the grain size of meaning to represent and what facets of meaning to include.",
        "This may depend on the domain and the contexts in which the translation system is used.",
        "For projects that take place at multiple research sites, another factor becomes important in interlingua design: if the interlingua is too complex, it cannot be used reliably by researchers at remote sites.",
        "Furthermore, the interlingua should not be biased toward one family of languages.",
        "Finally, an interlingua should clearly distinguish general and domain specific components for easy scalability and portability between domains.",
        "Sections 2 and 3 describe how we balanced the factors of grain-size, language independence, and simplicity in two interlinguas for speech translation projects – the C-star II Interchange Format (Levin et al., 1998) and the Ne-spole Interchange Format.",
        "Both interlinguas are based in the framework of domain actions as described in (Levin et al., 1998).",
        "We will show that the NESPOLE interlingua has a finer grain-size of meaning, but is still simple enough for collaboration across multiple research sites, and still maintains language-independence.",
        "Section 4 will address the issue of scalability of interlinguas based on domain actions to larger domains.",
        "The basis of Section 4 is a distributional analysis of the C-star II and Ne-spole databases tagged with interlingua representations.",
        "The C-star II database has been partially re-tagged with the NESPOLE interlingua, which enables us to make comparisons on the same data with two types of interlinguas and on two types of data (C-star II and Nespole) with the same type of interlingua."

        "org).",
        "with six participating research sites.",
        "The semantic domain was travel, including reservations and payments for hotels, tours, and transportation.",

        "Most of the database consists of transcripts of role-playing conversations.",
        "The driving concept behind the C-star II interlingua is that there are a limited number of actions in the domain – requesting the price of a room, telling the price of a room, requesting the time of a flight, giving a credit card number, etc.",
        " – and that each utterance can be classified as an instance of one of these domain actions.",

        "The C-star II interlingua specification document contains definitions for 44 speech acts, 93 concepts, and 117 argument names.",
        "The domain action is the part of the interlingua consisting of the speech act and concepts, in",
        "this case request-action+reservation+temporal+hotel.",
        "The domain action does not include the list of argument-value pairs.",
        "First it is important to point out that domain actions are created compositionally.",
        "A domain action consists of a speech act followed by zero or more concepts.",
        "(Recall that argument-value pairs are not part of the domain action.)",
        "The NESPOLE interlingua includes 65 speech acts and 110 concepts.",
        "An interlingua specification document defines the legal combinations of speech acts and arguments.",
        "The linguistic justification for an interlingua based on domain-actions is that many travel domain utterances contain fixed, formulaic phrases (e.g., can you tell me; I was wondering; how about; would you mind, etc.)",
        "that signal domain actions, but either do not translate literally into other languages or have a meaning that is sufficiently indirect that the literal meaning is irrelevant for translation.",
        "To take two examples, how about as a signal of a suggestion does not translate into other languages with the words corresponding to how and about.",
        "Also, would you mind might translate literally into some European languages as a way of signaling a request, but the literal meaning of minding is not relevant to the translation, only the fact that it signals politeness.",
        "The measure of success for the domain-action based interlingua (as described in (Levin et al., 2000a)) is that (1) it covers the data in the C-star II database with less than 8% no-tag rate,",
        "(2) inter-coder agreement across research sites is reasonably high: 82% for speech acts, 88% for concepts, and 65% for domain actions, and (3) end-to-end translation results using an analyzer and generator written at different sites were about the same as end-to-end translation results using an analyzer and generator written at the same site."
