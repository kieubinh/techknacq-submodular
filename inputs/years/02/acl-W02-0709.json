        "In the past decades, many MT approaches have been proposed.",
        "We roughly divided the current approaches into two types, which are respectively named as the mainstream approaches and the non-mainstream approaches.",
        "The mainstream approaches include four basic methods: the analysis-based method, the example-based method, the template-based method and also the statistical method as well.",
        "The analysis-based method here includes the rule-based method, the interlingual method, or even the knowledge-based method.",
        "In the recent years, the approach based on multi-engine has been practiced in many systems (Lavie, 1999; Wahlster, 2000; Zong, 2000a).",
        "However, the engines employed in these experimental systems are mainly based on the four mainstream methods.",
        "The strong points and the weak points of the four methods have been analyzed in many works (Zong, 1999; Ren, 1999; Zhao, 2000).",
        "The non-mainstream approach here refers to any other methods exclusive of the four methods mentioned above.",
        "To improve the performance of MT systems, especially to cope with the specific problems in S2S translation, many schemes have been proposed.",
        "Ren (1999) proposed a super-function based MT method, which tries to address the MT users’ requests and translates the input without thorough syntactic and semantic analysis.",
        "The super-function based MT system is fast, inexpensive, easy to control and easy to update.",
        "However, the fluency and the correctness of the translation results are usual not high.",
        "Moreover, to extract the practical super-functions from the corpus is also a hard work.",
        "Yamamoto et al.",
        "(2001) proposed a paradigm named Sandglass.",
        "In the sandglass system, the input utterances from a speech recognizer are paraphrased firstly, and the paraphrased text is passed to the transfer controller.",
        "The task of the paraphrasing module for the source language is to deal with noisy inputs from the speech recognizer and provides different expressions of the input.",
        "An obvious question about the Sandglass is why the system would rather rewrite the input than to translate it directly?",
        "Zong et al.",
        "(2000b) proposed an MT method based on the simple expression.",
        "In the method the keywords in an input utterances are spotted out firstly and the dependence relation among the keywords are analyzed.",
        "Then, the translation module searches the examples in the knowledge base according to the keywords and their dependence relation.",
        "If an example is matched with the conditions, the target language expression of the example is sent out as the translation result of the input.",
        "When the input is not very long, and the domain and the type of the input are restricted, the method is very practical.",
        "However, to develop the knowledge base with dependence relation of keywords and to match an input with all examples in the knowledge base are sometimes difficult.",
        "Wakita et al.",
        "(1997) proposed a robust translation method which locally extracts only reliable parts, i.e., those within the semantic distance threshold and over some word length.",
        "This technique, however, does not split input into units globally, or sometimes does not output any translation result (Furuse et al., 1998).",
        "In addition, the method closely lies on the semantic computation, and sometimes it is hard to compute the semantic distance for the spoken utterances.",
        "In summary, both mainstream MT methods and non-mainstream methods have been practiced in many experimental S2S translation systems.",
        "However, all methods mentioned above are unilateral and based on user's own wishful thinking.",
        "The system is passive and blind in some extent.",
        "The task that machine translates is imposed by human, and some problems are also brought by the speaker, e.g., the topics are changed casually, or the ill-formed expressions are uttered.",
        "In these cases, it is unreasonable to expect the system to get the correct translation results, but not to give the system any rights to ask the speaker about his or her intention or some ambiguous words.",
        "In fact, if we examine the procedures that human interpreters use, we can see that the translation is usually interactive.",
        "When an interpreter is unable to directly translate an utterance due to an ill-formed expression or something even worse, the interpreter may have to ask the speaker to repeat or explain his / her words.",
        "Based on the ideas, the interactive paradigms for S2S translation have been proposed (Blanchon, 1996; Waibel, 1996; Seligman, 1997; Seligman, 2000; Ren, 2000).",
        "Seligman (2000) proposed a ‘ quick and dirty’ or ‘low road’ scheme, in which he suggested that, by stressing interactive disambiguation, practically usable speech translation systems may be constructable in the near term.",
        "In addition, two interactive MT demos were shown respectively in 1997 and 1998 (Seligman, 2000).",
        "However, all the proposed interactive schemes and the demos put the emphasis on the interface between speech recognition (SR) and analysis.",
        "The interface can be supplied entirely by the user, who can correct SR results before passing them to translation components.",
        "That means the translation system is still passive.",
        "Actually, as we know that the parsing results and the translation results are not certainly correct even though the input is completely correct, but some noisy words usually have not any influence whether they are correct or not.",
        "In this sense, the user should know what the system needs?",
        "And what brought the system ambiguity?",
        "This means, the system has rights and obligations to tell the user what the system want to know.",
        "In another words, the system necessitates a DMM to guide the interaction between the system and user, and sometimes the system should play the leading role."

        "The example (3) shows that even though the expression is formal and there is not any unknown word in the input, the result of SR is still probably wrong.",
        "The parser is impossible to correctly analyze the wrong SR result.",
        "From the three examples we can easily get the following standpoints: a) the user expects his or her intentions to be translated rather than his (her) all words.",
        "The keywords and their dependence relations are the main objects to hold the user’s intentions.",
        "b) For the translation component, it is not indispensable to correct all mistakes in the input from the SR component.",

        "According to the paradigm, an input from the SR component is probably processed and translated by the following four steps.",
        "First, the input is preprocessed.",
        "Some noisy words are recognized, some repeated words are deleted, and the numbers are processed (Zong, 2000a).",
        "Then the base phrases (BP) in the input are identified, which include noun phrase (NP) and verb phrase (VP) mainly.",
