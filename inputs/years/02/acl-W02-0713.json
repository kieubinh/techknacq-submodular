        "These differences make it appear that any similarities between the machine translation of text and speech will be limited to core translation components, as opposed to pre-and post-processing operations that are linked to the medium.",
        "In this paper, we demonstrate that many challenges of translating spoken interaction are also encountered in translating written interaction such as chat or instant messaging.",
        "Consequently, it is proposed that solutions developed for these common problems can be shared by researchers engaged in applying machine translation technologies to both types of interaction.",
        "Specifically, preprocessing operations can address many of the problems that make dialogic interaction difficult to translate in both spoken and written media.",
        "After surveying the challenges that are shared in machine translation of spoken and written interaction, we identify several areas in which preprocessing solutions have been proposed that could be fruitfully adopted for either spoken or written input.",
        "The speech recognition problem of discriminating out of vocabulary words from unrecognized vocabulary words is equivalent to the problem of discriminating novel forms that emerge in chat environments from words that are unrecognized due to nonstandard spellings.",
        "We suggest that a solution based on templates like those used in example-based translation could be a useful approach to the problem for both spoken and written input.",
        "Similarly, other preprocessing operations that tag input for special processing can be used to facilitate translation of problematic phenomena such as discourse markers and vocatives.",
        "Finally, we explore the possibility that the complexity of translating interaction can be reduced by translating smaller packages of input and exploiting participants’ strategies for packaging certain discourse functions in smaller turn units."

        "(2000) report that 54% of turns with a duration of 0.7 seconds or less in their data consisted of either yeah or mmhmm and about 70% of the turns contained the same 40 words or phrasal expressions.",
        "They took advantage of these facts by building a language model tailored specifically for short turns.",
        "In a pilot study, we examined a small sample of chat data in order to determine whether short messages were more likely to contain the problematic features described in sections 2 and 3.",
        "Of 76 chat messages, 46 or 61% were 3 units or less, where units were delineated by space and punctuation (without separation of contractions) and emoticons counted as a unit.",
        "The frequency of items such as greetings, vocatives and acronyms was counted for each message size.",
        "Of 8 greetings in the corpus, 7 occurred in messages of 3 or fewer words, and all 9 greeting-plus-vocative structures occurred in messages of 3 or fewer words.",
        "Messages with 3 or fewer words also contained 11 of the 14 emotives in the corpus (including emoticons), 8 of the 10 messages with repeated letters, 3 of the 3 acronyms, 2 of the 3 discourse markers, and both of the interjections in the corpus.",
        "These results support the claim that much of the problematic usage in chat interaction is limited to short turns that can be identified and processed separately."

        "This paper demonstrates that many of the problems which complicate translation of spoken interaction are shared by written interaction such as chat and instant messaging.",
        "It is proposed that solutions developed to solve similar problems in the two communication environments can be profitably shared, and several examples are presented where mutually beneficial approaches might be developed.",
        "Specifically, we noted that the problem of discriminating unrecognized OOV words from in-vocabularly words in spoken interaction is analogous to the problem of discriminating unrecognized OOV words from misspelled words in written interaction.",
        "We suggested that some of the same methods used in spelling correction might be adapted to speech recognition, especially language models that incorporate probabilities of errors in specific positions in the word.",
        "We also observed the potential of preprocessing operations that structure input for translation systems to allow special treatment of problematic language, including the possibility that much complexity can be avoided by processing and translating smaller units separately.",
        "We look forward to exploring these possibilities in future work."
