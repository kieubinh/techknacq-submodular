      "text": [
        "In our various user studies and demonstrations, we have been forced to deal with the detrimental effects of network congestion on the transmission of Voice-over-IP in our system.",
        "The critical network paths are the H323 connections between the Mediator and the client and agent, which rely on the UDP protocol in order to guarantee real-time, but potentially lossy, human-to-human communication.",
        "This can potentially be very detrimental to the performance of speech recognizers (Metze et al., 2001).",
        "The communication between the Mediator and HLT servers can, in principle, be within a local network, although we currently run the HLT servers at the sites of the developing partners.",
        "This introduces time delays, but no packet loss, due to the use of TCP, rather than the UDP used for the H323 connections.",
        "To quantify the influence of UDP packet-loss on system performance, we ran a number of tests with German client installations in the USA (CMU at Pittsburgh) and Germany (UKA at Karlsruhe) calling a Mediator in Italy (IRST), which in turn contacted the German HLT server located at UKA.",
        "The tests were conducted by feeding a high-quality recording of the German",
        "development test-set collected at the beginning of the project into a computer set-up for a video-conference, i.e. we replaced the microphone by a DAT recorder (or a computer) playing a tape, while leaving everything else as it would be for sessions with real subjects.",
        "In particular, segmentation was based on silence detection performed automatically by NetMeeting.",
        "Each test consisted of several dialogues, lasting about an hour.",
        "These tests (a total of more than 16 hours) were conducted at different times of the day on different days of the week, in an attempt to investigate a wide as possible variety of real-life network conditions.",
        "We were able to run 16 complete tests, resulting in an average word accuracy of 60.4%,2 with single values in the 63% to 59% range for packet-loss conditions between 0.1% and 5.2%.",
        "The results of these tests are presented in graphical from in Figure 2.",
        "On a couple of occasions we experienced abnormally bad network conditions for short periods of time.",
        "These led to a breakdown of the Client-Mediator or Mediator-HLT server link due to time-out conditions being reached, or the inability to establish a connection at all.",
        "We were able, however, to record one full test with 21.0% packet loss, which resulted in a word accuracy of 50.3%.",
        "These dialogues are very difficult to understand even for humans.",
        "Our conclusion from the packet loss experi",
        "ment is that our speech recognition engine is relatively robust to packet loss rates of up to 5%, since there is no clear degradation in the word accuracy of the recognizer as a function of packet loss rate (in this range).",
        "This is very good news, since our experience indicates that packet loss rates of over 5% are quite rare under normal network traffic conditions.",
        "For 20% packet-loss, the increase in WER is significant, but the degradation is less severe than that reported in (Milner and Semnani, 2000) on synthetic data.",
        "We suspect that this is due to the non-random distribution of lost packets.",
        "The tests described above were the first phase of our research on the impact of network traffic on system performance.",
        "We are currently in the process of conducting several further experimental investigations concerning different conditions in which the system may run: Transmission of video in addition to audio through the video-conferencing communication channel: in this case we expect a substantial increase in UDP packet-loss rates due to audio and video competing for the network bandwidth over the H323 connections.",
        "It is not clear, however, how this competition takes place in practice and what are the resulting repercussions on the audio quality (and consequently on the recognizers’ performance).",
        "The use of low-bandwidth network connections (such as standard 56Kbps modems): This is the most common network scenario for real client users using a home installed computer.",
        "We are currently exploring how the bandwidth limitations in this setting affect audio quality and system usability.",
        "In low bandwidth conditions, NetMeeting supports encoding the speech with the G.723 codec, which can consume a much lower bandwidth (less then 6.4Kbps) compared to the G.711 codec (64Kbps), which we currently use in our system.",
        "We are in the process of testing the G.723 codec within our system.",

      "text": [
        "The nature of the e-commerce scenario and application in which our system is situated requires that speech-translation be well-integrated with additional modalities of communication and information exchange between the agent and client.",
        "Significant effort has been devoted to this issue within the project.",
        "The main multi-modal component in the current version of our system is the AeWhiteboard – a special whiteboard, which allows users to share maps and web-pages.",
        "The functionalities provided by the AeWhiteboard include: image loading, freehand drawing, area selecting, color choosing, scrolling the image loaded, zooming the image loaded, URL opening, and Nespole!",
        "Monitor activation.",
        "The most important feature of the whiteboard is that each gesture performed by a user is mirrored on the whiteboard of the other user.",
        "Both users communicate while viewing the same images and annotated whiteboards.",
        "Typically, the client asks for spatial information regarding locations, distances, and navigation directions (e.g., how to get from a hotel to the ski slopes).",
        "By using the whiteboard, the agent can indicate the locations and draw routes on the map, point at areas, select items, draw connections between different locations using a mouse or an optical pen, and accompany his/her gestures with verbal explanations.",
        "Supporting such combined verbal and gesture interactions has required modifications and extensions of both HLT modules and the IF.",
        "During July 2001, we conducted a detailed study to evaluate the effect of multi-modality on the communication effectiveness and usability of our system.",
        "The goals of the experiment were to test: (1) whether multi-modality increases the probability of successful interaction, especially when spatial information is the focus of the communicative exchange; (2) whether multi-modality helps reduce mis-communications and disfluencies; and (3) whether multi-modality supports a faster recovery from recognition and translation errors.",
        "For these purposes, two experimental conditions were devised: a speech-only condition (SO), involving multilingual communication and the sharing of images; and a multi-modal condition (MM), where users could additionally convey spatial information by pen-based gestures on shared maps.",
        "The setting for the experiment was the scenario described earlier, involving clients searching for winter tour-package information in the Trentino province.",
        "The client’s task was to select an appropriate resort location and hotel within the specified constraints concerning the relevant geographical area, the available budget, etc.",
        "The agent’s task was to provide the necessary information.",
        "Novice subjects, previously unfamiliar with the system and task were recruited to play the role of the clients.",
        "Subjects wore a head-mounted microphone, using it in a push-to-talk mode, and drew gestures on maps by means of a table-pen device or a mouse.",
        "Each subject could only hear the translated speech of the other party (original audio was disabled in this experiment).",
        "28 dialogues were collected, with 14 dialogues each for English and for German clients, and Italian agents in all cases.",
        "Each group contained 7 SO and 7 MM dialogues.",
        "The dialogue transcriptions include: orthographical transcription, annotations for spontaneous phenomena and disfluencies, turn information and annotations for gestures.",
        "Translated turns were classified into successful, partially successful and unsuccessful by comparing the translated turns with the responses they generated.",
        "Repeated turns were also counted.",
        "The average duration of dialogues was 35 minutes (35.8 for SO and 35.5 for MM).",
        "On average, a dialogue contained 35 turns, 247 tokens and 97 token types per speaker.",
        "Average values and variance of all measures are very similar for agents and clients and across conditions and Languages.",
        "ANOVA tests (p=0.05) on the number of turns and the number of spontaneous phenomena and disfluencies, agents and customers separately, did not produce any evidence that modality or language affected these variables.",
        "Hence the spoken input is homogeneous across groups.",
        "Details on the experimental database collected and the various statistical analyses performed appear in (Costantini et al., 2002).",
        "The analysis of the results indicated that both the SO and MM versions of the system were effective for goal completion: 86% of the users were able to complete the task’s goal by choosing a hotel meeting the pre-specified budget and location constraints.",
        "In the MM dialogues, there were 7.6 gestures per dialogue on average.",
        "The agents performed almost all gestures (98%), with a clear preference for area selections (61% of total gestures).",
        "Most gestures (79%) followed a dialogue contribution; none of the gestures were performed during speech.",
        "Overall, few or no deictics were used.",
        "We believe that these findings are related to the push-to-talk procedure and to the time needed to transfer gestures across the network: agents often preceded gestures with appropriate verbal cues e.g., “I’ll show you the hotel on the map”, in order to notify the other party of an upcoming gesture.",
        "These verbal cues indicate that gestures were well integrated in the communication.",
        "We found significant differences between the SO and MM dialogues in terms of unsuccessful and repeated turns, particularly so in the spatial segments of the dialogues.",
        "In the English-Italian dialogues the MM dialogues contained 19% unsuccessful turns versus 30% for the SO dialogues.",
        "For German-Italian dialogues we found 18% in MM versus 31% in SO.",
        "English-Italian MM dialogues contained 11% repeated turns versus 17% for SO.",
        "For German-Italian dialogues repeated turns amounted to 18% for MM versus 23% for SO.",
        "In addition we found smoother dialogues under MM condition, with fewer returns to already discussed topics for MM (one return every 19 turns in SO versus one return every 31 turns in MM).",
        "MM also exhibited a lower number of dialogue segments containing identifiable misunderstandings between the two parties (one such segment in each of 3 of the MM dialogues, versus a total of seven such segments in the SO dialogues – one dialogue with 3 segments, one with two, and a third with a single segment of miscommunication).",
        "Furthermore, the misunderstandings in MM conditions were often immediately solved by resorting to MM resources, while in case of SO ambiguous or misunderstood sub-dialogues often remained unresolved.",
        "Finally, the experiment subjects, given the choice between the MM and the SO system, expressed a clear preference for the former.",
        "In summary, we found strong supporting evidence that mul-timodality has a positive effect on the quality of interaction by reducing ambiguity, making it easier to resolve ambiguous utterances and to recover from system errors, improving the flow of the dialogue, and enhancing the mutual comprehension between the parties, in particular when spatial information is involved."
