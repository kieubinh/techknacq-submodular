        "In the last 15 years a number of speech recognition tasks have been studied and evaluated.",
        "Each task presented different challenges.",
        "The features characterizing these tasks are: type of speech (well formed vs spontaneous), target of communication (computer, audience, person), bandwidth ( FWB, full bandwidth TWB, telephone bandwidth, FF, far field).",
        "Some of these tasks are dictation (WSJ), broadcast news, switchboard, voicemail and meetings.",
        "In what follows, they are ordered in terms of the word error rate (wer) Dictation: 7%, well formed, computer, FBW Broadcast news: 12%, various, audience, FBW Switchboard : 20-30% spontaneous, person, TBW Voicemail: 30% spontaneous, person, TWB Meetings: 50-60% spontaneous, person FF At present the spontaneous speech is the feature with the largest effect on word error rate, followed by environment effect and domain dependence.",
        "The main challenge for the next years will be to develop speech recognition systems that mimics human performance.",
        "This means in general independent of environment, domain and working as well for spontaneous as for read speech.",
        "The focus areas will mainly concentrate first of all on improving the spontaneous speech models ( i.e prosodic features and articolatory models, multispeaker speech, collect adequate amount of conversational speech,...), modeling and training techniques for multi-environment and multi-domain.",
        "Then another key issue will be language modeling.",
        "It is well known that different static language models work best on specific domain.",
        "To implement a language model that works well on many domains will be an important achievement towards the goal of mimicking the human performance.",
        "A very quick dynamic adaptation at the level of word/sentence is an important target of the research.",
        "Finally other factors driving progress will be the continuous improving of computer speed over time, the independence from vocabulary and the involvement of all the potential researchers in the field, not only a few institutions.",
        "Improving the performance of conversational speech and introducing highly dynamic language models are the two fundamental requirement for improving S2ST performances.",
        "This is maybe the most critical point because performing under 10%, in conversational speech, seems today an hard problem."

        "In a corpus based approach the unit selection process involves a combinatorial search over the entire speech corpus, and consequently, fast search algorithms have been developed for this purpose as an integral part of current synthesis systems.",
        "Three are the main factors of the corpus-based methods for a specification of the speech segments required for concatenative synthesis: first of all a unit selection algorithm, then some objective measures used in the selection criteria and finally the design of the required speech corpus.",
        "From the application point of view the huge amount of memory necessary for exploiting the concatenation of speech units, strongly limits the class of application.",
        "Prosody and speaker characteristics are, together with speech segments design, the other two important issues in speech synthesis.",
        "In order to control prosody, it is necessary to ensure adequate intonation and stress, rhythm, tempo and accent.",
        "Segmental duration control and fundamental frequency control are needed.",
        "Speech waveforms contain not only linguistic information but also speaker voice characteristics, as manifested in the glottal waveform of voice excitation and in the global spectral features representing vocal tract characteristics.",
        "Moreover paralinguistic factors cause changes in speaking styles reflected in a change of both voice quality and prosody.",
        "Prosodic modeling is probably the domain from which most of the improvements will come.",
