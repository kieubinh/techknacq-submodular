        "Prepositions have generally been viewed as function words to be discarded in many natural language processing applications.",
        "However, prepositions have considerable importance as identifiers of semantic relations tying various elements of a sentence together.",
        "Since many prepositions are highly polysemous, it is necessary to develop a finer-grained analyses of their meanings so that the semantic relations can be more accurately identified.",
        "We have modeled preposition definitions in a dictionary using directed labeled graphs (digraphs) to identify primitive preposition senses.",
        "We have used the definitions from a machine-readable version of a comprehensive English dictionary.",
        "A preposition is “a word governing, and usually preceding, a noun or pronoun and expressing a relation to another word or element in the clause.” The definition of a preposition takes two principal forms: (1) a usage expression characterizing the relation or (2) an expression that can be substituted for the preposition.",
        "A substituting preposition definition usually consists of a prepositional phrase (including both a preposition and a noun phrase) and a terminating preposition (e.g., for around, one definition is “on every side of”)."

        "Modeling a dictionary with a digraph entails assigning an interpretation to the nodes and arcs.",
        "For our initial model, we subsume all the definitions of a preposition as one node in the digraph, labeled by the preposition.",
        "An arc is drawn from one node (e.g., of) to another (e.g., around) if the preposition represented by the first node contributes a typed meaning component with an open slot to the preposition represented by the second node, e.g., “part-of of around” would arise from the definition of around (“on every side of”).",
        "Loosely, for our purposes, the terminating preposition acts as a genus term in an ISA hierarchy and makes it possible to use the results from digraph theory to analyze the relationships between definitions.",
        "In particular, digraph analysis identifies definitional cycles and “primitives” and arranges the nodes into an inheritance hierarchy.",
        "When a dictionary is modeled like this, digraph theory (Harary, et al.",
        "1965) indicates that there is a “basis set” of nodes, which may be viewed as a set of primitives.1 Many prepositions are not used as the final preposition of other preposition definitions (specifically, their nodes have an outdegree of 0).",
        "These are the leaves of the inheritance hierarchy.",
        "When these are removed from the dictionary, other prepositions will come to have outdegree 0, and may in turn be removed.",
        "After all such iterations, the remaining nodes are “strongly connected”, that is, for every node, there is a path to each other node; a strong component is an equivalence class and corresponds to a definitional cycle.",
        "Each strong component may now be viewed as a node.",
        "Some of these nodes also have the property that they have outdegree 0; these strong component may also be removed from the dictionary.",
        "This may introduce a new round where individual nodes or strong components have outdegree 0 and hence may be removed from the dictionary.",
        "After all removals, what is left is a set of one or more strong components, each of which is unreachable from the other.",
        "This final set is viewed as the set of primitives.",
        "What this means is that we have converted the preposition dictionary into an inheritance hierarchy.",
        "If we can characterize the meanings of the primitives, we can then inherit these meanings in all the words and definitions that have been previously been removed."

        "In this new model, each node represents a single sense and the arc between two nodes indicates that one specific sense is used to define one specific sense of another word (i.e., “contributes a typed meaning component with an open slot to”).",

        "The digraph analysis of prepositions provides additional perspectives in understanding their meanings and their use.",
        "To begin with, the analysis enables us to identify definitional cycles and move toward the creation of an inheritance hierarchy.",
        "The large number of senses that have verb hypernymic roots indicates a close kinship between prepositions and verbs, suggesting that a verb hierarchy may provide an organizing principle for prepositions (discussed further below).",
        "The large number of senses rooted in usage notes, which essentially characterize how these senses function, encapsulates the role of prepositions as “function words;” however, as described below, these functions are not simply syntactic in nature, but also capture semantic roles.",
        "The frequency with which the various prepositions are used as hypernyms in defining other prepositions reveals something about their relative importance.",
        "The most frequent hypernyms are of (175), to (74), than (45), with (44), by (39), from (30), for (22), as (20), and in (12).",
        "These prepositions correspond to the primitives identified in Table 1, as well as those with the largest number of usage notes shown in Table 3.",
        "On the other hand, the relative frequencies may not correspond well with our intuitions about a semantic classification of prepositions.",
        "(Quirk, et al.",
        "1985) give the greatest prominence to spatial and temporal meanings, followed by the cause/purpose spectrum, the means/agentive spectrum, accompaniment, and support and opposition, and finally, several miscellaneous categories.",
        "In the semantic relations hierarchy of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) (Unified Medical Language System 2002), five general types of associations are identified: physical, spatial, functional (causal), temporal, and conceptual.",
        "The leaves of the UMLS hierarchy are realized as verbs, but have a strong correspondence to the classification in (Quirk, et al.",
        "1985).",
        "In our identification of primitives, including the usage notes, spatial and temporal senses are conspicuously reduced in significance, while a comparative term (than) seems to have a much greater presence.",
        "The explanation for these two observations is that (1) many of the basic spatial and temporal prepositions were located in the largest strong component (12 in Table 1) or were derived from it and (2) many of the senses of these spatial and temporal prepositions have “than” as hypernym.",
        "This suggests that a considerable amount of the meaning of such prepositions lie principally in describing relative position in a spatio-temporal continuum."

        "As suggested earlier, the next stage of digraph analysis involves disambiguating the hypernymic preposition, so that individual nodes of the digraph represent senses or concepts.",

        "gloss and the various lexicalizations the concept, much like the synsets in WordNet (Fellbaum 1998).",
        "A prototypical case would be strong component 23 which may be lexicalized as {by reason of, because of, on account of}; our analysis suggests that, in this case, some further characterization of the usage of this concept by the lexicographers would be desirable, since otherwise we have only a vicious definitional cycle.",
        "The creation of the hierarchy would involve assigning a label or type to the individual concepts and then characterizing the information that is to be inherited.",

        "This value will be useful in disambiguating the hypernymic preposition (as described in the next section).",

        "To describe the process by which preposition senses will be disambiguated and also how the representations of their meaning will be used in processing text, Table 4 shows the definitions for “of”, the most frequently used hypernym and perhaps the second most frequent word in the English language.",
        "In the table, we have assigned a type to each of nine main senses.",
        "In the definition column, the main sense is given first, with any subsenses given in parentheses, separated by semicolons if there is more than one subsense.",
        "First, we consider the disambiguation of hypernyms in preposition definitions, that is, those whose final word is “of”.",
        "One sense of “after” is “in imitation of” (e.g., “a mystery story after Poe”); examining the table suggests that this is a deverbal use of “of”, where the object of “after” would be the object of the underlying verb of “imitation”, so that when “after” is used in this sense, its arg1 is the object of the verb “imitate”.",
        "A sense of “on behalf of” is “as a representative of”; this is the partitive sense, so that arg1 of “on behalf of” is a “whole”.",
        "Finally, one sense of “like” is “characteristic of”; this is the predicative deverbal.",
        "Carrying out this process throughout the preposition definitions will thus enable us not only to disambiguate them, but also to identify characteristics of their arguments when the prepositions they define are used in some text.",
        "In addition, prepositions very often appear at the end of the definitions of transitive verbs.",
        "For example, one sense of “accommodate” is “provide lodging or sufficient space for”, where the sense of “for” is “to the benefit of”, where “of” is used in the genitive sense (i.e., “someone’s or something’s benefit).",
        "With this interpretation, we can say that the object of “accommodate” is a benefactive and that a benefactive role has been lexicalized into the meaning of “accommodate”.",
        "With disambiguation of the final preposition in such definitions, we will be able to characterize the objects of these verbs with some theta role.",

        "Our implementation of the semantic relation module has identified several issues of interest.",
        "First, the characterization of the semantic relation needs to come after the object of the prepositional phrase has been analyzed for its discourse entity properties.",
        "For example, if the object is an anaphor, the antecedent needs to be established.",
        "Second, the attachment points of the prepositional phrase need to be identified; our parser establishes a stack of possible attachment points (index positions in the sentence), with the most likely at the top of the stack.",
        "(Attachment tests could be implemented at this point, although we have not yet done so.)",
        "The attachment point is necessary to identify the arguments to be analyzed.",
        "Having identified the arguments, the information subject to analysis includes the literal arguments (both the full phrase and their roots), the parts of speech of the arguments, any semantic characterizations of the arguments that are available (such as the WordNet file number), and access to the dictionary definitions of the root heads.",
        "The analysis for the semantic relation is specific to the preposition.",
        "We are encoding a semantic relation type and one or more tests with each sense.",
        "Some of these tests are simple, such as string matches, and others are complex, involving function calls to examine semantic relationships between the arguments.",
        "In the case of “of”, the first test was whether arg2 is an adjective, in which case we assigned a type of “predicative”.",
        "Next, if arg2 was a vague general category (“form”, “type”, or “kind”), we set the type to “hypernymic”.",
        "If neither of these conditions was satisfied, we looked up the root of arg2 in WordNet to determine if the word had a “part-of” relation (resulting in a “partitive” type) or “member-of” relation (resulting in a “hypernymic” type).",
        "If a type had not been established by this point, we used the WordNet file number to establish an intermediate type.",
        "Thus, for example, if arg2 was an “action” or “process” word, we set the type for the semantic relation to “deverbal”; for a “quantity”, we set the type to “partitive”.",
        "Finally, we can make use of the definition for arg1 (parsed to identify its hypernym) to determine if arg2 is the hypernym of arg1.",
        "When these criteria are not sufficient, we label the type “undetermined”.",
        "In our encyclopedia project, we parse and process the articles to generate XML files.",
        "We then apply an XSL transformation to extract all the semantic relations that were identified, including the preposition, the type assigned, and the values of",
        "arg1 and arg2.",
        "We can sort on these fields to facilitate analysis of our success and to identify situations in need of further work.",
        "After the initial implementation, we were able to assign semantic relations to 50 percent of the instances of “of”, although many of these were given incorrect assignments.",
        "However, the method is useful for identifying instances for which improved analysis is necessary.",
        "For example, we can identify where improved characterization of discourse entities is needed, or where additional lexical information might be desirable (such as how to identify a partitive noun)."
