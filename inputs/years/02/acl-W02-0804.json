        "87), (Verkuyl et al.",

        "The semantics of other types of prepositions describing manner, instrument, amount or accompaniement remains largely unexplored (with a few exceptions however, such as avec (with) (Mari 00)).",
        "Our general application framework is knowledge extraction using linguistic and symbolic techniques.",
        "In this framework, the treatment of predicative forms is crucial to characterize actions, processes and states.",
        "Predicative forms include verbs, but also prepositions which have a heavy semantic weight by themselves.",
        "Of much interest are also the interactions verb-preposition-NP.",
        "This short document is a brief analysis of how preposition uses (as arguments or adjuncts) and senses, in standard utterances, can be organized and characterized.",
        "The method presented here, applied to French, seems general and applicable to many languages.",

      "text": [
        "Before looking in more depth at the semantic representation of preposition senses, let us investigate a few elements for delimiting senses that settle our theoretical and practical perspective.",
        "We prefer to use the term ‘strategy’ to delimit senses since there is obviously no theory or even no ‘formal’ procedure.",
        "This task is extremely difficult, but necessary for any real NLP application with a quite wide coverage.",
        "Very informally, in our perspective, we assume that a sense (more or less large and constrained) of a lexeme has a basic form and basic expressions or usages (surface forms reflecting the basic sense).",
        "The basic sense originates derived usages, which are more or less constrained and limited, via metonymy, metaphor, slight sense-shiftings or co-composition (Pustejovsky, 1991, 1995).",
        "One of the difficulties is, given a set of usages, to partition them into semantically coherent sets, each set corresponding to a sense.",
        "Sense delimitation is largely an open problem.",
        "It is indeed almost impossible to state precise and general principles that characterize the boundaries of different senses of a lexeme and, finally, what a sense exactly is.",
        "The difficulty is then to elaborate a coherent system for sense delimitation and for characterizing sense and usage variations.",
        "Solutions have been proposed, which are not totally satisfactory.",
        "For example, Word-Net (Fellbaum, 1997) tends to introduce one sense for each group of very closely related usages.",
        "For example, WordNet has 27 different senses for the verb give.",
        "Distinctions between senses are often very subtle and somewhat hard to represent in a semantic representation.",
        "This approach is very useful in the sense that it provides a very detailed description of the usages of a large number of words in English, but we think it lacks generalizations about language which are often useful for NLP systems to work efficiently.",
        "On the other side, are AI-based perspectives which tend to postulate a unique sense for a lexeme and very complex derivation procedures, involving complex logical systems, to produce different senses and possibly sub-senses.",
        "The approach taken in WordNet is close to that taken by a number of paper dictionaries, where sense distinctions are very numerous and essentially based on usage.",
        "These distinctions are, in a large part, based on the semantic nature of the arguments.",
        "There are confusions between what we view as ‘basic’ senses and derived ones.",
        "Indeed, a number of situations that would be analyzed as metaphors or metonymies are identified as original senses.",
        "Consequently, dictionaries are certainly a very good tool to identify the different usages and senses of a lexeme, but they cannot be used directly in our framework.",
        "There are however a few very welcome exceptions such as the German-French Harrap’s dictionary which has a very relevant and sound approach to multilinguism based on a conceptual analysis of language and of translation.",
        "Our perspective is between these two ‘extremes’, lexicography and AI.",
        "We think that the different usages of a word should be organized around a small, relatively generic, number of senses.",
        "From these senses, generative procedures must produce or recognize derived usages.",
        "These procedures must obviously be sound, and must not over-generate (e.g. the rules claimed to be general in e.g. (Lakoff et ali.",
        "99) must certainly not be taken for granted)."

      "text": [
        "The identification of a preposition sense is essentially based on the observation of groups of usages.",
        "It is then confirmed by two criteria: (a) the nature and the stability within a certain semantic domain of the type of the head noun of the PP, that confirms the ontological basis of the sense and, concomitantly, (b) the restrictions required by the verb on the nature of the PP, if it is an argument.",
        "Dictionary definitions and multilingual considerations may also help.",
        "Pragmatic factors may also interfere, but this is outside the scope of this study (e.g. Busa 96).",
        "Although prepositions have some idiosyncratic usages (probably much less in French than in English), most senses are relatively generic and can be characterized using relatively consensual and high-level ontology labels.",
        "Let us consider the case of par1.",
        "The following 6 senses can be quite easily identified and characterized.",
        "They come from very diverse ontological domains but they seem to be all approximately at the same level of abstraction:",
        "• proportion or distribution: il gagne 1500 Euros par mois (he earns 1500 Euros per month), • causality: as in passives but also e.g. in par mau-vais temps, je ne ne sors pas (by bad weather I don’t go out), • origin: je le sais par des amis (I know it from friends), • via: je passe par ce chemin (I go via this path), • tool or means: je voyage par le train (I travel by train), • approximation of a value: nous marchons par 3500m d’altitude (we hike at an altitude of 3500m).",
        "An important point is that uses with par do not necessarily cover all the conceptual field associated with each sense.",
        "For example, the expression of the idea of approximation using par is rather restricted to localization, speed or movement, not e.g. to amounts of money.",
        "One of the tasks is then to characterize, for each sense, what is the portion of the conceptual field which is covered.",
        "This is done via two means: (1) by a semantic characterization of the NP dominated by the preposition and (2) by the analysis of the restrictions imposed by the verb of the clause on the PP, or, conversely, by the type or family of the verb the preposition can be combined with, for that particular sense.",
        "Let us now examine the basic restrictions for 3 senses of par.",
        "The ‘VIA’ sense is basically subcate-gorized by movement verbs; it is a path, subcategorizing for a noun of type ‘way’ or ‘route’ or, by a kind of metonymic extension, any object which can define a trajectory, e.g. an aperture (by the window).",
        "It has numerous metaphors in the psychological and epistemic",
        "domains (e.g. Il passe par des moments difficiles (He experiences difficult moments)).",
        "The ‘ORIGIN’ sense is more narrow, it is essentially used in conjunction with communication or epistemic verbs, the argument is usually of type place, and the head noun is of type ‘human’ Il transite par Paris (he commutes in Paris).",
        "We consider that nouns of type e.g. ‘object with an informational content’ introduce a metonymic extension, as in, e.g. par la radio / la presse (I know the news from the radio / the newspapers).",
        "Finally, note that there is a kind of continuum between Origin and Causality, as in: I know she wears bracelets from the noise she makes when she moves.",
        "Finally, the ‘TOOLS or MEANS’ sense is used with verbs describing concrete actions (e.g. creation and movement verbs, if we refer to verb class systems (e.g. (Levin 93), (Fellbaum 93)).",
        "In general it is an adjunct.",
        "It is typed as a means, and the head noun of the PP must be e.g. a tool, or, more generally, an object that allows the action to be realized.",
        "This object could be found e.g. in the encyclopedic knowledge associated with the verb, or via a functional relation in a thesaurus.",
        "It has also numerous metaphoric extensions (e.g. je traite ce ph´enom`ene par la logique temporelle (I deal with this phenomena ‘by’ temporal logic))."

        "Location is obviously too general a restriction (*to be in the shelf).",

        "More complex is the case of boire dans un verre (literally: drink in a glass).",

        "For example, the facet manner and attitudes is decomposed into 3 modalities: basic manner, manner by comparison and manner with a reference point.",
        "Due to space limitations, this latter level will not be developed in this document.",

        "• Localization with subsenses: - source, - destination, - via/passage, - fixed position.",
        "Destination may be decomposed into destination reached or not (possibly vague), but this is often contextual.",
        "From an ontological point of view, all of theses senses can, a priori, apply to spatial, temporal or to more abstract arguments.",
        "• Quantity with subsenses: - numerical or referencial quantity, - frequency and iterativity, - proportion or ratio.",
        "Quantity can be either precise (temperature is 5 degrees above 0) or vague.",
        "Frequency and iterativity, e.g.: he comes several times per week.",
        "• Manner with subsenses: - manners and attitudes, - means (instrument or abstract),",
        "- imitation or analogy.",
        "Imitation: he walks like a robot; he behaves according to the law,",
        "• Accompaniement with subsenses: - adjunction, - simultaneity of events (co-events), - inclusion, - exclusion.",

        "Compared to the description in LCS of verbs, representing prepositions in LCS is rather straightforward and much more adequate.",
        "A few principles guide this description: (1) the representation of generic senses (e.g. family level) subsumes the representation of their daughters, (2) different senses of a given preposition receive substancially different semantic representations, (3) metaphoric uses are characterized in part by semantic field substitution in the LCS, not by a different representation with different primitives, and (4) the number of primitives representing prepositions must be as limited as possible.",

        "Pragmatic factors are, for example: Pierre a cach´e son livre sous son blouson, where sous (=under his jacket) means dans (=in).",
        "Same for Laguerre avec l’Allemagne (the war with Germany), where avec characterizes an opposition (contre (against) is more usual), due to the semantics of war, a use that needs some interpretation (there are a few such situations with aggression verbs, where semantic composition is necessary to get the meaning of the expression).",
        "Finally, another test for sense distinctions we are carrying out is the coordination test where two different senses of a preposition should not, a priori, be coordinated: * Un m´edicament contre la toux et contre l’avis du m´edecin."

        "In this document, we have shown some elements of a method to identify, in a generative perspective, the behavior ofprepositions in mono and multilingual contexts.",
        "We have initialized a discussion on the delimitation of senses, from observed uses, and have proposed a semantic representation for each of them based on the LCS.",
        "From the examples given in here, we can see that some regularities can be quite easily captured and dealt with by means of relatively simple tools, whereas a number of complex cases need much more attention and solutions seem to require a pragmatic interpretation, or long enumerations of specific realizations.",
        "Besides the obvious need of several steps of evaluation, we now have in mind to develop a form a lexical tuning to enrich the semantic characterization of preposition senses, at three levels: selectional restrictions or constraints identifying senses, preferences among senses (some are much more prominent or prototypical than others) and refining the LCS representation to accommodate different forms of e.g. metaphors and metonymies."
