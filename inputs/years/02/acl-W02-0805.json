        "Our goal is to characterize sense inventories, both qualitatively and quantitatively, so that the following questions can be answered:",
        "• Given a pair of senses of the same word, are they related?",
        "If so, in what way and how closely?",
        "• How well are individual senses defined?",
        "For each sense, how homogeneous are its examples of use?",
        "How coarse is its definition?",
        "Should it be split into subsenses?",
        "• How do these issues affect the evaluation of automatic Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) systems using the sense inventory?",
        "What penalty should be assigned to a WSD system that confuses two senses, i.e. how much should it be penalized according to how close these senses are?",
        "Can the sense inventory be improved for evaluation purposes, for instance, splitting senses into finer-grained distinctions or collapsing close senses into coarser clusters?",
        "In particular, we are interested in characterizing WordNet 1.7 as sense inventory for the Senseval-2 WSD comparative evaluation.",
        "Unlike conventional dictionaries, WordNet does not group senses of the same word in a hierarchical structure; every sense belongs to a synset, and can only be related to other senses via conceptual relations (rather than sense relations).",
        "Conceptual relations can be used to define measures of semantic distance (Sussna, 1993; Agirre and Rigau, 1996; Resnik, 1995), but topic relatedness is not well captured by wordnet relations, and this is a fundamental parameter to estimate sense similarity in many NLP applications (Gonzalo et al., 2000).",
        "The issue of estimating semantic distance between senses of a polysemous word has been previously addressed in (Resnik and Yarowsky, 1997; Resnik and Yarowsky, 1999).",
        "They propose a measure of semantic distance based on the likelihood of the sense distinction being lexicalized in some target language.",
        "The measure was tested using statistics collected from native-speaker translations of 222 polysemous contexts across 12 languages.",
        "The results obtained showed that monolingual sense dis",
        "tinctions at most levels of granularity can be effectively captured by translations into some set of second languages, especially as language family distance increases.",
        "The distance matrices obtained reproduced faithfully the hierarchical arrangement of senses provided by the Hector database used in Senseval-1 (Kilgarriff and Palmer, 2000).",
        "In order to characterize the Senseval-2 Wordnet 1.7 subset, we have adopted such methodology, extending it to capture also individual sense homogeneity, and comparing both quantitative measures with a coarse, qualitative classification of semantic relations between senses of a word.",
        "In Section 2 we introduce the quantitative measures of sense relatedness (as defined by Resnik & Yarowsky) and sense stability (as an extension to it).",
        "In Section 3, we describe the qualitative classification that will be confronted to such measures.",
        "In Sections 4 and 5, we describe the experiment design and discuss the results obtained.",
        "Finally, we draw some conclusions."

        "In general, what is the semantic distance between senses of a given word?",
        ".",
        "Are there sense definitions that are too coarse-grained, vague or confusing?",

        "Such measures would enable a finer scoring of WSD systems, and would provide new criteria to compare this test suite with data in forthcoming Senseval evaluations.",
        "The first question can be answered with a quantitative estimate of sense proximity.",
        "We will use the cross-linguistic measure of sense distance proposed in (Resnik and Yarowsky, 1999), where sense relatedness between two meanings of a given word, wi and wj, is estimated as the average probability of receiving the same translation across a set of instances and a set of languages:",
        "where trL(x),trL(y) are the translations of instances x, y into language L. The second question can be addressed by estimating sense stability.",
        "Extending the assumption in (Resnik and Yarowsky, 1999), we propose a sense stability score based also on cross-lingual evidence: stability will be estimated with the likelihood for a pair of occurrences of a word sense wi of receiving the same translation for a language L, averaged for as many language (and language families) as possible:",
        "This value depends on various factors.",
        "Too coarse-grained sense definition should lead to a lower stability, since different contexts may highlight subsenses differently lexicalized across the selected languages.",
        "The stability index also reflects the adequacy of the selected instances and how well they have been understood by annotators.",
