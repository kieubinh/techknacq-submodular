        "We describe a new version of the Dutch word sense disambiguation system trained and tested on a corrected version of the SENSEVAL-2 data.",
        "The system is an ensemble of word experts; each word expert is a memory-based classifier of which the parameters are automatically determined through cross-validation on training material.",
        "The original best-performing system, which used only local context features for disambiguation, is further refined by performing additional parallel cross-validation experiments for optimizing algorithmic parameters and the amount of local context available to each of the word experts’ memory-based kernels.",
        "This procedure produces an accuracy of 84.8% on test material, improving on a baseline score of 77.2% and the previous SENSEVAL-2 score of 84.2%.",
        "We show that cross-validation overfits; had the local context been held constant at two left and right neighbouring words, the system would have scored 85.0%."

        "Solving lexical ambiguity, or word sense disambiguation (WSD), is an important task in Natural Language Processing systems (Kilgarriff and Palmer, 2000).",
        "Much like syntactic word-class disambiguation, it is not a end in itself, but rather a subtask of other natural language processing tasks.",
        "The problem is far from solved, and research and competition in the development of WSD systems in isolation remains meritable, preferrably on many different languages and genres.",
        "This paper describes a refinement of an existing all-words WSD system for Dutch (Hoste et al., 2002b) that is an ensemble of word experts, each specialised in disambiguating the senses for one particular ambiguous wordform.",
        "Each word expert has a memory-based classification kernel.",
        "The system was developed on the basis of Dutch WSD data made available for the SENSEVAL-2 competition.",
        "The data, a collection of 102 children’s books for the age range of 4 to 12, is annotated according to a non-hierarchical sense inventory that is based on a children’s dictionary (for a detailed description of the data, cf. (Hendrickx and van den Bosch, 2002)).",
        "Since SENSEVAL-2, both the data and the system have been refined.",
        "The data has been cleaned by hand to remove annotation errors.",
        "Subsequently, cross-validation experiments were performed to optimize the amount of local context around the ambiguous word, which had been set arbitrarily constant in previous studies (Veenstra et al., 2000; Hendrickx and van den Bosch, 2002; Hoste et al., 2002a).",
        "Cross-validation focused on local context as opposed to non-local context (e.g. keyword features), since a post-SENSEVAL-2 study described in (Hoste et al., 2002b) indicated that for the Dutch data, WSD on local context, the immediate three left and right neighbouring words of the ambiguous words, yielded the best performance among all variants tested.",
        "Local context alone proved to be better than keyword vector representations of the wider textual context, and better than classifier combination schemes.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "First, in Section 2 we briefly review the Dutch WSD system and the data it is based on.",
        "Section 3 describes the new cross-validation experiments that focus on optimising the amount of local context per word expert.",
        "Section 4 discusses the new results and puts them in perspective of related studies."

        "The memory-based WSD system for Dutch, henceforth referred to as MBWSD-D, is built from the viewpoint of WSD as a classification task.",
        "Given an ambiguous word and its context as input features, a data-trained classifier assigns the contextually correct class (sense) to it.",
        "Our approach to memory-based all-words WSD follows the memory-based approach of (Ng and Lee, 1996), and the work by (Veenstra et al., 2000) on a memory-based approach to the English lexical sample task of SENSEVAL-1.",
        "We borrow the classification-based approach, and the word-expert concept of the latter: for each wordform, a word expert classifier is trained on disambiguating its one particular wordform.",

      "text": [
        "The distinguishing feature of memory-based learning (MBL) in contrast with minimal-description-length-driven or “eager” ML algorithms is that MBL keeps all training data in memory, and only abstracts at classification time by extrapolating a class from the most similar item(s) in memory to the new test item.",
        "This strategy is often referred to as “lazy” learning.",
        "In recent work (Daelemans et al., 1999) we have shown that for typical natural language processing tasks, this lazy learning approach performs well because it allows extrapolation from low-frequency or exceptional cases, whereas eager methods tend to treat these as discardable noise.",
        "Also, the automatic feature weighting in the similarity metric of a memory-based learner makes the approach well-suited for domains with large numbers of features from heterogeneous sources, as it embodies a smoothing-by-similarity method when data is sparse (Zavrel and Daelemans, 1997).",
        "For our experiments, we used the MBL algorithms implemented in TIMBL1.",
        "We give a brief overview of the algorithms and metrics here, and refer to (Daelemans et al., 1997; Daelemans et al., 2001) for more information.",
        "IB 1 – The distance between a test item and each memory item is defined as the number of features for which they have a different value (Aha et al., 1991).",
        "Classification occurs via the k-nearest-distances rule: all memory items which are equally near at the nearest k distances surrounding the test item are taken into account in classification.",
        "The classification assigned to the test item is simply the majority class among the memory items at the k nearest distances.",
        "Feature-weighted IB 1 – In most cases, not all features are equally relevant for solving the task; different types of weighting are available in TIMBL to assign differential cost to a feature value mismatch during comparison.",
        "Some of these are information-theoretic (based on measuring the reduction of uncertainty about the class to be predicted when knowing the value of a feature): information gain and gain ratio.",
        "Others are statistical (based on comparing expected and observed frequencies of value-class associations): chi-squared and shared variance.",
        "Distance-weighted IB 1 – Instead of simply taking the majority class among all memory items in the k nearest distances, the class vote of each memory item is weighted by its distance.",
        "The more distant a memory item is to the test item, the lower its class vote is.",
        "This can be implemented by using several mathematical functions; the TIMBL software implements linear inversed distance weights, inversed distance weights, and exponentially decayed distance weights.",
        "Value-difference weighted IB 1 –For typical symbolic (nominal) features, values are not ordered.",
        "In the previous variants, mismatches between values are all interpreted as equally important, regardless of how similar (in terms of classification behaviour) the values are.",
        "We adopted the modified value difference metric (Cost and Salzberg, 1993) to assign a different distance between each pair of values of the same feature.",
        "This algorithm can also be combined with the different feature weighting methods."

        "This wordlist was further used in the study to make literacy tests, including tests how many senses of ambiguous words were known by children of different ages.",

        "Each word in the dataset has a non-hierarchical, symbolic sense tag, realised as a mnemonic description of the specific meaning the word has in the sentence, often using a related term.",
        "As there was no gold standard sense set of Dutch available, Sch-rooten and Vermeer have made their own set of senses, based on a children’s dictionary (Van Dale, 1996).",
        "Sense tags consist of the word’s lemma and a sense description of one or two words (bergstapel ) or a reference of the grammatical category (fietsN, fietsen_ V).",

        "The keywords were selected through a selection method suggested by (Ng and Lee, 1996) within three sentences around the ambiguous word; only content words were used as candidates.",
        "So, our first step was to try two different selection methods often used for this task: information gain and loglikeli-hood.",
