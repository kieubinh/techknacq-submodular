        "Highly ambiguous words pose continuing problems for Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications.",

        "While homonyms like bank are fairly tractable, pol-ysemous words like run, with related but subtly distinct meanings, present the greatest hurdle for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD).",
        "SENSEVAL-1 and SENSEVAL-2 have attempted to provide a framework for evaluating automatic systems by creating corpora tagged with fixed sense inventories, which also enables the training of supervised WSD systems.",
        "In this paper we describe a maximum entropy WSD system that combines information from many different sources, using as much linguistic knowledge as can be gathered automatically by current NLP tools.",
        "Maximum entropy models have been applied to a wide range of classification tasks in NLP (Ratnaparkhi, 1998).",
        "Our maximum entropy system performed competitively with the best performing systems on the English verb lexical sample task in SENSEVAL-1 and SENSEVAL-2.",
        "We compared the system performance with human annotator performance in light of both fine-grained and coarse-grained sense distinctions made by WordNet in SENSEVAL-2, and found that many of the system’s errors on fine-grained senses stemmed from the same sources that caused disagreements between human annotators.",
        "These differences were partially resolved by backing off to more coarse-grained sense-groups, which are sometimes necessary when even human annotators cannot make the fine-grained sense distinctions specified in the dictionary."

        "The system with the highest overall performance in SENSEVAL-1 used Yarowsky’s hierarchical decision lists (Yarowsky, 2000); while there is a large set of potential features, only a small number is actually used to determine the sense of any given instance of a word.",
        "Chodorow, Leacock and Miller (Chodorow et al., 2000) also achieved high accuracy using naive bayesian models for WSD, combining sets of linguistically impoverished features that were classified as either topical or local.",
        "Topical features consisted of a bag of open-class words in a wide window covering the entire context provided; local features were words and parts of speech within a small window or at particular offsets from the target word.",
        "The system was configured to use only local, only topical, or both local and topical features for each word, depending on which configuration produced the best result on a held-out portion of the training data.",
        "Previous experiments (Ng and Lee, 1996) have explored the relative contribution of different knowledge sources to WSD and have concluded that collocational information is more important than syntactic information.",
        "Additionally, Pedersen (Pedersen, 2001; Pedersen, 2000) has pursued the approach of using simple word bigrams and other linguistically impoverished feature sets for sense tagging, to establish upper bounds on the accuracy of feature sets that do not impose substantial preprocessing requirements.",
        "In contrast, we wish to demonstrate that such preprocessing significantly improves accuracy for sense-tagging English verbs, because we believe that they allow us to extract a set of features that more closely parallels the information humans use for sense disambiguation."

        "We developed an automatic WSD system that uses a maximum entropy framework to combine linguistic contextual features from corpus instances of each verb to be tagged.",
        "Under the maximum entropy framework (Berger et al., 1996), evidence from different features can be combined with no assumptions of feature independence.",
        "The automatic tagger estimates the conditional probability that a word has sense x given that it occurs in context y, where y is a conjunction of features.",
        "The estimated probability is derived from feature weights which are determined automatically from training data so as to produce a probability distribution that has maximum entropy, under the constraint that it is consistent with observed evidence.",
        "In order to extract the linguistic features necessary for the model, all sentences were first automatically part-of-speech-tagged using a maximum entropy tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1998) and parsed using the Collins parser (Collins, 1997).",
        "In addition, an automatic named entity tagger (Bikel et al., 1997) was run on the sentences to map proper nouns to a small set of semantic classes.",
        "Following work by Chodorow, Leacock and Miller, we divided the possible model features into topical and local contextual features.",
        "Topical features looked for the presence of keywords occurring anywhere in the sentence and any surrounding sentences provided as context (usually one or two sentences).",
        "The set of 200-300 keywords is specific to each lemma to be disambiguated, and is determined automatically from training data so as to minimize the entropy of the probability of the senses conditioned on the keyword.",
        "The local features for a verb w in a particular sentence tend to look only within the smallest clause containing w. They include collocational features requiring no linguistic preprocessing beyond part-of-speech tagging (1), syntactic features that capture relations between the verb and its complements (2- 4), and semantic features that incorporate information about noun classes for objects (5-6):",
        "1. the word w, the part of speech of w, and words at positions -2, -1, +1, +2, relative to w 2. whether or not the sentence is passive 3. whether there is a subject, direct object, indirect object, or clausal complement (a complement whose node label is S in the parse tree) 4. the words (if any) in the positions of subject, direct object, indirect object, particle, prepositional complement (and its object) 5. a Named Entity tag (PERSON, ORGANIZATION, LOCATION) for proper nouns appearing in (4) 6.",
        "WordNet synsets and hypernyms for the nouns appearing in (4)1",
        "This set of local features relies on access to syntactic structure as well as semantic class information, and represents our move towards using richer syntactic and semantic knowledge sources to model human performance.",
        "1Nouns were not disambiguated in any way, and all possible synsets and hypernyms for the noun were included.",
        "No separate disambiguation of noun complements was done because, given enough data, the maximum entropy model should assign high weights to the correct semantic classes of the correct noun sense if they represent defining selectional restrictions."

        "The lexical inventory used was the Hector lexicon, developed jointly by DEC and Oxford University Press (Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig, 2000).",
        "By allowing for discussion and revision of confusing lexical entries during tagging, before the final test data was tagged, inter-annotator agreement of over 90% was eventually achieved.",
        "However, the Hector lexicon was very small and under proprietary constraints, making it an unsuitable candidate for applications requiring a large-scale, publicly-available dictionary.",
        "SENSEVAL-2 The subsequent SENSEVAL-2 exercise used a pre-release version of WordNet1 .7 which is much larger than Hector and is more widely used in NLP applications.",
        "The average training set size for verbs was only about half of that provided in SENSEVAL-1, while the average polysemy of each verb was higher3.",
        "Smaller training sets and the use of a large-scale, publicly available dictionary arguably make SENSEVAL-2 a more indicative evaluation of WSD systems in the current NLP environment than SENSEVAL-1.",
        "The role of sense groups was also explored as a way to address the popular criticism that WordNet senses are too vague and fine-grained.",
        "During the data preparation for SENSEVAL-2, previous WordNet groupings of the verbs were carefully re-examined, and specific semantic criteria were manually associated with each group.",
        "This occasionally resulted in minor revisions of the original groupings (Fellbaum et al., 2001).",

        "Our system performs competitively with the best performing systems in SENSEVAL-1 and SENSEVAL-2.",
        "Measuring accuracy as the recall score (which is equal to precision in our case because the system assigns a tag to every instance), we compare the system’s coarse-grained scores using the revised groupings versus random groupings, and demonstrate the coherence and utility of the groupings in reconciling apparent tagging disagreements."

        "This may be a language-dependent feature, as other experiments indicate that additional linguistic preprocessing does not necessarily improve tagging accuracy for languages like Chinese (Dang et al., 2002).",
        "In examining the instances that proved troublesome to both the human taggers and the automatic system, we found errors that were tied to subtle sense distinctions which were reconciled by backing off to the more coarse-grained sense groups.",
        "Achieving higher inter-annotator agreement is necessary in order to provide consistent training data for supervised WSD systems.",
        "Lexicographers have long recognized that many natural occurrences of polysemous words are embedded in underspecified contexts and could correspond to more than one specific sense.",
        "Annotators need the option of selecting, as an alternative to an explicit sense, either a group of specific senses or a single, broader sense, where specific meaning nuances are subsumed.",
        "Sense grouping, already present in a limited way in Word-Net’s verb component, can be guided and enhanced by the analysis of inter-annotator disagreements and the development of explicit sense distinction criteria that such an analysis provides."
