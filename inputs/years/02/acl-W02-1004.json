        "Classifier combination has been extensively studied in the last decade, and has been shown to be successful in improving the performance of diverse NLP applications, including POS tagging (Brill and Wu, 1998; van Halteren et al., 2001), base noun phrase chunking (Sang et al., 2000), parsing (Henderson and Brill, 1999) and word sense disambiguation (Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig, 2000; Stevenson and Wilks, 2001).",
        "There are several reasons why classifier combination is useful.",
        "First, by consulting the output of multiple classifiers, the system will improve its robustness.",
        "Second, it is possible that the problem can be decomposed into orthogonal feature spaces (e.g. linguistic constraints and word occurrence statistics) and it is often better to train different classifiers in each of the feature spaces and then combine their output, instead of designing a complex system that handles the multimodal information.",
        "Third, it has been shown by Perrone and Cooper (1993) that it is possible to reduce the classification error by a factor of (N is the number of classifiers) by combination, if the classifiers’ errors are uncorrelated and unbiased.",
        "The target task studied here is word sense disambiguation in the SENSEVAL evaluation framework (Kilgarriff and Palmer, 2000; Edmonds and Cotton, 2001) with comparative tests in English, Spanish, Swedish and Basque lexical-sample sense tagging over a combined sample of 37730 instances of 234 polysemous words.",
        "This paper offers a detailed comparative evaluation and description of the problem of classifier combination over a structurally and procedurally diverse set of six both well established and original classifiers: extended Naïve Bayes, BayesRatio, Cosine, non-hierarchical Decision Lists, Transformation Based Learning (TBL), and the MMVC classifiers, briefly described in Section 4.",
        "These systems have different space-searching strategies, ranging from discriminant functions (BayesRatio) to data likelihood (Bayes, Cosine) to decision rules (TBL, Decision Lists), and therefore are amenable to combination."

        "The experiments show substantial variation in single classifier performance across different languages and data sizes.",
        "They also show that this variation can be successfully exploited by 10 different classifier combination methods (and their meta-voting consensus), each of which outperforms both the single best classifier system and standard classifier combination models on each of the 4 focus languages.",
        "Furthermore, when the stacking consensus systems were frozen and applied once to the otherwise untouched test sets, they substantially outperformed all previously known SENSEVAL1 and SENSEVAL2 results on 4 languages, obtaining the best published results on these data sets."
