        "The focus tasks of this paper are two related problems in lexical ambiguity resolution: Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and Context-Sensitive Spelling Correction (CSSC).",
        "Word Sense Disambiguation has a long history as a computational task (Kelly and Stone, 1975), and the field has recently supported large-scale international system evaluation exercises in multiple languages (SENSEVAL-1, Kilgarriff and Palmer (2000), and SENSEVAL-2, Edmonds and Cotton (2001)).",
        "General purpose Spelling Correction is also a long-standing task (e.g. McIlroy, 1982), traditionally focusing on resolving typographical errors such as transposition and deletion to find the closest “valid” word (in a dictionary or a morphological variant), typically ignoring context.",
        "Yet Ku-kich (1992) observed that about 25-50% of the spelling errors found in modern documents are either context-inappropriate misuses or substitutions of valid words (such as principal and principle) which are not detected by traditional spelling correctors.",
        "Previous work has addressed the problem of CSSC from a machine learning perspective, including Bayesian and Decision List models (Golding, 1995), Winnow (Golding and Roth, 1996) and Transformation-Based Learning (Mangu and Brill, 1997).",
        "Generally, both tasks involve the selection between a relatively small set of alternatives per keyword (e.g. sense id’s such as church/BUILDING and church/INSTITUTION or commonly confused spellings such as quiet and quite), and are dependent on local and long-distance collocational and syntactic patterns to resolve between the set of alternatives.",
        "Thus both tasks can share a common feature space, data representation and algorithm infrastructure.",
        "We present a framework of doing so, while investigating the use of mixture models in conjunction with a new error-correction technique as competitive alternatives to Bayesian models.",
        "While several authors have observed the fundamental similarities between CSSC and WSD (e.g. Berleant, 1995 and Roth, 1998), to our knowledge no previous comparative empirical study has tackled these two problems in a single unified framework."

        "The problem of lexical disambiguation can be modeled as a classification task, in which each instance of the word to be disambiguated (target word, henceforth), identified by its context, has to be labeled with one of the established sense labels S = {sl, s2i ..., 8n}.1 The approaches we investigate are statistical methods h : C x S – � [0, 1], outputting conditional probability distributions over the sense set S given a context c E C. The classification of a context c is generally made by choosing argmaxsEsh(c, s), but we also present an alterna",

        "Examples of the feature types we employ are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2.",

        "Different relations are considered depending on the target word’s POS.",
        "For nouns, these relations are: verb-object, subject-verb, modifier-noun, and noun-modified_noun; for verbs: verb-object, verb-particle/preposition, verb-prepositional_object; for adjectives: modifying_adjective-noun.",
        "Also, words with the same POS as the target word that are linked to the target word by coordinating conjunctions are extracted as sibling features.",
        "The extraction process is performed using simple heuristic patterns and regular expressions over the POS environment.",
        "As Figure 2 shows, we considered for the CSSC task the POS bigrams of the immediate left and right word pairs as additional features in order to solve POS ambiguity and capture more of the syntactic environment in which the target word occurs (the elements of a confusion set often have disjoint or very different syntactic functions).",

        "Another important observation is that very many of the frequencies involved in the probability estimation are zero because of the very sparse feature space.",
        "Naïve Bayes depends heavily on probabilities not being zero and therefore it has to rely on smoothing.",
        "On the other hand, the mixture model is more robust to unseen events, without the need for explicit smoothing.",

        "The probabilities P(slw) in (4) and P(wls) in (2) can be computed as maximum likelihood estimates (MLE), by counting the co-occurrences of s and w versus the occurrences of w, respectively s in the training data.",

        "If S(i, j1) are set to 1 regardless of the distance Ii – jz I then MLE estimates are obtained.",
        "There are various other ways of choosing the weighting measure S. One natural way is to transform the distance Ii – jz I into a closeness measure by considering S(i, jl) = 1 +Iz1 – il I (Manning and Schütze, 1999, ch.",
        "14.1).",
        "This measure proves to be effective for the spelling correction task, where the words in the immediate vicinity are far more important than the rest of the context words2, but imposes counterproductive differences between the much wider context positions (such as +30 vs. +31) used in WSD, especially when considering large context windows.",

        "To address this estimation problem, a second classification step is employed, based on the observation that the deviation of a component of the posterior distribution from its expected value (as computed over the training set) can be as relevant as the maximum of the distribution max,sESP(s1c).",
        "Instead of classifying each test context independently after estimating its sense probability distribution, we classify it by comparing it with the whole space of training contexts, for which the posterior distributions are computed using a jackknife procedure.",

        "To apply this assumption to the disambiguation task, a set TS containing the values P(slc) for all contexts c in the training set that are not labeled s is built for every sense s (see Figure 4(a)).",
        "In this way, the problem of poor representation of some senses is overcome and the selections TS are large for all senses.",
        "An instance in the test set is considered more likely _to correspond to a sense s if the estimated value P(sIc) is an outlier with respect to T,s (see Figure 4(b)) and thus it is viewed as a candidate for having its classification changed to s. Assuming that the selections T,s are representative and there exist first and second order moments for the underlying distributions (conditions which we call “good statistical properties”), an improvement in the accuracy 1 – co of the classifier can be expected when choosing a sense with a variational coefficient vc > �1 instead of the classifier distribution’s mode argmaxsP(slc) (if such a sense exists).",
