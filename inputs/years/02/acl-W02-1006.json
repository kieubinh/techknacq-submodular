        "For example, effective WSD is crucial for high quality machine translation.",
        "One could envisage building a WSD system using handcrafted rules or knowledge obtained from linguists.",
        "Such an approach would be highly labor-intensive, with questionable scalability.",
        "Another approach involves the use of dictionary or thesaurus to perform WSD.",
        "In this paper, we focus on a corpus-based, supervised learning approach.",
        "In this approach, to disambiguate a word w, we first collect training texts in which instances of w occur.",
        "Each occurrence of w is manually tagged with the correct sense.",
        "We then train a WSD classifier based on these sample texts, such that the trained classifier is able to assign the sense of w in a new context.",
        "Two WSD evaluation exercises, SENSEVAL-1 (Kilgarriff and Palmer, 2000) and SENSEVAL-2 (Edmonds and Cotton, 2001), were conducted in 1998 and 2001, respectively.",
