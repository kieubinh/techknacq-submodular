        "Noun phrase coreference resolution refers to the problem of determining which noun phrases (NPs) refer to each real-world entity mentioned in a document.",
        "Machine learning approaches to this problem have been reasonably successful, operating primarily by recasting the problem as a classification task (e.g. Aone and Bennett (1995), McCarthy and Lehnert (1995), Soon et al.",
        "(2001)).",
        "Specifically, an inductive learning algorithm is used to train a classifier that decides whether or not two NPs in a document are coreferent.",
        "Training data are typically created by relying on coreference chains from the training documents: training instances are generated by pairing each NP with each of its preceding NPs; instances are labeled as positive if the two NPs are in the same coreference chain, and labeled as negative otherwise.1 A separate clustering mechanism then coordinates the possibly contradictory pairwise coreference classification decisions and constructs a partition on the set of NPs with one cluster for each set of corefer-ent NPs.",
        "Although, in principle, any clustering algorithm can be used, most previous work uses a single-link clustering algorithm to impose coreference partitions.2 An implicit assumption in the choice of the single-link clustering algorithm is that coreference resolution is viewed as anaphora resolution, i.e. the goal during clustering is to find an antecedent for each anaphoric NP in a document.3 Three intrinsic properties of coreference4, however, make the formulation of the problem as a classification-based single-link clustering task potentially undesirable: Coreference is a rare relation.",
        "That is, most NP pairs in a document are not coreferent.",
        "Con",
        "sequently, generating training instances by pairing each NP with each of its preceding NPs creates highly skewed class distributions, in which the number of positive instances is overwhelmed by the number of negative instances.",
        "For example, the standard MUC-6 and MUC-7 (1995; 1998) coreference data sets contain only 2% positive instances.",
        "Unfortunately, learning in the presence of such skewed class distributions remains an open area of research in the machine learning community (e.g. Pazzani et al.",
        "(1994), Fawcett (1996), Cardie and Howe (1997), Kubat and Matwin (1997)).",
        "Coreference is a discourse-level problem with different solutions for different types of NPs.",
        "The interpretation of a pronoun, for example, may be dependent only on its closest antecedent and not on the rest of the members of the same coreference chain.",
        "Proper name resolution, on the other hand, may be better served by ignoring locality constraints altogether and relying on string-matching or more sophisticated aliasing techniques.",
        "Consequently, generating positive instances from all pairs of NPs from the same coreference chain can potentially make the learning task harder: all but a few coreference links derived from any chain might be hard to identify based on the available contextual cues.",
        "Coreference is an equivalence relation.",
        "Recasting the problem as a classification task precludes enforcement of the transitivity constraint.",
        "After training, for example, the classifier might determine that A is coreferent with B, and B with C, but that A and C are not coreferent.",
        "Hence, the clustering mechanism is needed to coordinate these possibly contradictory pairwise classifications.",
        "In addition, because the coreference classifiers are trained independent of the clustering algorithm to be used, improvements in classification accuracy do not guarantee corresponding improvements in clustering-level accuracy, i.e. overall performance on the coreference resolution task might not improve.",
        "This paper examines each of the above issues.",
        "First, to address the problem of skewed class distributions, we apply a technique for negative instance selection similar to that proposed in Soon et al.",
        "(2001).",
        "In contrast to results reported there, however, we show empirically that system performance increases noticeably in response to negative example selection, with increases in F-measure of 3-5%.",
        "Second, in an attempt to avoid the inclusion of “hard” training instances, we present a corpus-based method for implicit selection of positive instances.",
        "The approach is a fully automated variant of the example selection algorithm introduced in Harabagiu et al.",
        "(2001).",
        "With positive example selection, system performance (F-measure) again increases, by 12-14%.",
        "Finally, to more tightly tie the classification and clustering-level coreference decisions, we propose an error-driven rule pruning algorithm that optimizes the coreference classifier ruleset with respect to the clustering-level coreference scoring function.",
        "Overall, the use of pruning boosts system performance from an F-measure of 69.3 to 69.5, and from 57.2 to 63.4 for the MUC-6 and MUC-7 data sets, respectively, enabling the system to achieve performance that surpasses that of the best MUC coreference systems by 4.6% and 1.6%.",
        "In particular, the system outperforms the best-performing learning-based coreference system (Soon et al., 2001) by 6.9% and 3.0%.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In sections 2 and 3, we present the machine learning framework underlying the baseline coreference system and examine the effect of negative sample selection.",
        "Section 4 presents our corpus-based algorithm for selection of positive instances.",
        "Section 5 describes and evaluates the error-driven pruning algorithm.",
        "We conclude with future work in section"

        "Creating an instance.",
        "An instance in our machine learning framework is a description of two NPs in a document.",
        "More formally, let NPM be the kth NP in document d. An instance formed from NPid and NPjd is denoted by i(NPzd,NP,d).",
        "A valid instance is an instance i(NPzd,NP,d) such that NPzd precedes NPjd.5 Following previous work (Aone and Bennett (1995),",
        "Soon et al.",
        "(2001)), we assume throughout the paper that only valid instances will be generated and used for training and testing.",
        "Each instance consists of 25 features, which are described in Table 1.6 The classification associated with a training instance is one of COREFERENT or NOT COREFERENT depending on whether the NPs co-refer in the associated training text.7 Building an NP coreference classifier.",
        "We use RIPPER (Cohen, 1995), an information gain-based propositional rule learning system, to train a classifier that, given a test instance i(NPzd,NP,d), decides whether or not NPid and NPjd are coreferent.",
        "Specifically, RIPPER sequentially covers the positive training instances and induces a ruleset that determines when two NPs are coreferent.",
        "When none of the rules in the ruleset is applicable to a given NP pair, a default rule that classifies the pair as not coreferent is automatically invoked.",
        "The output of the classifier is either COREFERENT or NOT COREFERENT along with a number between 0 and 1 that indicates the confidence of the classification.",
        "Applying the classifier to create coreference chains.",
        "After training, the resulting ruleset is used by a best-first clustering algorithm to impose a partitioning on all NPs in the test texts, creating one cluster for each set of coreferent NPs.",
        "Texts are processed from left to right.",
        "Each NP encountered, NPR d, is compared in turn to each preceding NP, NPid, from right to left.",
        "For each pair, a test instance is created as during training and is presented to the coreference classifier.",
        "The NP with the highest confidence value among the preceding NPs that are classified as being coreferent with NPjd is selected as the antecedent of NPjd; otherwise, no antecedent is selected for NPjd."

        "As noted above, skewed class distributions arise when generating all valid instances from the training texts.",
        "A number of methods for handling skewed distributions have been proposed in the machine learning literature, most of which modify the learn",
        "ing algorithm to incorporate a loss function with a much larger penalty for minority class errors than for instances from the majority classes (e.g. Gordon and Perlis (1989), Pazzani et al.",
        "(1994)).",
        "We investigate here a different approach to handling skewed class distributions – negative sample selection, i.e. the selection of a smaller subset of negative instances from the set of available negative instances.",
        "In the case of NP coreference, we hypothesize that reducing the number of negative instances will improve recall but potentially reduce precision: intuitively, the existence of fewer negative instances should allow RIPPER to more liberally induce positive rules.",
        "We propose a method for negative sample selection that, for each anaphoric NP, NPjd, retains only those negative instances for non-coreferent NPs that lie between NPjd and its farthest preceding antecedent, f (NPjd).",
        "The algorithm for negative sample selection, NEG-SELECT, is shown in Figure 1.",
        "NEG-SELECT takes as input the set of all possible negative instances in the training texts, i.e. the set of valid instances i(NPzd,NP,d) such that NPid and NPjd are not in the same coreference chain.",
        "The intuition behind this approach is very simple.",
        "Let S(NPjd) be the set of preceding antecedents of NPjd, and L(NPW,NPjd) be the set consisting of NPs NPid, NP(z+l)d,..., NPjd.",
        "Recall that the goal during clustering is to compute, for each NP NPjd, the set S(NPjd) from which the element with the highest confidence is selected as the antecedent of NPjd.",
        "Since (1) S(NPjd) is a subset of L(f (NPjd),NPjd)8 and 8 We define L(f (NP, d),NPid) to be the empty set if f (NP, d) does not exist (i.e. NPid is not anaphoric).",
        "(2) NPjd is compared to each preceding NP from right to left by the clustering algorithm, it follows that the set of negative instances whose classifications the classifier needs to determine in order to compute S(NPjd) is a superset of the set of instances I(NPjd) formed by pairing NPjd with each of its non-coreferent preceding NPs in L(f (NPjd),NPjd).",
        "Consequently, UJ �d I(NPjd) is the minimal set of (negative) instances whose classifications will be required during clustering.",
        "In principle, to perform the classifications accurately, the classifier needs to be trained on the corresponding set of negative instances from the training set, which is U �d I(NPj d ), where NPR d is now the jth NP in training document d. NEG-SELECT is designed essentially to compute this set.",
        "Next, we examine the effects of this minimalist approach to negative sample selection.",
        "Evaluation.",
        "We evaluate the coreference system with negative sample selection on the MUC-6 and MUC-7 coreference data sets in each case, training the coreference classifier on the 30 “dry run” texts, and applying the coreference resolution algorithm on the 20–30 “formal evaluation” texts.",
        "Results are shown in rows 1 and 2 of Table 2 where performance is reported in terms of recall, precision, and F-measure using the model-theoretic MUC scoring program (Vilain et al., 1995).",
        "The Baseline system employs no sample selection, i.e. all available training examples are used.",
        "Row 2 shows the performance of the Baseline after incorporating NEG-SELECT.",
        "With negative sample selection, the percentage of positive instances rises from 2% to 8% for the MUC-6 data set and from 2% to 7% for the MUC-7 data set.",
        "For both data sets, we see statistically significant increases in recall and statistically significant, but much larger drops in precision.",
        "The resulting F-measure scores, however, increase non-trivially from 52.4 to 55.2 (for MUC-6), and from 41.3 to 46.0 (for MUC-7).10"

        "Since not all of the coreference relationships derived from coreference chains are equally easy to identify, training a classifier using all possible coreference relationships can potentially lead to the induction of inaccurate rules.",

        "Similar observations are made by Harabagiu et al.",
        "(2001), who point out that intelligent selection of positive instances can potentially minimize the amount of knowledge required to perform coreference resolution accurately.",
        "They assume that the easiest types of coreference relationships to resolve are those that occur with high frequencies in the data.",
        "Consequently, they mine by hand three sets of coreference rules for covering positive instances from the training data by finding the coreference knowledge satisfied by the largest number of anaphor-antecedent pairs.",
        "While the Harabagiu et al.",
        "algorithm attempts to mine easy coreference rules from the data by hand, neither the rule creation process nor stopping conditions are precisely defined.",

        "In this section, we describe an automatic positive sample selection algorithm that coarsely mimics the Harabagiu et al.",
        "algorithm by finding a confident antecedent for each anaphor.",
        "Overall, our goal is to avoid the inclusion of hard training instances by automating the process of deriving easy coreference rules from the data.",
        "The Algorithm.",
        "The positive sample selection algorithm, POS-SELECT, is shown in Figure 2.",
        "It assumes the existence of a rule learner, L, that produces an ordered set ofpositive rules.",
        "POS-SELECT",
        "first uses L to induce a ruleset on the training instances and picks the first rule from the ruleset.",
        "For any training instance i(NPzd,NP,d) correctly covered by this rule, an antecedent NPid has been identified for the anaphor NPid.",
        "As a result, all (positive and negative) training instances formed with NPjd as the anaphor are no longer needed and are subsequently removed from the training data.11 The process is repeated until L cannot induce a rule to cover the remaining positive instances.",
        "The output of POS-SELECT is a set of positive rules selected during each iteration of the algorithm.",
        "Hence, positive sample selection in POS-SELECT is implicit in the sense that it is embedded within the rule induction process.",
        "with POS-SELECT only and then with both POS-SELECT and NEG-SELECT.",
        "With POS-SELECT only, the system achieves an F-measure of 64.1 (for MUC-6) and 53.8 (for MUC-7).",
        "When POS-SELECT and NEG-SELECT are used in combination, however, the system achieves an F-measure of 69.3 (for MUC-6) and 57.2 (for MUC-7).",
        "Discussion.",
        "The experimental results are largely consistent with our hypothesis.",
        "System performance improves dramatically with positive sample selection using POS-SELECT both in the absence and presence of negative sample selection.",
        "Without negative sample selection, F-measure increases from 52.4 to 64.1 (for MUC-6), and from 41.3 to 53.8 (for MUC-7).",
        "Similarly, with negative sample selection, F-measure increases from 55.2 to 69.3 (for MUC-6), and from 46.0 to 57.2 (for MUC-7).",
        "In addition, our results indicate that applying both negative and positive sample selection leads to better performance than applying positive sample selection alone: F-measure increases from 64.1 to 69.3, and from 53.8 to 57.2 for the MUC-6 and MUC-7 data sets, respectively.",
        "Nevertheless, reducing the number of negative instances (via negative sample selection) improves recall but damages precision: we see statistically significant gains in recall and statistically significant drops in precision for both data sets.",
        "In particular, precision drops precipitously from 78.0 to 55.1 for the MUC-7 data set.",
        "We hypothesize that POS-SELECT does not guarantee that hard positive instances will be avoided and that the inclusion of these hard instances is responsible for the poorer precision of the system.",
        "Anaphors that do not have easy antecedents can never be removed automatically via the induction of new rules using POS-SELECT.",
        "In fact, RIPPER will possibly induce rules to handle these hard instances as long as such kind of anaphors occur sufficiently frequently in the data set relative to the number of negative instances.",
        "12 Although it might be beneficial to acquire these rules at the classification level (according to the learning algorithm), they can be detrimental to system performance at the clustering level, especially if the rules cover a large number of examples with a lot of exceptions.",
        "Consequently, it is necessary to know which rules are worthy of keeping at the clustering level and not the classification level.",

        "As a hill-climbing procedure, the algorithm terminates when removal of any of the rules in the ruleset fails to improve performance.",
        "In contrast to most existing algorithms for coreference resolution, RULE-SELECT establishes a tighter connection between the classification and clustering-level decisions for coreference resolution and ensures that system performance is optimized with respect to the coreference scoring function.",

        "In general, our results support the hypothesis that rule pruning can be used to improve system performance; moreover, the technique is especially effective at enhancing the precision of the system.",
        "However, performance gains may be negligible when pruning is used in systems with high precision, as can be seen from the results for the MUC-6 data set.",
