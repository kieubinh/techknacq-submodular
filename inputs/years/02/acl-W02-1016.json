        "There are two conditions: the first with 38 relatively coarse syntactic verb subcategorisation frames, the second a more delicate classification subdividing the verb frames of the first condition using prepositional phrase information (case plus preposition), resulting in 171 possible frame types.",

        "Our previous work on the valency data applied k-Means (a standard technique) to the task of inducing semantic classes for German verbs (Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002).",
        "We compared the results of k-Means clustering with a gold standard set prepared according to the principles of verb classification advocated by (Levin, 1993), and reported on the sensitivity of the classes to linguistically motivated ”lesioning” of the input verb frame.",
        "The verb classes we used are listed in Table 2.",
        "The verb classes are closely related to Levin’s English classes.",
        "They also agree with the German verb classification in (Schumacher, 1986) as far as the relevant verbs appear in his less extensive semantic ‘fields’.",
        "The rough glosses and the references to Levin’s classes in the table are primarily to aid the intuition of non-native speakers of German.",
        "Clustering can be thought of as a process that finds a discrete approximation to a distance measure.",
        "For any data set of n items over which a distance measure is defined, the Gram matrix is the symmetric n-by-n matrix whose elements Mid are the distances between items i and j.",
        "The diagonal elements Mii of this matrix will all be 0.",
        "Every clustering corresponds to a block-diagonal Gram matrix.",
        "Clustering n items into k classes corresponds to the choice of an ordering for the labels on the axes of the Gram matrix and the choice of k − 1 change points marking the boundaries between the blocks.",
        "Thus, the search space of clusters is very large.",
        "The available techniques for searching this large space do not (and probably cannot) offer guarantees of global optimality.",
        "Standard nostrums include transformations of the underlying data, and the deployment of different strategies for initializing the cluster centers.",
        "These may produce intuitively attractive clusters, but when we apply these ideas to our verb frame data many questions remain, including the following: • When the solutions found by clustering differ from our intuitions, is this because of failures in the features used, the clustering techniques, or the intuitions?",
        "• How close are the local optima found by the clustering techniques to the best solutions in the space defined by the data?",
        "• Is it even appropriate to use frequency information for this problem?",
        "Or would it suffice to characterize verb classes by the pattern of frames that their members can inhabit, without regard to frequency?",
        "• Does the data support some clusters more strongly than others?",
        "Are all the distinctions made in classifications such as Levin’s of equal validity?",
        "In response to these questions, the present paper describes an application to the verb data of a particular spectral clustering technique (Ng et al., 2002).",
