        "Automatic speech recognition, which decodes human voice to generate transcriptions, has of late become a practical technology.",
        "It is feasible that speech recognition is used in real-world human language applications, such as information retrieval.",
        "Initiated partially by TREC-6, various methods have been proposed for “spoken document retrieval (SDR),” in which written queries are used to search speech archives for relevant information (Garo-folo et al., 1997).",
        "State-of-the-art SDR methods, where speech recognition error rate is 20-30%, are The first and second authors are also members of CREST, Japan Science and Technology Corporation.",
        "comparable with text retrieval methods in performance (Jourlin et al., 2000), and thus are already practical.",
        "Possible rationales include that recognition errors are overshadowed by a large number of words correctly transcribed in target documents.",
        "However, “speech-driven retrieval,” where spoken queries are used to retrieve (textual) information, has not fully been explored, although it is related to numerous keyboard-less applications, such as telephone-based retrieval, car navigation systems, and user-friendly interfaces.",
        "Unlike spoken document retrieval, speech-driven retrieval is still a challenging task, because recognition errors in short queries considerably decrease retrieval accuracy.",
        "A number of references addressing this issue can be found in past research literature.",
        "Barnett et al.",
        "(1997) and Crestani (2000) independently performed comparative experiments related to speech-driven retrieval, where the DRAGON speech recognition system was used as an input interface for the INQUERY text retrieval system.",
        "They used as test queries 35 topics in the TREC collection, dictated by a single male speaker.",
        "However, these cases focused on improving text retrieval methods and did not address problems in improving speech recognition.",
        "As a result, errors in recognizing spoken queries (error rate was approximately 30%) considerably decreased the retrieval accuracy.",
        "Although we showed that the use of target document collections in producing language models for speech recognition significantly improved the performance of speech-driven retrieval (Fujii et al., 2002; Itou et al., 2001), a number of issues still remain open questions.",

      "heading": "2 Problem Statement",
      "text": [
        "One major problem in speech-driven retrieval is related to out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.",
        "On the one hand, recent IR systems do not limit the vocabulary size (i.e., the number of index terms), and can be seen as open-vocabulary systems, which allow users to input any keywords contained in a target collection.",
        "It is often the case that a couple of million terms are indexed for a single IR system.",
        "On the other hand, state-of-the-art speech recognition systems still need to limit the vocabulary size (i.e., the number of words in a dictionary), due to problems in estimating statistical language models (Young, 1996) and constraints associated with hardware, such as memories.",
        "In addition, computation time is crucial for a real-time usage, including speech-driven retrieval.",
        "In view of these problems, for many languages the vocabulary size is limited to a couple of ten thousands (Itou et al., 1999; Paul and Baker, 1992; Steeneken and van Leeuwen, 1995), which is incomparably smaller than the size of indexes for practical IR systems.",
        "In addition, high-frequency words, such as functional words and common nouns, are usually included in dictionaries and recognized with a high accuracy.",
        "However, those words are not necessarily useful for retrieval.",
        "On the contrary, low-frequency words appearing in specific documents are often effective query terms.",
        "To sum up, the OOV problem is inherent in speech-driven retrieval, and we need to fill the gap between speech recognition and text retrieval in terms of the vocabulary size.",
        "In this paper, we propose a method to resolve this problem aiming at open-vocabulary speech-driven retrieval."

        "Figure 1 depicts the overall design of our speech-driven text retrieval system, which consists of speech recognition, text retrieval and query completion modules.",
        "Although our system is currently implemented for Japanese, our methodology is language-independent.",
        "We explain the retrieval process based on this figure.",
        "Given a query spoken by a user, the speech recognition module uses a dictionary and acoustic/language models to generate a transcription of the user speech.",
        "During this process, OOV words, which are not listed in the dictionary, are also detected.",
        "For this purpose, our language model includes both words and syllables so that OOV words are transcribed as sequences of syllables.",
        "For example, in the case where “kankitsu (citrus)” is not listed in the dictionary, this word should be transcribed as /ka N ki tsu/.",
        "However, it is possible that this word is mistakenly transcribed, such as /ka N ke tsu/ and /ka N ke tsu ke ko/.",
        "To improve the quality of our system, these syllable sequences have to be transcribed as words, which is one of the central issues in this paper.",
        "In the case of speech-driven retrieval, where users usually have specific information needs, it is feasible that users utter contents related to a target collection.",
        "In other words, there is a great possibility that detected OOV words can be identified as index terms that are phonetically identical or similar.",
        "However, since a) a single sound can potentially correspond to more than one word (i.e., homonyms) and b) searching the entire collection for phonetically identical/similar terms is prohibitive, we need an efficient disambiguation method.",
        "Specifically, in the case of Japanese, the homonym problem is multiply crucial because words consist of different character types, i.e., “kanji,” “katakana,” “hiragana,” alphabets and other characters like numerals1 .",
        "To resolve this problem, we use a two-stage retrieval method.",
        "In the first stage, we delete OOV words from the transcription, and perform text retrieval using remaining words, to obtain a specific number of top-ranked documents according to the degree of relevance.",
        "Even if speech recognition is not perfect, these documents are potentially associated with the user speech more than the entire col",
        "lection.",
        "Thus, we search only these documents for index terms corresponding to detected OOV words.",
        "Then, in the second stage, we replace detected OOV words with identified index terms so as to complete the transcription, and re-perform text retrieval to obtain final outputs.",
        "However, we do not re-perform speech recognition in the second stage.",
        "In the above example, let us assume that the user also utters words related to “kankitsu (citrus),” such as “orenji (orange)” and “remon (lemon),” and that these words are correctly recognized as words.",
        "In this case, it is possible that retrieved documents contain the word “kankitsu (citrus).” Thus, we replace the syllable sequence /ka N ke tsu/ in the query with “kankitsu,” which is additionally used as a query term in the second stage.",
        "It may be argued that our method resembles the notion of pseudo-relevance feedback (or local feedback) for IR, where documents obtained in the first stage are used to expand query terms, and final outputs are refined in the second stage (Kwok and Chan, 1998).",
        "However, while relevance feedback is used to improve only the retrieval accuracy, our method improves the speech recognition and retrieval accuracy."
