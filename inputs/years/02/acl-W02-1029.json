        "Ensemble learning is a machine learning technique that combines the output of several different classifiers with the goal of improving classification performance.",
        "The classifiers within the ensemble may differ in several ways, such as the learning algorithm or knowledge representation used, or data they were trained on.",
        "Ensemble learning has been successfully applied to numerous NLP tasks, including POS tagging (Brill and Wu, 1998; van Halteren et al., 1998), chunking (Tjong Kim Sang, 2000), word sense disambiguation (Pederson, 2000) and statistical parsing (Henderson and Brill, 1999).",
        "Dietterich (2000) presents a good introduction to ensemble methods.",
        "Ensemble methods ameliorate learner bias by amortising individual classifier bias of over different systems.",
        "For an ensemble to be more effective than its constituents, the individual classifiers must have better than 50% accuracy and must produce diverse erroneous classifications (Dietterich, 2000).",
        "Brill and Wu (1998) call this complementary disagreement complementarity.",
        "Although ensembles are often effective on problems with small training sets, recent work suggests this may not be true as dataset size increases.",
        "Banko and Brill (2001) found that for confusion set disambiguation with corpora larger than 100 million words, the best individual classifiers outperformed ensemble methods.",
        "One limitation of their results is the simplicity of the task and methods used to examine the efficacy of ensemble methods.",
        "However, both the task and applied methods are constrained by the ambitious use of one billion words of training material.",
        "Disambiguation is relatively simple because confusion sets are rarely larger than four elements.",
        "The individual methods must be inexpensive because of the computational burden of the massive training set, so they must perform limited processing of the training corpus and can only consider a fairly narrow context surrounding each instance.",
        "We explore the value of ensemble methods for the more complex task of automatic thesaurus extraction, training on corpora of up to 300 million words.",
        "The increased complexity leads to results contradicting Banko and Brill (2001), which we explore using ensembles of different contextual complexity.",
        "This work emphasises the link between contextual complexity and the problems of representation sparseness and noise as corpus size increases, which in turn impacts on learner bias and ensemble efficacy."

        "The development of large thesauri and semantic resources, such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), has allowed lexical semantic information to be leveraged to solve NLP tasks, including collocation discovery (Pearce, 2001), model estimation (Brown et al., 1992; Clark and Weir, 2001) and text classification (Baker and McCallum, 1998).",
        "Unfortunately, thesauri are expensive and time-consuming to create manually, and tend to suffer from problems of bias, inconsistency, and limited coverage.",
        "In addition, thesaurus compilers cannot keep up with constantly evolving language use and cannot afford to build new thesauri for the many sub-domains that NLP techniques are being applied to.",
        "There is a clear need for automatic thesaurus extraction methods.",
        "Much of the existing work on thesaurus extraction and word clustering is based on the observations that related terms will appear in similar contexts.",
        "These systems differ primarily in their definition of “context” and the way they calculate similarity from the contexts each term appears in.",
        "Many systems extract co-occurrence and syntactic information from the words surrounding the target term, which is then converted into a vector-space representation of the contexts that each target term appears in (Pereira et al., 1993; Ruge, 1997; Lin, 1998b).",
        "Curran and Moens (2002b) evaluate thesaurus extractors based on several different models of context on large corpora.",
        "The context models used in our experiments are described in Section 3.",
        "We define a context relation instance as a tuple (w, r, w�) where w is a thesaurus term, occurring in a relation of type r, with another word w� in the sentence.",
        "We refer to the tuple (r, w�) as an attribute of w. The relation type may be grammatical or it may label the position of w� in a context window: e.g. the tuple (dog, direct-obj, walk) indicates that the term dog, was the direct object of the verb walk.",
        "After the contexts have been extracted from the raw text, they are compiled into attribute vectors describing all of the contexts each term appears in.",
        "The thesaurus extractor then uses clustering or nearest-neighbour matching to select similar terms based on a vector similarity measure.",
        "Our experiments use k-nearest-neighbour match-(adjective, good) 2005 (adjective, faintest) 89 (direct-obj, have) 1836 (indirect-obj, toy) 74 (adjective, preconceived) 42 (adjective, foggiest) 15",

        "The simplest and fastest contexts to extract are the word(s) surrounding each thesaurus term up to some fixed distance.",
        "These window methods are labelled W(L1R1), where L1R1 indicates that window extends one word on either side of the target term.",
        "Methods marked with an asterisk, e.g. W(L1R1*), do not record the word’s position in the relation type.",
        "The more complex methods extract grammatical relations using shallow statistical tools or a broad coverage parser.",
        "We use the grammatical relations extracted from the parse trees of Lin’s broad coverage principle-based parser, MINIPAR (Lin, 1998a) and Abney’s cascaded finite-state parser, CASS (Abney, 1996).",
        "Finally, we have implemented our own relation extractor, based on Grefenstette’s SEXTANT (Grefenstette, 1994), which we describe below as an example of the NLP system used to extract relations from the raw text.",
        "Processing begins with POS tagging and NP/VP chunking using a Naive Bayes classifier trained on the Penn Treebank.",
        "Noun phrases separated by prepositions and conjunctions are then concatenated, and the relation attaching algorithm is run on the sentence.",
        "This involves four passes over the sentence, associating each noun with the modifiers and verbs from the syntactic contexts they appear in:",
        "1. nouns with pre-modifiers (left to right) 2. nouns with post-modifiers (right to left) 3. verbs with subjects/objects (right to left) 4. verbs with subjects/objects (left to right) This results in relations representing the contexts: 1. term is the subject of a verb 2. term is the (direct/indirect) object of a verb 3. term is modified by a noun or adjective 4. term is modified by a prepositional phrase",
        "The relation tuple is then converted to root form using the Sussex morphological analyser (Minnen et al., 2000) and the POS tags are stripped.",

        "We then create corpus subsets down to 128 th (2.3 million words) of the original corpus by randomly sentence selection.",
        "Ensemble voting methods for this task are quite interesting because the result consists of an ordered set of extracted synonyms rather than a single class label.",
        "To test for subtle ranking effects we implemented three different methods of combination: MEAN mean rank of each term over the ensemble; HARMONIC the harmonic mean rank of each term; MIXTURE ranking based on the mean score for each term.",
        "The individual extractor scores are not normalised because each extractor uses the same similarity measure and weight function.",
        "We assigned a rank of 201 and similarity score of zero to terms that did not appear in the 200 synonyms returned by the individual extractors.",

        "MEAN(*)) and the top three performing extractors (e.g.",
        "MEAN(3)).",

        "coarse-grained and thesaurus coverage is a problem.",

        "Since the extracted thesaurus does not separate senses we transform Ro-get’s and Macquarie into head ordered format by collapsing the sense sets containing the term.",

        "In thesaurus extraction, contextual information is collected from the entire corpus into a single description of the environments that each term appears in and classification, as such, involves comparing these collections of data.",
        "In confusion set disambiguation on the other hand, each instance must be classified individually with only a limited amount of context.",
        "The disambiguator has far less information available to determine each classification.",
        "This has implications for representation sparseness and noise that a larger corpus helps to overcome, which in turn, affects the performance of ensemble methods against individual classifiers.",
        "The complexity of the contextual representation and the strength of the correlation between target term and the context also plays a significant role.",
        "Curran and Moens (2002b) have demonstrated that more complex and constrained contexts can yield superior performance, since the correlation between context and target term is stronger than simple window methods.",
        "Further, structural and grammatical relation methods can encode extra syntactic and semantic information in the relation type.",
        "Although the contextual representation is less susceptible to noise, it is often sparse because fewer context relations are extracted from each sentence.",
        "The less complex window methods exhibit the opposite behaviour.",
        "Depending on the window parameters, the context relations can be poorly correlated with the target term, and so we find a very large number of irrelevant relations with low and unstable frequency counts, that is, a noisy contextual representation.",
        "Since confusion set disambiguation uses limited contexts from single occurrences, it is likely to suffer the same problems as the window thesaurus extractors.",
        "To evaluate an ensemble’s ability to reduce the data sparseness and noise problems suffered by different context models, we constructed ensembles based on context extractors with different levels of complexity and constraints.",
        "Table 6 shows the performance on the full corpus for the three syntactic extractors, the top three performing extractors and their corresponding mean rank ensembles.",
        "For these more complex and constrained context extractors, the ensembles continue to outperform individual learners, since the context representation are still reasonably sparse.",

        "age complementarity is greater than 50%.",
        "Table 7 shows the performance on the full corpus for a wide range of window-based extractors and corresponding mean rank ensembles.",

        "Although the ensemble performs better than most individuals, they fail to outperform the best individual on direct match evaluation.",
        "Since the average complementarity for these ensembles is similar to the methods above, we must conclude that it is a result of the individual methods themselves.",
        "In this case, the most correlated context extractor, e.g. W(L1R1), extracts a relatively noise free representation which performs better than amortising the bias of the other noisy ensemble constituents.",
        "Finally, confusion set disambiguation yields a single classification from a small set of classes, whereas thesaurus extraction yields an ordered set containing every potential synonym.",
        "The more flexible set of ranked results allow ensemble methods to exhibit more subtle variations in rank than simply selecting a single class.",
        "We can contrast the two tasks using the single synonym, P(1), and rank sensitive, INVR, evaluation measures.",
        "The results for P(1) do not appear to form any trend, although the results show that ensemble methods do not always improve single class selection.",

      "text": [
        "This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of ensemble methods for thesaurus extraction and investigates the performance of ensemble extractors on corpora ranging up to 300 million words in size.",
        "Contrary to work reported by Banko and Brill (2001), the ensemble methods continue to outperform the best individual systems for very large corpora.",
        "The trend in Figure 3 suggests that this may continue for corpora even larger than we have experimented with.",
        "Further, this paper examines the differences between thesaurus extraction and confusion set disambiguation, and links ensemble efficacy to the nature of each task and the problems of representation sparseness and noise.",
        "This is done by evaluating ensembles with varying levels of contextual complexity and constraints.",
        "The poorly constrained window methods, where contextual correlation is often low, outperformed the ensembles, which parallels results from (Banko and Brill, 2001).",
        "This suggests that large training sets ameliorate the predominantly noise-induced bias of the best individual learner better than amortising the bias over many similar ensemble constituents.",
        "Noise is reduced as occurrence counts stabilise with larger corpora, improving individual classifier performance, which in turn causes ensemble constituents to converge, reducing complementarity.",
        "This reduces the efficacy of classifier combination and contributes to individual classifiers outperforming the ensemble methods.",
        "For more complex, constrained methods the same principles apply.",
        "Since the correlation between context and target is much stronger, there is less noise in the representation.",
        "However, the added constraints reduce the number of contextual relations extracted from each sentence, leading to data sparseness.",
        "These factors combine so that ensemble methods continued to outperform the best individual methods.",
        "Finally, corpus size must be considered with respect to the parameters of the contextual representation extracted from the corpus.",
        "The value of larger corpora is partly dependent on how much information is extracted from each sentence of training material.",
        "We fully expect individual thesaurus extractors to eventually outperform ensemble methods as sparseness and complementarity are reduced, but this is not true for 100 or 300 million words since the best performing representations extract very few contexts per sentence.",
        "We would like to further investigate the relationship between contextual complexity, data sparseness, noise and learner bias on very large corpora.",
        "This includes extending these experiments to an even larger corpus with the hope of establishing the cross over point for thesaurus extraction.",
        "Finally, although wider machine learning research uses large ensembles, many NLP ensembles use only a handful of classifiers.",
        "It would be very interesting to experiment with a large number of classifiers using bagging and boosting techniques on very large corpora."
