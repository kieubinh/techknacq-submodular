        "In two recent papers, Banko and Brill (2001a; 2001b) criticize the fact that current NLP algorithms are typically optimized, tested, and compared on fairly small data sets (corpora with millions of words), even though data sets several orders of magnitude larger are available, at least for some tasks.",
        "Banko and Brill go on to demonstrate that learning algorithms typically used for NLP tasks benefit significantly from larger training sets, and their performance shows no sign of reaching an asymptote as the size of the training set increases.",
        "Arguably, the largest data set that is available for NLP is the web, which currently consists of at least 968 million pages.1 Data retrieved from the web therefore provides enormous potential",
        "for training NLP algorithms, if Banko and Brill’s findings generalize.",
        "There is a small body of existing research that tries to harness the potential of the web for NLP.",
        "Grefenstette and Nioche (2000) and Jones and Ghani (2000) use the web to generate corpora for languages where electronic resources are scarce, while Resnik (1999) describes a method for mining the web for bilingual texts.",
        "Mihalcea and Moldovan (1999) and Agirre and Martinez (2000) use the web for word sense disambiguation, and Volk (2001) proposes a method for resolving PP attachment ambiguities based on web data.",
        "A particularly interesting application is proposed by Grefenstette (1998), who uses the web for example-based machine translation.",
        "His task is to translate compounds from French into English, with corpus evidence serving as a filter for candidate translations.",
        "As an example consider the French compound groupe de travail.",
        "There are five translation of groupe and three translations for travail (in the dictionary that Grefenstette (1998) is using), resulting in 15 possible candidate translations.",
        "Only one of them, viz., work group has a high corpus frequency, which makes it likely that this is the correct translation into English.",
        "Grefenstette (1998) observes that this approach suffers from an acute data sparseness problem if the corpus counts are obtained from a conventional corpus such as the British National Corpus (BNC) (Burnard, 1995).",
        "However, as Grefenstette (1998) demonstrates, this problem can be overcome by obtaining counts through web searches, instead of relying on the BNC.",
        "Grefenstette (1998) therefore effectively uses the web as a way of obtaining counts for compounds that are sparse in the BNC.",
        "While this is an important initial result, it raises the question of the generality of the proposed approach to overcoming data sparseness.",
        "It remains to be shown that web counts are generally useful for approximating data that is sparse or unseen in a given corpus.",
        "It seems possible, for instance, that Grefenstette’s (1998) results are limited to his particular task (filtering potential translations) or to his particular linguistic phenomenon (noun-noun compounds).",
        "Another potential problem is the fact that web counts are far more noisy than counts obtained from a well-edited, carefully balanced corpus such as the BNC.",
        "The effect of this noise on the usefulness of the web counts is largely unexplored.",
        "The aim of the present paper is to generalize Grefenstette’s (1998) findings by testing the hypothesis that the web can be employed to obtain frequencies for bigrams that are unseen in a given corpus.",
        "Instead of having a particular task in mind (which would introduce a sampling bias), we rely on sets of bigrams that are randomly selected from the corpus.",
        "We use a web-based approach not only for noun-noun bigrams, but also for adjective-noun and verb-object bigrams, so as to explore whether this approach generalizes to different predicate-argument combinations.",
        "We evaluate our web counts in two different ways: (a) comparison with actual corpus frequencies, and (b) task-based evaluation (predicting human plausibility judgments)."

        "(1999), who compiled a set of 90 bigrams as follows.",
        "First, 30 adjectives were randomly chosen from a lemmatized version of the BNC so that each adjective had exactly two senses according to WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) and was unambiguously tagged as “adjective” 98.6% of the time.",
        "The 30 adjectives ranged in BNC frequency from 1.9 to 49.1 per million.",
        "Gsearch (Corley et al., 2001), a chart parser which detects syntactic patterns in a tagged corpus by exploiting a user-specified context free grammar and a syntactic query, was used to extract all nouns occurring in a head-modifier relationship with one of the 30 adjectives.",
        "Bigrams involving proper nouns or low-frequency nouns (less than 10 per million) were discarded.",
        "For each adjective, the set of bigrams was divided into three frequency bands based on an equal division of the range of log-transformed co-occurrence frequencies.",

        "All nouns modifying one of the 30 nouns were extracted from the BNC using a heuristic which looks for consecutive pairs of nouns that are neither preceded nor succeeded by another noun (Lauer, 1995).",
        "Verb-object bigrams for the 30 preselected verbs were obtained from the BNC using Cass (Abney, 1996), a robust chunk parser designed for the shallow analysis of noisy text.",
        "The parser’s output was post-processed to remove bracketing errors and errors in identifying chunk categories that could potentially result in bigrams whose members do not stand in a verb-argument relationship (see Lapata (2001) for details on the filtering process).",
        "Only nominal heads were retained from the objects returned by the parser.",
        "As in the adjective study, noun-noun bigrams and verb-object bigrams with proper nouns or low-frequency nouns (less than 10 per million) were discarded.",
        "The sets of noun-noun and verb-object bigrams were divided into three frequency bands and one bigram was chosen at random from each band.",
        "The procedure described by Lapata et al.",
        "(2001) was followed for creating sets of unseen noun-noun and verb-object bigrams: for each of noun or verb, we compiled a list of all nouns with which it failed to co-occur with in a noun-noun or verb-object bigram in the BNC.",
        "Again, Lauer’s (1995) heuristic and Abney’s (1996) partial parser were used to identify bigrams, and proper nouns and low-frequency nouns were excluded.",

        "The process of obtaining bigram frequencies from the web can be automated straightforwardly using a script that generates all the search terms for a given bigram (from (1)–(3)), issues an Altavista or Google query for each of the search terms, and then adds up the resulting number of matches for each bigram.",

        "The approach proposed here does not recreate the missing counts, but instead retrieves them from a corpus that is much larger (but also much more noisy) than any existing corpus: it launches queries to a search engine in order to determine how often a bigram occurs on the web.",
