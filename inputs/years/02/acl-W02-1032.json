        "In spite of its deficiencies, trigram-based language modeling still dominates the statistical language modeling community, and is widely applied to tasks such as speech recognition and Asian language text input (Jelinek, 1990; Gao et al., 2002).",
        "Word trigram models are deficient because they can only capture local dependency relations, taking no advantage of richer linguistic structure.",
        "Many proposals have been made that try to incorporate linguistic structure into language models (LMs), but little improvement has been achieved so far in realistic applications because (1) capturing longer distance word dependency leads to higher-order n-gram models, where the number of parameters is usually too large to estimate; (2) capturing deeper linguistic relations in a LM requires a large amount of annotated training corpus and a decoder that assigns linguistic structure, which are not always available.",
        "This paper presents several practical ways of incorporating long distance word dependency and linguistic structure into LMs.",
        "A headword detector is first applied to detect the headwords in each phrase in a sentence.",
        "A permuted headword trigram model (PHTM) is then generated from the annotated corpus.",
        "Finally, PHTM is extended to a cluster model (C-PHTM), which clusters similar words in the corpus.",
        "Our models are motivated by three assumptions about language: (1) Headwords depend on previous headwords, as well as immediately preceding words; (2) The order of headwords in a sentence can freely change in some cases; and (3) Word clusters help us make a more accurate estimate of the probability of word strings.",
        "We evaluated the proposed models on the realistic application of Japanese Kana-Kanji conversion, which converts phonetic Kana strings into proper Japanese orthography.",
        "Results show that C-PHTM achieves a 15% error rate reduction over the word trigram model.",
        "This demonstrates that the use of simple methods can effectively capture long distance word dependency, and substantially outperform the word trigram model.",

      "text": [
        "Japanese linguists have traditionally distinguished two types of words1, content words (jiritsugo) and function words (fuzokugo), along with the notion of the bunsetsu (phrase).",
        "Each bunsetsu typically consists of one content word, called a headword in this paper, and several function words.",
        "Figure 1 shows a Japanese example sentence and its English translation2.",
        "In Figure 1, we find that some headwords in the sentence are expected to have a stronger dependency relation with their preceding headwords than with their immediately preceding function words.",
        "For example, the three headwords",
        "'concentrate' – zenkai 'full recovery') form a trigram with very strong semantic dependency.",
        "Therefore, we can hypothesize (in the trigram context) that headwords may be conditioned not only by the two immediately preceding words, but also by two previous headwords.",
        "This is our first assumption.",
        "We also note that the order of headwords in a sentence is flexible in some sense.",
        "From the",
        "example in Figure 1, we find that if q� – �� – �'[",
        "recovery' – chiryou 'treatment' – sennen 'concentrate')) should also be meaningful, because headword trigrams tend to capture an order-neutral semantic dependency.",
        "This reflects a characteristic of Japanese, in which arguments and modifiers of a predicate can freely change their word order, a phenomenon known as \"scrambling\" in linguistic literature.",
        "We can then introduce our second assumption: headwords in a trigram are permutable.",
        "Note that the permutation of headwords should be useful more generally beyond Japanese: for example, in English, the book Mary bought and Mary bought a book can be captured by the same headword trigram (Mary – bought – book) if we allow such permutations.",
        "In this subsection, we have stated two assumptions about the structure of Japanese that can be exploited for language modeling.",
        "We now turn to discuss how to incorporate these assumptions in language modeling."

        "The PHTM is a simple extension of the trigram model that incorporates the dependencies between headwords.",
        "If we assume that each word token can uniquely be classified as a headword or a function word, the PHTM can be considered as a cluster-based language model with two clusters, headword H and function word F. We can then define the conditional probability of wi based on its history as the product of the two factors: the probability of the category (H or F), and the probability of wi given its category.",
        "Let hi or fi be the actual headword or function word in a sentence, and let Hi or Fi be the category of the word wi.",
        "The PHTM can then be formulated as:",
        "P(Hil Φ(w1...wi-1)) and P(Fil Φ(w1 ... wi-1)) are category probabilities, and P(wilΦ(w1 ... wi-1)Fi) is the word probability given that the category of wi is function word.",
        "For these three probabilities, we used the standard trigram estimate (i.e., Φ(w1 ... wi-1) = (wi-2wi-1)).",
        "The estimation of headword probability is slightly more elaborate, reflecting the two assumptions described in Section 2.1:",
        "This estimate is an interpolated probability of three probabilities: P(wil hi-2hi-1Hi) and P(wil hi-1hi-2Hi), which are the headword trigram probability with or without permutation, and P(wil wi-2wi-1Hi), which is the probability of wi given that it is a headword, where hi-1 and hi-2 denote the two preceding headwords, and A1, A2 ∈ [0,1] are the interpolation weights optimized on held-out data.",
        "The use of A1 in Equation (2) is motivated by the first assumption described in Section 2.1: headwords are conditioned not only on two immediately preceding words, but also on two previous headwords.",
        "In practice, we estimated the headword probability by interpolating the conditional probability based on two previous headwords P(wi|hi-2hi-1Hi) (and P(wi|hi-1hi-2Hi) with permutation), and the conditional probability based on two preceding words P(wi|wi-2wi-1Hi).",

        "Note that we did not estimate the conditional probability P(wi|wi-2wi-1hi-2hi-1Hi) directly, because this is in the form of a 5-gram, where the number of parameters are too large to estimate.",
        "The use of A2 in Equation (2) comes from the second assumption in Section 2.1: headword trigrams are permutable.",
        "This assumption can be formulated as a co-occurrence model for headword prediction: that is, the probability of a headword is determined by the occurrence of other headwords within a window.",
        "However, in our experiments, we instead used an interpolated probability A2×P(wi|hi-2hi-1Hi) + (1 –A2)×P(wi|hi-1hi-2Hi) for two reasons.",
        "First, co-occurrence models do not predict words from left to right, and are thus very difficult to interpolate with trigram models for decoding.",
        "Second, if we see n-gram models as one extreme that predicts the next word based on a strictly ordered word sequence, co-occurrence models go to the other extreme of predicting the next word based on a bag of previous words without taking word order into account at all.",
        "We prefer models that lie somewhere between the two extremes, and consider word order in a more flexible way.",
        "In PHTM of Equation (2), A2 represents the impact of word order on headword prediction.",
        "When A2 = 1 (i.e., the resulting model is a non-permuted headword trigram model, referred to as HTM), it indicates that the second assumption does not hold in real data.",

        "From Figure 2, we can see that approximately 95% of the headword trigrams can be captured by the higher-order n-gram model with the value of n smaller than 7.",
        "Based on this observation, we built word n-gram models with the values of n=4, 5 and 6.",
        "For all n-gram models, we used the interpolated modified absolute discount smoothing method (Gao et al., 2001), which, in our experiments, achieved the best performance among the state-of-the-art smoothing techniques.",
        "Results showed that the performance of the higher-order word n-gram models becomes saturated quickly as n grows: the best performance was achieved by the word 5-gram model, with the CER of 3.71 %.",
        "Following Goodman (2001), we suspect that the poor performance of these models is due to the data sparseness problem.",
        "Skipping models are an extension of an n-gram model in that they predict words based on n conditioning words, except that these conditioning words may not be adjacent to the predicted word.",
        "For instance, instead of computing P(wiJwi_2wi_,), a skipping model might compute P(wiJwi_3wi_,) or P(wiJwi_4wi_2).",
        "Goodman (2001) performed experiments of interpolating various kinds of higher-order n-gram skipping models, and obtained a very limited gain.",
        "Our results confirm his results and suggest that simply extending the context window by brute-force can achieve little improvement, while the use of even the most modest form of structural information such as the identification of headwords and automatic clustering can help improve the performance.",
        "We also compared our models with the trigram version of the ATR models discussed in Section 4, in which the probability of a word is conditioned by the preceding content and function word pair.",
        "We performed experiments using the ATR models as described in Isotani and Matsunaga (1994).",
        "The results show that the CER of the ATR model alone is much higher than that of the baseline model, but when interpolated with a word trigram model, the CER is slightly reduced by 1.6% from 3.73% to 3.67%.",
        "These results are consistent with those reported in previous work.",
        "The difference between the ATR model and our models indicates that the predictions of headwords and function words can better be done separately, as they play different semantic and syntactic roles capturing different dependency structure."

        "In order to better understand the effect of the headword trigram, we have manually inspected the actual improvements given by PHTM.",
        "As expected, many of the improvements seem to be due to the use of larger context: for example, the headword trigram ff3 – _c ,' M – 9 �V (shouhi 'consume' – shishutsu 'expense' – genshou 'decrease') contributed to the correct conversion of the phonetic string Vf hu L x 5 genshou into 9� genshou 'decrease' rather than M M genshou 'phenomenon' in the context of ff3 _c,' M� Y) Z �9 �V shouhi shishutsu hajimete no genshou 'consumer spending decreases for the first time'.",
        "On the other hand, the use of headword trigrams and predictive clustering is not without side effects.",
        "The overall gain in CER was 15% as we have seen above, but a closer inspection of the conversion results reveals that while C-PHTM corrected the conversion errors of the baseline model in 389 sentences (8%), it also introduced new conversion errors in 201 sentences (4.1%).",
        "Among the newly introduced errors, one type of error is particularly worth noting: these are the errors where the candidate conversion preferred by the HTM is",
        "grammatically impossible or unlikely.",
        "For example, * Q 6L & v5c z -;� 6 (beikoku-ni shinkou-dekiru, USA-to invade-can 'can invade USA') was misconverted as * Q 6L AT X z -;� 6 (beikoku-ni shinkou-dekiru, USA-to new-can), even though & v5c shinkou 'invade' is far more likely to be preceded by the morpheme 6L ni 'to', and ATX shinkou 'new' practically does not precede z � 6 dekiru 'can'.",
        "The HTM does not take these function words into account, leading to a grammatically impossible or implausible conversion.",
        "Finding the types of errors introduced by particular modeling assumptions in this manner and addressing them individually will be the next step for further improvements in the conversion task."

      "text": [
        "We proposed and evaluated a new language model, the permuted headword trigram model with clustering (C-PHTM).",
        "We have shown that the simple model that combines the predictive clustering with a headword detector can effectively capture structure in language.",
        "Experiments show that the proposed model achieves an encouraging 15% CER reduction over a conventional word trigram model in a Japanese Kana-Kanji conversion system.",
        "We also compared C-PTHM to several similar models, showing that our model has many practical advantages, and achieves substantially better performance.",
        "One issue we did not address in this paper was the language model size: the models that use HTM are larger than the baseline model we compared the performance with.",
        "Though we did not pursue the issue of size reduction in this paper, there are many known techniques that effectively reduce the model size while minimizing the loss in performance.",
        "One area of future work is therefore to reduce the model size.",
        "Other areas include the application of the proposed model to a wider variety of test corpora and to related tasks."
