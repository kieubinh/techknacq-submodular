        "Entries (or lemas) sharing the same meaning is grouped into a synset and assigned with a unique sense identification number for easy retrieval and tracking purposes.",
        "This unique offset number gives the information about the parts of speech and the hierarchy position to which a specific synset belongs.",
        "For nouns and verbs the synsets are grouped into multiple lexical hierarchies; modifiers such as adjectives and adverbs are simply “organized into clusters on the basis of binary opposition (antinomy).” [1] This lexical hierarchy makes the lexical domain assigning task more straightforward because it coincides with a ontological taxonomy in many aspects.",
        "The primary objective of our project is to enrich the WordNet knowledge content due to the fact that “WordNet lacks relations between related concepts.” [2] We adopt WordNet itself, together with other lexical resources to develop an integrated domain specific lexical resource."

      "text": [
        "Dictionary The digital file of Far East Dictionary contains complete information for each word entry that can be found in an ordinary printed version.",
        "Most of all, it lists the domain information for each vocabulary wherever possible.",
        "Thus we employ the available data from a text source file (each vocabulary entry is organized as one single row) and extract all the information by running a string manipulation program coded in Visual Basic.",
        "During the extraction process we only take into account the part of speech of each word in Far East Dictionary.",
        "Next, we map the domains obtained from Far East Dictionary if the word and its part of speech coincides with the entries in our database which contains a complete list of synset.",
        "Since WordNet collects only nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs, we only extract the domain data that falls into these four categories.",
        "Later we group the information in a database table and extent the assigned domains of each word to its synset.",
        "Table 1 is an example of our database table which 'contains all the adverbial uses of `aback.'",
        "In Table 1, it is shown that 'aback' has two adverbial senses.",
        "Since in Far East Dictionary “aback” is labeled with domain 'aviation,' extra work of expansion is necessary to further label all of its adverb synset with the same domain to maintain the integrity of the information.",
        "Because both the extraction and expansion method would produce ambiguities in domain assignment, manual verifications are required in the future."

      "text": [
        "Each WordNet entry (i.e. each synset) is followed by its sense.",
        "Although there is no specifically defined set of controlled vocabulary, the sense definition does specify the field the synset members are commonly used in that specific field of study, such as biology, physics or chemistry.",
        "This specification comes in a special format contained in a bracket for each WordNet entry so that extraction of data is possible and straightforward.",
        "Due to the fact that each domain is directly extracted by its corresponding synset, there is simply no ambiguity in assigning the domain tags.",
        "And if there is more than one lexical item in that synset, all will share the same domain tag.",
        "1.3 Establishment of a Common Domain Taxonomy for Nouns Each lexical resource uses a different domain taxonomy, which may be explicitly defined or implicitly assumed.",
        "Hence, when combining domain information from multiple sources, the establishment of a Common Domain Taxonomy (CDT) is crucial for both efficient representation as well as effective knowledge merging.",
        "Our survey of existing domain taxonomy, including LDOCE, HowNet, Tongyici Cilin, etc., show that there is quite a lot in common.",
        "Hence we decide to build a working CDT based on the two resources we have.",
        "Note that since our goal is to establish a domain taxonomy for wordnets (for English now and for Chinese in the future), the existing domain information in WordNet need to be assumed as defaults that can be overridden.",
        "Hence a model of CDT based on basic binary combination involving WordNet is necessary.",
        "After collecting all the domain tags from the two resources, we build our CDT.",
        "First, all common domain nodes are put in a hierarchy based on their relation.",
        "Second, inconsistent domain names are resolved.",
        "Last, when gaps appear after all domain tags are attached to the taxonomy, new domain categories are adopted to fill in the gaps and make a more complete CDT.",
        "Since top taxonomy presupposes a particular view on conceptual primacy and may differ in different lexical sources, we took a bottom-up approach to our CDT.",
