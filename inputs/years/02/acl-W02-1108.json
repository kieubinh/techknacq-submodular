        "Linguistic research has shown that verbs fall into classes distinctive in terms of their syntactic and semantic properties (Jackendoff, 1990; Hale and Keyser, 1993; Levin, 1993; Pinker, 1989).",
        "For example, verbs which share the meaning component of `motion' (e.g. fly and walk) tend to behave similarly also in terms of sub categorization and can thus be grouped to a linguistically coherent class.",
        "While the correspondence between the syntax and semantics of verbs is arguably not perfect and while the whole notion of a verb class is somewhat elusive l �verb classifications can be constructed which provide a generalization over a range of syntactic and semantic properties of verbs.",
        "Such classifications are particularly useful from a practical NLP point of view.",
        "They can be used as a means of reducing redundancy in the lexicon and for filling gaps in lexical knowledge.",
        "To a certain extent, they enable inferring 'For example, as most verbs can be characterized by several meaning components, there is potential for cross-classification.",
        "Therefore different, equally viable classification schemes can be constructed.",
        "the semantics of a word on the basis of its syntactic behaviour, and the syntax of a word on the basis of its semantic behaviour.",
        "Verb classifications have, in fact, been used to support various NLP tasks, including machine translation, language generation (Dorr, 1997), document classification (Klavans and Kan, 1998), lexicography (Sanfilippo, 1994) and lexical acquisition, such as word sense disambiguation (Dorr and Jones, 1996) and subcategorization acquisition (Korhonen, 2002b).",
        "The verb classification employed most widely in NLP is Levin's taxonomy of verbs and their classes (Levin, 1993).",
        "Levin classes are based on the ability of a verb to occur in specific diathesis alternations, i.e. specific pairs of syntactic frames which are assumed to be meaning retentive.",
        "The classification covers a substantial number of diathesis alternations occurring in English.",
        "It is not, however, exhaustive.",
        "More work is required on extending and refining it until a comprehensive resource can be obtained suitable for large-scale NLP use (Dorr and Jones, 1996; Dorr, 1997; Korhonen, 2002b).",
        "Perhaps the most challenging task is to extend the classification with new participants.",
        "Manual classification of verbs to semantic classes yields accurate results but is time consuming (Levin, 1993; Dang et al., 1998).",
        "Fully automatic classification, on the other hand, is fast but suffers from low accuracy (Dorr, 1997; Stevenson and Merlo, 1999).",
        "In this paper, we propose combining the strengths of these approaches.",
        "We present a method for semiautomatic semantic classification of verbs which exploits automatic techniques but also allows for some manual intervention.",
        "The method involves classifying verbs semantically via the semantic network of WordNet (Miller, 1990).",
        "Unlike Levin's source, Wordnet is a comprehensive lexical database.",
        "Although it classifies verbs on a purely semantic basis, the syntactic regularities studied by Levin are to some extent reflected by semantic relatedness as it is represented by WordNet's particular structure (Dorr, 1997; Fellbaum, 1999).",
        "Our method makes use of this partial overlap between WordNet and Levin classes.",
        "It involves first classifying entire WordNet senses to semantic classes and then classifying individual verbs on the basis of their WordNet senses.",
        "We use this method to classify verbs in a number of WordNet files and report experimental evaluation which shows that the method is fairly accurate and can also be used to build a classification suitable for practical NLP use.",
        "The classification built using our method can also be used to benefit linguistic research, as knowledge about novel verb and verb class associations can be used to test and enrich linguistic theory (e.g. (Levin, 1993)).",
        "As a by-product, the method produces a mapping between WordNet senses and Levin classes.",
        "This mapping – once comprehensive – can act as a useful supplement to WordNet which incorporates information about diathesis alternations and semantic verb classes.",
        "Currently this information is absent in WordNet.",

        "It is not, however, comprehensive in breadth or depth of coverage.",
        "It provides a classification of around 3200 verbs into 48 classes (some of which are split further into more distinctive subclasses, making the total number of 191 classes) according to their participation in 79 alternations involving NP and PP complements only.",
        "Work on refining the existent semantic classes and composing novel ones is under way.",
        "Dang et al.",
        "(1998), for example, have refined the current classification by creating intersective classes for those verbs which share membership of more than one Levin class.",
        "Dorr (1997) has created new classes for verbs whose syntactic behaviour differs from the syntactic description of existing Levin classes.",
        "Korhonen (2002b) has proposed novel alternations not covered by Levin – particularly those involving sentential complements – with the aim to create new classes for further verb types.",
        "Attempts have also been made to extend the classification with new participants.",
        "Levin, for instance, associates only 13 verbs with the class of \"Break Verbs\" ( break, chip, crack, crash, crush, fracture, rip, shatter, smash, snap, splinter, split, and tear), while it is possible that other English verbs fall into this class as well.",

        "Stevenson and Merlo have applied machine learning techniques to automatically classify a set of verbs, based on distributional features extracted from a corpus.",
        "They achieve 70% accuracy on the task, but their method is applicable to three verb classes only.",
        "Dorr has proposed a method applicable to all Levin classes which relies heavily on lexical resources.",
        "It uses grammatical information in the LDOCE dictionary (Procter, 1978) alongside semantic information in WordNet.",
        "The method yields 61% accuracy in assigning verbs to (one of their) correct classes.",
        "Although fully automatic classification would be an ideal solution, the methods proposed so far have not led to a resource accurate enough for all-purpose practical NLP use (e.g. (Korhonen, 2002b)).",
        "On the other hand, manual classification is not an ideal solution as it is time consuming and thus costly.",
        "Here, we address this problem by proposing a semi-automatic method which uses automatic techniques to speed up the classification task but allows for some manual intervention to maximise accuracy of classification."
