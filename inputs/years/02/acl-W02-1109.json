        "The core of the system relies on the combination of approximately 200 language-dependent rules with a set of predicates, defined on the WORDNET hierarchy, for the identification of both proper nouns and trigger words.",
        "The strengths of this approach are twofold.",
        "First, the use of a semantic network allows it to cope with the difficulty of building and maintaining extensive gazetteers.",
        "Second, considering the recent spread of WORDNET-like semantic networks for languages other than English and aligned with the English version, the use of language-independent predicates offers a useful basis for achieving multilinguality."

        "Named Entities (NE) recognition represents a crucial aspect in the process of natural language understanding.",
        "Since up to 10% of a newswire text may consist of proper names, dates, times, and similar expressions (Coates-Stephens, 1992), their effective identification is required both in Information Extraction and Information Retrieval related tasks.",
        "The NE recognition task has been defined in the context of the Message Understanding Conferences (MUC) (Chinchor, 1998) as the capability of identifying and categorizing entity names (such as persons, organizations, and locations names) �temporal expressions (dates and times), and certain types of numerical expressions (monetary values and percentages) in a written text.",
        "Knowledge-based approaches represent a possible solution to the NE recognition problem.",
        "Such techniques usually rely on the combination of a wide range of knowledge sources (for example, lexical, syntactic, and semantic features of the input text as well as world knowledge and discourse level information) and higher level techniques (e.g. co-reference resolution).",
        "In the context of this framework, dictionaries and extensive gazetteer lists of first names, company names, and corporate suffixes are often claimed to be a very useful resource.",
        "Although the recourse to list lookup seems to be a straightforward method to achieve reasonable performance, several works pointed out that the compilation of gazetteers represents a bottleneck in the design of an NE recognition system and that their availability for languages other than English is rather limited (Cucchiarelli et al., 1998).",
        "(Mikheev et al., 1999) presents an exhaustive discussion about the drawbacks related to the pure list lookup approach.",
        "Such problems mainly depend on the required dimensions of reliable gazetteers, on the difficulty of maintenance of this kind of resource (proper names form an open class, making the incompleteness of gazetteers an obvious problem), and on the possibility of overlaps among the lists (for instance, the name \"Washington\" could refer either to a person or to a location) .",
        "The difficulties related to the construction and maintenance of reliable gazetteers can be overcome by focusing attention on the presence in the text of trigger words, i.e. predicates and constructions typically associated with named entities (Wakao et al., 1996).",
        "Trigger words often provide a sufficient contextual information to determine the class of candidate proper nouns in their proximity.",
        "As an example, sys-teins designed to deal with this kind of contextual information usually access more or less complete hand-crafted word lists containing expressions like \"President\", \"Corporation\", and \"County\" in order to recognize respectively person, organization, and location names into a given text.",
        "According to (McDonald, 1996), the identification and the classification of a candidate named entity can be tackled by considering two kinds of information: internal evidence and external evidence.",
        "The former is provided by the candidate string itself, while the latter is provided by the context into which the string appears.",
        "As an example, in the sentence, \"Judge Pasco Bowman II, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan...\", the candidate proper names \"Pasco Bowman II\" and \"Ronald Rea-gan\" can be correctly marked with the tag PER-soNl either by accessing a database of person names (i.e. considering their internal evidence) or by considering the appositives \"Judge\", \"II\" and \"President\", or the pronoun \"who' as external evidence sufficient for disambiguation.",
        "In light of the above considerations, the distinguishing features of our approach to NE recognition are the following:",
        "(i) We avoid the use of gazzeteers; instead, We exploit ` ORDNET, a well known resource freely available (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "(ii) As a consequence, trigger words assume a crucial role.",
        "In order to identify trigger words relevant to the NEs categories defined in the context of the DARPA/NIST HUB4 evaluation exercise (Chinchor et al., 1998), and to separate them from words bringing internal ev",
        "idence, we resort on the distinction between Word-Class and Word-Instance in ` ORDNET.",
        "Word-Classes often individuate trigger words, while Word-Instances provide internal evidence.",
        "Our hypothesis is that the huge number of possible trigger words that can be extracted from ` ORDNET compensates for the relatively limited availability of proper nouns, thus forming a reliable basis to accomplish NE recognition without the further use of gazetteer lists.",
        "(iii) The NE recognition system is rule-based.",
        "Throughout the paper named entities categories are indicated with this TYPEFACE while W ORDNET word senses are reported with this typeface#1, where ,#1 is the corresponding sense number in WORDNET 1.6.",
        "Rules are designed to take advantage of the ` ORDNET taxonomy, in particular of abstractions induced by the IS-A hierarchy.",
        "An additional advantage (that we have not yet experimented with) of a ` ORDNET-based approach to NE recognition is that, as multilingual semantic networks aligned with the English version of ` ORDNET are available, the construction of multilingual NE recognition systems becomes a much easier challenge.",
        "This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces our ` ORDNET-based approach.",
        "Section 3 describes how named entities are recognized and how high-level rules can be used to cope with tagging ambiguities and co-reference resolution.",
        "Section 4 shows experimental results.",
        "Section 5 concludes the paper with a discussion about the presented approach."

        "Scores (i.e. F-measure, Precision and Recall) are computed by comparing a reference tagged corpus with an automatically tagged corpus according to type, content and extension of each NE.",
        "Results achieved over a 365Kb test corpus of newswire texts are shown in Table 8.",
        "The testing phase revealed an acceptable overall system's performance: as can be seen, the F-Measure score for all the tags is around 85% This result confirms the initial working hypothesis that a WORDNET-based approach to NE recognition avoids the difficulties related to the creation and maintainance of reliable gazetteers, without a great loss in terms of performance.",
        "We believe that the gap between our system and the results achieved by rule-based systems exploiting extensive gazetteer lists can be filled following two main directions.",
        "First, by improving the basic rules set adding new rules for some NE categories.",
        "As an example, Table 8 shows an unforeseen low result for the category MEASURE.",
        "In fact, even though numerical expressions are in general easier to handle, the number of constructions commonly used to express quantities was dramatically un-derstimated.",
        "For instance, no rules were created for dealing with expressions of measure like \"a three-judge panel\", \"a three-turnover per-formance\", \"a three-and-a-half-game\", \"a half-speed grounder\", \"a two-run double\", etc.",
        "As we are currently filling this gap we expect the next evaluation of the system to give much better results.",
        "Further improvements to the system can also be obtained by moving to WORDNET 1.7, which contains a significantly larger number of NE with respect to WORDNET 1.6.",
        "As an example, if we consider the concepts \"philosopher\" and \"port\", which belong to the categories PERSON and LOCATION respectively, we see that WORDNET 1.7 contains 81 Word-Instances for the first concept and 157 for the second, while the 1.6 version contains only 24 and 4 of such instances.",
        "It is important to notice that the performances of systems based on the use of gazetteer lists crucially depend on the availability and reliability of these resources.",
        "As an example, (Mikheev et al., 1999) reports that, for the category LOCATION, the Precision and Recall scores of their system decrease from more than 90% to 50% without the availability of gazetteers.",
        "Even though our approach is not only focused on capturing internal evidence in the input text, the system will doubtless benefit from the availability of the large number of new Word-Instances present in WORDNET 1.7.",
        "5 Conclusion and future work Information Retrieval and Information Extraction related tasks doubtlessly are among the most natural applications of semantic networks.",
        "An increasing number of NLP applications actually take great advantage of the highly structured WORDNET taxonomy for a wide range of activities.",
        "Among these, NE recognition could benefit from the availability of WORDNET-like resources for two main reasons.",
        "First, WORDNET is a free, well known, standard resource which provides a powerful alternative to the use of hand-crafted gazetteer lists.",
        "In this paper we showed how the highly structured WORDNET hierarchy can be exploited to cope with the difficulty of building and maintaining comprehensive lists of proper nouns and trigger words.",
        "The approach presented is based on the assumption that the huge number of possible trigger words that can be mined from WORDNET compensates for the relatively limited availability of proper nouns.",
        "Experimental results compare well with results achieved by other rule-based systems and confirm the validity of our methodology.",
        "Second, the recent spread of multilingual semantic networks aligned with the English version of WORDNET makes the construction of multilingual NE recognition systems quite an easier challenge.",
        "In fact, even though the basic rules are language-dependent (i.e. any extension to languages other than English would require the development of a set of language-specific rules), the predicates for the extraction of proper nouns and trigger words from the WORDNET hierarchy are language-independent and reusable.",
        "In order to achieve multilinguality, we are planning to combine our English rule set with a set of Italian rules.",
        "Trigger words and entity words will be extracted from MultiWordNet (Pianta et al., 2002), a multilingual lexical database including information about English and Italian words.",
        "MultiWordNet has been developed keeping as much as possible of the semantic relations available in the English WORDNET: Italian synsets have been created in correspondence with English synsets, importing semantic relations from the corresponding English synsets.",
        "The Italian part of MultiWordNet currently covers about 40,000 lemmas, strictly aligned with WORDNET 1.6."
