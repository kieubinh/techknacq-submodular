        "The WordNet lexical ontology (Miller, 1990) contains more than 100,000 unique noun forms.",
        "Most of these noun forms are common nouns (nouns describing non-specific members of a general class, e.g. “detective”).",
        "Only a small percentage1 of the nouns in WordNet are proper nouns (nouns describing specific instances, e.g. “[the detective] Columbo”).",
        "The WordNet ontology has been widely useful, with applications in information retrieval (Sussna, 1993), text classification (Scott and Matwin, 1998), and question answering (Paşca and Harabagiu, 2001).",
        "These successes have shown that common noun ontologies have wide applicability and utility.",
        "There exists no ontology with similar coverage and detail for proper nouns.",

        "recognition (Chinchor et al., 1999), stemming from the MUC evaluations.",
        "In this task, each proper noun is categorized, for example, as a PERSON, a LOCATION, or an ORGANIZATION.",
        "These coarse categorizations are useful, but more finely grained classification might have additional advantages.",
        "While Bill Clinton is appropriately identified as a PERSON, this neglects his identity as a president, a southerner, and a saxophone player.",
        "If an information request identifies the object of the search not merely as a PERSON, but as a typed proper noun (e.g. “a southern president”), this preference should be used to improve the search.",
        "Unfortunately, building a proper noun ontology is more difficult than building a common noun ontology, since the set of proper nouns grows more rapidly.",
        "New people are born.",
        "As people change, their classification must change as well.",
        "A broad-coverage proper noun ontology must be constantly updated.",
        "Therefore, to propose a viable system, a method, however limited, must be presented to build a proper noun ontology.",
        "In this paper, we explore the idea of a fine-grained proper noun ontology and its use in question answering.",
        "We build a proper noun ontology from unrestricted text using simple textual co-occurrence patterns (Section3).",
        "This automatically constructed ontology is then used on a question answering task to give preliminary results on the utility of this information (Section 4)."

        "In both, the question indicates a preference for colors as answers.",
        "Current question answering systems use ontologies when these type preferences are detected.",

        "Given the question “In pool, what color is the eight ball?”, and the ontology excerpt shown in Figure 1, the system can narrow down the range of choices.",

        "This pattern detects phrases of the form ‘[the] automaker Mercedes Benz’, and is ideally suited for proper nouns.",
        "In AP news wire text this is a productive and high precision pattern, generating nearly 200,000 unique descriptions, with 113,000 different proper nouns and 20,000 different descriptions.",
        "In comparison, the “such as” pattern (Section 5) occurs less than 50,000 times in the same size corpora.",
        "Table 2 shows the descriptions generated for a few proper nouns using this simple pattern.",

        "As can be seen from the list of descriptions generated by this pattern, people are described in a variety of different ways, and this pattern detects many of them.",
        "Table 3 shows the descriptions generated for a common proper noun (“Bill Gates”).",
        "When the descriptions are grouped by WordNet synsets and senses manually resolved, the variety of descriptions decreases dramatically (Figure 4).",

        "It is important that no invalid descriptions are added.",
        "The previous examples have focused on proper nouns which are people’s names.",
        "However, this method works for many organizations as well, as",
        "the data in Table 2 show.",
        "However, while description extraction for people is high quality (84% correct descriptions in a 100 example sample), for non-people proper names, the quality of extraction is poorer (47% correct descriptions).",

        "This suggests that attempts at noise reduction might be able to lead to larger gains in performance.",
