        "A word usually has more than one meaning or sense, which are listed in the dictionary.",
        "The task of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is to make the choice between the senses for a particular usage of the word in context.",
        "There are, however, several difficulties to WSD (Yang et al., 2000): (i) The evaluation of word sense disambiguation system is not yet standardized.",
        "(ii) The potential for WSD varies by task.",
        "(iii) Sense-tagged corpora are crucial resources for WSD but they are difficult to obtain.",
        "Efforts in building large Chinese corpora started in the 90s, for example, the Sinica corpus (CKIP, 1995) and the Chinese Penn Tree Bank (Xia et al., 2000).",
        "However, these two corpora concentrate on the tagging of parts-of-speech and syntactic structures, while little work has been done on semantic annotation.",
        "Of the few efforts that were carried out, Lua1 annotated 340,000 words with semantic classes defined in a thesaurus (Mei, 1983).",
        "This resource, however, was not publicly accessible.",
        "With the release of HowNet (Dong, 1999; Dong, 2000) in YANG Yongsheng Department of Computer Science, HKUST, Clear Water Bay, Hong Kong.",
        "ysyang@cs.ust.hk 1999, Gan and Tham (1999) manually annotated a Chinese corpus of 30,000 words with the senses from HowNet.",
        "The corpus is a subset of the Sinica balanced corpus, and consists of 103 narratives on news stories, in which the words have already been segmented and tagged with parts-of-speech.",
        "Gan and Tham (1999) added sense tagging and subsequently Gan and Wong (2000) annotated the corpus with semantic dependency relations as defined in HowNet.",
        "The corpus was released to the public in January 2002 2, providing essential resources for Chinese word sense disambiguation.",
        "This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives an introduction of HowNet.",
        "Section 3 describes the WSD task and the experiment results.",

        "In contrast to WordNet (Miller, 1990), HowNet adopts a constructive approach of meaning representation (Miller, 1993).",
        "Basic meaning units called sememes, which cannot be decomposed further, combine to construct concepts in HowNet.",

        "The current version of HowNet has entries in two languages (Chinese and English) with the possibility of extending it to other languages.",
        "Therefore, W_C, E_C and G_C would be entries for the words, the examples and the parts-of-speech respectively in Chinese, whereas W_E, E_E and G_E are the corresponding entries for English.",
        "Figure 2 shows an example word, “journalist”, as entered in HowNet.",
        "As mentioned in Miller (1993), the definition of a common noun typically consists of (i) its immediate superordinate term and (ii) some distinguishing features.",
        "HowNet represents this with pointers3 and the order of the sememes in concept definitions.",
        "In the example above, the sememe appearing in the first position ‘human |k’ is called the categorical attribute.",
        "It names the hypernym or the superordinate term, which gives a general classification of the concept.",
        "The sememes appearing in other positions: ‘occupation|FFJ� f(�’, ‘gather |� :%[-- ’, ‘compile |,�Q ’, ‘news |�h riI’ are additional attributes, which provide more specific, distinguishing features.",
        "Two types of pointers are used in this concept.",

        "There is a one-to-one direct mapping of the categorical attributes to the 3rd, 4th and the 5th senses, so frequency information is not needed for them.",

        "In that case, the performance of the maximum entropy tagger would improve to 89.73%.",
        "Even though it does not look like the maximum entropy tagger outperforms the baseline system by much, it should be noted that the nature of the corpus makes the task simple for the baseline system.",
