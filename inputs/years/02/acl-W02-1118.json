        "In order to answer this question, let us take a look at the time course of lexicalization.",
        "According to psychologists (Butterworth, 1989:110; Levelt 1989), lexical access takes place in two temporally distinct stages.",
        "In the first stage the speaker checks the semantic lexicon for a lemma expressing the conceptual input .4 If he can find one, he will take it and consult then the phonological lexicon in order to find the appropriate phonological form.5 Errors can occur at both ends.",
        "Yet, since the two stages are independent, errors belong to either category, but never to both.",
        "Errors at the semantic level will yield a wrong lemma (e.g. hate instead of love), while errors at the phonological level may result in the wrong phonological form.",
        "For example, the intented relegate may surface as renegate or delegate (/l/ and /n/ as well /r/ and /d/ being phonologically relatively close), turn on the heater switch may result in turn on the sweeter hitch (Clark & Clark, 1977), etc.",
        "As one can see, these words are all phonologically reasonably close to the target word, yet, it is precisely",
        "this proximity that prevents the speaker to access the “right” word.",
        "4 The speaker’s problem: choosing words, finding them, or both?",
        "Obviously, there is more to lexicalisation than just choosing words: one has to find them to begin with.",
        "No matter how rich a lexical database may be, it is of little use if one cannot access the relevant information in time.",
        "Work on memory has shown that access depends crucially on the way information is organized (Baddeley, 1982).",
        "From speech error literature (Fromkin 1973) we learn that ease of access depends not only on meaning relations (word bridges, i.e. associations) or the structure of the lexicon (i.e. the way words are organized in our mind), – but also on linguistic form.",
        "Researchers collecting speech errors have offered countless examples of phonological errors in which segments (phonemes, syllables or words) are added, deleted, anticipated or exchanged.",
        "Reversals like /aminal/ instead of /animal/, or /karpsihord/ instead of /harpsikord/ are not random at all, they are highly systematic and can be explained.",
        "Examples such as grastly, a blend of grizzly + ghastly, or Fatz and Kodor (instead of Katz and Fodor) clearly show that knowing the meaning of a word does not guarantee its access.",
        "The work on speech errors also reveals that words are stored in two modes, by meaning and by form (sound), and it is often this latter which inhibits finding the right token: having recombined inadvertently the components of a given word (syllable scrambling), one may end up producing a word, which either does not exist or is simply different from the one in mind.",
        "This kind of recombination, resulting from bookkeeping problems due to time pressure, parallel processing and information overload, may disturb or prevent the access of words.",
        "Hence the usefulness of a tool that allows to revert the process."

        "The component described below is part of a larger system PIC (Fournier & Letellier, 1990).",
        "For its adaptation to the problem of lexical access see Zock & Fournier (2001).",
        "The system has two basic mechanisms for finding the right word: anacodes and phoneti-codes.",
        "The former deals with errors due to permutations, while the latter deals with homophones.",
        "Since an anacode is equivalent to the set of letters composing the word, scrambled letters (unwanted permutations) are not a problem at all.",
        "The system would still find the right word, provided that there is such a candidate in the dictionary, and provided that the user didn't omit, add or replace one character(s) by another.",
        "For example, if the input were aclibrer instead of calibrer, the system would have no difficulty to find the target word (calibrer), since both words are composed of the same set of letters (a/b/c/e/i/l/r).",
        "If the user added letters outside of the anacode, the system would need several runs to check alternative spellings by making local variations (delete or add a character by making systematic permutations).",
        "The second technique (phoneticodes) consists in converting graphemes into phonemes, which allows the system to deal with spelling errors due to homophony, a very frequent phenomenon in French (see figure 1).",
        "For example, the system would be able to deal with errors like vin, vins, vein, vint, vaincs, etc.",
        "instead of vingt.",
        "If the system cannot find directly a candidate, it will perform local changes by performing permutations of phonemes or syllables.",
        "Hence it would have no problem to find the word poteau (pole) instead of topos (topic), both words being composed of the same syllables (/po-to/), the only difference being their order.",
        "The situation is more complex and may even become intractable if extraneous material is added, or if the correction yields an existing, yet semantically different word from what was intended.",
        "Suppose that the target word were \"maison\" (house), while the user typed “masson”.",
        "Relying on the phoneticode, the system might suggest \"maçon\" (bricklayer), a word that exists, but which is not at all what was intended.",
        "Relying on the anacode, it would fail, because none of the permutations would result in the target word.",
        "5.2 Access by meaning: navigation in a huge associative network As mentionned before, words are stored by meaning and by form (sound).",
        "Therefore we need a method to access words in both modalities.",
        "This is all the more necessary, as the speaker starts from a meaning representation (concept, message).",
        "We plan to experiment with the following two methods.",
        "In the first case search is done by propagation in a dynamically built network.",
        "In the second case search is done by filtering (5.3).",
        "The fact that the dictionary is organized as a web rather than a taxonomy, has obvious advantages : there is more than one way to reach the goal.",
        "Hence, if ever one has gone in the « wrong » direction, one may still recover later on.",
        "To illustrate this last point, let’s take an example.",
        "Suppose you played chess and you wanted to find the French equivalent for the word « knight » (cavalier).",
        "If the dictionary were structured along the lines suggested, than one could access the word via any of the following links or associations : horseman (cavalier-noun), to be nonchalant (être cavalier), to be a loner (faire cavalier seul), but also to bolt (ca-valer), King Arthur (chevalier), famous French singer (Maurice Chevalier).",
        "Note, that while in the first three cases we get homonymes of the target word (cavalier), to bolt produces a similarly sounding word (cavaler instead of cavalIer).",
        "The last association (Maurice Chevalier) results in a perfect match, except for the first syllable and the first name, which would have to be dropped, of course.",
        "5.2.1 Search by progagation in the network I start from the assumption that the mental dictionary is a huge semantic network composed of words (nodes) and associations (links), either being able to activate the other.6 Finding a word amounts thus to entering the network and to follow the links leading to the target word.",
        "Being unable to access the desired word, a speaker being in the TOT-state may still be able to recognize it in a list.",
        "If the list doesn’t contain the exact word, he is generally able to decide which word leads in the right direction, i.e. which word is most closely connected to the target word.",
        "Suppose you wanted to find the word nurse (target word), yet the only token coming to your mind were hospital.",
        "In this case the system would build (internally) a small semantic net6 The idea according to which the mental dictionary (or encyclopedia) is basically an associative network, composed of nodes (words or concepts) and links (associations) is not new.",
        "Actually the very notion of association goes back at least to Aristotle (350 before our time), but it is also inherent in work done by philosophers (Locke, Hume) physiologists (James & Stuart Mills), psychologists (Galton, 1880 ; Freud, 1901 ; Jung & Riklin, 1906) and psycholinguists (Deese, 1965 ; Jenkins, 1970, Schvaneveldt, 1989 ).",
        "For surveys in psycholinguistics see (Hörmann, 1972 ; chapters 6-10), or more recent work (Spitzer, 1999).",
        "The notion of association is also implicit in work on semantic networks (Sowa, 1992), hypertext (Bush, 1945), the web (Nelson, 1967), connectionism (Stemberger, 1985 ; Dell, 1986) and of course Word-Net (Miller, 1990, Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "work with hospital in the center (Figure 2a) and as immediate satellites all the words having a direct link with it (Figure 2b).7 This process is recursive: satellites can become the center, thus triggering a new search, and since the speaker knows the concept/word he is looking for, he is likely to encounter it sooner or later.",
        "Figure 2b shows the candidates from which the user is supposed to choose.",
        "If he finds in any of these groups the word he is looking for, the process halts, otherwise it goes on.",
        "As you can see words are presented in clusters.",
        "Each cluster corresponds to a specific link.",
        "The assumption is that the user will use this information in order to jump quickly from one group to the next.",
        "This approach might work fine provided : 1) the speaker is able to come up with a word reasonably close to the target; 2) The dictionary contains (or allows to infer) all the relations/ associations a speaker typically uses.",
        "This second condition hardly ever holds.",
        "Hence, we need to find out what these assocations are.",
        "Also, while a single piece of information (a word, a relationship or part of the definition) can be useful, it is obviously better to provide more information (number of syllables, sound, origine, etc.)",

        "Looking at some of the psycholinguistic findings, and looking at the work done on spell checking, it seemed that some of the techniques developed in the context of the latter could profitably be used in the domain of the former.",
        "While the use of certain spell checking techniques can certainly enhance word access in speaking and writing (hence the potential of electronic dictionaries associated with word processors), more work is needed in order to adjust the method to be in line with psycholinguistic data and in order to keep the search space small.",
        "I have also tried to show that in order to support a speaker being in the TOT-state, we need to create an associative memory.",
        "That is, I've raised and partially answered the question what kind of information semantic networks need to have in order to be able to help a speaker being in this state.",
        "Actually, my basic proposal is to build a system akin to WordNet, but containing many more links – in particular on the horizontal plane.",
        "These links are basically associations, whose role consists in helping the speaker to find either related ideas to a given stimulus, (concept/idea/word - brainstorming), or to find the word he is thinking of (word access).",
        "Hence, future work will consist in identifying the most useful assocations, by considering relevant work in linguistics8 and in collecting data by running psycholinguistic expermiments.",
        "For example, one could ask people to label the links for the words (associations) they have given in response to a stimulus (word) ; or one could also ask them to lable couples of words (eg.",
        "apple-fruit, lemon-yellow, etc.).",
        "A complementary approach would be to look for lexical-data-base mining-strategies, as the desired information may be distributed or burried deep down in the base.",
        "Finally, one can also look at texts and try to extract automatically co-occurences (see Rapp & Wettler, 1991 ; Wettler & Rapp 1992)."
