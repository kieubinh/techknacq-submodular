        "ISLE (International Standards for Language Engineering) is a continuation of the long standing European EAGLES (Expert Advisory Group for Language Engineering Standards) initiative (Calzolari et al., 1996), carried out through a number of subsequent projects funded by the European Commission (EC) since 1993.",
        "ISLE is an initiative under the Human Language Technology (HLT) programme within the EU-US International Research Cooperation with the aim to develop and promote widely agreed and urgently demanded HLT standards, common guidelines and best practice recommendations for infrastructural language resources (Zampolli, 1998), (Calzolari, 1998), tools that exploit them, and language engineering products.",
        "Object of EAGLES/ISLE are large-scale language resources (such as text corpora, computational lexicons, speech corpora, multimodal resources), means of manipulating such knowledge via computational linguistic formalisms, mark-up languages and various software tools and means of assessing and evaluating resources, tools and products (EAGLES EWG final report, 1996).",
        "EAGLES was set up to determine which aspects of our field are open to short-term de facto standardisation and to encourage the development of such standards for the benefit of consumers and producers of language technology, through bringing together representatives of major collaborative European R&D projects, and of HLT industry, in relevant areas.",
        "In this respect, more than 150 leading industrial and academic players in the HLT field have actively participated in the definition of this initiative and have lent invaluable support to its execution.",
        "Successful standards are those which respond to commonly perceived needs or aid in overcoming common problems.",
        "In terms of offering workable, compromise solutions, they must be based on some solid platform of accepted facts and acceptable practices.",
        "The current ISLE project1 targets the three areas of : multilingual computational lexicons2, natural interaction and multimodality (NIMM)3, evaluation of HLT systems4.",
        "For multilingual computational lexicons, ISLE goals are: i) extending EAGLES work on lexical semantics, necessary to establish inter-language links; ii) designing and proposing standards for multilingual lexicons; iii) developing a prototype tool to implement lexicon guidelines and standards; iv) creating exemplary EAGLES-conformant sample lexicons and tagging exemplary corpora for validation purposes; v) developing standardised evaluation procedures for lexicons.",
        "For NIMM, ISLE work is targeted to develop guidelines for: i) the creation of NIMM data resources; ii) interpretative annotation of NIMM data, including spoken dialogue in NIMM contexts; iii) metadata descriptions for large NIMM resources; iv) annotation of discourse phenomena.",
        "For evaluation, ISLE is working on: i) quality models for machine translation systems; ii) maintenance of previous guidelines - in an ISO based framework (ISO 9126, ISO 14598).",
        "Three Working Groups, and their sub-groups, carry out the work, according to the EAGLES",
        "methodology, with experts from both the EU and US, acting as a catalyst in order to pool concrete results coming from major international/national/industrial projects.",
        "Relevant common practices or upcoming standards are being used where appropriate as input to EAGLES/ISLE work.",
        "Numerous theories, approaches, and systems are being taken into account as any recommendation for harmonisation must take into account the needs and nature of the different major contemporary approaches.",
        "Results are widely disseminated, after due validation in collaboration with EU and US HLT R&D projects, National projects, and industry.",
        "In the following we concentrate on the Computational Lexicon Working Group (CLWG), trying to describe its specific methodology and its goal of establishing a general and consensual standardized environment for the development and integration of multilingual resources.",
        "The general vision adheres to the idea of enhancing the sharing and reusability of multilingual lexical resources, by promoting the definition of a common parlance for the community of multilingual HLT and computational lexicon developers.",
        "The CLWG pursues this goal by proposing a general schema for the encoding of multilingual lexical information, the MILE (Multilingual ISLE Lexical Entry).",
        "This has to be intended as a meta-entry, acting as a common representational layer for multilingual lexical resources.",

        "Standards must emerge from state-of-the-art developments.",
        "The process of standardisation, although by its own nature not intrinsically innovative, must – and actually does – proceed shoulder to shoulder with the most advanced research.",
        "Since ISLE involves many bodies active in EU-US NLP and speech projects, close collaboration with these projects is assured and, significantly, free manpower has been contributed by the projects, as a sign of both their commitment and of the crucial importance they place on reusability issues.",
        "Lexical semantics has always represented a sort of wild frontier in the investigation of natural language.",
        "In fact, the number of open issues in lexical semantics both on the representational, architectural and content level might induce an actually unjustified negative attitude towards the possibility of designing standards in this difficult territory.",
        "Rather to the contrary, standardisation must be conceived as enucleating and singling out the areas in the open field of lexical semantics, that already present themselves with a clear and high degree of stability, although this is often hidden behind a number of formal differences or representational variants, that prevent the possibility of exploiting and enhancing the aspects of commonality and the already consolidated achievements.",
        "With no intent of imposing any constraints on investigation and experimentation, the ISLE CLWG rather aims at selecting mature areas and results in computational lexical semantics and in multilingual lexicons, which can also be regarded as stabilised achievements, thus to be used as the basis for future research.",
        "Therefore, consolidation of a standards proposal must be viewed, by necessity, as a slow process comprising, after the phase of putting forward proposals, a cyclical phase involving ISLE external groups and projects with: i) careful evaluation and testing of recommendations in concrete applications; ii) application, if appropriate, to a large number of European languages; iii) feedback on and readjustment of the proposals until a stable platform is reached; dissemination and promotion of consensual recommendations.",
        "The process of standard definition undertaken by CLWG represents an essential interface between advanced research in the field of multilingual lexical semantics, and the practical task of developing resources for HLT systems and applications.",
        "It is through this interface that the crucial trade-off between research practice and applicative needs will actually be achieved.",

        "Following the well established EAGLES methodology, the first priority was to do a wide-range survey of bilingual/multilingual (or semantic monolingual) lexicons, so as to reach a fair level of coverage of existing lexical resources.",
        "With respect to this target, one of the first objectives is to discover and list the (maximal) set of (granular) basic notions needed to describe the multilingual level.",
        "The Survey of existing lexicons (Calzolari, Grishman and Palmer, 2001) has been accompanied by the analysis of the requirements of a few multilingual applications, and by the parallel analysis of typical cross-lingually complex phenomena 5.",
        "The main issue is how to state in the most proper way the translation correspondences among entries in the multilingual lexicon.",
        "The passage from source language (SL) to target language (TL) makes it necessary to express very complex and articulated transfer conditions, which have to take into account as difficult and pervasive phenomena as argument switching, multi-word expressions, collocational patterns, etc.",
        "The function of an entry in a multilingual lexicon is to supply enough information to allow the system to identify a distinct sense of a word or phrase in SL, in many different contexts, and reliably associate each context with the most appropriate translation.",
        "The first step is to determine, of all the information that can be associated with SL lexical entries, what is the most relevant to a particular task.",
        "We decided to focus the work of survey and subsequent recommendations around two major broad categories of application: Machine Translation and Cross-Language Information Retrieval.",
        "They have partially different/complementary needs, and can be considered to represent the requirements of other application types.",
        "It is necessary in fact to ensure that any guidelines meet the requirements of industrial applications and that they are implementable.",
        "In the Survey, some Korean and Japanese examples were present in the case study dedicated to relevant cross-linguistic phenomena, (e. g. sense distinctions according to variation in syntactic frames/semantic type/",

        "Since the architecture of the PAROLE-SIMPLE lexicons has been selected to provide the necessary bootstrapping basis for the stepwise refinement cycle leading to MILE, we briefly provide here some information about these resources.",
        "The design of the SIMPLE lexicons (Bel et al., 2000) complies with the EAGLES Lexicon/Semantics Working Group guidelines (Sanfilippo et al., 1999), and the set of recommended semantic notions.",
        "The SIMPLE lexicons are built as a new layer connected to the PAROLE syntactic layer, and encode structured “semantic types” and semantic (subcategorization) frames.",
        "They cover 12 languages (Catalan, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish).",
        "The common model is designed to facilitate future cross-language linking: they share the same core ontology and the same set of semantic templates.",
        "The “conceptual core” of the lexicons consists of the basic structured set of “semantic types” (the SIMPLE ontology) and the basic set of notions to be encoded for each Semantic Unit (SemU): domain information, lexicographic gloss, argument structure, selectional restrictions/preferences on the arguments, event type, links of the arguments to the syntactic subcategorization frames as represented in the PAROLE lexicons, ‘qualia’ structure, following the Generative Lexicon (Pustejovsky, 1995), semantic relations, etc..",
        "SIMPLE and PAROLE lexicons are layered resources, with links between the morphological and syntactic layers expressed in PAROLE and the semantic information present in SIMPLE.",
        "In its general design, also MILE is envisaged as a highly modular and layered architecture as described in Calzolari et al.",
        "(2001).",
        "Modularity concerns the “horizontal” MILE organization, in which independent and yet linked modules target different dimensions of lexical entries.",
        "On the other hand, at the “vertical” level, a layered organization is necessary to allow for different degrees of granularity of lexical descriptions, so that both “shallow” and “deep” representations of lexical items can be captured.",
        "This feature is particularly crucial in order to stay open to the different styles and approaches to the lexicon adopted by existing multilingual systems.",
        "At the top level, MILE includes two main modules, mono-MILE, providing monolingual lexical representations, and multi-MILE, where multilingual correspondences are defined.",
        "With this design choice the ISLE-CLWG intends also to address the particularly complex and yet crucial issue of multilingual resource development through the integration of monolingual computational lexicons.",
        "As in the reference model, PAROLE/SIMPLE, Mono-MILE is organized into independent modules, respectively providing morphological, syntactic and semantic descriptions.",
        "The latter surely represents the core and the most challenging part of the ISLE-CLWG activities, together with the two other crucial topics of collocations and multi-word expressions, which have often remained outside astandardization initiatives, and nevertheless have a crucial role at the multilingual level.",
        "This bias is motivated by the necessity of providing an answer to the most urgent needs and desiderata of next generation HLT, as also expressed by the industrial partners participating to the project.",
        "With respect to the issue of the representation of multi-word expressions in computational lexicons, the ISLE-CLWG is actively cooperating with the NSF sponsored XMELLT project (Calzolari et al., 2002).",
        "Multi-MILE specifies a formal environment for the characterization of multilingual correspondences between lexical items.",
        "In particular, source and target lexical entries can be linked by exploiting (possibly combined) aspects of their monolingual descriptions.",
        "Moreover, in multi-MILE both syntactic and semantic lexical representations can also be enriched, so as to achieve the granularity of lexical description required to establish proper multilingual correspondences, and which is possibly lacking in the original monolingual lexicons.",
        "According to the ISLE approach, monolingual lexicons can thus be regarded as pivot lexical repositories, on top of which various language-to-language multilingual modules can be defined, where lexical correspondences are established by partly exploiting and partly enriching the monolingual descriptions.",
        "This architecture guarantees the independence of monolingual descriptions while allowing for the maximum degree of flexibility and consistency in reusing existing monolingual resources to build new bilingual lexicons.",
        "The MILE architecture is intended to provide the common representational environment needed to implement such an approach to multilingual resource development, with the goal of maximizing the reuse, integration and extension of existing monolingual computational lexicons.",
        "In the process of specifying the various components of MILE, the ISLE-CLWG has adopted a two-track strategy:",
        "1) identifying the lexical dimensions and the various types of information which are relevant to establish multilingual correspondences; 2) idefining a suitable formal data model to encode this information as well as the operations required at the multilingual level.",
        "To tackle point 1) the survey of the available computational lexicons (see section 2.1) has been complemented with a more lexicographic-based effort, to identify the types of information used in bilingual dictionaries to establish translation equivalents.",
        "To this purpose, the CLWG has organized two “task forces” with the responsibility respectively of creating a sample of lexical entries and investigating the use of the so-called sense indicators in traditional bilingual dictionaries.",
        "The work on sense indicators has been carried out mainly by S. Atkins and P. Bouillon: sense indicators are the ‘clues’ given by the lexicographer to the bilingual dictionary users in order to guide them to the most appropriate choice of equivalence in the foreign language.",
        "The source word with its syntactic category, the target words and the sense indicators were automatically extracted from an English-French dictionary and then the sense indicators have been classified on the basis of lexical relevant facts (cf. Atkins et al., 2002).",
        "The aim of these activities has been twofold: on one hand, we wanted to be able to highlight the various types of information useful to determine the transfer conditions; on the other, we had to explore and evaluate the full expressive potentialities provided by the reference computational model (i.e. the PAROLE-SIMPLE architecture)."

        "The MILE Entry Skeleton, formalized as an XML DTD, is an Entity Relationship model that will define the general constraints for the construction of multilingual entries, as well as the grammar to build the whole array of lexical elements needed for a given lexical description.",

        "Lexical Data Categories will be organized in a hierarchy and will be defined using RDF schema (Brickley and Guha, 2000) to formalize their properties and make their “semantics” explicit.",
        "The MILE Shared Lexical Objects will instantiate the MILE Lexical Data Categories, to be used to build in an easy and straightforward way lexical entries.",
        "These will include main syntactic constructions, basic operations and conditions to establish multilingual links, macro-semantic objects, such as lexical conceptual templates acting as general constraints for the encoding of semantic units.",
        "For instance, at the multilingual level it is possible to identify a first set of basic operations that are at the basis of multilingual transfer tests and actions.",
        "This would include: i) adding to a monolingual lexical entry a new syntactic position (required for a given translation correspondence); ii) adding to a monolingual semantic description a new semantic feature (required for a given translation correspondence); iii) constraining the source-target correspondence to apply only if an existing syntactic position is realized by a certain type of phrase, etc.",
        "Lexical objects will be identified by an URI and will act as a common resources for lexical representation, to be in turn described by RDF metadata.",
        "The defined lexical objects will be used by the lexicon (or applications) developers to build and target lexical data at a higher level of abstraction.",
        "Thus, they have to be seen as a step in the direction of simplifying and improving the usability of the MILE recommendations.",
        "The ISLE Lexicographic Station is a development platform used to automatically generate a prototype tool starting from the MILE DTD.",
        "The aim of this prototype tool is to i) exemplify the MILE entry ii) make extensive use of already existing monolingual resources, and iii) eventually test the guidelines in a real scenario.",
        "This situation led us to define a lexicographic station development platform that guarantees the portability of the final prototype to the final specifications as well as to existing monolingual resources which will serve as the basic data for MILE (for a detailed description, cf. Villegas and Bel, 2002).",
        "Both at monolingual and multilingual level (but with particular emphasis on the latter), ISLE intends to start up the incremental definition of a more Object-Oriented layer for lexical description and to foster the vision of open and distributed lexicons, with elements possibly residing in different sites of the web."
