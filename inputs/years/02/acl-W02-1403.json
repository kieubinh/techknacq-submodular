        "Terminology structuring, i.e., organizing a set of terms through semantic relations, is one of the difficult issues that have to be addressed when building terminological resources.",
        "These relations include subsumption or hyperonymy (the is-a relation), meronymy (part-of and its variants), as well as other, diverse relations, sometimes called ‘transversal’ (e.g., cause, or the general see also).",
        "Various methods have been proposed to discover relations between terms (see Jacquemin and Bourigault (2002) for a review).",
        "We divide them into internal and external methods, in the same way as McDonald (1993) for proper names.",
        "Internal methods look at the constituency of terms, and compare terms based on the words they contain.",
        "Term matching can rely directly on raw word forms (Bodenreider et al., 2001), on morphological variants (Jacquemin and Tzoukermann, 1999), on syntactic structure (Bourigault, 1994; Jacquemin and Tzoukermann, 1999) or on semantic variants (synonyms, hyperonyms, etc.)",
        "(Hamon et al., 1998).",
        "External methods take advantage of the context in which terms occur: they examine the behavior of terms in corpora.",
        "Distributional methods group terms that occur in similar contexts (Grefenstette, 1994).",
        "The detection of appropriate syntactic patterns of cooccurrence is another method to uncover relations between terms in corpora (Hearst, 1992; Séguéla and Aussenac, 1999).",
        "In previous work we applied lexical methods to identify relations between terms on the basis on their content words, taking morphological variants into account.",
        "Our goal was then to assess the feasibility of such structuring by studying it on an existing, hierarchically structured terminology.",
        "Ignoring this existing structure and starting from the set of its terms, we attempt to discover hierarchical term-to-term links and compare them with the preexisting relations.",
        "Our goal in the present paper is to analyze ‘new’ relations.",
        "‘New’ means that these induced relations are not present in the original hierarchical structure of the MeSH thesaurus; they might nevertheless reflect useful links.",
        "Performing this analysis allows us to propose a more precise evaluation of the methods and their results and to point out some inherent limits.",
        "After the exposition of the data we used in our experiments (section 2), we present methods (section 3) for generating hierarchical links between terms through the study of lexical inclusion and for evaluating their quality with appropriate recall and precision metrics.",
        "We then present the analysis of some ‘new’ induced relations and attempt to propose a typology of term dependency in these relations (section 4).",
        "We finally discuss the limits of lexical methods for the structuring task (section 5)."

        "The MeSH is used to index the international biomedical literature in the Medline bibliographic database.",
        "The French version of the MeSH (INSERM, 2000) contains a translation of these terms (19,638 terms) plus synonyms.",
        "It happens to be written in unaccented, uppercase letters.",
        "Both the American and French MeSH can be found in the UMLS Metathesaurus (NLM, 2001b), which can be obtained through a convention with the National Library of Medicine.",
        "The concept names (main headings) which the MeSH contains have been designed to reflect their broad meanings and to facilitate their use by human indexers and librarians.",
        "In that, they follow a tradition in information sciences, and are not necessarily the expressions used in naturally occurring biomedical documents.",
        "The MeSH can be considered as a fine-grained thesaurus: concepts are chosen to insure a good coverage of the biomedical domain (Zweigenbaum, 1999).",
        "As many other medical terminologies, the MeSH has a hierarchical structure: ‘narrower’ concepts (children) are related to ‘broader’ concepts (parents).",
        "This both covers the usual is-a relation and partitive relations (part-of, conceptual-part-of and process-of).",

        "To conclude, the MeSH team aims to organize it in a clear and intuitive manner, both for concept naming and concept placement.",
        "The version of the French MeSH we used in these experiments contains 19,638 terms, 26,094 direct child-to-parent links and (under transitive closure) 95,815 direct or indirect child-to-ancestor links."

        "The second lexicon, more specialized and tuned to the vocabulary in medical terminologies, is the result of applying rules acquired in previous work from two other medical terminologies (ICD-10 and SNOMED) to the vocabulary in the MeSH, ICD-10 and SNOMED (total: 2,889 pairs).",
        "Derivation produces, e.g., the adjectival form of a noun (noun aorta H adjective aortic), the nominal form of a verb (verb intervene H noun intervention), or the adverbial form of an adjective (adjective human H adverb humanely).",
        "We perform linguistically-motivated stemming to reduce a derived word to its base word.",
