        "SMT mainly became known to the linguistic community as a result of the seminal work of Brown et al.",
        "(1993b).",
        "Since then, many researchers have invested effort into designing better models than the ones proposed in the aforementioned article and several new exciting ways have been suggested to attack the problem.",
        "For instance, Vogel et al.",
        "(1996) succeeded in overcoming the independence assumption made by IBM models by introducing order-1 Hidden Markov alignment models.",
        "Och et al.",
        "(1999) described an elegant way of integrating automatically acquired probabilistic templates into the translation process, and Nießen and Ney (2001) did the same for morphological information.",
        "Radically different statistical models have also been proposed.",
        "(Foster, 2000) investigated maximum entropy models as an alternative to the so-called noisy-channel approach.",
        "Very recently, Yamada and Knight (2001) described a model in which the noisy-channel takes as input a parsed sentence rather than simple words.",
        "While many of these studies include intensive evaluation sections, it is not always easy to determine exactly how well statistical translation can do on a given task.",
        "We know that on a specific task of spoken language translation, Wang (1998) provided evidence that SMT compared favorably to a symbolic translation system; but as mentioned by the author, the comparison was not totally fair.",
        "We do not know of any studies that describe extensive experiments evaluating the adequacy of SMT in a real translation environment.",
        "We prefer not to commit ourselves to defining what a real translation task is; instead, we adopt the conservative point of view that a viable translation engine (statistical or not) is one that copes with texts that may be very different in nature from those used to train it.",
        "This fairly general definition suggests that adaptativity is a cornerstone of a successful SMT engine.",
        "Curiously enough, we are not aware of much work on adaptative SMT, despite the tremendous amount of work done on adaptative statistical language modeling.",
        "In this paper, we propose to evaluate how a statistical engine behaves when translating a very domain specific text which is far different from the corpus used to trained both our translation and language models.",
        "We first describe our translation engine.",
        "In section 3, we quantify and analyse the performance deterioration of an SMT engine trained on a broad-based corpus (the Hansard) when used to translate a domain specific text (in this study, a manual for military snipers).",
        "In section 4, We then suggest a simple but natural way of improving a broad-based SMT engine; that is, by opening the engine to available terminological resources.",
        "In section 5, we report on the improvement we observed by implementing our proposed approach.",
        "Finally, in section 6 we discuss other approaches we feel can lead to more robust translation."

        "To train our statistical models, we assembled a bitext composed of 1.6 million pairs of sentences that were automatically aligned at the sentence level.",
        "In this experiment, every token was converted into lowercase before training.",
        "The language model we used is an interpolated trigram we trained on the English sentences of our bitext.",
        "The perplexity of the resulting model is fairly low – 65 –, which actually reflects the fact that this corpus contains many fixed expressions (e.g pursuant to standing order).",
        "The inverted translation model we used is an IBM2-like model: 10 iterations of IBM1-training were run (reducing the perplexity of the training corpus from 7776 to 90), followed by 10 iterations of IBM2-training (yielding a final perplexity of 54).",
        "We further reduced the number of transfer parameters (originally 34 969 331) by applying an algorithm described in Foster (2000); this algorithm basically filters in the pairs of words with the best gain, where gain is defined as the difference in perplexity – measured on a held-out corpus – of a model trained with this pair of words and a model trained without.",
        "In this experiment, we worked with a model containing exactly the first gain-ranked million parameters.",

        "(2001), one of a translator’s first tasks is often terminological research; and many translation companies employ specialized terminologists.",
        "Actually, aside from the infrequent cases where, in a given thematic context, a word is likely to have a clearly preferred translation (e.g. bill/facture vs bill/projet de loi), lexicons are often the only means for a user to influence the translation engine.",
        "Merging such lexicons at run time offers a complementary solution to those mentioned above and it should be a fruitful strategy in situations where terminological resources are not available at training time (which may often be the case).",

        "The approach we adopted consists in viewing a terminological lexicon as a set of constraints that are employed to reduce the search space.",
        "For instance, knowing that sniper is a sanctioned translation of tireur d’´elite, we may require that current hypotheses in the search space associate the target word sniper with the three source French words.",
        "In our implementation, we had to slightly modify the block diagram of Figure 1 in order to: 1) forbid a given word ei from being associated with a word belonging to a source terminological unit, if it is not sanctioned by the lexicon; and 2) add at any target position an hypothesis linking a target lexicon entry to its source counterpart.",

        "In a similar vein, Marcu (2001) investigated how to combine Example Based Machine Translation (EBMT) and SMT approaches.",
        "The author automatically derived from the Hansard corpus what he calls a translation memory: actually a collection of pairs of source and target word sequences that are in a translation relation according to the viterbi alignment run with an IBM4 model that was also trained on the Hansard corpus.",
        "This collection of phrases was then merged with a greedy statistical decoder to improve the overall performance of the system.",
        "What this study suggests is that translation memories collected from a given corpus can improve the performance of a statistical engine trained on the same corpus, which in itself is an interesting result.",
        "A very similar study but with weaker results is derscribed in (Langlais et al., 2000), in the framework of the TransType project.",
        "Besides the different metrics the authors used, the discrepancy in performance in these two studies may be explained by the nature of the test corpora used.",
        "The test corpus in the latter study was more representative of a real translation task, while the test corpus that Marcu used was a set of around 500 French sentences of no more than 10 words.",
        "Our present study is close in spirit to these last two, except that we do not attack the problem of automatically acquiring bilingual lexicons; instead, we consider it a part of the translator’s task to provide such lexicons.",
        "Actually, we feel this may be one of the only ways a user has of retaining some control over the engine’s output, a fact that professional translators seem to appreciate (Langlais et al., 2001).",
        "As a final remark, we want to stress that we see the present study as a first step toward the eventual unification of EBMT and SMT, and in this respect we agree with (Marcu, 2001).",
        "Potentially, of course, EBMT can offer much more than just a simple list of equivalences, like those we used in this study.",
