        "Named entity (NE) recognition is an important task for many natural language applications, such as Internet search engines, document indexing, information extraction and machine translation.",
        "Moreover, in oriental languages (such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean), NE recognition is even more important because it significantly affects the performance of word segmentation, the most fundamental task for understanding the texts in oriental languages.",
        "In this paper, a probabilistic verification model is designed for verifying the correctness of a named entity candidate.",
        "This model assesses the confidence level of a candidate not only according to the candidates structure but also according to its context.",
        "In our design, the clues for confidence measurement are collected from both positive and negative examples in the training data in a statistical manner.",
        "Experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves the F-measure of Chinese personal name recognition from 86.5% to 94.4%.",
        "Introduction Named entity (NE) recognition (or proper name recognition) is a task to find the entities of person, location, organization, date, time, percentage and monetary value in text documents.",
        "It is an important task for many natural language applications, such as Internet search engines, document indexing, information extraction and machine translation.",
        "Moreover, in oriental languages (such as Chinese, Japanese and Korean), NE recognition is even more important because it significantly affects the performance of word segmentation, the most fundamental task for understanding the texts in oriental languages.",
        "Therefore, a high-accuracy NE recognition method is highly demanded for most natural language applications in various languages.",
        "There are two major approaches to NE recognition: the handcrafted approach (Grish-man, 1995) and the statistical approach (Bikel, 1997; Chen, 1998; Yu, 1998).",
        "In the first approach, a system usually relies on a large number of handcrafted rules.",
        "This kind of systems can be rapid prototyped but are hard to scale up.",
        "In fact, there will be numerous exceptions for most handcrafted rules.",
        "It is generally expensive and impossible to code for every exception we can imagine, not to mention those exceptions we are not able to think of.",
        "Another serious problem with the handcrafted approach is that systems are hard to be ported across different domains and different languages.",
        "Porting a handcrafted system usually means rewriting all its rules.",
        "Therefore, the statistical approach is becoming more and more popular because of its cost-effectiveness in scaling up and porting systems.",
        "In general, the statistical approach to NE recognition can be viewed as a two-stage process.",
        "First, according to dictionaries and/or pattern matching rules, the input text is tokenized into tokens.",
        "Each token may be a word or an NE candidate which can consist of more than one word.",
        "Then, the most likely token sequence is selected according to a statistical model, such as Markov model (Bikel, 1997; Yu, 1998) or maximum entropy model (Borthwick, 1999).",
        "Although, the statistical NE recognition is much more scalable and portable, its performance is still not satisfactory.",
        "The insufficient cover-age/precision of pattern matching rules and unknown words are the major sources of errors.",
        "Furthermore, the role of the statistical model is to assess the relative possibilities of all possible token sequences and select the most probable one.",
        "The scores obtained from the statistical model can be used for a comparison of competing token sequences, but not for an assessment of the probability that a spotted named entity is correct.",
        "To reduce the recognition errors, we propose a probabilistic verification model to verify the correctness of a named entity.",
        "This model assesses the confidence level of a named entity candidate not only according to the candidates structure but also according to its contexts.",
        "In our design, the clues for confidence measurement are collected from both positive and negative examples in the training data.",
        "Therefore, the confidence measure has strong discriminant power for judging the correctness of a named entity.",
        "In the experiments of Chinese personal name recognition, the proposed verification model increases the F-measure from 86.5% to 94.4%, which corresponds to 58.5% error reduction rate, where error rate is defined as",
        "As mentioned before, there are several kinds of named entities, including person, location, organization, date, time, percentage and monetary value.",
        "In the following description, we use the task of verifying Chinese personal name as an example.",
        "However, our proposed method is also applicable on verifying other kinds of named entities in different languages.",
        "Before introducing our approach, we first describe the notations that will be used.",
        "In this proposal, a random variable is written with a boldface italic letter.",
        "An outcome of a random variable is written with the same italic letter but in normal face.",
        "For example, an outcome of the random variable o is denoted as o.",
        "If there is no confusion, we usually use P(o) to denote the probability P(o = o) .",
        "A symbol sequence x 1, , xn is denoted as x1 .",
        "Likewise, xY,l denotes the sequence xY ,1, \" ,xY,n .",
        "The task of verifying a named entity candidate is viewed as making an acceptance or rejection decision according to the text segment consisting of the candidate and its context.",
        "Without loss of generality, a text segment is",
        "considered as an outcome of the random vector O = [oi,i , oC,1,oR i The outcome of each random variable in O is one basic element of text.",
        "In Chinese, the basic elements of text are Chinese characters.",
        "However, in English, the basic elements are English words.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of a text segment in which the size of the candidate to be verified is 3 (i.e., consists of three Chinese characters) and the sizes of its left context and right context are set to 2 (i.e., two Chinese characters).",
        "Figure 2 depicts the flowchart of our verification approach.",
        "First, the candidate in the input text segment is parsed by a predefined grammar.",
        "If the candidate is ill-formed (i.e., fail",
        "to be parsed), it will be rejected immediately.",
        "Otherwise, the text segment is passed to the confidence measurement module to assess the confidence level that the candidate in the text segment is to be a named entity.",
