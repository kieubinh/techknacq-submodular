        "There is an increased amount of new terms that represent newly created concepts.",
        "Since existing term dictionaries usually do not meet the needs of specialists, automatic term extraction tools are indispensable for efficient term discovery and dynamic update of term dictionaries.",
        "However, automatic term recognition (ATR) is not the ultimate aim: terms recognised should be related to existing knowledge and/or to each other.",
        "This entails the fact that terms should be classified or clustered so that semantically similar terms are grouped together.",
        "Classification and/or clustering of terms are indispensable for improving information extraction, knowledge acquisition, and document categorisation.",
        "Classification can also be used for efficient term management and populating and updating existing ontologies in a consistent manner.",
        "Both classification and clustering methods are built on top of a specific similarity measure.",
        "The notion of term similarity has been defined and considered in different ways: terms can have functional and/or structural similarities, though they can be correlated by different relationships (Grefenstette (1994), Maynard and Ananiadou (2000)).",
        "In this paper we suggest a novel, domain-independent method for the automatic discovery of term similarities, which can serve as a basis for both classification and clustering of terms.",

        "In our approach, one can define which categories to instantiate and which to remove.",
