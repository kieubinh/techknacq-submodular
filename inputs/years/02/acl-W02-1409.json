        "This paper proposes a principled approach to analyzing Japanese compound nouns whose heads are deverbal nouns (henceforth deverbal compounds for succinctness), using the framework of lexical conceptual structure (LCS).",
        "Deverbal compounds constitute a major part of Japanese compound nouns, especially in technical terms where noun compounds are abundant; and to develop a method to deal with deverbal compounds is an essential element of developing a full-scale, high-performance compound noun analyzer.",
        "We focus on compounds with only two constituent words, as more complex compounds are basically constructed by the iteration of binary rules (Kageyama, 1999).",
        "1 For instance, the ratio of technical terms that contains deverbal nouns is 78% in a dictionary of information processing (Aiso, 1993) Deverbal nouns may behave as verbs, assigning thematic roles to the other noun constituent in a compound, or they may behave as nouns accepting a thematic role or modifying the other constituent.",
        "On this account, the relation between constituent words in a deverbal compound may be modification or adjunct relation (when the deverbal head functions as an ordinary noun), or it may be thematic role or internal argument relation (when the deverbal head takes a verbal role).",
        "Though there are various kinds of semantic relations that should be identified in compound nouns, the disambiguation of modification and internal argument is the first and essential element in compound noun analysis.",
        "For the analysis of deverbal compounds, we propose a method based on LCS (Jackendoff, 1990; Kageyama, 1996).",
        "We will show that, by adopting LCS-based approach, it is possible to disambiguate the relation between constituent words in deverbal compounds with high accuracy.",
        "As LCS gives a clear framework for describing verb semantics, the lexicon of deverbal nouns can be constructed consistently and is thus extendable to a large scale, which is another advantage of the LCS-based method.",
        "In the following, after briefly discussing the background and the overall framework of the approach, we sketch the basic idea of using LCS for the analysis of deverbal compounds.",
        "We will then elaborate our LCS system (TLCS) in section 4, noun classification in section 5, and procedure of analysis in section 6.",
        "In section 7, we will show the result of experimental evaluation, which is highly promising."

        "However existing LCS frameworks can not be applied to the analysis of compounds straightforwardly because they do not give restriction rules nor extensive semantic predicates for LCS.",
