        "In Information Retrieval (IR), text categorization and clustering, documents are usually indexed and represented by domain terminology: terms which are particular to the domain/topic of a document.",
        "However, when documents must be retrieved or categorized according to criteria which do not correspond to the domains, such as genre (text style) (Kessler et al., 1997; Finn et al., 2002) or subjectivity (e.g. opinion vs. factual description) (Wiebe, 2000), we must use different, domain-independent features to index and represent documents.",
        "In those tasks, selection of the features is in fact one of the most critical factors which affect the performance of a system.",
        "Question type classification is one of such tasks, where categories are question types (e.g. 'how-to', 'why' and 'where').",
        "In recent years, question type has been successfully used in many Question-Answering (Q&A) systems for determining the kind of entity or concept being asked and extracting an appropriate answer (Voorhees, 2000; Harabagiu et al., 2000; Hovy et al., 2001).",
        "Just like genre, question types cut across domains; for instance, we can ask 'how-to' questions in the cooking domain, the legal domain etc.",
        "However, features that constitute question types are different from those used for genre classification (typically part-of-speech or meta-lingusitic features) in that features are strongly lexical due to the large amount of idiosyncrasy (keywords, idioms or syntactic constructions) that is frequently observed in question sentences.",
        "For example, we can easily think of question patterns such as \"What is the best way to ..\" and \"What do I have to do to ..\".",
        "In this regard, terms which identify question type are considered to form a terminology of their own, which we define as question terminology.",
        "Terms in question terminology have some characteristics.",
        "First, they are mostly domain-independent, non-content words.",
        "Second, they include many closed-class words (such as interrogatives, modals and pronouns), and some open-class words (e.g. the noun \"way\" and the verb \"do\").",
        "In a way, question terminology is a complement of domain terminology.",
        "Automatic extraction of question terminology is a rather difficult task, since question terms are mixed in with content terms.",
        "Another complicating factor is paraphrasing – there are many ways to ask the same question.",
        "For example,",
        "- \"How can I clean teapots?\" - \"In what way can we clean teapots?\" - \"What is the best way to clean teapots?\" - \"What method is used for cleaning teapots?\" - \"How do I go about cleaning teapots?\"",
        "In this paper, we present the results of our investigation on how to automatically extract question terminology from a corpus of questions and represent them for the purpose of classifying by question type.",
        "It is an extension of our previous work (Tomuro and Lytinen, 2001), where we compared automatic and manual techniques to select features from questions, but only (stemmed) words were considered for features.",
        "The focus of the current work is to investigate the kind(s) of features, rather than selection techniques, which are best suited for representing questions for classification.",
        "Specifically, from a large dataset of questions, we automatically extracted two sets of features: one set consisting of terms (i.e., lexical features) only, and another set consisting of a mixture of terms and semantic concepts (i.e., semantic features).",
        "Our particular interest is to see whether or not semantic concepts can enhance the representation of strongly lexical nature of question sentences.",
        "To this end, we apply two machine learning algorithms (C5.0 (Quinlan, 1994) and PEBLS (Cost and Salzberg, 1993)), and compare the classification accuracy produced for the two feature sets.",
        "The results show that there is no significant increase by either algorithm by the addition of semantic features.",
        "The original motivation behind our work on question terminology was to improve the retrieval accuracy of our system called FAQFinder (Burke et al., 1997; Lytinen and Tomuro, 2002).",
        "FAQFinder is a web-based, natural language Q&A system which uses Usenet Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) files to answer users' questions.",
        "Figures 1 and 2 show an example session with FAQFinder.",
        "First, the user enters a question in natural language.",
        "The system then searches the FAQ files for questions that are similar to the user's.",
        "Based on the results of the search, FAQFinder displays a maximum of 5 FAQ questions which are ranked the highest by the system's similarity measure.",
        "Currently FAQFinder incorporates question type as one of the four metrics in measuring the similarity between the user's question and FAQ questions.)",
        "In the present implementation, the system uses a small set of manually selected words to determine the type of a question.",
        "The goal of our work here is to derive optimal features which would produce improved classification accuracy.",
        "2 Question Types In our work, we defined 12 question types below.",
        "Descriptive definitions of these types are found in (Tomuro and Lytinen, 2001).",
        "Table 1 shows example FAQ questions which we had used to develop the question types.",
        "Note that",
        "our question types are general question categories.",
        "They are aimed to cover a wide variety of questions entered by the FAQFinder users.",
        "3 Selection of Feature Sets In our current work, we utilized two feature sets: one set consisting of lexical features only (LEX), and another set consisting of a mixture of lexical features and semantic concepts (LEXSEM).",
        "Obviously, there are many known keywords, idioms and fixed expressions commonly observed in question sentences.",
        "However, categorization of some of our 12 question types seem to depend on open-class words, for instance, \"What does mpg mean?\" (DEF) and \"What does Belgium import and export?\" (REF).",
        "To distinguish those types, semantic features seem effective.",
        "Semantic features could also be useful as back-off features since they allow for generalization.",
        "For example, in WordNet (Miller, 1990), the noun \"know-how\" is encoded as a hypernym of \"method\", \"methodology\", \"solution\" and \"technique\".",
        "By selecting such abstract concepts as semantic features, we can cover a variety of paraphrases even for fixed expressions, and supplement the coverage of lexical features.",
        "We selected the two feature sets in the following two steps.",
        "In the first step, using a dataset of 5105 example questions taken from 485 FAQ files/domains, we first manually tagged each question by question type, and then automatically derived the initial lexical set and initial semantic set.",
        "Then in the second step, we refined those initial sets by pruning irrelevant features and derived two subsets: LEX from the initial lexical set and LEXSEM from the union of lexical and semantic sets.",
        "To evaluate various subsets tried during the selection steps, we applied two machine learning algorithms: C5.0 (the commercial version of C4.5 (Quinlan, 1994), available at http://www.rulequest.com), a decision tree classifier; and PEBLS (Cost and Salzberg, 1993), a k-nearest neighbor algorithm.2 We also measured the classification accuracy by a procedure we call domain cross-validation (DCV).",
        "DCV is a variation of the standard cross-validation (CV) where the data is partitioned according to domains instead of random 2W e used k = 3 and majority voting scheme for all experiments in our current work.",
        "choice.",
        "To do a k-fold DCV on a set of examples from n domains, the set is first broken into k non-overlapping blocks, where each block contains examples exactly from m = n k domains.",
        "Then in each fold, a classifier is trained with (k – 1) * m domains and tested on examples from m unseen domains.",
        "Thus, by observing the classification accuracy of the target categories using DCV, we can measure the domain transferability: how well the features extracted from some domains transfer to other domains.",
        "Since question terminology is essentially domain-independent, DCV is a better evaluation measure than CV for our purpose."

        "The initial lexical set was obtained by ordering the words in the dataset by their Gain Ratio scores, then selecting the subset which produced the best classification accuracy by C5.0 and PEBLS.",
        "Gain Ratio (GR) is a metric often used in classification systems (notably in C4.5) for measuring how well a feature predicts the categories of the examples.",
        "GR is a normalized version of another metric called Information Gain (IG), which measures the informativeness of a feature by the number of bits required to encode the examples if they are partitioned into two sets, based on the presence or absence of the feature.3 Let C denote the set of categories cl, .., cm for which the examples are classified (i.e., target categories).",
        "Given a collection of examples S, the Gain Ratio of a feature A, GR(S, A), is defined as: GR(S, A) – IG(S, A) SI(S, A) where IG(S, A) is the Information Gain defined to be:",
        "and SI(S, A) is the Splitting Information defined to be:",
        "Then, features which yield high GR values are good predictors.",
        "In previous work in text categorization, GR (or IG) has been shown to be one of the most effective methods for reducing dimensions (i.e., words to represent each text) (Yang and Pedersen, 1997).",
        "Here in applying GR, there was one issue we had to consider: how to distinguish content words from non-content words.",
        "This issue arose from the uneven distribution of the question types in the dataset.",
        "Since not all question types were represented in every domain, if we chose question type as the target category, features which yield high GR values might include some domain-specific words.",
        "In effect, good predictors for our purpose are words which predict question types very well, but do not predict domains.",
        "Therefore, we defined the GR score of a word to be the combination of two values: the GR value when the target category was question type, minus the GR value when the target category was domain.",
        "We computed the (modified) GR score for 1485 words which appeared more than twice in the dataset, and applied C5.0 and PEBLS.",
        "Then we gradually reduced the set by taking the top n words according to the GR scores and observed changes in the classification accuracy.",
        "Figure 3 shows the result.",
        "The evaluation was done by using the 5-fold DCV, and the accuracy percentages indicated in the figure were an average of 3 runs.",
        "The best accuracy was achieved by the top 350 words by both algorithms; the remaining words seemed to have caused overfitting as the accuracy showed slight decline.",
        "Thus, we took the top 350 words as the initial lexical feature set."

        "The initial semantic set was obtained by automatically selecting some nodes in the Word-Net (Miller, 1990) noun and verb trees.",
        "For each question type, we chose questions of certain structures and applied a shallow parser to extract nouns and/or verbs which appeared at a specific position.",
        "For example, for all question types (except for YNQ), we extracted the head noun from questions of the form \"What is NP ..?\".",
        "Those nouns are essentially the denominalization of the question type.",
        "The nouns extracted included \"way\", \"method\", \"procedure\", \"process\" for the type PRC, \"reason\", \"advantage\" for RSN, and \"organization\", \"restaurant\" for ENT.",
        "For the types DEF and MNR, we also extracted the main verb from questions of the form \"How/What does NP V ..?\".",
        "Such verbs included \"work\", \"mean\" for DEF, and \"affect\" and \"form\" for MNR.",
        "Then for the nouns and verbs extracted for each question type, we applied the sense disambiguation algorithm used in (Resnik, 1997) and derived semantic classes (or nodes in the WordNet trees) which were their abstract generalization.",
        "For each word in a set, we traversed the WordNet tree upward through the hypernym links from the nodes which corresponded to the first two senses of the word, and assigned each ancestor a value which equaled to the inverse of the distance (i.e., the number of links traversed) from the original node.",
        "Then we accumulated the values for all ancestors, and selected ones (excluding the top nodes) whose value was above a threshold.",
        "For example, the set of nouns extracted for the type PRC were \"know-how\" (an ancestor of \"way\" and \"method\") and \"activity\" (an ancestor of \"procedure\" and \"process\").",

        "It was done by taking the features which appeared in more than half of the decision trees induced by C5.0 during the iterations of DCV.4 Then we applied the same procedure to the initial lexical set (350 features) and derived LEX.",
        "Now both sets were (sub) optimal subsets, with which we could make a fair comparison.",
        "There were 117 features/words and 164 features selected for LEX and LEXSEM respectively.",
        "Our refinement method is similar to (Cardie, 1993) in that it selects features by removing ones that did not appear in a decision tree.",
        "The difference is that, in our method, each decision tree is induced from a strict subset of the domains of the dataset.",
        "Therefore, by taking the intersection of multiple such trees, we can effectively extract features that are domain-independent, thus transferable to other unseen domains.",
        "Our method is also computationally",
        "less expensive and feasible, given the number of features expected to be in the reduced set (over a hundred by our intuition), than other feature subset selection techniques, most of which require expensive search through model space (such as wrapper approach (John et al., 1994)).",
        "Table 2 shows the classification accuracy measured by DCV for the training set.",

        "This result agreed with the findings in (Cardie, 1993), and confirmed that LEX and LEXSEM were indeed (sub) optimal.",

        "This means the semantic features did not help improve the classification accuracy.",

        "However in most of those examples, key terms were already represented by lexical features, thus semantic features did not add any more information to help determine the question type.",
