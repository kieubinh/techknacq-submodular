        "Paraphrasing research has attracted increased attention, and the work in this field has become more active recently.",
        "Paraphrasing involves various types of transformations of expressions into the same language, and thus there is generally no all-purpose design and information resource.",
        "Among the many types of paraphrasing, a handwritten construction may be best for syntactic paraphrasing knowledge or knowledge of functional words because the number of resulting phenomena can be counted.",
        "On the other hand, we need to acquire lexical paraphrasing knowledge automatically or efficiently, since there is an enormous number of phenomena observed for an enormous number of content words.",
        "Some works, such as Barzilay and McKeown (2001), have acquired paraphrasing knowledge automatically.",
        "All of those works found differences from a paraphrase corpus, where each expression is aligned to another expression (or more) with the same meaning and in the same language.",
        "Unfortunately, there is no paraphrase corpus widely available except for a few collections such as those prepared by Shirai et al.",
        "(2001) and Zhang et al.",
        "(2001).",
        "Most of those works collected paraphrase corpora by employing special situations, such as multiple news resources from the same events or multiple translations of the same (and well-known) story in other languages.",
        "However, since these situations seem to be really special, we believe that the collection of many paraphrase corpora in the near future is quite hopeless.",
        "Consequently, it is necessary to conduct a feasibility study on collecting various kinds of paraphrase knowledge from non-paraphrase corpora, particularly from raw text corpora.",
        "Although we have already reported extracting paraphrasing knowledge of Japanese noun modifiers from a raw corpus (Kataoka et al., 1999), we need to explore other types of expressions.",
        "With this motivation, we have attempted to acquire paraphrasing knowledge on content words, mainly nouns and verbs.",
        "As a knowledge source, we use newspaper articles collected over one year in text format, which is regarded as the most generally used corpus.",
        "In this trial, we propose the following two principles of acquisition:",
        "• Conditions for applying each type of paraphrasing knowledge should be obtained.",
        "• Paraphrasing knowledge should have directionality.",
        "In other words, all of the paraphrasing patterns obtained by the conventional methods seem to have been applied unconditionally, that is, conventional approaches tend to target only unconditional patterns.",
        "However, most paraphrasing phenomena depend on their context; paraphrasing can be possible only if a paraphrased expression fits the context.",
        "Moreover, directionality of the rules is an important issue for paraphrasing, although no other works have discussed this.",
        "Despite the existence of synonymy, even if expression E1 can be replaced by expression E2, it is unsure whether E2 can be paraphrased by using E1.",
        "We discuss this feature in the experiments."

        "Paraphrasability is the degree of replacability for two expressions E1 and E2, which are regarded as different from each other in some sense.",
        "This definition implies the notion that E1 should not be judged as the same (or similar) as E2 in the sense of meaning.",
        "Of course, similarity of meaning and paraphrasability are very closely correlated with each other, and Kurohashi and Sakai (1999) utilize this feature to paraphrase Japanese expressions (in order to comprehend them more easily).",
        "They use a Japanese dictionary written for humans (or more precisely, children) to replace a part of the target expression with a different one by judging its local context computed by a thesaurus.",
        "We propose that replacability (obtained by the corpus, for example) is a more important factor in judging the paraphrasability of expressions than their meaning as defined in a dictionary.",
        "For example, words used only in some special situations, such as for children or in ancient documents, should not be used in a paraphrase even though it has synonymy.",
        "On the contrary, even if synonymy is not satisfied, we still focus on expressions that are replaceable.",
        "Hypernymy is one example of this.",
        "A hypernym is not a paraphrase in a strict sense due to the loss of information.",
        "However, this kind of paraphrasing is still useful from the engineering point of view.",
        "For instance, these loose (and therefore many) paraphrases are more effective in the case of reluctant processing, where we must necessarily change an expression for various reasons such as our requirement in paraphrase-based machine translation (Yamamoto, 2002).",
        "Moreover, this kind of paraphrase loses nothing when it is used as anaphora or when it is trivial and out of major interest in the context used.",

It is defined as either r _* c (something depends on c by r) or r +– c (c depends on something by r).",
