        "The question of how to test natural language analysis systems has been central to all natural language work in the past two decades.",
        "It is a difficult question, for which researchers have found only partial answers.",
        "The most common answer is component testing, where the component is compared against a standard of goodness, usually the Penn Treebank for English (Marcus et al., 1993), allowing a numerical score of precision and recall (e.g. Collins, 1997).",
        "Such methods have limitations, however, and need to be supplemented by additional methods.",
        "One limitation is the availability of annotated corpora, which do not exist for all languages.",
        "Secondly, comparison to an annotated corpus can only measure how well a system produces the kind of analysis for which the corpus is annotated, e.g. labeled bracketing of surface syntax.",
        "Evaluation of analysis of deeper, more semantically descriptive, levels requires additional annotated corpora, which may not exist.",
        "A more fundamental limitation of such methods is that they measure the goodness of a grammar without taking into account what the grammar is good for.",
        "This limitation is overcome, we claim, only by measuring the goodness of a grammar by its success in real-world applications.",
        "We propose that machine translation (MT) is a good application to evaluate and drive the development of analysis components when the transfer component is based on linguistic modules.",
        "Multilingual applications such as MT allow evaluation of system components that overcomes the limitations mentioned above, and therefore serves as a useful complement to other evaluation techniques.",
        "Another significant advantage to using MT as a testbed for the analysis system is that it prioritizes analysis problems, highlighting those problems that have the greatest negative effect on translation output.",
        "In this paper, we give an overview of NLPWin, a multi-application natural language analysis and generation system under development at Microsoft Research (Jensen et al., 1993; Gamon et al., 1997; Heidorn 2000), incorporating analysis systems for 7 languages (Chinese, English, French, German, Japanese, Korean and Spanish).",
        "Our discussion focuses on a description of the three components of the analysis system (called sketch, portrait and logical form) with a particular emphasis on the logical form derived as the end-product, which serves as the medium for transfer in our MT system.",
        "We also give an overview of the architecture of the MSR-MT system, and of the evaluation we use to measure correctness of the translations.",
        "We demonstrate the correlation between the scores assigned to translation outputs and the correctness of the analysis, using as illustration two language-pairs at different stages of development: Spanish-English (SE) translation, as a testbed for the Spanish analysis system, and French-English (FE) translation, as a testbed for the French analysis system.",
        "2 Overview of the analysis component of NLPWin Analysis produces three representations for the input sentence: sketch, portrait and logical form1.",
        "Sketch is the initial tree representation for the sentence, along with its associated attribute-value structure.",
        "An example of sketch is given in Figure 1, which shows the sketch tree for sentence (1).",
        "Ce format est pris en charge par Windows 2000 this format is taken in charge by Windows 2000 ‘This format is supported by Windows 2000’",
        "Attachment sites for post-modifiers are not determined in sketch.",
        "In most cases, the information available as the syntactic tree is built is not sufficient to determine where e.g. prepositional phrases or relative clauses should be attached.",
        "Post-modifiers are thus systematically attached to the closest possible attachment site, and reattached, if necessary, by the reattachment module, a set of heuristic rules.",
        "Reattachment rules apply to the sketch to produce the portrait; the portrait analysis of (1) is given in Figure 2, where the PP expressing the agent of the passive construction, originally attached to PP1 in sketch (see Figure 1) has been reattached at the sentence level.",
        "The portrait is the input to the computation of the logical form (LF), a labeled directed unordered graph representing the deep syntactic relations among the content words of the sentence (i.e., basic predicate-argument structure), along with some semantic information, such as functional relations expressed by certain prepositions.2 At this level, the difference between active and passive constructions is normalized; control relations and long-distance dependencies, such as subjects of infinitives, arguments associated with gaps, etc., are resolved.",
        "The LF of (1) is shown in Figure 3.",
        "Note that the surface subject of the passive is rendered as the Dobj (deep object) in LF, and the par-phrase as the Dsub (deep subject).",
        "Modifications to any of the analysis components are tested using monolingual regression files containing thousands of analyzed sentences; differences caused by the modification are examined manually by the linguist responsible for the change (Suzuki, 2002).",
        "This process serves as an initial screening to ensure that modifications to the analysis have the desired effect."

        "The evaluation we are discussing in this section was performed in January 2002, at the beginning of our effort on the Hansard corpus.",
        "The evaluation was performed on a corpus of 250 sentences, of which 55.6% (139 sentences) were assigned a score of 2 or lower, 30.4% (76 sentences) were assigned a score greater than 2 but not greater than 3, and 14% (35 sentences) were assigned a score greater than 3.",
        "Examination of French sentences receiving low-score translations led to the identification of some classes of analysis problems, such as the following:",
        "- misidentification of vocatives - clefts not represented correctly - mis-analysis of ce qui / ce que free relatives - bad representation of complex inversion (pronoun-doubling of inverted subject) - no treatment of reflexives",
        "- fitted parses (i.e., not spanning the sentence) Most of the problematic structures are characteristic of spoken language as opposed to more formal, written styles (vocatives, clefts, direct questions), and had not been encountered in our previous work, which had involved mostly translation of technical manuals.",
        "Other problems (free relatives, reflexives) are analysis issues that we had not yet addressed.",
        "Fitted parses are parses that do not span the whole sentence, but are pieced together by the parser from partial parses; fitted parses usually result in poor translations.",
        "Examples of translations together with their score are given in Table I.",
        "The source sentences are the French sentences, the reference sentence is the human translation to which the translation is compared by the evaluators, and the translation is the output of MSR-MT.",
        "Each of the three categories considered above is illustrated by an example.",
        "Sentence (2) (with a score of 1.5) is a direct question with complex inversion and the doubled subject typical of that construction.",
        "In the LF for (2), les ministres des finances is analyzed as a modifier, because the verb réunir already has a subject, the pronoun ils ‘they’.",
        "There are a couple of additional problems with this sentence: si is analyzed as the adverb meaning ‘so’ instead of as the conjunction meaning ‘if’, and a direct question is analyzed as a complement clause; the sketch and LF analyses of this sentence are given in the Appendix..",
        "The MSR-MT translation of this sentence has a very low score, reflecting the severity of the analysis problems.",
        "The two other sentences, on the other hand, do not have analysis problems: the poor translation of (3) (score 2.16) is caused by bad alignment (droit translates as right instead of law), and the translation of (4) (score 3) is not completely fluent, but this is due to an English generation problem, rather than to a French analysis problem.",
        "This last sentence is the most correct with appropriate lexical items and has the highest score of the three.",
        "Of the 139 sentences with score 2 or lower, 73% were due to analysis problems, and 24% to alignment problems.",
        "Most of the rest had bugs related to the learned dictionary.",
        "There were a few cases of very free translations, where the reference translation was very far from the French sentence, and our translation, based on the source sentence, was therefore penalized.",
        "These figures show that, at this stage of development of our system, most of the problems in translation come from analysis.",
        "Translation can be improved by tackling analysis problems exhibited by the lowest scoring sentences, and, conversely, analysis issues can be discovered by looking at the sentences with the lowest translation score.",
