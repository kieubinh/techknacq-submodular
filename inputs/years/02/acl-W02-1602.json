        "Creating and maintaining aligned multilingual documents is a growing necessity.",
        "In the current practice, a multilingual document consists in many parallel monolingual files, which may be technical documentation as well as help files, message files, or simply thematic information put on the web and intended for a multilingual audience (medicine, cooking, travel...).",
        "The task is difficult even for a document managed in a centralized manner.",
        "Ususally, it is first created in a unique source language, and translated into several target languages.",
        "There must be a way to keep trak of A. Assimi [1, 2] has shown how to \"realign\" parallel decentralized documents and apply the methodology sketched above.",
        "However, in both cases, human translators have to retranslate the modified or new source segments, or to revise them if they are retranslated by a quality MT system.",
        "Contrary to what is often said, quality MT exists, but for specific contexts only.",
        "(See [14]).",
        "What we would like to do is to make it possible to share the revision work across languages, whatever the domain and the context.",
        "It is clearly impossible to reflect changes on a file in language L0 into files in L1,... Ln automatically and faithfully, without any intermediate structure to bridge the gap, because that would necessitate at least a perfect fine-grained aligner in case of changing articles or common nouns (provided the gender and number stay the ame in each Li version).",
        "In case of replacing a verb by another with a different valency frame in a target Li, the sentence in Li would have to be reanalyzed, transformed accordingly, and regenerated without introducing any new error or imprecision, thereby keeping the manual improvements coming from previous manual revisions.",
        "Or we would need a more than perfect MT system, namely one which would be able to analyze the changed utterance in L0, and to transfer and generate it into a sentence of Li as close as possible as the previous sentence in Li, which again could have been improved manually before.",
        "The best and simplest way to go seems to use some formalized interlingua IL and to",
        "(1) reflect the modifications from L0 to the IL, (2) regenerate into L1,... Ln from the IL.",
        "We should also allow for direct manual improvements, considering that the IL form will not always be present, or not always improvable enough for lack of expressivity, or that generators will never be perfect.",
        "We choose UNL [3, 4, 10, 11 ] as our IL of choice for various reasons:",
        "(1) it is specifically designed for linguistic and semantic machine processing, (2) it derives with many improvements from H.Uchida's pivot used in ATLAS-II (Fujitsu) [13], still evaluated as the best quality MT system for English-Japanese, with a large coverage (586,000 lexical entries in each language), (3) participants of the UNL project1 have built \"deconverters\" from UNL into about 12 languages, and at least the Arabic, Indonesian, Italian, French, Russian, Spanish, and Thai",
        "deconverters were accessible for experimentation through a web interface at the time of writing,",
        "(4) although formal, UNL graphs (see below) are quite easy to understand with little training and may be presented in a \"localized\" way to naive users by translating UNL symbols (semantic relations, attributes) and lexemes (UWs) into symbols and lexemes of their language, (5) the UNL project has defined a format embed",
        "ded in html for files containing a complete multilingual document aligned at the level of utterances, and produced a \"visualizer\" transforming a UNL file into as many html files as languages, and sending them to any web browser.",
        "The UNL representation of a text is a list of \"semantic graphs\", each expressing the meaning of a natural language utterance.",
        "Nodes contain lexical units and attributes, arcs bear semantic relations.",
        "Connex subgraphs may be defined as \"scopes\", so that a UNL graph may be a hypergraph.",
        "The lexical units, called Universal Words (UW), represent (sets of) word meanings, something less ambitious than concepts.",
        "Their denotations are built to be intuitively understood by developers knowing English, that is, by all developers in NLP.",
        "AUW is an English term or special symbol (number...) possibly completed by semantic restrictions : the UW \"process\" represents all word meanings of that lemma, seen as citation form (verb or noun here), and \"process(icl>do, agt>person)\" covers only the meanings of processing, working on, etc.",
        "The attributes are the (semantic) number, genre, time, aspect, modality, etc., and the 40 or so semantic relations are traditional \"deep cases\" such as agent, (deep) object, location, goal, time, etc.",
        "One way of looking at a UNL graph corresponding to an utterance in language L is to say that it represents the abstract structure of an equivalent English utterance \"seen from L\", that is, where semantic attributes not necessarily expressed in L may be absent (e.g., aspect coming from French, determination or number from Japanese, etc.).",
        "We will first present scenarios of increasing internal complexity for the situation where somebody reads a UNL document in her language, corrects it, and wants the corrections to carry over to the corresponding fragment in other languages.",
        "We will then study more precisely the correspondence between a text in language L0 and its representation in UNL, and show the advantage of breaking it into 3 parts: text morpho-syntactic lattice or chart abstract \"UNL-tree\" UNL graph.",
        "Finally, we present the current status of this work: an experimentation web site, a method to establish the second part of the correspondence, and related research."
