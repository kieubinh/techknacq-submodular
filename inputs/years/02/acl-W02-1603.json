        "Finally, we started the system evaluation with 322 randomly selected sentences on the Future Magazine bilingual corpus and the system yielded 59.87% and 83.08% translation accuracy for the best case and the worse case based on 90.1% average precision of the parser."

        "Information comprehension of Thai people should not be only limited in Thai; in contrast, it should also include a considerably large amount of information sources from foreign countries.",
        "Insufficient basic language knowledge, a result of inadequate distribution in the past, conversely, is the major obstruction for information comprehension.",
        "There are presently several English-Thai MT systems – for instance, Parsit (Sornlertlamvanich, 2000), Plae Thai, and AgentDict.",
        "The first one applies semantic transfer model via the methodology similar to the lexical functional grammar (Kaplan et al., 1989) and it is develop with the intention of public use.",
        "The latter two implicitly apply the direct transfer model with the purpose of commercial use.",
        "Nonetheless, by limited vocabularies and translation rules, the users must accept the only one translation result that is occasionally semantically divergent or ungrammatical.",
        "Due to the according reason, we initiated this project in order to relieve language problem of Thai people.",
        "In this project, we develop a semi-automatic translation system to assist them to translate English documents into Thai.",
        "For this paper, the term semi-automatic translation means the sentence translation with user interaction to manually resolve structural and semantic ambiguities during translation period.",
        "Despite manual disambiguation, we provided a simple statistical disambiguation in order to preselect the most possible translation for each source language sentence, though.",
        "The automatic semantic disambiguation can be thus excluded with this approach."

        "We can classify current translation approaches into three major models as follows – structural transfer, semantic transfer, and lexical transfer (Trujillo, 1999).",
        "• Structural transfer: this methodology heavily depends on syntactic analysis (say, grammar).",
        "Translation transfers the source language structures into the target language.",
        "This method is established by the assumption that every language in the world uses syntactic structure in order to represent the meaning of sentences.",
        "• Semantic transfer: this methodology heavily depends on semantic analysis (say, meaning).",
        "This model applies syntactic analysis as well.",
        "On the contrary to the structural transfer, a source language sentence is not immediately translated into the target language, but it is first translated into semantic representation (Inter-lingua is mostly referred), and afterwards into the target language.",
        "This method is established by the assumption that every language in the world describes the same world; hence, there exists the semantic representation for every language.",
        "• Lexical transfer: this methodology heav",
        "ily depends on lexicon ordering patterns.",
        "The translation occurs at the level of morpheme.",
        "The translation process transfers a set of morpheme in the source language into that of the target language.",
        "In this project, we decided to utilize the structural transfer approach, since it is more appropriate for rapid development.",
        "In addition, semantic representation that covers every language is now still under research."

        "By the reason of the ambiguities of natural languages, a sentence may be translated or interpreted into many senses.",
        "An example of structural ambiguity is “I saw a girl in the park with a telescope.” This sentence can be grammatically interpreted into four senses as follows.",
        "• I saw a girl, to whom a telescope belonged, who was in the park.",
        "• I used a telescope to see a girl, who was in the park.",
        "• I was in the park and seeing a girl, to whom a telescope belonged.",
        "• I was in the park and using a telescope to see a girl.",
        "Furthermore, an example of word-sense ambiguity is “I live near the bank.” The noun bank can be semantically interpreted into at least two senses as follows.",
        "• n. a financial institution that accepts deposits and channels the money into lending activities • n. sloping land (especially the slope beside a body of water)",
        "In order to resolve structural ambiguity, we apply the concept of the statistical machine translation approach (Brown et al., 1990).",
        "We apply the Maximum-Entropy-Inspired Parser (Charniak, 1999) (so-called Charniak Parser) to analyze and determine the appropriate grammatical structure of an English sentence.",
        "From (Charniak, 1999), Charniak presented that the parser uses the Penn Tree Bank tag set (Marcus et al., 1994) (or PTB in abbreviation) as a grammatical structure representation, and it yielded 90.1% average precision for sentences of length 40 or less, and 89.5% for sentences of length 100 and less.",
        "Moreover, with the intention to resolve word-sense ambiguity, we embedded a numerical statistic value with each translation rule (including lexical transfer rule) with the major aim of assisting to select the best translation parse tree from every possibility (Charniak, 1997).",
