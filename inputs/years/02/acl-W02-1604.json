        "In the wake of the pioneering work of Nagao (1984), Brown et al.",
        "(1990) and Sato and Nagao (1990), Machine Translation (MT) research has increasingly focused on the issue of how to acquire translation knowledge from aligned parallel texts.",
        "While much of this research effort has focused on acquisition of correspondences between individual lexical items or between unstructured strings of words, closer attention has begun to be paid to the learning of structured phrasal units: Yamamoto and Matsumoto (2000), for example, describe a method for automatically extracting correspondences between dependency relations in Japanese and English.",
        "Similarly, Imamura (2001a, 2001b) seeks to match corresponding Japanese and English phrases containing information about hierarchical structures, including partially completed parses.",
        "Yamamoto and Matsumoto (2000) explicitly assume that dependency relations between words will generally be preserved across languages.",
        "However, when languages are as different as Japanese and English with respect to their syntactic and informational structures, grammatical or dependency relations may not always be preserved: the English sentence “the network failed” has quite a different grammatical structure from its Japanese translation equivalent ネ �y N as 発 ‘a defect arose in the network.’ One issue for example-based MT, then, is to capture systematic divergences through generic learning applicable to multiple language pairs.",
        "In this presentation we describe the MSR-MT English-Japanese system, an example-based MT system that learns structured phrase-sized translation units.",
        "Unlike the systems discussed in Yamamoto and Matsumoto (2000) and Imamura (2001a, 2001b), MSR-MT places the locus of translation knowledge acquisition at a greater level of abstraction than surface relations, pushing it into a semantically-motivated layer called LOGICAL FORM (LF) (Heidorn 2000; Campbell & Suzuki 2002a, 2002b).",
        "Abstraction has the effect of neutralizing (or at least minimizing) differences in word order and syntactic structure, so that mappings between structural relations associated with lexical items can readily be acquired within a general MT architecture.",
        "In Section 1 below, we present an overview of the characteristics of the system, with special reference to English-Japanese MT.",
        "Section 2 discusses a class of structures learned through phrase alignment, Section 3 presents the results of comparative evaluation, and Section 4 some factors that contributed to the evaluation results.",
        "Section 5 addresses directions for future work."

        "The MSR-MT English-Japanese system is a hybrid example-based machine translation system that employs handcrafted broad-coverage augmented phrase structure grammars for parsing, and statistical and heuristic techniques to capture translation knowlege and for transfer between languages.",
        "The parsers are general purpose: the English parser, for example, forms the core of the grammar checkers used in Microsoft Word (Heidorn 2000).",
        "The Japanese grammar utilizes much of the same codebase, but contains language-specific grammar rules and additional features owing to the need for word-breaking in Japanese (Suzuki et al.",
        "2000; Kacmarcik et al.",
        "2000).",
        "These parsers are robust in that if the analysis grammar fails to find an appropriate parse, it outputs a best-guess “fitted” parse.",
        "System development is not confined to English-Japanese: MSR-MT is part of a broader natural language processing project involving three Asian languages (Japanese, Chinese, and Korean) and four European languages (English, French, German, and Spanish).",
        "Development of the MSR-MT systems proceeds more or less simultaneously across these languages and in multiple directions, including Japanese-English.",
        "The Spanish-English version of MSR-MT has been described in Richardson et al.",
        "2001a, Richardson et al. 2001b, and the reader is referred to these papers for more information concerning algorithms employed during phrase alignment.",

        "The graphs are simplified for expository purposes.",
        "Although our hypothesis is that equivalent sentences in two languages will tend to resemble each other at LF more than they do in the surface parse, we do not adopt a naïve reductionism that would attempt to make LFs completely identical.",

        "In the next step, an LF alignment algorithm is used to match source language and target language LFs at the sub-sentence level.",
        "The LF alignment algorithm first establishes tentative lexical correspondences between nodes in the source and target LFs on the basis of lexical matching over dictionary information and approximately 31,000 “word associations,” that is, lexical mappings extracted from the training corpora using statistical techniques based on mutual information (Moore 2001).",
        "From these possible lexical correspondences, the algorithm uses a small grammar of (language-pair-independent) rules to align LF nodes on lexical and structural principles.",
        "The aligned LF pairs are then partitioned into smaller aligned LF segments, with individual node mappings captured in a relationship we call “sublinking.” Finally, the aligned LF segments are filtered on the basis of frequency, and compiled into a database known as a Mindnet.",

        "A total of 238 English-Japanese sentence pairs were randomly extracted from held-out software manual data of the same kinds used for training the system.",
        "The Japanese sentences, which had been translated by human translators, were taken as reference sentences (and were assumed to be correct translations).",
        "The English sentences were then translated by the two MT systems into Japanese for blind evaluation performed by seven outside vendors unfamiliar with either system’s characteristics.",
        "No attempt was made to constrain or modify the English input sentences on the basis of length or other characteristics.",
        "Both systems provided a translation for each sentence.5 For each of the Japanese reference sentences, evaluators were asked to select which translation was closer to the reference sentence.",

        "If two translated sentences were considered equally good or bad in comparison",
        "to the reference, a value of 0 was assigned.",
        "On this metric, MSR-MT scored slightly worse than the comparison system rating of 0.015.",
        "At a two-way confidence measure of 0.16, the difference between the systems is statistically insignificant.",
        "By contrast, an earlier evaluation conducted in October 2001 yielded a score of 0.34 vis-à-vis the comparison system.",
        "In addition, the evaluators were asked to rate the translation quality on an absolute scale of 1 through 4, according to the following criteria:",
        "1.",
        "Unacceptable: Absolutely not comprehensible and/or little or no information transferred accurately.",
        "2.",
        "Possibly Acceptable: Possibly comprehensible (given enough context and/or time to work it out); some information transferred accurately.",
        "3.",
        "Acceptable: Not perfect, but definitely comprehensible, and with accurate transfer of all important information.",
        "4.",
        "Ideal: Not necessarily a perfect translation, but grammatically correct, and with all information accurately transferred.",
        "On this absolute scale, neither system performed exceptionally well: MSR-MT scored an average 2.25 as opposed to 2.32 for the comparison system.",
        "Again, the difference between the two is statistically insignificant.",
        "It should be added that the comparison presented here is not ideal, since MSR-MT was trained principally on technical manual sentences, while the comparison system was not specifically tuned to this corpus.",
        "Accordingly the results of the evaluation need to be interpreted narrowly, as demonstrating that: l A viable example-based English-Japanese MT system can be developed that applies general-purpose alignment rules to semantic representations; and l Given general-purpose grammars, a representation of what the sentence means, and suitable learning techniques, it is possible to achieve in a domain, results analogous with those of a mature commercial product, and within a relatively short time frame."

        "Table 2 shows the number of transfers per sentence and the number of LF nodes per transfer in versions of the system evaluated in October 2001 and May 2002.",
        "Not only is the MSR-MT finding more LF segments in the Mindnet, crucially the number of nodes transferred has also grown.",
        "An average of two connected nodes are now transferred with each LF segment, indicating that the system is increasingly learning its translation knowledge in terms of complex structures rather than simple lexical correspondences.",
        "It has been our experience that the greater MSR-MT’s reliance on the Mindnet, the better the quality of its output.",
        "Table 2 shows the sources of selected word classes in the two systems.",
        "Over time, reliance on the Mindnet has increased overall, while reliance on dictionary lookup has now diminished to the point where, in the case of content words, it should be possible to discard the handcrafted dictionary altogether and draw exclusively on the contextualized resources of the Mindnet and statistically-generated lexical data.",
        "Also striking in Table 2 is the gain shown in preposition handling: a majority of English prepositions are now being transferred only in the context of LF structures found in the Mindnet.",
        "The important observation underlying the gains shown in these tables is that they have primarily been obtained either as the result of LF improvements in English or Japanese (i.e., from better sentence analysis or LF construction), or as a result of generic improvements to the algorithms that map between LF segments (notably better coindexation and improved learning of mappings involving lexical attributes).",
        "In the latter case, although certain modifications may have been driven by phenomena observed between Japanese and English, the heuristics apply across all seven languages on which our group is currently working.",

        "Ultimately it is probably desirable that the system’s mean absolute score should approach 3 (Acceptable) within the training domain: this is a high quality bar that is not attained by off-the-shelf systems.",

        "Work to improve the quality of alignment and transfer is ongoing within our group.",
        "In addition to improvement of alignment itself, we are also exploring techniques to ensure that the transferred LF is consistent with known LFs in the target language, with the eventual goal of obviating the need for heuristic rules used in preprocessing generation.",

        "Our experience with English-Japanese example based MT suggests that the problem of MT among Asian languages may be recast as a problem of implementing a general representation of structured meaning across languages that neutralizes differences where possible, and where this is not possible, readily permits researchers to identify general-purpose techniques of bridging the disparities that are viable across multiple languages."
