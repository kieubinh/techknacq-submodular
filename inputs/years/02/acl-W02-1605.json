        "A rule-based approach is the first strategy pursued by research in the field of machine translation.",
        "Rules are written from linguistic knowledge by human.",
        "The strength is that it can deeply analyze in both syntax and semantic levels.",
        "However, the weak points of this model are 1) it requires much linguistic knowledge.",
        "2) it is impossible to write rules that cover all a language.",
        "In many years ago, a statistic-based and an example-based were proposed.",
        "These approaches do not require linguistic knowledge, but they need large size of bilingual corpus.",
        "A statistic-based approach uses statistic of bilingual corpus and language model.",
        "The advantage is that it may be able to produce suitable translations even if a given sentence is not similar to any sentences in a training corpus.",
        "In contrast, an example-based can produce appropriate translations in case of a given sentence must similar to any sentences in a training data.",
        "Nevertheless, a statistic-based approach cannot translate idioms and phrases that reflect long-distance dependency.",
        "To improve quality of a rule-based machine translation, we have to modify/add some generation rules or analysis rules.",
        "This method requires much linguistic knowledge and we cannot guarantee that accuracy will be better.",
        "For example, in case of modifying some rules, it does not only change incorrect sentences to correct sentences furthermore they may effect on correct sentences too.",
        "The common errors of machine translation can be classified into two main groups.",

        "At each step of learning procedure, the evolving tree is branched on the attribute that partitions the data items with the highest information gain.",
        "Branches will be added until all items in the training set are classified.",
        "To reduce the effect of overfitting, C4.5 prunes the entire decision tree constructed.",
        "It recursively examines each subtree to determine whether replacing it with a leaf or branch would reduce expected error rate.",
        "This pruning makes the decision tree better in dealing with the data different from training data.",
        "In C4.5 version 8, it provides the other technique, which is extended from C4.5 called C4.5rule.",
        "C4.5rule extracts production rules from an unpruned decision tree produced by C4.5, and then improves process by greedily deletes or adds single rules in an effort to reduce description length.",

        "A set-valued attribute is an attribute whose value is a set of strings.",
        "The primitive tests on a set-valued attribute As are of the form “v ∈ As”.",
