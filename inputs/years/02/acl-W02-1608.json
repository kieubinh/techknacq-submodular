        "One of the severest problems facing machine translation between Asian languages is the lack of suitable language resources.",
        "Even when word-lists or simple bilingual dictionaries exist, it is rare for them to include detailed information about the syntax and meaning of words.",
        "In this paper we present a method of adding new entries to a bilingual valency dictionary.",
        "New entries are based on existing entries, so have the same amount of detailed information.",
        "The method bootstraps from an initial hand built lexicon, and allows new entries to be added cheaply and effectively.",
        "Although we will use Japanese and English as examples, the algorithm is not tied to any particular language pair or dictionary.",
        "The core idea is to add new entries to the valency dictionary by using Japanese-English pairs from a plain bilingual dictionary (without detailed information about valency or selectional restrictions), and build new entries for them based on existing entries.",
        "It is well known that detailed information about verb valency (subcategorization) and selectional restrictions is useful both for monolingual parsing and selection of appropriate translations in machine translation.",
        "As well as being useful for resolving parsing ambiguities, verb valency information is particularly important for complicated processing such as identification and supplementation of zero pronouns.",
        "However, this information is not encoded in normal human-readable dictionaries, and is hard to enter manually.",
        "Shirai (1999) estimates that at least 27,000 valency entries are needed to cover around 80% of Japanese verbs in a typical newspaper, and we expect this to be true of any language.",
        "Various methods of creating detailed entries have been suggested, such as the extraction of candidates from corpora (Manning, 1993; Ut-suro et al., 1997; Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2001), and the automatic and semi-automatic induction of semantic constraints (Akiba et al., 2000).",
        "However, the automatic construction of monolingual entries is still far from reaching the quality of hand-constructed resources.",
        "Further, large-scale bilingual resources are still rare enough that it is much harder to automatically build bilingual entries.",
        "Our work differs from corpus-based work such as Manning (1993) or Kawahara and Kurohashi (2001) in that we are using existing lexical resources rather than a corpus.",
        "Thus our method will work for rare words, so long as we can find them in a bilingual dictionary, and know the English translation.",
        "It does not, however, learn new frames from usage examples.",
        "In order to demonstrate the utility of the valency information, we give an example of a sentence translated with the system default information (basically a choice between transitive and intransitive), and the full valency information.",
        "The verb is�u�i * 6 kamei-suru “order”, which takes a sentential complement.",
        "In (1)1 the underlined part is the sentential complement.",
        "The verb valency entry is the same as ± **6 joushin-suru “report” [NP-ga Cl-to V], except with the clause marked as to-infinitival.",
        "The translation with the valency information is far from perfect, but it is comprehensible.",
        "Without the valency information the translation is incomprehensible.",

        "sally forth QUOT ordered “The king ordered his follower to sally forth.” with: The king ordered a follower that sallied forth.",
        "without: * ordered to a follower that the king, sallied forth.",
        "In general, translation tends to simplify text, because the target language will not be able to represent exactly the same shades of meaning as the source text, so there is some semantic loss.",
        "Therefore, in many cases, a single target language entry is the translation of many similar source patterns.",
        "For example, there are 23 Japanese predicates linked to the English entry report in the valency dictionary used by the Japanese-to-English machine translation system ALT-J/E (Ikehara et al., 1991)."

        "Our method is based on two facts: (1) verbs with similar meanings typically have similar valency structures; (2) verbs with identical translations typically have similar meanings.",
        "We use three resources: (1) a seed valency dictionary (in this case the verbs from ALT-J/E’s valency dictionary, ignoring all idiomatic and adjectival entries – this gave 5,062 verbs and 11,214 valency patterns3) ; (2) a plain bilingual dictionary which contains word pairs without valency information (in our case a combination of ALT-J/E’s Japanese-English word transfer dictionary and EDICT (Breen, 1995)); and (3) a source language corpus (mainly newspapers).",
        "Our method creates valency patterns for words in the bilingual dictionary whose English translations can be found in the valency dictionary.",
        "We cannot create patterns for words with unknown translations.",
        "Each combination consists of JU, an Unknown word for which we have no valency information; E, its English translation (or translations); which is linked to one or more valency patterns JV in the valency dictionary.",
        "Figure 1 shows the overall flow of creating candidate patterns.",
        "For each entry in the plain J-E dictionary • If no entries with the same Japanese (JU) exist in the valency dictionary – For each valency entry (JV) with the same English (E) * Create a candidate pattern consisting of JV replaced by JU",
        "The definition of “similar meaning” used to generate new patterns is that they have the same English translation.",
        "We had to make this quite loose: any entry with the same En-3We call an entry in the valency dictionary (consisting of source and target language subcategorization information and selectional restrictions on the source side) a valency pattern.",
        "glish head.",
        "Therefore give up and give back are counted as the same entry.",
        "This allows for minor inconsistencies in the target language dictionaries.",
        "In particular the valency dictionary is likely to include commonly appearing adjuncts and complements that do not normally appear in bilingual dictionaries.",
        "For example: iku “go” is translated as to go in EDICT, go in the ALT-J/E word transfer dictionary and NP go from NP to NP in the ALT-J/E valency dictionary (among other translations).",
        "To match these entries it is necessary to have some flexibility in the English matching.",
        "In order to filter out bad candidates, we compare the usage of JV with JU using examples from a corpus.",
        "Two judgments are made for each paraphrase pair: is the paraphrase grammatical, and if it is grammatical, are the meanings similar?",
        "This judgment can be done by monolingual speakers of the source language.",
        "This is done in both directions: first we find example sentenes using JU, replacing JU with JV and compare the paraphrased sentences, then we find sentences for valence patterns using JV, replace with JU and judge the similarity.",
        "Figure 2 shows the comparison using paraphrases.",
        "In the implementation, we added a pre-filter: reject, for verb pairs that obviously differed in meaning.",
        "This allowed the analysts to immediately reject verb pairs (JU-JV) that were obviously not similar, and speeded up things considerably (e.g., JU jA* * 6 ketchaku-suru “settle on” has translation E settle; both JV1 N t, * { ochitsuku “calm down” and JV2 \"a *6 teijuu-suru “settle in” are candidates but JV2 appear because of the polysemy of E.4).",
        "The three grammaticality classes are: grammatical, ungrammatical, grammatical in some context.5 Semantic similarity was divided into the following classes:",
        "• same: JU 1 t odosu “threaten” and JV * odosu “threaten” • close: JU A * * 6 gushin-suru “report” and JV ± * * 6 joushin-suru “report”",
        "• If JU is obviously different to JV reject • Extract 5 sentences using JU from the corpus For each sentence – Replace JU with JV – Classify the paraphrased sentence into 3 grammaticality classes if the class is grammatical * Classify the semantic similarity into 6 classes • Extract 5 sentences using each pattern of JV from the corpus – Replace JV with JU – Test as above",
        "• [JU] broader: JU 41f W,* tsukuri-dasu “create” and JV A M * 6 hatsumei-suru “invent” • [JU] narrower: JU 44A#* 6 saikon-suru “remarry” and JV MA A§ * 6 kekkon-suru “marry” • different nuance: JU -°° 1R* 6 oushuu-suru “expropriate” and JV XR 9 ±.",

        "Next, we give an example of the paraphras�� ing; for the unknown Japanese word JU A 6 gushin-suru “report” we look at the existing word JV ± * * 6 joushin-suru “report” which exists in the valency dictionary, with the same English translation.",
        "We extract 5 sentences from our corpus which use JU, for example (2; slightly simplified here), and replace JU with JV (3).",
        "The paraphrase (3) is grammatical and the pair (2, 3) have close meanings.",

        "When these were expanded into patterns, they made a total of 8,553 candidate patterns (3.3 patterns/verb) whose semantic similarity was then checked using paraphrases.",

        "For each verb (JU) we picked two shortish sentences (on average 81.8 characters/sentence: 40 words) from a corpus of 11 years of newspaper text (4 years of Mainichi and 5 of years Nikkei).",
        "This corpus had not been used in the paraphrasing stage, i.e., all the sentences were unknown.",
        "We tried to get 2 sentences for each verb, but could only find one sentence for some verbs: this gave a total of 4,367 test sentences.",
        "Translations that were identical were marked no change.",
        "Translations that changed were evaluated by Japanese native speakers who are fluent in English.",
        "The new translations were placed into three categories: improved, equivalent and degraded.",
        "All the judgments were based on the change in translation quality, not the absolute quality of the entire sentence.",
        "We compared the translations with and without the valency patterns.",
        "There were two setups.",
        "In the first, we added one pattern at a time to the valency dictionary, so we could get a score for each pattern.",
        "Thus verbs with more than one pattern would be tested multiple times.",
        "In this case we tested 13,140 different sentence/pattern combinations.",
        "In the second, we added all the patterns together, and let the system select the most appropriate pattern using the valency information and selectional restrictions.",
        "The results of the evaluation are given in Table 2.",
        "As can be seen in Table 2, most sentences improved followed by equivalent or no change.",
        "Degraded is a minority.",
        "There was a clear improvement in the overall translation quality.",
        "In particular, the result using all patterns (which is the way the dictionary would normally be used) is better than using one pattern at a time.",
        "There are two reasons: (1) Many verbs have different alternations.",
        "When we used all patterns, we covered more alternations, therefore the system could select the right entry based on its subcategorization.",
        "(2) The entries also have different selectional restrictions for different translations.",
        "When we used all patterns, the system could select the best valency entry based on its selectional restrictions.",
        "Even without using the full paraphrase data, only the pre-filter and the grammatical judgments, 37.5% of translations improved and only 12.6% degraded, an overall improvement of 24.9%.",

        "(2) A new pattern with a better translation was selected.",
        "(3) The sentence was translated using the correct subcategorization, which allowed a zero pronoun to be supplemented or some other improvement.",

        "Because we used up to two evaluation sentences for each JU, the evaluation score varies between 2 and 2.",
        "We expected that restricting the patterns to those with grammatical paraphrases and same or close meaning would improve translation quality.",
        "However, as can be seen in Table 3, the distribution of improvements in translation quality did not change significantly according to the percentage of paraphrases that were either same or close.",
        "One reason for the lack of correlation of the results is that change in translation quality of an example sentence is a very blunt instrument to evaluate the fitness of a lexical entry.",
        "Particularly for complicated sentences, the parse may improve locally, but the translation degrade overall.",
        "In particular, a translation that was incomprehensible could become comprehensible but with the wrong meaning: the worst possible result for a translation system.",
        "However, even allowing for these imperfections, the result still holds: a test for paraphrasability on a small set of sentences is not a useful indicator of whether two verbs have the same valency.",
        "One reason for the lack of utility of the paraphrase tests is that the example sentences were chosen randomly: there is no guarantee that they show either typical usage patterns or the full range of use.",
        "We were actually suprised by these results, so we tried various other combinations of grammaticality and semantic similarity, and found the same lack of effect.",
        "We also tried a monolingual similarity measure based on word-vector distances taken from word-definitions and corpora (Kasahara et al., 1997).",
        "This measure was also not effective.",
        "We then looked at our inital grammaticality filter (at least one paraphrase that was grammatical).",
        "Evaluating a small sample of verbs that failed this test (evaluated on 50 sentences), we found that only 16% improved and 24% were degraded.",
        "Therefore this test was useful.",
        "However, it only removed 265 verbs (less than 10%).",
        "If we had left them",
        "in, the extrapolated result (testing each pattern individually) is an improvement of 32% versus a degradation of 16%, which should improve further if all patterns are tested together.",
        "Next, we looked at the target language translation (used to judge that the meanings are similar).",
        "We made the conditions used to match the English stricter (e.g., head match plus n words different for various n), and found no useful difference.",
        "Finally, we looked at the source of the English used to find the candidate patterns.",
        "Translations with a very low preference value in our system dictionary (i.e., the 12th best or lower translation for a word with 12 translations or more) were significantly worse.",
        "However there were only 4 such verbs, so it is not a very useful filter in practice.",
        "An interesting trend we did find was that translations found in EDICT were significantly better than those found in ALT-J/E’s transfer dictionary (see Table 4).",
        "The main reason that EDICT gave such good results was that words with no entry in ALT-J/E’s transfer dictionary could not be translated at all by the default system: the translated system included the Japanese verb as is.",

        "We therefore propose a method of building information-rich lexicons that proceeds as follows: (1) build a seed lexicon by hand; (2) extend it semi-automatically using a simple pre-filter check; (3) release the resulting lexicon so that people can use it and provide feedback to remove bad entries.",
        "People will not use a lexicon if it is too bad, but an error rate of 12.6% should be acceptable, especially as it can be easily decreased with feedback."
