        "Many researchers have criticized and proposed evaluation techniques for natural language (NL) systems (Sparck-Jones, 1996; Dorr et al., 1999), and especially for areas such as machine translation (MT) where there is no single correct answer for a given text.",
        "Thus, conventional ways of measuring precision and recall become misleading and uninformative for the untrained consumer or average user of MT.",
        "In fact, \"so-called evaluations of MT technology ... [give] claims of upwards of 90% accuracy for systems, without a clear specification of what `accuracy' en-tails\" (Miller, 2000).",
        "Moreover, most existing evaluations suffer from two major deficiencies: they do not measure user acceptance of translation quality and do not \"provide the slightest hint about the ease with which the system can be extended or modi-fied\" (King and Falkedal, 1990).",
        "Possible audiences who are interested in system evaluation outcomes include users, developers, and managers; however, current methods tend to concentrate on getting results for developers.",
        "Most existing MT evaluations focus on gathering fine-grained results that either require too much time or are cognitively overwhelming and labour-intensive for non-expert translators to complete.",
        "For example, some methods ask evaluators to identify and correct errors of many translation passages, some ask evaluators to rank translation quality based on finely differentiated criteria, and some assess system performance indirectly via evaluators' intelligence (Carroll, 1966; White et al., 1994; Bohan et al., 2000; Hovy, 1999).",
        "From her critical account of MT evaluations (King, 1997), King proposes that researchers focus on developing methods that allow users and developers understand the quality of an MT system and allow developers to relate the evaluation results to fixing system errors.",
        "We believe these are exceedingly important factors in research technologies, and proposes to approach MT evaluation that attempts to address these issues.",
        "In this work, we explore an inspection method, called the heuristic evaluation, that measures user acceptance by implicitly asking users to diagnose system misbehaviour.",
        "The evaluation method is presented to the user as a free-trial of a system and survey – a concept that non-experts are already familiar with.",
        "Also, the evaluation groups the results in terms of system functionality, so that the results can be used quickly by developers to fix the problems.",
        "This method is an attempt to directly address the need of assessing user acceptance of NL systems and to provide useful development directions for researchers at the same time.",
        "Adapting this framework for MT is described in Sections 2 and 3 and experimental results for two systems are presented in Section 4.",
        "The results suggest that heuristic evaluation has clear advantages over existing NL evaluations and is worth investigating further.",
        "A discussion on identifying translation quality factors that are important to users is provided in Section 5.",
        "We believe that this framework can be generalized to other NL domains, and demonstrate this with a pilot study for a text summarization (TS) system in Section 6.",
        "An interesting way of using the evaluation data is to create user profiles.",
        "By collecting data in our evaluation scheme, we have, in essence, elicited a database of user preferences.",
        "Also, the results are grouped in terms of system functionality.",
        "Therefore, by comparing user acceptance among multiple systems, what we get is what people like most about each system.",
        "Section 7 outlines ways of exploiting both kinds of data via cluster analysis.",
        "2 Properties of the Heuristic Evaluation Method Human-computer interaction (HCI) has long advocated for user evaluations of computer systems.",
        "Among the different methods that have developed in this field, one that is particularly notable is called the heuristic evaluation (Nielsen, 1993).",
        "In brief, heuristic evaluation requires several evaluators to \"walkthrough\" the system under real-use scenarios while performing a meaningful task so that they can get a good sense of the system design and responses to various user actions.",
        "Thereafter, the evaluator comments on the system based on a set of design principles that have been generally accepted as standard criteria in interface research.",
        "The outcome of the evaluation is a list of interface problems identified by potential users.",
        "This method has the benefit of easy experimental set-up, low requirements on user's experience or time, and few number of users as evaluators.",
        "In fact, Nielsen empirically shows that 5 evaluators typically identifies 75% of the system problems (see Figure 1, taken from (Nielsen, 1993)).",
        "This method is especially effective in carrying out quick evaluations and getting iterative feedback for developers.",
        "The obstacle with directly applying an HCI evaluation method to NL is that it has been designed for assessing user interfaces, not system output.",
        "The trick therefore is to tailor the heuristic evaluation so that it allows users to evaluate the quality of output rather than the interface.",
        "In the following section, we will explain the steps we took to tailor the method towards evaluating MT systems."

        "Cultural or linguistic differences are therefore also \"translated\".",
        "8.",
        "Accountability: The kinds and frequency of errors (punctuation, words, syntax, style) are tolerable.",
        "Readers are generally satisfied with the translation and are likely to recommend the system to other users.",
        "In this way, a principle receiving an unfavourable score and comments indicates specific modules for further development.",
