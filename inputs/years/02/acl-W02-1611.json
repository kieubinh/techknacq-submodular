        "The basic idea of EBMT is that the translation of an input sentence can be acquired by modifying translations of similar sentences, as is done in the human translation process (Nagao, 1981).",
        "Therefore, the selection of similar sentences from a bilingual corpus is important for EBMT.",
        "A similarity measure with low retrieval ability lessens the exploitation of the bilingual corpus and results in bad or no translation.",
        "Identifying synonymous expressions is an effective way to expand the retrieval of similar sentences.",
        "It equates different expressions that have almost the same meaning and shortens the distance between sentences that are essentially the same but look different.",
        "In this paper, we describe a method to extract synonymous expressions from a bilingual corpus.",
        "Extraction is based on differences between synonymous sentences by dynamic programming match (DP-match)(Cormen et al., 2001).",
        "The method has the advantage that it does not require rich linguistic knowledge, such as sentence structure and dictionaries."
