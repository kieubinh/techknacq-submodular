        "With the increasing amount of online information and the rapid growth of non-English speaking Internet hosts, it is becoming increasingly important to offer users universal access to valuable information resources in different languages.",
        "The European Multilingual Information Retrieval (EMIR) project [6], the MULINEX project[7], the TwentyOne project[8], and the cross-language retrieval track in TREC[9] conference all reflect people’s interest in providing interoperability among different language processing environments and multilingual information retrieval.",
        "Distributed system technology plays an important role to enable us to manage information from various places.",
        "This makes it unnecessary to access only the central server.",
        "It helps machine translation developers to work individually.",
        "Yasuhara [ 10] wrote that many machine translation systems were developed, especially from local language to English, and the language has an important role as an intermediate language.",
        "Our paper tries to apply a distributed technique by using English language, which is mostly used by non-English speakers as a second language to be an intermediate language.",
        "Our approach is not aimed to show that it is better than the interlingua appro but it is another solution for us to use exist resources in cyberspace.",
        "We hope that it possible to help developers build the machine translation that will support all languages taking into account of cost, quantity, and time consumption.",
