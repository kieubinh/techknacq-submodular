        "In conclusion, we propose that an XML-application in the field of LT would facilitate for the LT community to share information, and that automatic data harvesting will emerge as an important technique for building information centres in the future."

      "text": [
        "Since the breakthrough of the Internet, and more specifically the World Wide Web (WWW, web), an information centre is commonly viewed as some sort of web-based service.",
        "In its most simple form, such a centre consists of a collection of links, manually updated by a webmaster or editor.",
        "Large, more sophisticated websites usually utilize some kind of database backend in order to separate content from display information, to facilitate searching and to provide simple, site-standardized means for data entry and editing.",
        "One of the fundamental principles of the WWW is the idea of globally reachable documents, a fact given in the acronym WWW itself.",
        "Given its global nature, the WWW naturally grows to contain a very large amount of data.",
        "In order to resolve the issue of actually finding anything in this vast network, a need for search engines, portals, and information centres has arisen.",
        "Our website is a response to such a need for an information centre on language technology in Sweden.",
        "The success of an information centre largely depend on the perceived quality of its contents, and how easily those contents are found.",
        "Textual quality is not what we will discuss in this paper.",
        "Suffice to say that quality depends on, among other things, information being correct, up to date, and comprehensive.",
        "For our purposes, this is a data entry/edit issue, which we will address."

    {
      "heading": "1.1 Data entry",
      "text": [
        "As stated above, a common way to manage website is by means of a database that generates HTML web-pages which a user may view in her web browser.",
        "The input to the database may be provided by other users, sometimes by means of a web-form (Fig 1).",
        "Now, the Language Technologist in this picture is probably more interested in his Interesting Work than filling out a web-form (we hope!).",
        "He may already have filled out several such forms, may not see the use of the website in question, or may have done so already and be unwilling to update old information.",
        "Therefore we suggest an alternative way to provide information (Fig 2).",
        "The alternative builds on the notion that people, projects, companies, etc.",
        "already have or want to have websites or homepages of their own.",
        "Most of the information is thus already available there.",
        "We will try to harvest this information by asking the data-providers to do one of four things:",
        "a) Annotate their own HTML website with tags for our data-harvester.",
        "b) Provide information in an XML-format, compatible with ours.",
        "c) Submit a web-form.",
        "d) Contact our web-editor for manual entry.",
        "The last two entry modes are a step back to older methods, and are provided as a cautionary measure for two reasons.",
        "First, not all data-providers will adopt to the new way of data-entry.",
        "A cause for not adopting is that our XML-application and attributed HTML-tags will probably undergo several changes and demand that early adopters change their documents accordingly.",
        "The second reason is of pragmatic nature, namely that we need to build our site before the data-harvesting application and the XML-application is finished.",
        "There are three benefits with entry modes a) and b):",
        "1.",
        "Data entry is facilitated by making use of existing web-pages.",
        "2.",
        "The amount of stale data is reduced by updating the database as the data-provider updates her own website.",
        "3.",
        "The ability to output in XML format.",

        "We have chosen to use the META and SPAN tags since they may be used as containers for generic meta-information.",
        "Use of the META-tag is uncontroversial, since it is commonly used for providing data for search engines.",
        "The SPAN tag is more commonly used for style information, but may be used to tailor HTML to ones own needs and tastes, according to W3C (1999).",
        "Some may still see the use of this tag as controversial, since we use it for semantic, not style information.",
        "We argue that this is not an issue because the tags will not affect the website in question (presuming the information was already there), whether users implement a style-sheet or not.",
        "Alternatives might have been HTML-comments or scripting languages.",
        "The drawbacks with these methods are that they may force data-providers to use invalid HTML and that they make it harder to make use of existing information.",
        "As for XML, documents will have to conform to a DTD under development by us in cooperation with NorDokNet.",
        "We also have contact with LT-World, in order to resolve compatibility issues with their information centre before they appear.",
        "Since websites using XML is not yet commonsight, documents will usually have to be written from scratch.",

        "It then checks whether the document in question is written in HTML or XML, and runs either the HTML parsers and the link extractor or the XML parser.",
        "The information returned from the parsers is then translated into XML and updated by the database interface.",
        "The reason for having three different HTML parsers (including the link extractor) is, of course, that they do different things.",
        "The head parser only parses information in the HTML-HEAD part of the document, in order to check whether the document belongs in our database at all, and if so, in what main category.",
