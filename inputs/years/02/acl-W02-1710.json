        "A central aspect of our research is to explore up to which point current standard XML technology (XML, XSL-T, XSL-FO, XPATH, SVG, XQUERY) can be used to model multimodal corpora, to transform, query and distribute the content of such corpora and to perform adequate linguistic analysis.",
        "As a result, all linguistic data in our system is stored in an XML-based format called TASX: the Time Aligned Signal data eXchange format.",
        "A TASX-annotated corpus consists of a set of sessions, each one holding an arbitrary number of descriptive tiers, called layers.",
        "Each layer consists of a set of separated events.",
        "Each event stores some textual information (e.g. a syllable or the description of gesture) and is linked to the primary audio data by two time stamps denoting the interval of this event.",
        "Relations between events on different tiers can be encoded by defining links using the ID/IDREFS mechanism of XML.",
        "This is similar to the approach of stand-off markup as proposed by MATE (Dy-bkaer et al., June 1999), respectivly NITE (Car-letta et al., 2002).",
        "Finally, arbitrary meta-data can be assigned to the complete corpus, each session, each layer and each event.",
        "Meta data is represented as a named set of attribute-value pairs.",
        "No further restrictions are made on the AV pairs.",
        "The design of TASX is based on the careful analysis of common annotation formats and tools.",
        "We tried to maximally reduce these formats while still allowing to represent all of the stored information and (even more important) the represented information structure.",
        "The TASX-format is thus powerful enough to encode most of the corpus annotation formats in use.",
        "Indeed a number of format transformation programme have been implemented.",
        "For a more detailed description of the TASX-environment",
        "see also (Milde and Gut, 2001), (Milde and Gut, 2002a), (Milde and Gut, 2002b).",
        "Table 1 shows the formal TASX-format specification.",
        "Two levels of TASX-annotation can be distinguished: 1.",
        "TASX level 1: all events do immediately refer to the common timeline of the underlying signal.",
        "This approach has been taken by most of the currently available annotation formats and annotation tools.",
        "2.",
        "TASX level 2: events can either refer to the common timeline or events can refer to events in other layers.",
        "This allows to construct hierarchical annotation stuc-tures.",
        "While conceptually integrated into the TASX format, there is currently no tool available to manipulate TASX level 2 annotated language data."

        "The TASX-annotator is a central component of the TASX-environment.",
        "The tool allows the multilevel annotation and transcription of video (multi-channel) and audio data (see figure 1).",
        "A separate video playback window is opened up for each video file making it possible to e.g. display multiple perspectives of the same scene.",
        "The video playback is synchronized with the transcription.",
        "For audio transcriptions an os-zillogram is calculated and is displayed inside the main window.",
        "The programm is very user friendly and can be used without a high level of computer skills.",
        "It is possible to completely control the tool by either mouse or by keyboard shortcuts.",
        "Different data views are programmed (time-aligned partiture, word-aligned partiture, sequential text view) to make annotation as effective as possible.",
        "The time aligned view is organized as a two dimensinal grid of infinite size.",
        "A layer is presented as a horizontal tier of events.",
        "The order of the layers is arbitrary and can be changed instantly.",
        "The user is able to define time intervals by dragging the mouse.",
        "Each time interval represents an event.",

        "On top of the main window, the font selection panel is visible (showing some IPA characters).",
        "Above it, the find tool is shown.",
        "In the upper left corner the video display can been seen.",
        "event is entered in an additional text field.",
        "Any (unicode) font (e.g. IPA fonts, HamNoSys fonts etc.)",
        "available for the operating system can be used for the transcription.",
        "The user can choose font and fontpage from a table displaying all characters of the selected font.",
        "It is also possible to define a virtual keyboard which maps the given keystrokes to arbitrary characters of the target font.",
        "In the text view the data can be manipulated in a standard text editor panel.",
        "The content of the editor represents the layer and each line represents an event.",
        "A list selection box allows switching between different layers.",
        "It is possible to transfer text from standard text editors, e.g. Microsoft Word, by cut and paste operations.",
        "In order to additionally speed up the transcription process, a word completion function has been implemented for the text view.",
        "Entering the initial letter of a word and consecutively pressing CTRL+L will bring up all words starting with this letter.",
        "Once the text is tranferred into the TASX-annotator, the events still have to be aligned with the primary audio and video data.",
        "Switching back to the time aligned view and moving the events with the mouse makes this task quite simple.",
        "In the partiture view the data cannot be edited.",
        "In practice this means that the data is transformed into an HTML table and then displayed to the user.",
        "A number of different HTML formatted views have been designed.",
        "The views can also be saved to external files and loaded into standard web browsers.",
        "One potential strength of the TASX-annotator is its manner of handling the export/import of XML based information.",
        "A standard way of solving this problem would be the implementation of a set of format specific XML parsers which construct the internal representation (e.g. JDom) of the XML file.",
        "In the TASX-annotator we follow a different approach.",
        "The system integrates an XSL-T processor (saxon), making it easy to perform on the fly data transformations.",
        "The import of an XML-file is split into two steps: first an XSL-T stylesheet transforms the XML file into TASX, second another XSL-T stylesheet will transform the TASX file into a simple text oriented format.",
        "This format can be loaded efficiently.",
        "A crucial problem when setting up larger corpora are inter-anotator transcription errors.",
        "While the TASX-annotator is designed to be used by a single person, it still provides a number of routines to combine (merge), control and align annotations created by a larger team of people.",
        "We do not integrate more complex control functions.",
        "This contradicts our approach of clearly separating corpus creation from corpus analysis.",
        "Currently a number of related annotation tools are under development (e.g. Elan (Brug-man and Wittenburg, 2001), AGTK (Bird et al., 2001), (Bird and Liberman, 1999), Anvil (Kipp, 2001), Exmaralada (Schmidt, 2001)), each of them designed for a specific target audience.",
        "Most of the tools are using Java as an implementation base and encode the linguistic data in a comparable way as proposed here (XML-based, using time spans to mark events, separating meta-data and content).",
        "As a result it becomes relativly simple to convert/generate TASX-annotated corpora into/from these formats."

        "The TASX-environment therefore focuses on the development of transcoding filters from and into various formats.",

        "The tracker uses Praat (Boersma, 2001) to perform the actual speech analysis.",
        "It simply calculates the pitch curve of the audio signal.",
        "If no pitch is detected, then non-speech is assumed, otherwise speech.",

        "Even if tracking is far from perfect, the human annotator gets a good pre-segmentation of the signal.",
        "This allows to move very quickly through the file, possibly performing minor adjustments to the boundaries or combining a set of separated events of one speaker.",
