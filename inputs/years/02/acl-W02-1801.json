        "Normally Rule-Based Machine Translation system takes word as basic translation unit.",
        "However, word is normally polysemous and therefore ambiguous, which causes many difficulties in selecting proper target equivalent words in machine translation, especially in translation between unrelated language pairs, such as Chinese and English.",
        "On the other hand, human translation is rarely word-based.",
        "Human translators always translate group of words as a whole, which means human do not view words as the basic translation units, and it seems they view language expressions that can transfer meaning unambiguously as basic translation units instead.",
        "Following this observation, we believe translation unit shall be not only words but also words groups (Multi-Word Unit) and a collection of bilingual translation unit will be certainly a very useful resource to machine translation.",
        "Manual compilation of such a database of translation unit is certainly labor intensive.",
        "But following the recent progress in Corpus Linguistics, especially in parallel corpus research such as Gale,W.",

        "(2001), Wu, D., Xia, X.(1994).",
        "Automatic identification of translation unit and its target equivalents from existed authentic translation might be a feasible solution; at least it can be used to produce a candidate list of bilingual translation unit.",
        "As a first step towards building a database of bilingual translation units, we selected the Hong Kong Legal Documents Corpus (HKLDC) as the parallel corpus for the feasibility study.",
        "This paper elaborates the methods we adopted.",
        "We will first give our model of (semi-) automatic acquisition of bilingual translation unit based on parallel corpora in section 1.",
        "Then we will show how the corpus could be preprocessed in section 2.",
        "In section 3, several statistic measurements will be introduced which will serve as a basis for late steps in extracting of bilingual translation units.",

        "In the significance of statistics, multi-word unit should be word group that co-occur more frequently than expectation.",

        "Based on the above-mentioned observations, we used an iterative algorithm using both statistical and linguistics means.",

        "Word groups of length more than 3 words could not be found by only one run of the algorithm.",
        "But apparently they could be found by a series of runs until there are no word groups having greater association value than the threshold anymore.",
