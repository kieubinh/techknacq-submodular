        "Multilingual terminology is an important language resource for a range of natural language processing tasks such as machine translation and cross-lingual information retrieval.",
        "The compilation of multilingual terminology is often time-consuming and involves much manual labour to be of practical use.",
        "Aligning texts of typologically different languages such as Chinese and English is even more challenging because of the significant differences in lexicon, syntax, semantics and styles.",
        "The discussion in the paper is based on issues arising from the extraction of bilingual legal terms from aligned Chinese-English legal corpus in the implementation of a bilingual a text retrieval system for the Judiciary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government.",
        "Much attention in computational terminology has been directed to the development of algorithms for extraction from parallel texts.",
        "For example, Chinese-English (Wu and Xia 1995), Swedish-English-Polish (Borin 2000), and Chinese-Korean (Huang and Choi 2000).",
        "Despite considerable progress, bilingual terminology so generated is often not ready for immediate and practical use.",
        "Machine extraction is often the first step of terminology extraction and must be used in conjunction with rigorous and well-managed manual efforts which are critical for the production of consistent and useable multilingual terminology.",
        "However, there has been relatively little discussion on the significance of human intervention.",
        "The process is far from being straightforward because of the different purposes of alignment, the requirements of target users and the corpus type.",
        "Indeed, there remain many problematical issues that will not be easy to be resolved satisfactorily by computational means in the near future, especially when typologically different languages are involved, and must require considerable manual intervention.",
        "Unfortunately, such critical manual input has often been treated as an obscure process.",
        "As with other human cognitive process (T’sou et al.",
        "1998), manual terminology markup is not a straightforward task and many issues deserve closer investigation.",
        "In this paper, we will present some significant issues for Chinese-English alignment and term extraction for the construction of a bilingual legal glossary.",

      "text": [
        "The implementation of a bilingual legal system in Hong Kong as a result of the return of sovereignty to China in 1997 has given rise to a need for the creation and standardization of Chinese legal terminology of the Common Law on par with the English one.",
        "The standardization of legal terminology will not only facilitate the mandated wider use of Chinese among legal professionals in various legal practices such as trials and production of legal documentation involving bilingual laws and judgments, but also promote greater consistency of semantic reference of terminology to minimize ambiguity and to avoid confusion of interpretation in legal argumentation.",
        "In the early 90’s, Hong Kong law drafters and legal translation experts undertook the unprecedented task of translating Hong Kong Laws, which are based on the Common Law system, from English into Chinese.",
        "In the process, many new Chinese legal terms for the Common Law were introduced.",
        "On this basis, an English-Chinese Glossary of legal terms and a Chinese-English Glossary were published in 1995 and 1999 respectively.",
        "The legal terminology was vetted by the high level Bilingual Laws Advisory Committee (BLAC) of Hong Kong.",
        "The glossaries which contain about 30,000 basic entries have become an important reference for Chinese legal terms in Hong Kong.",
        "The Bilingual Legal Information System (BLIS) developed by the Department of Justice, HKSAR provides simple keyword search for the glossaries and laws that are available in both Chinese and English.",
        "Nevertheless, the glossaries are far from being adequate for many different types of legal documentation, e.g. contracts, court judgments, etc.",
        "One major limitation of the BLIS glossary is its restricted coverage of legal terminology in the Laws of Hong Kong, within a basically prescriptive context as when the laws were studied at the time of its promulgation.",
        "There are other important bilingual references (Li and Poon 1998, Yiu and Au-Yeung 1992, Yiu and Cheung 1996) which focus more on the translation of Common Law concepts.",
        "These are almost exclusively nominal expressions.",
        "In 2000, the City University of Hong Kong, in cooperation with the Judiciary, HKSAR, initiated a research project to develop a bilingual text retrieval system, Electronic Legal Documentation/Corpus System (ELDoS), which is supported by a bilingually aligned corpus of judgments.",
        "The purpose of the ongoing project is twofold.",
        "First, the aligned legal corpus enables the retrieval of legal terms used in authentic contexts where the essence and spirit of the laws are tested (and contested) in reality, explicated and elaborated on, as an integral part of the evolving and defining body of important precedent cases unique to the Common Law tradition.",
        "Second, the corpus covers judgment texts involving interpretation of different language styles and vocabulary from Hong Kong laws.",
        "The alignment markup also serves as the basis for the compilation of a high-quality bilingual legal term bank.",
        "To complete the task within the tight timeframe, a team of annotators highly trained in law and language are involved in alignment markup and related editing."

        "The legal professionals which are the target users of ELDoS have very stringent demands on terminology in terms of accuracy, coverage and consistency.",
        "Aligned texts and extracted terms must therefore be carefully and thoroughly verified manually to minimize errors.",
        "Furthermore, many studies on terminology alignment and extraction deal predominantly with nominal expressions.",
        "Since the project aims to provide comprehensive information on the manifestations of legal vocabulary in Chinese and English texts, the retrieval system should not restrict users to nominal expressions but should also provide reference to many other phenomena such as alternation of part-of-speech (POS) (e.g. noun-verb alternation) inherent in bilingual texts, as will be seen in Section 3.",
        "The availability of bilingual corpora has made it possible to construct representative term banks.",
        "Nonetheless, current alignment and term extraction technology are still considered insufficient to meet the requirements for high quality terminology extraction.",
        "In ELDoS project, many issues are difficult to be handled satisfactorily by the computer in the foreseeable future.",
        "Although human input is essential for high quality term bank construction, the practice of manual intervention is not straightforward.",
        "Indeed, the manual efforts to correct the errors can be substantial, and the associated cost should not be underestimated.",
        "The annotator must first go through the entire texts to spot the errors and terms left out by the machines.",

        "Although many term banks avoid such variations and focus primarily on equivalent nominals or verbs, the correspondence of terms between two typologically different languages is often more complicated.",
