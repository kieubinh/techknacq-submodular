        "It is well known that the major difference between Chinese information retrieval (IR) and IR in European languages lies in the absence of word boundaries in sentences.",
        "As Chinese sentences are written as continuous character strings, a preprocessing has to be done to segment sentences into shorter units that may be",
        "used as indexes.",
        "Those units may be of two kinds: words or character n-grams (simplifed as n-grams hereafter).",
        "In the previous studies, several experiments had been carried out using these two kinds of indexing units (Nie et al., 1996) (Kwok et al., 1996) (Chen et al., 1997) (Hsiao, 1997) (Gao et al., 2001a) (Shi et al., 2001).",
        "It turns out that these two kinds of units are effective in Chinese IR.",
        "However, several problems have not been fully investigated: Does the accuracy of word segmentation have a significant impact on IR performance?",
        "Is it worthwhile to combine words with n-grams in Chinese IR?",
        "How should this be done?",
        "These are the questions we will examine in this study.",
        "A series of tests will be conducted on TREC and NTCIR-2 collection.",
        "This is a step forward to find a good way to index Chinese texts.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 1, we provide a brief survey of Chinese word segmentation.",
        "In Section 2, we discuss in detail of Chinese IR indexing units.",
        "In section 3, experimental results are presented.",
        "Finally, we present our conclusion."
