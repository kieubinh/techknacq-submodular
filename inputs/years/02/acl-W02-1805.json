        "Assignment of grammatical categories is the fundamental step in natural language processing.",
        "And ambiguity resolution is one of the most challenging NLP tasks that is currently still beyond the power of machines.",
        "When two questions are combined together, the problem of resolution of categorical ambiguity is what a computational linguistic system can do reasonably good, but yet still unable to mimic the excellence of human beings.",
        "This task is even more challenging in Chinese language processing because of the poverty of morphological information to mark categories and the lack of convention to mark word boundaries.",
        "In this paper, we try to investigate the nature of categorical ambiguity in Chinese based on Sinica Corpus.",
        "The study differs crucially from previous studies in that it directly measure information content as the degree of ambiguity.",
        "This method not only offers an alternative interpretation of ambiguity, it also allows a different measure of success of categorical disambiguation.",
        "Instead of precision or recall, we can also measure by how much the information load has been reduced.",
        "This approach also allows us to identify which are the most ambiguous words in terms of information content.",
        "The somewhat surprising result actually reinforces the Saussurian view that underlying the systemic linguistic structure, assignment of linguistic content for each linguistic symbol is arbitrary."

        "Assignment of grammatical categories or tagging is a well-tested NLP task that can be reliably preformed with stochastic methodologies (e.g. Manning and Shutz 1999).",
        "Depending on the measurement method, over 95% precision can be achieved regularly.",
        "But the question remains as to why the last few percentages are so hard for machines and not a problem for humans.",
        "In addition, even though over 95% seems to be good scores intuitively, we still need to find out if they are indeed better than the naïve baseline performance.",
        "Last but not the least, since natural languages are inherently and universally ambiguous, does this characteristic serve any communicative purpose and can a computational linguistic model take advantage of the same characteristics.",
        "Since previous NLP work on categorical assignment and ambiguity resolution achieved very good results using only distributional information, it seems natural to try to capture the nature of categorical ambiguity in terms of distributional information.",
        "This is how the baseline model was set in Meng and Ip (1999), among others.",
        "Huang et al.",
        "(2002), the most extensive study on categorical ambiguity in Chinese so far, also uses only distributional information.",
        "Huang et al.",
        "(2002) confirmed some expected characteristics of ambiguity with convincing quantitative and qualitative data from the one million word Sinica Corpus 2.0.",
        "Their generalizations include that categorical ambiguity correlates with frequency; that verbs tend to be more ambiguous than nouns, and that certain categories (such as prepositions) are inherently more ambiguous.",
        "What is not totally unexpected, and yet runs against certain long-held assumptions is the distribution of ambiguity.",
        "It is found that only a small fraction of all words (4.298%) are assigned more than one category.",
        "However, in terms of actual use, these words make up 54.59% of the whole corpus.",
        "These two facts are consistent with the frequency effect on ambiguity.",
        "An interesting fact is that of all the words that can have more than one category, 88.37% of the actual uses are in the default category.",
        "A significant fact regarding Chinese language processing can be derived from the above data.",
        "Presupposing lexical knowledge of the lexicon and the default category of each word, a naïve baseline model for category assignment two simple steps: First, if a word has only one category in the lexicon, assign that category to the word.",
        "Second, if a word has more than one category in the lexicon, assign the default (i.e. most frequently used) category to that word.",
        "Since step 1) is always correct and the precision rate of step 2) depends on the percentage of use of the default category.",
        "Huang et al.",
        "(2002) estimated the expected precision of such a naïve model to be over 93.65%.",
        "Huang et al.’s (2002) work, however, has its limitation.",
        "It takes categorical ambiguity as a lexical attribute.",
        "In other words, an attribute is either + or -, and a certain word is either categorically ambiguous or not.",
        "For Huang et al.",
        "(2002), the degree of ambiguity is actually the distribution of the attribute of being ambiguous among a set of predefined (usually by frequency ranking) lexical items.",
        "Strictly speaking, this data only shows the tendency of being categorically ambiguous for the set members.",
        "In other words, what has been shown is actually: Words with higher frequency are more likely to be categorically ambiguous.",
        "The data has noting to say about whether a lexical item or a set of lexical items are more ambiguous than others or not.",
        "A good example of the inadequacy of Huang et al.’s (2002) approach is their measurement of the correlation between number of potential categories and the likelihood of default category to occur.",
        "In table one, the number seems to suggest that number of possible categories of a word form is not directly correlated with its degree of ambiguity, since its probability of being assigned the default category is not predictable and remains roughly the same in average.",
        "This is somewhat counter-intuitive in the sense that we expect the more complex the information structure (i.e. more possible categories), the less likely that it will be assigned a simple default.",
        "Since the methodology is to take distributional information over a large corpus, it is most likely the number shown in table 1 is distorted by the dominance of the most frequent words.",
        "Is there an alternative to pure distributional measurement?",
        "Recall that ambiguity is about information content.",
        "Hence if the quantity of information content is measured, there will be a more direct characterization of ambiguity."

        "The above definition nicely reflects the intuition that the more predictable the category is, the less ambiguous it is.",
        "That is, a word that can be 90% predicted by default is less ambiguous than a word that can only be predicted in 70% of the context.",

        "Confidence of prediction corresponds to quantity of data.",

        "In NLP, this clearly predicts the performance ceiling of stochastic approaches.",
