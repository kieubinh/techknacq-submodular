        "Classical Chinese is an essentially different language from Modern Chinese, especially in syntax and morphology.",
        "While there has been a number of works on Modern Chinese Processing over the past decade (Yao and Lua, 1998a), Classical Chinese is largely neglected, mainly because of its obsolete and difficult grammar patterns.",
        "In our previous work (2002), however, we have stated that in terms of computer processing, Classical Chinese is",
        "even easier as there is no need of word segmentation, an inevitable obstacle in the processing of Modern Chinese texts.",
        "Now in this paper, we move on to the parsing of Classical Chinese by PCFG model.",
        "In this section, we will first briefly review related works, then provide the background of Classical Chinese processing, and finally give the outline of the rest of the paper.",
        "A number of parsing methods have been developed in the past few decades.",
        "They can be roughly classified into two categories: rule-based approaches and statistical approaches.",
        "Typical rule-based approaches as described in James (1995) are driven by grammar rules.",
        "Statistical approaches such as Yao and Lua (1998a), Klein and Manning (2001) and Johnson, M. (2001), on the other hand, learn the parameters the distributional regularities from a usually large-sized corpus.",
        "In recent years, the statistical approaches have been more successful both in part-of-speech tagging and parsing.",
        "In this paper, we apply the PCFG parsing with context-dependent probabilities.",
        "A special difficulty lies in the word segmentation for Modern Chinese processing.",
        "Unlike Indo-European languages, Modern Chinese words are written without white spaces indicating the gaps between two adjacent words.",
        "And different possible segmentations may cause consistently different meanings.",
        "In this sense, Modern Chinese is much more ambiguous than those Indo-European Languages and thus more difficult to process automatically (Huang et al., 2002).",
        "For Classical Chinese processing, such segmentation is largely unnecessary, since most Classical Chinese words are single-syllable and single-character formed.",
        "To this end, it is easier than Modern Chinese but actually Classical Chinese is even more ambiguous because more than half of the words have two or more possible lexical categories and dynamic shifts of lexical categories are the most common grammatical phenomena in Classical Chinese.",
        "Despite of these difficulties, our work (2002) on part-of-speech tagging has shown an encouraging result.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 1, a tagset designed specially for Classical Chinese is introduced and the forward-backward algorithm for obtaining the context-dependent probabilities briefly discussed.",
        "We will briefly present the traditional two-level PCFG model, the syntactic tagset and CFG rule-set for Classical Chinese in Section 2.",
        "Features of the Classical Chinese grammar will also be covered in this section.",

        "(See table 1).",

        "Generally there are 2 types of HMM taggers for parsers, the trigram model and the bigram forward-backward model.",
        "Charniak (1996) suggested that the former is better for parsers.",
        "But the former only result in a deterministic sequence of most probable POS, in other words, it assigns only one POS tag for each word.",
        "Although the accuracy of trigram by our previous work (2002) is as high as 97.6%, for a sentence of 10 words long, the possibility of all-correctness is as low as low as (97.6%)10 = 78.4%, and the single-tag scheme does not allow parsers to recall the correct tags, as is often done if we apply the forward-backward model.",
        "So in this paper we still apply the traditional bigram forward-backward algorithm.",
        "We suggest that a combination of trigram and forward-backward model would be the best choice, although no such attempt exists in the literature."
