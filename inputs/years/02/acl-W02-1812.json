        "In NLP applications, word segmentation of non-segmented language is a very necessary initial stage(Sun et al., 1998).",

        "Furthermore, the standard of word segmentation is dependent on a user and destination of use(Sproat et al., 1996), so that it is necessary that word segmentation can adapt users, can deal with multi languages.",
        "In our method, we extract recursively a common character string that occur frequently in text and call it a common part.",
        "When some common parts contain still same character strings, furthermore we extract the same character string as high dimensional common parts and the remain parts is called different parts.",
        "The high dimensional common parts maybe have higher possibility as words because it is extracted by multi steps.",
        "Those extracted common parts and different parts are called WS(Word Segment), and classified into some ranks according to extracting condition.",
        "The proposed method segments a non-segmented sentence into words using the ranks of WS in order of the higher value of the certainty degrees as words.",
        "When there are multiple segmentation candidates, the system gets a list of segmentable candidates, and picks a correct segmentation candidate from the list by using a value of LEF (Likelihood Evaluation Function, Section 2.1) and so on.",
