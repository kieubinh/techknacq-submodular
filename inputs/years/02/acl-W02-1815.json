        "It is generally agreed among researchers that word segmentation is a necessary first step in Chinese language processing.",
        "Most of the previous work in this area views a good dictionary as the cornerstone of this task.",
        "Several word segmentation algorithms have been developed using a dictionary as an essential tool.",
        "Most notably, variants of the maximum matching algorithm have been applied to word segmentation with considerable success.",
        "The results that have been reported are generally in the upper 90 percentile range.",
        "However, the success of such algorithms is premised on a large, exhaustive dictionary.",
        "The accuracy of word segmentation degrades sharply as new words appear.",
        "Since Chinese word formation is a highly productive process, new words are bound to appear in substantial numbers in realistic scenarios (Wu and Jiang 1998, Xue 2001), and it is virtually impossible to list all the words in a dictionary.",
        "In recent years, as annotated Chinese corpora have become available, various machine-learning approaches have been applied to Chinese word segmentation, with different levels of success.",
        "Compared with dictionary-based approaches, machine-learning approaches have the advantage of not needing a dictionary and thus are more suitable for use on naturally occurring Chinese text.",
        "In this paper we report results of a supervised machine-learning approach towards Chinese word segmentation that combines two fairly standard machine learning models.",
        "We show that this approach is very promising compared with dictionary-based approaches as well as other machine-learning approaches that have been reported in the literature.",
        "2 Combining Classifiers for Chinese word segmentation The two machine-learning models we use in this work are the maximum entropy model (Ratnaparkhi 1996) and the error-driven transformation-based learning model (Brill 1994).",
        "We use the former as the main workhorse and the latter to correct some of the errors produced by the former."

      "text": [
        "Before we apply the machine-learning algorithms we first convert the manually segmented words in the corpus into a tagged sequence of Chinese characters.",
        "To do this, we tag each character with one of the four tags, LL, RR, MM and LR, depending on its position within a word.",
        "It is tagged LL if it occurs on the left boundary of a word, and forms a word with the character(s) on its right.",
        "It is tagged RR if it occurs on the right boundary of a word, and forms a word with the character(s) on its left.",
        "It is tagged MM if it occurs in the middle of a word.",
        "It is tagged LR if it forms a word by itself.",
        "We call such tags position-of-character (POC) tags to differentiate them from the more familiar part-of-speech (POS) tags.",
        "For example, the manually segmented string in (1)a will be tagged as shown in (1)b:",
        "c. Shanghai plans to reach the goal of 5,000 dollars in per capita GDP by the end of the century.",
        "Given a manually segmented corpus, a POC-tagged corpus can be derived trivially with perfect accuracy.",
        "The reason that we use such POC-tagged sequences of characters instead of applying n-gram rules to a segmented corpus directly (Hockenmaier and Brew 1998, Xue 2001) is that they are much easier to manipulate in the training process.",
        "Naturally, while some characters will have only one POC tag, most characters will receive multiple POC tags, in the same way that words can have multiple POS tags.",
        "The example in (2) shows how all four of the POC tags can be assigned to the character r (‘produce’):",
        "Also as in POS tags, the way the character is POC-tagged in naturally occurring text is affected by the context in which it occurs.",
        "For example, if the preceding character is tagged a LR or RR, then the next character can only be tagged LL or LR.",
        "How a character is tagged is also affected by the surrounding characters.",
        "For example, ) (‘close’) should be tagged RR if the previous character is )T (‘open’) and neither of them forms a word with other characters, while it should be tagged LL if the next character is LN (‘heart’) and neither of them forms a word with other characters.",
        "This state of affairs closely resembles the familiar POS tagging problem and lends itself naturally to a solution similar to that of POS tagging.",
        "The task is one of ambiguity resolution in which the correct POC tag is determined among several possible POC tags in a specific context.",
        "Our next step is to train a maximum entropy model on the perfectly POC-tagged data derived from a manually segmented corpus and use the model to automatically POC-tag unseen text."

        "The maximum entropy model used in POS-tagging is described in detail in Ratnaparkhi (1996) and the POC tagger here uses the same probability model.",
        "The probability model is defined over H x T, where H is the set of possible contexts or \"histories\" and T is the set of possible tags.",
        "The model's joint probability of a history h and a tag t is defined as",
        "where 7c is a normalization constant, {,u, a1, ..., ak} are the model parameters and {f1, ..., fk} are known as features, where fj (h, t) C{0,1}.",
        "Each feature fj has a corresponding parameter cj, which effectively serves as a \"weight\" of this feature.",
        "In the training process, given a sequence n of characters {c1, ... ,cn} and their POC tags {t1, ... ,tn} as training data, the purpose is to determine the parameters {&, a1, ..., ak} that maximize the likelihood L of the training data using p:",
        "The success of the model in tagging depends to a large extent on the selection of suitable features.",
        "Given (h,t), a feature must encode information that helps to predict t. The features we used in this experiment are instantiations of the following feature templates:",
        "(3) Feature templates used in this tagger: a.",
        "The current character b.The previous (next) character and the current character c. The previous (next) two characters d. The tag of the previous character e. The tag of the character two before the current character f. Whether the current character is a punctuation mark g. Whether the current character is a numeral h. Whether the current character is a Latin letter",
        "In general, given (h,t), these features are in the form of co-occurrence relations between t and some type of context.",
        "For example, This feature will map to 1 and contribute towards p(hi,ti) if c(i-1) is tagged LL and ci is tagged RR.",
        "The feature templates in (3) encode three types of contexts.",
        "First, features based on the current and surrounding characters are extracted.",
        "Given a character in a sentence, this model will look at the current character, the previous two and next two characters.",
        "For example, if the current character is % (‘-ize’), it is very likely that it will occur as a suffix in a word, thus receiving the tag RR.",
        "On the other hand, other characters might be equally likely to appear on the left, on the right or in the middle.",
        "In those cases, where a character occurs within a word depends on its surrounding characters.",
        "For example, if the current character is �2 (‘love’), it should perhaps be tagged LL if the next character is tP (‘protect’).",
        "However, if the previous character is(‘warm’), then it should perhaps be tagged RR.",
        "In the second type of context, features based on the previous tags are extracted.",
        "Information like this is useful in predicting the POC tag for the current character just as the POS tags are useful in predicting the POS tag of the current word in a similar context.",
        "For example, if the previous character is tagged LR or RR, this means that the current character must start a word, and should be tagged either LL or LR.",
        "Finally, limited POS-tagging information can also be used to predict how the current character should be POC-tagged.",
        "For example, a punctuation mark is generally treated as one segment in the CTB corpus.",
        "Therefore, if a character is a punctuation mark, then it should be POC-tagged LR.",
        "This also means that the previous character should close a word and the following character should start a word.",
        "When the training is complete, the features and their corresponding parameters will be used to calculate the probability of the tag sequence of a sentence when the tagger tags unseen data.",
        "Given a sequence of characters {c1,...,cn}, the tagger searches for the tag sequence {t1, ..., tn} with the highest conditional probability",
