        "Example 1.1 The verb dˇa has many meanings in Chinese, which differ in dˇa h´aizi (punish the child), dˇa m´aoy¯i (weaver the sweater), dˇa ji`angy´ou (buy the soy), etc.",
        "Actually, the semantics of dˇa is distinguished by the semantics of its arguments.",
        "Different from the traditional lexicon, we advocate the conception of dynamic lexicon ([15]) and its evolution oriented to some particular application, which will be mentioned in Section 2.",
        "The WordNet-like lexicon is treated as a dynamic one, which means that the structures representing semantic knowledge could be changed according to some empirical standards.",
        "In the next section, we’ll define the WSD based on the WordNet-like lexicon, and then discuss the training of concept TagSet and the statistical model of WSD.",
