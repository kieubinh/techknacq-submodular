        "It is well known that word segmentation is a prerequisite to Chinese information processing.",
        "Previous research and work in word segmentation have made great progresses.",
        "However, cases with unknown words are not satisfactory.",
        "In general, any lexicon is limited and unable to cover all the words in real texts or speeches.",
        "According to our statistics on a 2,305,896-character news corpus from the People's Daily, there are about 1.19% unknown words.",
        "But they are difficult to be recalled and often greatly reduce the recognition rate of known words close to them.",
        "For example, the sentence “ 部 长 孙 家 正 在 工 作 。 ” (Pronunciation: “Bu Zhang Sun Jia Zheng Zai Gong Zuo.”) has two valid segmentations: “部 长/孙家正/在/工作” (The minister Sun Jiazheng is at work) and “ 部 长 / 孙 家 / 正 在 / 工 作 ” (The minister Sun Jia now is at work).",
        "“ 孙家正” is a person name in the first, while “孙家 ” is another name in the latter.",
        "Meanwhile, the string “ 孙家正 在” will lead to overlapping ambiguity and bring a collision between the unknown word “ 孙 家 正” (Sun Jiazheng) and “正在”(zheng zai; now).",
        "What’s more, the recognizing precision rates of person names, place names, and transliterations are 91.26%, 69.12%, and 82.83%, respectively, while the recalling rates of them are just 68.77%, 60.47%, and 78.29%, respectively.",
        "(Data from official testing in 1999) [Liu (1999)] In a word, unknown words recognition has become one of the biggest stumbling blocks on the way of Chinese lexical analysis.",
        "A proper solution is important and urgent.",
        "Various approaches are taken in Chinese unknown words recognition.",
        "They can be broadly categorized into “one-for-one”, “one-for-several” and “one-for-all” based on the number of categories of unknown words, which can be recognized.",
        "One-for-one solutions solve a particular problem, such as person name recognition [Song (1993); Ji (2001)], place name recognition [Tan (1999)] and transliteration recognition [Sun (1993)].",
        "Similarly, one-for-several approaches provide one solution for several specific categories of unknown words [Lv (2001); Luo (2001)].",
        "One-for-all solutions, as far as we know, have not been applicable yet [Chen (1999); He (2001)].",
        "Although currently practicable methods could achieve great precision or recalling rates in some special cases, they have their inherent deficiencies.",
        "First of all, rules applied are mostly summarized by linguists through painful study of all kinds of huge “special name libraries” [Luo (2001)].",
        "It’s time-consuming, expensive and inflexible.",
        "The categories of unknown words are diverse and the amount of such words is huge.",
        "With the rapid development of the Internet, this situation is becoming more and more serious.",
        "Therefore, it’s very difficult to summarize simple yet thorough rules about their compositions and contexts.",
        "Secondly, the recognition process cannot be activated until some “indicator” tokens are scanned in.",
        "For instance, possible surnames or titles often trigger person name recognition on the following 2 or more characters.",
        "In the case of place name recognition, the postfixes such as “ 县 ”(county), “ 市 ”(city) will activate the recognition on the previous characters.",
        "What’s more, these methods tend to work only on the monosyllabic tokens, which are obvious fragments after tokenization [Luo (2001); Lv (2001)].",
        "It takes the risk of losing lots of unknown words without any explicit features.",
        "Furthermore, this trigger mechanism cannot resolve the ambiguity.",
        "For example, unknown word “方林 山” (Fang Lin Shan) maybe a person name “方/林 山”(Fang Linshan) or a place name “方 林/山”(Fanglin Mountain).",
        "This paper presents a one-for-all approach based on roles tagging to avoid such problems.",
        "The process is: tagging tokens after word segmentation with the most probable roles and making unknown words recognition based on roles sequence.",
        "The mechanism of roles tagging is just like that of a small and simple Part-Of-Speech tagger.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we will describe the approach in general.",
        "Following that, we will present the solution in practice.",
        "In the final part, we provide recognition experiments using roles-tagging methods.",
        "The result and possible problems are discussed as well."
