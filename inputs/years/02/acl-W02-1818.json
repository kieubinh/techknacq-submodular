        "We construct a hybrid model to recognize nine types of Chinese base phrases.",
        "Many researches in Chinese partial parsing (Zhou, 1996; Zhao, 1998; Sun, 2001) have shown that statistical learning is of great use for Chinese chunking, especially for large corpus.",
        "However, the lack of morphological hints in Chinese makes it necessary to use semantic and syntactic information such as context free grammar rules in Chinese processing.",
        "In our approach, viewing chunking as a tagging problem by encoding the chunk structure in new tags attached to each word, we use Memory-Based Learning (MBL) method to set a tag indicating type and position in a base phrase on each word.",
        "After which grammar rules are used to disambiguate the tags.",
        "Our test with a corpus of about 2 MB showed that the experiment achieves 94.4% in precision and 92.5% in recall.",
        "2 Definitions of Chinese Base Phrases The idea of parsing by chunks goes back to Abney (1991).",
        "In his definition of chunks in English, he assumed that a chunk has syntactic structure and he defined chunks in terms of major heads, which are all content words except those that appear between a function word f and the content word which f selects.",
        "A major head is the ‘semantic’ head (s-head) for the root of the chunk headed by it.",
        "However, s-heads can be defined in terms of syntactic heads.",
        "If the syntactic head h of a phrase P is a content word, h is also the s-head of P. If h is a function word, the s-head of P is the s-head of the phrase selected by h .",
        "The research enlightens us about the definition of Chinese base phrases.",
        "In this paper, a Chinese base phrase consists of a single content word surrounded by a cluster of function words.",
        "The single content word is the semantic head of the base phrase.",
        "The forms of base phrases can be expressed as follows."

        "Recognizing simple and non-recursive base phrases is an important subtask for many natural language processing applications, such as information retrieval.",

        "CoNLL-2000’s shared task identified many kinds of English base phrases, which are syntactically related non-overlapping groups of words (Tjong and Buchholz, 2000).",
        "The shared task has significantly heightened the progress in the techniques of English partial parsing.",
        "For Chinese processing, Zhao (1998) put forward a definition of Chinese baseNP that is a combination of determinative modifier and head noun (Zhao, 1998).",
        "Based on that research, Zhao et al.",
        "(2000) extended the concept of baseNP to seven types of Chinese base phrases.",
        "These base phrases may consist of words or other base phrases, but its constituents, in turn, should not contain any base phrases.",
        "In this paper, we put forward the new definition of Chinese base phrases, which are simple and non-recursive, similar to the CoNLL-2000’s shared task.",
        "The definition enables us to resolve most local ambiguities and is very useful for NLP tasks such as name entity recognition and information extraction.",
        "{Modifier} * + head + {complement}* or Coordinate structure The components of ‘modifier’ and ‘complement’ are optional.",
        "A head could be a simple word as well as the structure of “modifier + head” or “head + complement”, but not “modifier + head + complement”.",
        "Coordinate structure could not consist of coordinate symbols such as comma and coordinating conjunction.",
        "The type of base phrases is congruent with its head’s semantic information.",
        "In most cases, the type accords with the head’s syntactical information, for example, when the head is a noun, the phrase is a noun phrase.",
        "However, when a head is a noun that denotes a place, the base phrase including that head is not a noun phrase, but a location phrase.",
        "We consider 9 types of Chinese base phrases in our research: namely adjective phrase (ap), distinguisher phrase (bp), adverbial phrase (dp), noun phrase (np), temporal phrase (tp), location phrase (sp), verb phrase (vp), quantity phrase (mp), quasi quantity phrase (mbar).",
        "The inner grammar structures of every base phrase are very important too, but we will discuss that in another paper."

        "The frame of Chinese base phrase parsing is composed of two parts: one is the “Type and bracket tagging model”, the other is the “Base phrases acquisition model” which consists of two modules which are “brackets matching ”and “correct the types of base phrases”.",
        "(See figure 1.)",
        "The input to the system is a sequence of POS.",
        "In the “Predict the phrase boundary” module, we predict the type, which each word belongs to, and the position of each word in a base phrase with Memory-Based Learning (MBL)(Using the software package provided by Tilburg University.).",
        "And the result is expressed as a pair formed by base phrase type and position information.",
        "Because our Chinese base phrases are non-recursive and non-overlapping, the left and right boundaries of base phrases must match with each other which means they should be a pair and alternative.",
        "However, the errors involving in the first part will lead to incorrect base phrases because the boundaries do not match, for example “[ ... [ ... ]”.",
        "In the second part, grammar rules that indicate the inner structures of base phrases are used to resolve the boundary ambiguities.",
        "Furthermore, it also takes lexical information into account to correct the type mistakes.",
        "The corpus used in the experiment includes 7606 sentences.",

        "The solution of the module is to find < ri, ci > (Wojciech and Thorsten, 1998), a duple formed by a type tag and a boundary tag for each word ti .",
