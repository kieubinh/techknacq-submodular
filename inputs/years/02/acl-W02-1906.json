        "Information Retrieval (IR) systems receive as input a user’s query, and they have to return a set of documents sorted by their relevance to the query.",
        "There are different techniques to carry out the document extraction process, but most of them are based on pattern matching modules that depend on the number of times that a query term appear in each document, as well as the importance or discrimination value of each term in the document collection.",
        "Question Answering (QA) systems try to improve the output generated by IR systems by means of returning just small pieces of text that are supposed to contain the response.",
        "Usually, QA systems combine IR and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform their task.",
        "This combination allows text understanding until a minimum level that permits a precise answer detection and extraction.",
        "Nevertheless, since NLP techniques are computationally expensive, QA systems need to reduce the amount of text where these techniques have to be applied.",
        "In this way, they usually work on the output of IR systems [10] that select the most relevant documents to the query by supposing that they will contain the answer required.",
        "Most applied IR systems are mainly based on three models: the cosine model [15], the pivoted cosine model1 [17], and the probabilistic model (OKAPI [18]).",
        "Moreover, IR systems usually employ query expansion techniques that frequently improve their precision.",
        "These techniques can be based on thesaurus [21] or on the incorporation of the most frequent terms in the top M relevant documents [7].",
        "Currently, several Passage Retrieval (PR) systems have also been proposed for this task [2][5][8][9].",
        "PR systems deal with fragments of text in order to determine the relevance of a document to a query, as well as to detect document extracts that are likely to contain the expected answer (instead of full documents).",
        "Although PR systems apply IR-based techniques to perform their work, they have revealed to be more effective than IR systems for QA tasks.",
        "In this paper, we are analysing the importance of the IR-n PR system for QA n [1 1 ] as it was used in last TREC-10 Conference [19].",
        "The following section briefly presents the backgrounds in IR, PR and QA.",

        "Given a question, an IR system sorts the documents by its relevance to the query.",
        "It computes the similarity between each document and the question by taking into account the frequency of each query term in the document.",
        "This fact usually produces that bigger documents are preferred.",
        "A possible alternative to IR models is based on obtaining the similarity in accordance with the relevance of the passages contained in the document.",
        "This new approach, called Passage Retrieval (PR), has several advantages.",
        "When used for document retrieval, as the relevance of a document will depend on the relevance of the passages it contains, this measure will not be affected by the length of the full document.",
        "Moreover, these techniques allow to detect high relevant information embedded in a long document obtaining, this way, better performance than IR approaches [2][9].",
        "On the other hand, when applied for QA tasks, PR systems allow reducing the amount of text to be processed with costly NLP tools by returning passages instead of whole documents.",
        "Two classifications can be accomplished in PR.",
        "The first one is in accordance with the way of dividing the documents into passages.",
        "The second one is in accordance with the moment in which the passage segmentation is carried out.",
        "With reference to the first one, PR community generally agrees with the classification proposed in [2], where the author distinguishes between discourse models, semantic models, and window models.",
        "The first one uses the structural properties of the documents, such as sentences or paragraphs [13][16] in order to define the passages.",
        "The second one divides each document into semantic pieces according to the different topics in the document [5].",
        "The last one uses windows of a fixed size (usually a number of terms) to determine passage boundaries [2] [8].",
        "At first glance, we could think that discourse-based models would be the most effective, in retrieval terms, since they use the structure of the document itself.",
        "However, this model greatest problem relies on detecting passage boundaries since it depends on the writing style of the author of each document.",
        "On the other hand, window models have as main advantage that they are simpler to accomplish, since the passages have a previously known size, whereas the remaining models have to bear in mind the variable size of each passage.",
        "Nevertheless, discourse-based and semantic models have the main advantage that they return full information units of the document, which is quite important if these units are used as input by other applications such as QA.",
        "According to the second classification, we can distinguish between approaches that segment documents into passages for indexing purposes, and those that perform segmentation after the query is posed.",
        "The first one allows a quicker calculation; nevertheless, the second one allows different segmentation models in accordance with the kind of query.",
        "The passage extraction model that we propose (IR-n) allows us to benefit from the advantages of discourse-based models since self-contained information units of text, such as sentences, are used for building passages.",
        "Moreover, another novel proposal in our PR system is the relevance measure which, unlike other discourse-based models, is not based on the number of passage terms, but on a fixed number of passage sentences.",
        "This fact allows a simpler calculation of this measure unlike other discourse-based or semantic models.",
        "Although each passage is made up by a fixed number of sentences, we consider that our proposal differs from the window models since our passages do not have a fixed size (i.e. a fixed number of words) since we use sentences with a variable size.",
        "Furthermore, IR-n document segmentation into passages is accomplished after the query is posed, which allows us to determine the number of sentences to be considered in accordance with the kind of the query."
