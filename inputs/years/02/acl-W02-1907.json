        "Recent rapid progress of computer and communication technologies enabled us to access enormous amount of machine-readable information easily.",

        "Under these circumstances, the necessity for automatic summarization has been increasing and has been intensively studied recently (see e.g,(Mani and T.Maybury, 1999)).",
        "No all-purpose automatic summarization method for summarizing any type of documents appropriately exists, thus, in many cases, we must combine several summarization methods as components when we develop an automatic summarization system.",
        "Deletion of some unnecessary parts from a sentence is among such important summarization methods (Yamamoto et al., 1995)(Jing and McKeown, 2000).",
        "In this paper, we propose an unsupervised learning method which acquires knowledge about the deletion possibility of adnominal verb phrases in order to summarize a document by deleting unimportant segments from a sentence in the document.",
        "As a method of summarization which deletes unimportant segments from a sentence, Ohtake et al.",
        "(Ohtake et al., 2001) proposes a method which deletes one of double modification segments modifying the same noun by using manually constructed rules.",

        "(Katoh and Uratani, 1999) proposes a method which acquires knowledge about paraphrasing by using an aligned corpus of captions and original manuscripts which correspond to the captions.",
        "However, these previously proposed methods have the following drawbacks for practical use.",
        "• To make a complete list of rules manually in order to delete unimportant segments from a sentence is a hard task.",
        "• Aligned corpus between original manuscripts and summaries is useful.",
        "But it is not necessarily available.",
        "Moreover, constructing summaries manually for obtaining such aligned corpus is a time-consuming and costly task.",
        "By these reasons, we propose an unsupervised learning method which acquires knowledge from general corpus (e.g., news paper articles), about the deletion possibility of adnominal verb phrases to summarize by deleting unimportant segments from a sentence.",
