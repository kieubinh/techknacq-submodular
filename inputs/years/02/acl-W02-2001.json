        "This paper proposes a series of techniques for extracting English verb–particle constructions from raw text corpora.",
        "We initially propose three basic methods, based on tagger output, chunker output and a chunk grammar, respectively, with the chunk grammar method optionally combining with an attachment resolution module to determine the syntactic structure of verb–preposition pairs in ambiguous constructs.",
        "We then combine the three methods together into a single classifier, and add in a number of extra lexical and frequentistic features, producing a final F-score of 0.865 over the WSJ."

        "There is growing awareness of the pervasiveness and idiosyncrasy of multiword expressions (MWEs), and the need for a robust, structured handling thereof (Sag et al., 2002; Calzolari et al., 2002; Copestake et al., 2002).",
        "Examples of MWEs are lexically fixed expressions (e.g. ad hoc), idioms (e.g. see double), light verb constructions (e.g. make a mistake) and institutionalised phrases (e.g. kindle excitement).",
        "MWEs pose a challenge to NLP due to their syntactic and semantic idiosyncrasies, which are often unpredictable from their component parts.",
        "Large-scale manual annotation of MWEs is infeasible due to their sheer volume (at least equivalent to the number of simplex words (Jackendoff, 1997)), productivity and domain-specificity.",
        "Ideally, therefore, we would like to have some means of automatically extracting MWEs from a given domain or corpus, allowing us to pre-tune our grammar prior to deployment.",
        "It is this task of extraction that we target in this paper.",
        "This research represents a component of the LinGO multiword expression project,' which is targeted at extracting, adequately handling and representing MWEs of all types.",
        "As a research testbed and target resource to expand/domain-tune, we use the LinGO English Resource Grammar (LinGO-ERG), a linguistically-precise HPSG-based grammar under development at CSLI (Copestake and Flickinger, 2000; Flickinger, 2000).",
        "The particular MWE type we target for extraction is the English verb-particle construction.",
        "Verb-particle constructions ( “VPCs”) consist of a lhttp://lingo.stanford.edu/mwe head verb and one or more obligatory particles, in the form of intransitive prepositions (e.g. hand in), adjectives (e.g. cut short) or verbs (e.g. let go) (Villavicencio and Copestake, 2002a; Villavicencio and Copestake, 2002b; Huddleston and Pullum, 2002); for the purposes of this paper, we will focus exclusively on prepositional particles – by far the most common and productive of the three types – and further restrict our attention to single-particle VPCs (i.e. we ignore VPCs such as get along together).",
        "We define VPCs to optionally select for an NP complement, i.e. to occur both transitively (e.g. hand in the paper) and intransitively (e.g. battle on).",
        "One aspect of VPCs that makes them difficult to extract (cited in, e.g., Smadja (1993)) is that the verb and particle can be non-contiguous, e.g. hand the paper in and battle right on.",
        "This sets them a art from conventional collocations and terminology (psee, e.g., Manning and Sch¨utze (1999) and McKeown and Radev (2000)) in that they cannot be captured effectively using N-grams, due to the variability in the number and type of words potentially interceding between the verb and particle.",
        "We are aiming for an extraction technique which is applicable to any raw text corpus, allowing us to tune grammars to novel domains.",
        "Any linguistic annotation required during the extraction process, therefore, is produced through automatic means, and it is only for reasons of accessibility and comparability with other research that we choose to work over the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "That is, other than in establishing upper bounds on the performance of the different extraction methods, we use only the raw text component of the treebank.",
        "In this paper, we first outline distinguishing features of VPCs relevant to the extraction process (§ 2).",
        "We then present and evaluate a number of simple methods for extracting VPCs based on, respectively, POS tagging (§ 3), the output of a full text chunk parser (§ 4), and a chunk grammar (§ 5).",
        "Finally, we detail enhancements to the basic methods (§ 6) and give a brief description of related research (§ 7) before concluding the paper (§ 8)."

        "If the preposition is transitive, it must select for an NP, producing either a prepositional verb (e.g. refer to) or a free verb–preposition combination (e.g. put it on the table, climb up the ladder).",
        "A number of diagnostics can be used to distinguish VPCs from both prepositional verbs and free verb– preposition combinations (Huddleston and Pullum, 2002):",
        "1. transitive VPCs undergo the particle alternation 2. with transitive VPCs, pronominal objects must be expressed in the “split” configuration 3. manner adverbs cannot occur between the verb and particle",
        "The first two diagnostics are restricted to transitive VPCs, while the third applies to both intransitive and transitive VPCs.",
        "The first diagnostic is the canonical test for par-ticlehood, and states that transitive VPCs take two word orders: the joined configuration whereby the verb and particle are adjacent and the NP complement follows the particle (e.g. hand in the paper), and the split configuration whereby the NP complement occurs between the verb and particle (e.g. hand the paper in).",
        "Note that prepositional verbs and free verb–preposition combinations can occur only in the joined configuration (e.g. refer to the book vs. *refer the book to).",
        "Therefore, the existence of a verb–preposition pair in the split configuration is sufficient evidence for a VPC analysis.",
        "It is important to realise that compatibility with the particle alternation is a sufficient but not necessary condition on verb–particlehood.",
        "That is, a small number of VPCs do not readily occur in the split configuration, including carry out (a threat) (cf. ?carry a threat out).",
        "The second diagnostic stipulates that pronominal NPs can occur only in the split configuration (hand it in vs. *hand in it).",
        "Note also that heavy NPs tend to occur in the joined configuration, and that various other factors interact to determine which configuration a given VPC in context will occur in (see, e.g., Gries (2000)).",
        "The third diagnostic states that manner adverbs cannot intercede between the verb and particle (e.g. *hand quickly the paper in).",
        "Note that this constraint is restricted to manner adverbs, and that there is a small set of adverbs which can pre-modify particles and hence occur between the verb and particle (e.g. well in jump well up)."

        "Examples of false positives (i.e. verb–prepositions misclassified as VPCs) returned by this final system configuration are firm away, base on and very off.",
        "In Section 1, we made the claim that VPCs are highly productive and domain-specific.",
        "We validate this claim by comparing the 1000 VPCs correctly extracted by the Combine* method against both the LinGO-ERG and the relatively broad-coverage Alvey Tools VPC inventory.",
        "The 28 March, 2002 version of the LinGO-ERG contains a total of 300 intransitive and transitive VPC types, of which 195 were contained in the 1000 correctly-extracted VPCs.",
        "Feeding the remaining 805 VPCs into the grammar (with a lexical type describing their transitivity) would therefore result in an almost fourfold increase in the total number of VPCs, and increase the chances of the grammar being able to parse WSJ-style text.",
        "The Alvey Tools data contains a total of 2254 VPC types.",
        "Of the 1000 extracted VPCs, 284 or slightly over 28%, were not contained in the Alvey data, with examples including head down, blend together and bid up.",
        "Combining this result with that for the LinGO-ERG, one can 7 Note that only a limited number of VPCs can be dever-balised in this manner: of the 62 VPCs attested in the WSJ, only 8 had a deverbal usage.",

        "There is a moderate amount of research related to the extraction of VPCs, or more generally phrasal verbs, which we briefly describe here.",
        "One of the earliest attempts at extracting “interrupted collocations” (i.e. non-contiguous collocations, including VPCs), was that of Smadja (1993).",
        "Smadja based his method on bigrams, but unlike conventional collocation work, described bigrams by way of the triple of (word1,word2,posn), where posn is the number of words occurring between word1 and word2 (up to 4).",
        "For VPCs, we can reasonably expect from 0 to 4 words to occur between the verb and the particle, leading to 5 distinct variants of the same VPC and no motivated way of selecting between them.",
        "Smadja did not attempt to evaluate his method other than anecdotally, making any comparison with our research impossible.",
        "The work of Blaheta and Johnson (2001) is closer in its objectives to our research, in that it takes a parsed corpus and extracts out multiword verbs (i.e. VPCs and prepositional verbs) through the use of log-linear models.",
        "Once again, direct comparison with our results is difficult, as Blaheta and Johnson output a ranked list of all verb–preposition pairs, and subjectively evaluate the quality of different sections of the list.",
        "Additionally, they make no attempt to distinguish VPCs from prepositional verbs.",
        "The method which is perhaps closest to ours is that of Kaalep and Muischnek (2002) in extracting Estonian multiword verbs (which are similar to English VPCs in that the components of the multiword verb can be separated by other words).",
        "Kaalep and Muischnek apply the “mutual expectation” test over a range of “positioned bigrams”, similar to those used by Smadja.",
        "They test their method over three different corpora, with results ranging from a precision of 0.21 and recall of 0.86 (F-score=0.34) for the smallest corpus, to a precision of 0.03 and recall of 0.85 (F-score=0.06) for the largest corpus.",
        "That is, high levels of noise are evident in the system output, and the F-score values are well below those achieved by our method for English VPCs."

      "heading": "8 Conclusion",
      "text": [
        "In conclusion, this paper has been concerned with the extraction of English verb–particle constructions from raw text corpora.",
        "Three basic methods were proposed, based on tagger output, chunker output and a chunk grammar; the chunk grammar method was optionally combined with attachment resolution to determine the syntactic structure of verb–preposition pairs in ambiguous constructs.",
        "We then experimented with combining the output of the three methods together into a single classifier, and further complemented the feature space with a number of lexical and frequentistic features, culminating in an F-score of 0.865 over the WSJ.",
        "It is relatively simple to adapt the methods described here to output subcategorisation types, rather than a binary judgement on verb– particlehood.",
        "This would allow the extracted output to be fed directly into the LinGO-ERG for use in parsing.",
        "We are also interested in extending the method to extract prepositional verbs, many of which appear in the attachment resolution data and are subsequently filtered out by the consolidated classifier."
