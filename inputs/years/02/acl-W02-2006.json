        "This paper presents a method for bootstrapping a fine-grained, broad-coverage part-of-speech (POS) tagger in a new language using only one person-day of data acquisition effort.",
        "It requires only three resources, which are currently readily available in 60-100 world languages: (1) an online or hard-copy pocket-sized bilingual dictionary, (2) a basic library reference grammar, and (3) access to an existing monolingual text corpus in the language.",
        "The algorithm begins by inducing initial lexical POS distributions from English translations in a bilingual dictionary without POS tags.",
        "It handles irregular, regular and semi-regular morphology through a robust generative model using weighted Levenshtein alignments.",
        "Unsupervised induction of grammatical gender is performed via global modeling of context-window feature agreement.",
        "Using a combination of these and other evidence sources, interactive training of context and lexical prior models are accomplished for fine-grained POS tag spaces.",
        "Experiments show high accuracy, fine-grained tag resolution with minimal new human effort."

        "Previous work in minimally supervised language learning has defined minimal using several different criteria.",
        "Some have assumed only partially tagged training corpora (Merialdo, 1994), while others have begin with small tagged seed wordlists (such as Collins and Singer (1999) and Cucerzan and Yarowsky (1999) for named-entity tagging).",
        "Others have exploited the automatic transfer of some already existing annotated resource in a different medium or language (such as the translingual projection of part-of-speech tags, syntactic bracketing and inflectional morphology in Yarowsky et al.",
        "(2001), requiring no direct supervision in the foreign language).",
        "Ngai and Yarowsky (2000) observed that an often more practical measure of the degree of supervision is not simply the quantity of annotated words, but the total weighted human labor and resource costs of different modes of supervision (allowing manual rule writing to be compared directly with active learning on a common cost-performance learning curve).",
        "In this paper we observe that another useful measure of (minimal) supervision is the additional cost of obtaining a desired functionality from existing commonly available knowledge sources.",
        "In particular, we note that for a remarkably wide range of languages, academic libraries, many booksellers and websites offer a foundation of linguistic wisdom in reference grammars and dictionaries.",
        "Thus starting from this baseline, what is the marginal cost of distilling from and augmenting this existing knowledge to achieve a desired new task functionality?"

      "text": [
        "A substantial percentage of foreign language dictionaries that are available on line or in smaller paperback format are simple bilingual word or phrase translation lists which fail to specify part of speech.1 Thus one component question of this work is how can one extract preliminary part-of-speech distributions from untagged monolingual translation lists.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates such a bilingual dictionary, also specifying the true part of speech for each possible translation, which we do not assume to be generally available.",
        "One approach is to take an unweighted mixture of the prior part-of-speech distributions for the English words ei given in the translation list (TL) as illustrated in Figure 2.",
        "These probabilities may be estimated from a large and preferably balanced, corpus.",
        "In this work, we used statistics from the Brown and WSJ corpora combined.",
        "However, when a translation candidate is phrasal (e.g. mandat H money order), one can model the more general probability of the foreign word’s part of speech tag (T f) given the part of speech sequence of the English phrasal translation (T,l...T,n).",
        "For example, one could model P(T f I money order) via P(T f IN�N,) and P(T f manifest itself) via P(T f IV, Pro,) .",
        "However, because English words often have multiple parts of speech (e.g. order may be a verb), one may weight phrasal POS sequence probabilities (making an independence assumption) as:",
        "where P(T,z I w,z) is estimated from the dictionary as above.",
        "Without an independence assumption:",
        "There are two major options via which one can estimate P(TfIT,,...T,n).",
        "The first is to assume that the part-of-speech usage of phrasal (English) translations is generally consistent across dictionaries (e.g. P (N f IN,, N,z) remains high regardless of publisher or language).",
        "Hence one could use any foreign-English bilingual dictionary that also includes the true foreign word part of speech in addition to its translations to train these probabilities.",
        "Alternately, one could do a first-pass assignment of foreign-word part of speech based on only single word translations as in Figure 2, and use this to train P(T f IT,, ...T,.)",
        "for those foreign words having both phrasal and single-word definitions (such as mandat).",
        "The advantage of this approach is that it may benefit dictionaries with different phrasal translation styles from the training dictionary (e.g. use or omission of the word ’to’ in verb definitions).",
        "However, given the assumption of relatively consistent dictionary formatting styles (which was unfortunately not the case for Kurdish), we evaluated this work based on supervised phrasal training from a single independent third language dictionary.",
        "Table 1 measures the POS induction performance on three languages, where the true POS tags were given in the dictionary (as in Figure 1), but ignored except for evaluation.",
        "The accuracy values in this table are based on exact matches between a word’s dictionary-provided POS and the most probable tag in its induced distribution.",
        "For our target application of part-of-speech tagging, what matters is to have a robust tag probability distribution that includes the true candidate with sufficiently large probability to seed further training.",
        "By setting this baseline threshold to 0.1 and deleting lower ranked candidates, up to 98% of the true POS were found to be above this threshold and hence were considered in future training.",
        "The Mean Probability of Truth, as shown in Table 1, is another measure of the quality of the POS predictions made by the algorithm, representing the probability mass associated with the true POS tag averaged over all words.",
        "In some cases the algorithm could not predict a POS tag, primarily due to English translations for which no POS distribution was known (often an obscure word, proper name or OCR error).",
        "This oc",
        "casional omission is measured by the coverage column.",
        "Most of the observed errors are due to differences in phrasal definitional conventions in the training and testing dictionaries, long phrasal idioms, single-word definitions with ambiguous English parts-of-speech and OCR errors.",
        "The Kurdish dictionary was particularly hindered by frequent long phrasal translations which often included an explanation or definition in their translation.",
        "Because all dictionary entries are equally weighted, errors on rare words such as mythological characters or kinship terms can substantially downgrade performance.",
        "But for the purposes of providing seed POS distributions to context-sensitive taggers, performance is quite adequate for this follow-on task."

        "There has been extensive previous work in the supervised and minimally supervised induction of both affix paradigms (e.g. Goldsmith, 2000; Snover and Brent, 2001) and diverse models of regular and irregular concatenative and non-concatenative morphology (e.g. Schone and Jurafsky, 2000; van den Bosch and Daelemans, 1999; Yarowsky and Wicen-towski, 2000).",
        "While such approaches are important from the perspective of learning theory or broad coverage handling of irregular forms, another possible paradigm for minimal supervision is to begin with whatever knowledge can be efficiently manually entered from the grammar book in several hours work.",
        "We defined such grammar-based “supervision” as entry of regular inflectional affix changes and their associated part of speech in standardized ordering of fine-grained attributes, as in Table 2 for Spanish and Romanian.",
        "The full tables have approximately 200 lines each and required roughly 1.5-2 person-hours for entry.",

        "changes, such generation will clearly have substantial inaccuracies and overgenerations.",
        "However, through weighted-Levenshtein-based iterative alignment models, such as described in Yarowsky and Wicentowski (2000), one can perform a probabilistic string match from all lexical tokens actually observed in a monolingual corpus, as",
        "in the right side of Figure 32.",
        "For example, when looking for a potential analysis path for the Spanish irregular inflection destrocen, the closest string match is the regular hypothesis destrozar/V H destrozen/V-pres_subj-3pl.",
        "Likewise, the closest string match for destruyen is destruir/V H destruen/V-pres_indic-3pl.",
        "The differences between these regular hypotheses and observed inflected forms are the relatively productive stem changes 0 – �y and z – �c, neither of which was listed in the inflectional supervision table, and yet they were correctly handled.",
        "Note that a traditional P (POS I suffix) model would fail to handle this case given that the common inflection suffix en corresponds to two different parts of speech here (present indicative or subjunctive depending on -ir or -ar paradigm).",
        "Also note that the irregular stem change processes such as dormir – �duermen have a correct best-fit analysis, despite the absence of any internal stem change exemplars (e.g. o – �ue) in the human-generated inflectional supervision table.",
        "For further robustness, the consensus model of P (Pose I FW) is estimated as a weighted mixture of the part-of-speech tags of the most closely aligned",
        "pseudo-regular generated inflections.",
        "The inflections of closed-class words (such as pronouns, determiners and auxiliary verbs) are not well handled by this generative-alignment model, both due to their often very high irregularity (e.g. the Spanish verb ser (to be)) and/or their typical shortness (e.g. the pronominal inflections of mi, tu, su).",
        "Thus as one final amount of supervision, lists of closed-class words, paired with their inflections and fine-grained part-of-speech tags were entered manually from the grammar book (e.g. aque llas # (aque l) Adj _Dem-fem-plur-p3).",

        "• A suffix-based part-of-speech probability model P(posjJsuffix(wi)) using hierarchically smoothed tries is trained on the raw initial tag distributions, yielding coverage to unseen words and smoothing of low-confidence initial tag assignments.",

        "• Both the tag-sequence and lexical prior models are iteratively retrained using these additional evidence sources and first-pass probability distributions.",
        "The success of this model is based on the assumption that (a) words of the same part of speech tend to have similar tag sequence behavior, and (b) there are sufficient instances of each POS tag labeled by either the morphology models or closed-class entries described in Section 3.",
        "One example where these assumptions do not hold is for the Romanian word a, which has 5 possible POS tags, including Infinit ive_Marker (corresponding to the English word to).",

        "Thus one avenue of potential improvement to these models would be to include limited tagged contexts for ambiguous small class (or singleton class) words, although such supervision is less readily extractable from grammar books by non-native speakers, and was not employed here."

        "However, given the assumptions of minimal supervision, it is not reasonable to require a parser or dependency model to identify non-adjacent agreeing pairs explicitly.",

        "If one makes the assumption that the overwhelming majority of nouns have a single grammatical gender independent of context, we perform smoothing to force nouns with sufficient global context frequency towards their single most likely gender.",
        "Finally, the trie-based suffix model noted in Section 3 can be utilized here to further generalize gender affixal tendencies for use in smoothing poorly represented single words.",
        "Through this approach we successfully discover a wide space of low-entropy gender affix tendencies, including the common -a, dad and -ción feminine affixes in Spanish, without any human or dictionary supervision of nominal gender.",

        "The minimal supervision in this study consisted of an average total of 4 person-hours per language for manually entering the inflectional paradigms and associated parts of speech from a grammar as in Section 3, and an additional average of 3 person-hours per language for dictionary extraction and entry parsing.",

        "The feature of grammatical gender was specifically isolated because it is rarely salient for cross-language applications such as machine translation (where grammatical gender rarely transfers), and because its induction algorithm in Section 4.1 depends heavily on the size of the monolingual corpus (which is small in these experiments, suggesting size-dependent potential for significant further improvement here).",
        "Finally, a post-hoc analysis of the system vs. test data discrepancies showed that a significant number were simply arbitrary differences in annotation convention between the grammar-book analyses and the test data tagging policy.",
