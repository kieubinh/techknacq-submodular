        "The quantity and reliability of linguistic information is primarily determined by the size of the training corpus: with limited data available, extracting statistics for any given language phenomenon and its surrounding context is unreliable.",
        "Overcoming the sparse distribution of linguistic events is a key design problem in any statistical NLP system.",
        "For some tasks, corpus size is no longer a limiting factor, since it has become feasible to acquire homogeneous document collections two or three orders of magnitude larger than existing resources.",
        "Banko and Brill (2001) report on confusion set disambiguation experiments where they apply relatively simple learning methods to a one billion word training corpus.",
        "Their experiments show a logarithmic trend in performance as corpus size increases without performance reaching an upper bound.",
        "This leads them to believe that the development of large scale training material will yield superior results than further experimentation with machine learning methods on existing smaller scale training corpora.",
        "Recent work has replicated the Banko and Brill (2001) results on the much more complex task of automatic thesaurus extraction, showing that contextual statistics, collected over a very large corpus, significantly improve system performance (Curran and Moens, 2002).",
        "Other research has shown that query statistics from a web search engine can be used as a substitute for counts collected from large corpora (Volk, 2001; Keller et al., 2002).",
        "To further investigate the benefits of using very large corpora we empirically analyse the convergence behaviour of unigram probability estimates for a range of words with different relative frequencies.",
        "By dramatically increasing the size of the training corpus, we expect our confidence in the probability estimates for each word to increase.",
        "As theory predicts, unigram probability estimates for many words do converge as corpus size grows.",
        "However, contrary to intuition, we found that for many commonplace words, for example tight-ne s s, there was no sign of convergence as corpus size approaches one billion words.",
        "This suggests that for at least some words, simply using a much larger corpus to reduce sparseness will not yield reliable estimates.",
        "This leads us to conclude that effective use of large corpora demands, rather than discourages, further research into sophisticated statistical language modelling methods.",
        "In our case, this means adding extra conditioning to the model.",
        "Only then could we reasonably predict how much training material would be required to ameliorate sparse statistics problems in NLP.",

        "Figure 1 shows the convergence behaviour of some very frequent closed-class words selected from the PTB.",
        "This graph shows that for most of these extremely common words, the probability estimates are accurate to within approximately ±10% (a ratio of 1 ± 0.1) of their final value for a very small corpus of only 5 million words (the size of the first subset sample).",
        "Some function words, for example, the and in, display much more stable probability estimates even amongst the function words, suggesting their usage is very uniform throughout the corpus.",
        "By chance, there are also some open-class words, such as bringing, form and crucial, that also have very stable probability estimates.",
        "Examples of these are shown in Figure 2.",
        "The main difference between the convergence behaviour of these words and the function words is the fine-grained smoothness of the convergence, because the open-class words are not as uniformly distributed across each sample.",
        "Figure 3 shows the convergence behaviour of commonplace words that appear in the PTB between 30 and 100 times each.",
        "Their convergence behaviour is markedly different to the closed-class words.",
        "We can see that many of these words have very poor initial probability estimates, consistently low by up to a factor of almost 50%, five times worse than the closed-class words.",
        "speculation is an example of convergence from a low initial estimate.",
        "After approximately 800 million words, many (but not all) of the estimates are correct to within about ± 10%, which is the same error as high frequency words sampled from a 5 million words corpus.",
        "This is a result of the sparse distribution of these words and their stronger context dependence.",
        "Their relative frequency is two to three orders of magnitude smaller than the relative frequencies of the closed-class words in Figure 1.",
        "What is most interesting is the convergence behaviour of rare but not necessarily unusual words, which is where using a large corpus should be most beneficial in terms of reducing sparseness.",
        "Figure 4 shows the very large corpus behaviour of selected hapax legomena from the PTB.",
        "Many of the words in this graph show similar behaviour to Figure 3, in that some words appear to converge relatively smoothly to an estimate within ±20% of the final value.",
        "This shows the improvement in stability of the estimates from using large corpora, although ±20% is a considerable deviation from the gold-standard estimate.",
        "However, other words, for instance tightness, fail spectacularly to converge to their final estimate before the influence of the forced convergence of the ratio starts to take effect.",
        "tightness is an extreme example of the case where a word is seen very rarely, until it suddenly becomes very popular.",
        "A similar convergence behaviour can be seen for words with a very high initial estimate in Figure 5.",
        "The maximum decay ratio curve is the curve we would see if a word appeared at the very beginning of the corpus, but did not appear in the remainder of the corpus.",
        "A smooth decay with a similar gradient to the maximum decay ratio indicates that the word is extremely rare in the remainder of the corpus, after a high initial estimate.",
        "rebelled, kilometers and coward are examples of exceedingly high initial estimates, followed by very rare or no other occurrences.",
        "extremists, shelling and cricket are examples of words that were used more consistently for a period of time in the corpus, and then failed to appear later, with cricket having two periods of frequent usage.",
        "Unfortunately, if we continue to assume that a unigram model is correct, these results imply that we cannot be at all confident about the probability estimates of some rare words even with over one billion words of material.",
        "We cannot dismiss this as an unreliable low frequency count because tightness occurs 2652 times in the full corpus.",
        "Thus we must look for an alternative explanation: and the most reasonable explanation is burstiness, the fact that word occurrence is not independent and identically distributed.",
        "So given that one billion words does not always yield reliable estimates for rare but not unusual words, it leaves us to ask if any finite number of words could accurately estimate the probability of pathologically bursty word occurrences."

        "On the other hand, some words appear often in the first 5 million word sample but are not seen again in the remainder of the corpus.",
        "Proper names and topic-specific nouns and verbs",
        "exhibit the most bursty behaviour, since the newspaper articles are naturally clustered together according to the chronologically grouped events.",
        "The most obvious and expected conditioning of the random variables is the topic of the text in question.",
        "However, it is hard to envisage seemingly topic-neutral words, such as tightness and newly, being conditioned strongly on topic.",
        "Other factors that apply to many different types of words include the stylistic and idiomatic expressions favoured by particular genres, authors, editors and even the in-house style guides.",
        "These large corpus experiments demonstrate the failure of simple Poisson models to account for the burstiness of words.",
        "The fact that words are not distributed by a simple Poisson process becomes even more apparent as corpus size increases, particularly as the effect of noise and sparseness on the language model is reduced, giving a clearer picture of how badly the current language models fail.",
        "With a very",
        "large corpus it is obvious that the usual independence assumptions are not always appropriate.",
        "Using very large corpora for simple probability estimation demonstrates the need for more sophisticated statistical models of language.",
        "Without better models, all that training upon large corpora can achieve is better estimates of words which are approximately i.i.d.",
        "To fully leverage the information in very large corpora, we need to introduce more dependencies into the models to capture the non-stationary nature of language data.",
        "This means that to gain a significant advantage from large corpora, we must develop more sophisticated statistical language models.",
        "We should also briefly mention the other main benefit of increasing corpus size: the acquisition of occurrences of otherwise unseen words.",
        "Previously unseen linguistic events are frequently presented to NLP systems.",
        "To handle these unseen events the statistical models used by the system must be smoothed.",
        "Smoothing typically adds considerable computational complexity to the system since multiple models need to be estimated and applied together, and it is often considered a black art (Chen and Goodman, 1996).",

        "The difficulty of obtaining reliable probability estimates is central to many NLP tasks.",
        "Can we improve the performance of these systems by simply using a lot more data?",
        "As might be expected, for many words, estimating probabilities on a very large corpus can be valuable, improving system performance significantly.",
        "This is due to the improved estimates of sparse statistics, made possible by the relatively uniform distribution of these words.",
        "However, there is a large class of commonplace words which fail to display convergent behaviour even on very large corpora.",
        "What is striking about these words is that proficient language users would not recognise them as particularly unusual or specialised in their usage, which means that broad-coverage NLP systems should also be expected to handle them competently.",
        "The non-convergence of these words is an indication of their non-stationary distributions, which a simple Poisson model is unable to capture.",
        "Since it is no longer a problem of sparseness, even exceptionally large corpora cannot be expected to produce reliable probability estimates.",
        "Instead we must relax the independence assumptions underlying the existing language models and incorporate conditional information into the language models.",
        "To fully harness the extra information in a very large corpus we must spend more, and not less, time and effort developing sophisticated language models and machine learning systems."
