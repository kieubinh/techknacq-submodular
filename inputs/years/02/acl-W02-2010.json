        "A careful selection of the feature space is a very important part of classifier design.",
        "The algorithms presented in this paper are using only information that can be extracted directly from the training data: the words, their capitalization information and the chunk tags.",
        "While they can definitely incorporate additional information (such as lists of countries/cities/regions, organizations, people names, etc.",
        "), due to the short exposition space, we decided to restrict them to this feature space.",
        "Table 2 presents the results obtained by running off-the-shelf part-of-speech/text chunking classifiers; all of them use just word information, albeit in different ways.",
        "The leader of the pack is the MX-POST tagger (Ratnaparkhi, 1996).",
        "The measure of choice for the NER task is F-measure, the harmonic mean of precision and recall: F� = 2����� ����R, usually computed with , = 1.",
        "As observed by participants in the MUC-6 and 7 tasks (Bikel et al., 1997; Borthwick, 1999; Miller et",
        "al., 1998), an important feature for the NER task is information relative to word capitalization.",
        "In an approach similar to Zhou and Su (2002), we extracted for each word a 2-byte code, as summarized in Table 1.",
        "The first byte specifies the capitalization of the word (first letter capital, etc), while the second specifies whether the word is present in the dictionary in lower case, upper case, both or neither forms.",
        "These two codes are extracted in order to offer both a way of backing-off in sparse data cases (unknown words) and a way of encouraging generalization.",
        "Table 2 shows the performance of the fnTBL (Ngai and Florian, 2001) and Snow systems when using the capitalization information, both systems displaying considerably better performance."

      "text": [
        "Transformation-based learning (TBL henceforth) is an error-driven machine learning technique which works by first assigning an initial classification to the data, and then automatically proposing, evaluating and selecting the transformations that maximally decrease the number of errors.",
        "Each such transformation, or rule, consists of a predicate and a target.",
        "In our implementation of TBL – fnTBL – predicates consist of a conjunction of atomic predicates, such as feature identity (e.g. wordo = Barcelona), membership in a set (e.g. B – ORG E",
        "TBL has some attractive qualities that make it suitable for the language-related tasks: it can automatically integrate heterogenous types of knowledge, without the need for explicit modeling (similar to Snow, Maximum Entropy, decision trees, etc); it is error–driven, therefore directly minimizes the",
        "ultimate evaluation measure: the error rate; and it has an inherently dynamic behavior1.",
        "TBL has been previously applied to the English NER task (Aberdeen et al., 1995), with good results.",
        "The fnTBL-based NER system is designed in the same way as Brill’s POS tagger (Brill, 1995), consisting of a morphological stage, where unknown words’ chunks are guessed based on their morphological and capitalization representation, followed by a contextual stage, in which the full interaction between the words’ features is leveraged for learning.",
        "The feature templates used are based on a combination of word, chunk and capitalization information of words in a 7-word window around the target word.",
        "The entire template list (133 templates) will be made available from the author’s web page after the conclusion of the shared task."

        "Both the fnTBL and the Snow methods have strengths and weaknesses:",
        "• fnTBL’s strength is represented by its dynamic modeling of chunk tags – by starting in a simple state and using complex feature interactions, it is able to reach a reasonable end-state.",
        "Its weakness consists in its acute myopia: the optimization is done greedily for the local context, and the feature interaction is observed only in the order in which the rules are selected.",
        "• Snow’s strength consists in its ability to model interactions between the all features associated with a sample.",
        "However, in order to obtain good results, the system needs reliable contextual information.",
        "Since the approach is not dynamic by nature, good initial chunk classifications are needed.",
        "One way to address both weaknesses is to combine the two approaches through stacking, by applying Snow on fnTBL’s output.",
        "This allows Snow to have access to reasonably reliable contextual information, and also allows the output of fnTBL to be corrected for multiple feature interaction.",
        "This stacking approach has an intuitive interpretation: first, the corpus is dynamically labeled using the most important features through fnTBL rules (coarse-grained optimization), and then is fine-grained tuned through a few full-feature-interaction iterations of Snow.",
        "Table 2 contrasts stacking Snow and fnTBL with running either fnTBL or Snow in isolation - an improvement of 1.6 F-measure points is obtained when stacking is applied.",
        "Interestingly, as shown in Figure 1, the relation between performance and Snow-iteration number is not linear: the system initially takes a hit as it moves out of the local fnTBL maximum, but then proceeds to increase its performance,",
        "finally converging after 10 iterations to a F-measure value of 73.49."

        "Table 4 shows the results obtained by stacking the FB algorithm on top of fnTBL.",
