        "Most current models of grammar learning assume a set of primitive linguistic categories and constraints, the learning process being modelled as category filling and rule instantiation – rather than category formation and rule creation.",
        "Arguably, distributing linguistic data over predefined categories and templates does not qualify as grammar 'learning' in the strictest sense, but is better described as 'adjustment' or 'adaptation'.",
        "Indeed, Chomsky, the prime advocate of the hypothesis of innate linguistic principles, has claimed that \"in certain fundamental respects we do not really learn language\" (Chomsky 1980: 134).",

        "So, arguably, a speech grammar inducing algorithm should avoid referring to the usual categories of text based linguistics – 'sentence', 'determiner phrase', etc.1 Instead we allow a large, indefinite number of (indistinguishable) basic categories – and then leave it to the learner to shape them, fill them up, and combine them.",
