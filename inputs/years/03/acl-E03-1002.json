        "Many statistical parsers (Ratnaparkhi, 1999; Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2001) are based on a history-based probability model (Black et al., 1993), where the probability of each decision in a parse is conditioned on the previous decisions in the parse.",
        "A major challenge in this approach is choosing a representation of the parse history from which the probability for the next parser decision can be accurately estimated.",
        "Previous approaches have used a hand-crafted finite set of features to represent the unbounded parse history (Ratnaparkhi, 1999; Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2001).",
        "In the work presented here, we automatically induce a finite set of features to represent the unbounded parse history.",
        "We perform this induction using an artificial neural network architecture, called Simple Synchrony Networks (SSNs) (Lane and Henderson, 2001; Henderson, 2000).",
        "Because this architecture is specifically designed for processing structures, it allows us to impose structurally specified and linguistically appropriate biases on the search for a good history representation.",
        "The resulting parser achieves performance far greater than previous approaches to neural network parsing (Ho and Chan, 1999; Costa et al., 2001), and only marginally below the current state-of-the-art for parsing the Penn Treebank.",
        "We propose a hybrid parsing system consisting of two components, a neural network which estimates the parameters of a probability model for phrase structure trees, and a statistical parser which searches for the most probable phrase structure tree given these parameters.",
        "We first present the probability model which is common to these two components, followed by the estimation method, the search method, and a discussion of the empirical results."

        "The probability model we use is generative and history-based.",
        "Generative models are expressed in terms of a stochastic process which generates both the phrase structure tree and the input sentence.",
        "At each step, the process chooses a characteristic of the tree or predicts a word in the sentence.",
        "This sequence of decisions is the derivation of the tree, which we will denote di,...,dm.",
        "Because there is a one-to-one mapping from phrase structure trees to our derivations, the probability of a derivation P(d\\r..,dm) is equal to the joint probability of the derivation's tree and the input sentence.",
        "The probability of the input sentence is a constant across all the candidate derivations, so we only need to find the most probable derivation.",
        "In history-based models (Black et al., 1993), the probability estimate for each derivation decision di is conditioned on the previous derivation decisions c?i,..., which is called the derivation history at step i.",
        "This allows us to use the chain rule for conditional probabilities to derive the probability of the entire derivation as the multiplication of the probabilities for each of its decisions.",
        "The probabilities P(dj|c?i,..., rfi-i) are the parameters of the parser's probability model.",
        "To define the parameters we need to choose the ordering of the decisions in a derivation, such as a top-down or shift-reduce ordering.",
        "The ordering which we use here is that of a form of left-corner parser (Rosenkrantz and Lewis, 1970).",

        "We use the binarized version of a left-corner parser, described in (Manning and Carpenter, 1997), where the parse of each non-leftmost child begins with the parent node predicting the child's leftmost terminal, and ends with the child's root nonterminal attaching to the parent.",

        "The most important step in designing a statistical parser with a history-based probability model is choosing a method for estimating the parameters P(di\\d\\,...,di-\\).",
        "The main difficulty with this estimation is that the history is of unbounded length.",
        "Most probability estimation methods require that there be a finite set of features on which the probability is conditioned.",
        "The standard way to handle this problem is to handcraft a finite set of features which provides a sufficient summary of the unbounded history (Rat-naparkhi, 1999; Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000).",
        "The probabilities are then assumed to be independent of all the information about the history which is not captured by the chosen features.",
        "The difficulty with this approach is that the choice of features can have a large impact on the performance of the system, but it is not feasible to search the space of possible feature sets by hand.",
        "One alternative to choosing a finite set of features is to use kernel methods, which can handle unbounded feature sets, but then efficiency becomes a problem.",
        "Collins and Duffy (2002) define a kernel over parse trees and apply it to re-ranking the output of a parser, but the resulting feature space is restricted by the need to compute the kernel efficiently, and the results are not as good as Collins' previous work on re-ranking using a finite set of features (Collins, 2000).",
        "In this work we use a method for automatically inducing a finite set of features for representing the derivation history.",
        "The method is a form of multi-layered artificial neural network called Simple Synchrony Networks (Lane and Henderson, 2001; Henderson, 2000).",
        "The outputs of this network are probability estimates computed with a log-linear model (also known as a maximum entropy model), as is done in (Ratnaparkhi, 1999).",
        "Log-linear models have proved successful in a wide variety of applications, and are the inspiration behind one of the best current statistical parsers (Charniak, 2000).",
        "The difference from previous approaches is in the nature of the input to the log-linear model.",
        "We do not use handcrafted features, but instead we use a finite vector of real-valued features which are induced as part of the neural network training process.",
        "These induced features represent the information about the derivation history which the training process has decided is relevant to estimating the output probabilities.",
        "In neural networks these feature vectors are called the hidden layer activations, but for continuity with the previous discussion we will refer to them as the history features.",
        "We will denote the history feature computation with the function h, and the output log-linear model with the function o, whose result is a probability distribution over the possible derivation operations.",
        "odi(h{du...,di-i)) « P{di\\dlr..,di-1) The mapping h from the derivation history to the history features is computed with the repeated application of a function g, which maps previous history representations plus predefined features of the derivation history to a real-valued vector.",
        "Because the function g is nonlinear, the induction of these features allows the training process to explore a much more general set of estimators o(h(x)) than would be possible with a log-linear model alone (i.e. o(x)).",
        "This generality makes this estimation method less dependent on the choice of input representation x.",
        "In addition, because the inputs to g include previous history representations, the mapping h is defined recursively.",
        "This recursion allows the input to the system to be unbounded, thereby allowing an unbounded derivation history to be successively compressed into a fixed-length vector of history features.",
        "Training a Simple Synchrony Network (SSN) is similar to training a log-linear model.",
        "First an appropriate error function is defined for the network's outputs, and then some form of gradient descent learning is applied to search for a minimum of this error function.",
        "This learning simultaneously tries to optimize the parameters of the output computation o and the parameters of the mapping h from the derivation history to the history features.",
        "With multi-layered networks such as SSNs, this training is not guaranteed to converge to a global optimum, but in practice a set of parameters whose error is close to the optimum can be found.",
        "The reason no global optimum can be found is that it is intractable to find the optimal mapping h from the derivation history to the history features.",
        "Given this difficulty, it is important to impose appropriate biases on the search for a good set of history features.",
        "The main bias we have exploited in this work is the recency bias in training recursively defined neural networks.",
        "The only trained parameters of the mapping h are the parameters of the function g, which records a subset of the information from a set of previous history representations in a new history representation.",
        "The training process automatically chooses these parameters based on what information needs to be recorded.",
        "The recorded information may be needed to compute the output for the current step, or it may need to be passed on to future history representations to compute a future output.",
        "However, the more history representations intervene between the place where the information is input and the place where the information is needed, the less likely the training is to learn to record this information.",
        "We can exploit this recency bias in inducing history representations by ensuring that information which is known to be important at a given step in the derivation is input directly to that step's history representation, and that as information becomes less relevant it has increasing numbers of history representations to pass through before reaching the step's history representation.",

        "The SSN network then performs the same computation at each position in each sub-derivation.",
        "The unbounded nature of phrase structure trees does not pose a problem for this approach, because increasing the number of nodes only increases the number of times the SSN network needs to perform a computation, and not the number of parameters in the computation which need to be trained.",
        "Each computation which the network performs results in two real-valued vectors, namely the results of the functions o and h. As discussed in the previous section, the function o is simply a log-linear model applied to the result of h. When h is applied to node topi at step i, it computes the history representation h{d\\r.., c?i_i) by applying the function g to a set of predefined features f(di,..., di-i) of the derivation history plus a small set of previous history representations.",

        "These choices determine how information flows from one set of history features to another, and thus determines the inductive bias discussed in the previous section.",
        "The principle we apply when designing D(topj) and f(d\\,...,di-i) is that we want the inductive bias to reflect structural locality.",
        "For this reason, Dfapi) includes nodes which are structurally local to top^ These nodes are the left-corner ancestor of topi (which is below top{ on the stack), top^s left-corner child (its leftmost child, if any), and topi's most recent child (which was topi_1, if any).",
        "For right-branching structures, the left-corner ancestor is the parent, conditioning on which has been found to be beneficial (lohnson, 1998), as has conditioning on the left-corner child (Roark and lohnson, 1999).",
        "Because these inputs include the history features of both the left-corner ancestor and the most recent child, a derivation step % always has access to the history features from the previous derivation step i – 1, and thus (by induction) any information from the entire previous derivation history could in principle be stored in the history features.",
        "Thus this model is making no a priori hard independence assumptions, just a priori soft biases.",
        "As mentioned above, D(topj) also includes topiitself, which means that the inputs to g always include the history features for the most recent derivation step assigned to top^ This input imposes an appropriate bias because the induced history features which are relevant to previous derivation decisions involving topi are likely to be relevant to the decision at step i as well.",
        "As a simple example, in figure 1, the prediction of the left corner terminal of the VP node (step 4) and the decision that the S node is the root of the whole sentence (step 9) are both dependent on the fact that the node on the top of the stack in each case has the label S (chosen in step 3).",
        "The predefined features of the derivation history f(di,...,di-i) which are input to g for node topi at step i are chosen to reflect the information which is directly relevant to choosing the next decision di.",
        "In the parser presented here, these inputs are the last decision d^\\ in the derivation, the label or tag of the sub-derivation's node top{, the tag-word pair for the most recently predicted terminal, and the tag-word pair for top^s left-corner terminal (the leftmost terminal it dominates).",
        "Inputting the last decision is sufficient to provide the SSN with a complete specification of the derivation history.",

        "At each point in a partial derivation which is being pursued by the search, only the 10 best alternative decisions are considered for continuing that derivation.",
        "This was done because we found that the best-first search tended to pursue a large number of alternative labels for a nonterminal before pursuing subsequent derivation steps, even though only the most probable labels ended up being used in the best derivations.",
        "We found that a branching factor of 10 was large enough that it had virtually no effect on validation performance.",
        "The most computationally intensive operation of the parser is computing the probability estimates for the predictions of the next tag-word pair.",
        "To compute the log-linear model of this prediction, it is necessary to compute values for all possible next words, not just the correct next word, because they are needed for normalizing.",
        "Because there are a very large number of words, this is expensive.",
        "To reduce this burden, the parser computes this prediction in two stages, first predicting the tag in the tag-word pair, and then predicting the word conditioned on that tag.",
        "We implement this conditioning as a mixture model (Bishop, 1995), where the tag predictions are the mixing coefficients.",
        "This means that only estimates for the tag-word pairs with the correct tag need to be computed, both in training and testing.",

        "The first possible explanation is that something about the parser design prevents the SSN from fully exploiting lexical information.",
        "One candidate for such a problem is the lack of any inductive bias expressing the importance of lexical heads over non-head words.",
        "The second possible explanation is that the importance of lexical items in previous models is mainly that they provide information about the types of contexts in which the lexical items tend to occur.",
        "This indirect representation of context is not very important if the model has a good representation of the actual context.",
        "The only lexical items which would then be necessary are the idiosyncratic ones, which tend to be high frequency.",
        "This argument is supported by the fact that the non-lexicalized model with induced history features actually does better than the lexicalized model without them (shown in the last line of table 2, and discussed below).",
