        "Automated evaluation of student essay writing is a rapidly growing field.",
        "Over the past few years, at least four commercially automated essay scoring systems have been made available (PEG;Page 1966; e-rafer®Burstein et al., 1998; Intelligent Essay Assessor™ ;Foltz, Kintsch, and Landauer 1998; and, Intellimetric ™; Elliot, 2003).",
        "In addition, based on the demands of users of the automated scoring technology, tools have been developed that perform more detailed evaluations of student writing.",
        "One such application is Critique Writing Analysis Tools.",
        "Critique and e-rater are embedded in a broader writing instruction application, Criterion\" Online Essay Evaluation (see http://www.etstechnologies.com).",
        "Critique performs a number of evaluations on a student essay related to errors in grammar (Chodorow and Leacock, 2000), usage, and mechanics, comments on style, and analysis of essay-based discourse (organization and development) (Burstein et al., 2001 and Burstein and Marcu, 2003, and Burstein, Marcu and Knight, forthcoming).",
        "Many of these capabilities use machine-learning approaches to model each particular kind of analysis.",
        "To develop such tools requires large sets of human annotated data, where judges have annotated information required to train a system to evaluate a particular kind of essay characteristic.",
        "For example, to build a capability to identify sentence fragments, a corpus of essay data needs to be annotated for this kind of ungrammatical sentence.",
        "A capability exists that identifies essay-based discourse elements in essays, for example, thesis statements, and conclusions.",
        "To do this, human judges annotated a corpus of essays for these particular kinds of discourse elements.",
        "The judges' annotations were used to build an essay-based discourse analysis system.",
        "Annotation protocols are required for each task.",
        "For identification of sentence fragments, this is reasonably straightforward.",
        "In terms of essay-based discourse analysis, it is fairly clear-cut.",
        "Though there is a certain amount of debate, annotators can be trained to have a reasonable amount of agreement in classifying essay-based discourse elements.",
        "Style, in contrast to grammar usage and discourse strategy, is tricky in terms of getting people to agree.",
        "It is a strongly subjective measure.",
        "We discuss a system that identifies a specific characteristic of undesirable writing style – overly repetitious word usage.",
        "Unlike identification of sentence fragments, and essay-based discourse strategy, there are no hard-and-fast rules that tell us how often a word must be used in an essay to be considered overly repetitious.",
        "The results reported in this paper indicate that even for a subjective style measure, human judges annotations can be modeled.",
        "The system can label repetitive words with precision, recall, and F-measures upwards of 0.90.",
        "It clearly outperforms all baseline methods described in the paper.",
        "In earlier work with the writing instruction application, \"Writer's Workbench,\" some features associated with style were evaluated, including: average word length, the distribution of sentence lengths, grammatical types of sentences (e.g., simple and complex), the percentage of passive voice verbs, and the percentage of nouns that are nominalizations (see MacDonald et al., 1982 for a complete description of the Writer's Workbench).",
        "In contrast to a subjective measure such as, repetitive word usage, the stylistic features in the Writer's Workbench are not subjective."

        "As noted in the Introduction, the identification of good or bad writing style is highly subjective.",
        "With regard to word overuse in an essay, what one person may find irritating may not really bother someone else.",
        "Our goal in developing this tool was to indicate to students the cases in which word overuse might affect the rating of the paper with regard to its overall quality.",
        "In the annotation protocol, the central guideline for the two human judges was to label as repetitious only those cases where the repetition of a word interfered with the overall quality of the essay.",
        "Both annotators were expert essay graders.",
        "They used a PC-based graphical user interface to label occurrences of repetitious words in a corpus containing 296 essays.",
        "These essay data were randomly selected from a larger set of 5,000 essays.",
        "The final set contained essays from across several populations (6th grade through college freshman), and 11 test question topics.",
        "We hypothesized, a priori, a number of features that could reasonably be associated with word overuse, such that the overuse interfered with a smooth reading of the essay.",
        "Our hypotheses were based on general discussions with the annotators before the annotation process began.",

        "These features are described below in Figure 1.",
        "For each lemmatized word token in an essay, a vector was generated that contained the values for the 7 features.",

        "In Table la, agreement on \"Repeated words\" between judges is somewhat low.",
        "How can we build a system to reliably identify overly repetitious words if judges cannot agree?",
        "If we look in the total set of essays identified by either judge as having some repetition, we find an overlapping set of 40 essays where both judges annotated the essay as having some sort of repetition.",
        "We call this the agreement subset.",
        "Of the essays that Judge 1 annotated as having repetition, approximately 57% (40/70) agreed with Judge 2 as having some sort of repetition; of the essays that Judge 2 annotated with repetitious word use, about 54% (40/74) agreed with Judge 1.",
        "If we look at the total number of \"Repeated words\" labeled by each judge for all essays in Table la, we find that these 40 essays contain the majority of \"Repeated words\" for each judge: 64% (838/1315) for Judge 2, and 60% (767/1292) forjudge 1.",
        "It is possible that even for the essays where judges both agree that there is some kind of repetitive word use, they do not agree on what the repetition is.",
        "Therefore, we want to answer the following question: On the subset of essays where judges agree that there is repetition, do they agree on the same words as being repetitious?",
        "The core agreement with regard to \"Repeated words\" appears to be in these 40 essays.",
        "Table lb shows high agreement between the two judges for \"Repeated words\" in the agreement subset.",
        "The Kappa between the two judges for \"All words\" (repeated + non-repeated) on this subset is 0.88.",
        "Figure 4 in the Appendix shows an example of an essay where both judges annotated the same words as repeated words.",
        "System\" and \"J2 with System.\" Using All Features, agreement for repeated words more closely resembles inter-judge agreement for the agreement subset in Table lb.",
        "It seems that the machine learning algorithm is capturing the patterns of repetitious word use in that set of 40 essays.",
        "Perhaps, an additional explanation as to why each judge has high agreement with the system, is that each judge is internally consistent."

        "Teachers would generally prefer that students try to use synonyms in their writing, instead of the same word, repeatedly.",
        "Feedback about word overuse is helpful in terms of getting students to refine the use of vocabulary in their writing.",
        "Therefore, writing teachers would agree that it is an important capability in an automated essay evaluation system.",
        "The evaluations presented in this paper show that a reliable repetitive word detection system can be built to model human annotations, even though this is a highly subjective writing style measure.",
        "An evaluation of our system indicates that it outperforms all baseline systems.",
        "It also has agreement with a single judge upward of 0.90 with regard to Precision, Recall and F-measures.",
        "As research continues in automated essay scoring, it is standard to try to incorporate in a scoring system, any new features of writing that can be captured automatically.",
        "This new capability to identify repetitious word usage is currently being evaluated in terms of how it can contribute to better accuracy in an automated scoring system.",
        "Preliminary results indicate that the ability to detect if a writer is overusing certain vocabulary can contribute to the overall accuracy of the score from an automated essay scoring system.",
        "We are experimenting with the information about repetitious word usage in different discourse elements in an essay, e.g., thesis statements.",
        "In this case, the detection of repetitious words in these elements could contribute to a method for rating the overall quality of a particular element.",
        "The repetitious word detection system was trained on annotated data across 11 test question topics; however, informal evaluations indicate that the system makes reasonable decisions on any topic.",
        "Though more systematic testing still needs to be done, the system appears to be topic-independent."
