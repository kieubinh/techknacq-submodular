        "This research note reports on the work in progress which regards automatic transformation of phrase-structure syntactic trees of Arabic into dependency-driven analytical ones.",
        "Guidelines for these descriptions have been developed at the Linguistic Data Consortium, University of Pennsylvania, and at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics and the Faculty of Arts, Charles University in Prague, respectively.",
        "The transformation consists of (i) a recursive function translating the topology of a phrase tree into a corresponding dependency tree, and (ii) a procedure assigning analytical functions to the nodes of the dependency tree.",
        "Apart from an outline of the annotation schemes and a deeper insight into these procedures, model application of the transformation is given herein."

      "heading": "1 Introduction",
      "text": [
        "Exploring the relationship between constituency and dependency sentence representations is not a new issue – the first studies go back to the 60's (Gaifman (1965); for more references, see e.g. Schneider (1998)).",
        "Still, some theoretical findings had not been applicable until the first dependency treebanks with well-defined annotation schemes came into existence just in the very last years (Hajic et al., 2001).",
        "The need to convert Arabic treebank data of different descriptions arises from a cooperation between the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC), University of Pennsylvania, and three concerned institutions of Charles University in Prague, namely the Center for Computational Linguistics, the Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics, and the Institute of Comparative Linguistics.",
        "The two parties intend to share the resources they create.",
        "Prior to this exchange, 10,000 words from the LDC Arabic Newswire A Corpus were manually annotated in both syntactic styles as a step to ensure that the annotations are reusable and their concepts mutually compatible.",
        "Here we attempt the constituency-dependency direction of the transfer.",
        "The input data come from the LDC team (Maamouri et al., 2003).",
        "The annotation scheme is based on constituent-syntax bracketing style used at the University of Pennsylvania (Maamouri and Cieri, 2002).",
        "The trees include nodes for surface text tokens as well as non-terminal nodes following from the descriptive grammar.",
        "Not only syntactic elements, but also several kinds of structural reconstructions (traces) are captured here.",
        "Under the analytical tree structure we understand a representation of the surface sentence in form of a dependency tree.",
        "The node set consists of all the tokens determined after morphological analysis of the text, and the sentence root node.",
        "The description recovers the relation between a governor and a node dependent on it.",
        "The nature of the government is expressed by the analytical functions of the nodes being linked.",
        "Let us give a model sentence which in its phonetic transcript and translation reads Wa lam yakun mina 's-sahli Hxlay hi muwagahatu kamirati 't-tilfizyuni wa Sidasati 'l-musawwirTna wa huwa yas<adu 'l-basa.",
        "It was not easy for him to face the television cameras and the lenses of photographers as he was getting on the bus.",
        "Its respective representations in Figures 1 and 2 use glossed tokens which are further split into morphemes and transliterated in Tim Buckwalter's notation of graphemes of the Arabic script.",
        "There are three phenomena to focus on in the trees.",
        "Firstly, occurrence of the empty trace one with its contents moved to np-tpc-i.",
        "Secondly, subtree interpretation may be sensitive to other than the top-level nodes, like when the coordination s conj s produces the subordinate complement clause Pred (Atv) due to the idiomatic context of the pronoun.",
        "Finally to note are complex rearrangements of special constructs, as is the case of np-sbj pp np-prd versus auxp auxp sb nodes and their subtrees.",
        "More discussion follows.",
        "The two tree types in question differ in the topology as well as in the attributes of the nodes.",
        "Thus, the problem is decomposed into two parts:",
        "i) creation of the dependency tree topology, i.e. contraction of the phrase-structure tree based mostly on the concept of phrase heads and on resolution of traces, ii) assignment of labels describing the analytical function of the node within the target tree.",
        "2 Structural Transformation 2.1 The core algorithm",
        "The principle of the conversion of phrase structures into dependency structures is described clearly in Xia and Palmer (2001) as (a) mark the head child of each node in a phrase structure, using the head percolation table, and (b) in the dependency structure, make the head of each non-head child depend on the head of the head-child.",
        "In our implementation, the topology of the analytical tree is derived from the topology of the phrase tree by a recursive function, which has the following input arguments: original phrase tree Tpfir, dependency tree Tdep being created, one particular node Sphr from Tv^r (the root of the phrase subtree to be processed), and node pdep from Tdep(the future parent of the subtree being processed).",
        "The function returns the root of the created analytical subtree.",
        "The recursion works like this:",
        "1.",
        "If Sphr is a terminal node, then create a single analytical node naep in Tdep and attach it below pdep; return ndep; 2.",
        "Otherwise (sphr is a nonterminal), choose the head node hphr among the children of sphr, recursively call the function with hphras the phrase subtree root argument, and store its return value raep (root of the recursively created dependency subtree); recursively call the function for each remaining sp/jr's child nphr,i, and attach the returned subtree root OdeP,i below rdep; return rdep.",
        "Rules for the selection of phrase heads follow from the analytical annotation guidelines.",
        "Predicates are considered the uppermost nodes of a clause, prepositions govern the rest of a prepositional phrase, auxiliary words are annotated as leaves etc.",
        "Non-verbal predication, so frequent in Arabic syntax, is also formalized into the terms of dependency, cf. Smrz et al.",
        "(2002).",
        "With the algorithm taking decisions about the head child before scanning the subtrees of the level, the already mentioned clause huwa yas/adu 'l-basa qualifies improperly as a sister to the predicate yakun of the main clause.",
        "In fact, we are dealing with the so called state or complement clause.",
        "Therefore, corrective shuffling in this respect is inevitable.",
        "Completion of the dependency tree also involves pruning of subtrees which are co-indexed with some trace, and attaching them in place of the referring trace node.",
        "Typically, this is the case for clauses having an explicit subject before the predicate.",
        "In the model sentence, yas'adu retains its role as a predicate of the clause, no matter what function it receives from its governor."

        "The analytical function can be deduced well from the POS of the node and the sequence of labels of all its ancestors in the phrase tree, and from the POS or the lexical attributes of its parent in the dependency tree.",
        "That is why this step succeeds the structural changes.",
        "Problems may appear though if the declared constituents are not consistent enough, relative to the analytical concept.",
        "While np-sbj, pp and np-prd would normally imply sb, auxp and Pnom, these get in principal conflict in the type of nominal predicates like mina 's-sahli followed by an optional object and a rhematic subject.",

        "According to our experience with similar task for Czech, English (Zabokrtsky and Kucerova, 2002) and German, we expect the performance to improve up to 90 % and 85 % as more phenomena are treated.",
