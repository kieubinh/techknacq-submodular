        "This paper describes an algorithm which automatically discovers word senses from free text and maps them to the appropriate entries of existing dictionaries or taxonomies.",
        "Automatic word sense discovery has applications of many kinds.",
        "It can greatly facilitate a lexicographer's work and can be used to automatically construct corpus-based taxonomies or to tune existing ones.",
        "The same corpus evidence which supports a clustering of an ambiguous word into distinct senses can be used to decide which sense is referred to in a given context (SchÃ¼tze, 1998).",
        "This paper is organised as follows.",
        "In section 2, we present the graph model from which we discover word senses.",
        "Section 3 describes the way we divide graphs surrounding ambiguous words into different areas corresponding to different senses, using Markov clustering (van Dongen, 2000).",
        "The quality of the Markov clustering depends strongly on several parameters such as a granularity factor and the size of the local graph.",
        "In section 4, we outline a word sense discovery algorithm which bypasses the problem of parameter tuning.",
        "We conducted a pilot experiment to examine the performance of our algorithm on a set of words with varying degree of ambiguity.",
        "Section 5 describes the experiment and presents a sample of the results.",
        "Finally, section 6 sketches applications of the algorithm and discusses future work.",
        "2 Building a Graph of Similar Words The model from which we discover distinct word senses is built automatically from the British National corpus, which is tagged for parts of speech.",
        "Based on the intuition that nouns which co-occur in a list are often semantically related, we extract contexts of the form Noun, Noun,... and/or Noun, e.g. \"genomic DNA from rat, mouse and dog\".",
        "Following the method in (Widdows and Dorow, 2002), we build a graph in which each node represents a noun and two nodes have an edge between them if they co-occur in lists more than a given number of times .",
        "Following Lin's work (1998), we are currently investigating a graph with verb-object, verb-subject and modifier-noun-collocations from which it is possible to infer more about the senses of systematically polysemous words.",
        "The word sense clustering algorithm as outlined below can be applied to any kind of similarity measure based on any set of features.",
        "Simple cutoff functions proved unsatisfactory because of the bias they give to more frequent words.",
        "Instead we link each word to its top n neighbors where n can be determined by the user (cf. section 4)."

        "Ambiguous words link otherwise unrelated areas of meaning.",
        "E.g. rat and printer are very different in meaning, but they are both closely related to different meanings of mouse.",
        "However, if we remove the mouse-node from its local graph illustrated in figure 1, the graph decomposes into two parts, one representing the electronic device meaning of mouse and the other one representing its animal sense.",
        "There are, of course, many more types of polysemy (cf. e.g. (Kilgarriff, 1992)).",
        "As can be seen in figure 2, wing \"part of a bird\" is closely related to tail, as is wing \"part of a plane\".",
        "Therefore, even after removal of the wing-node, the two areas of meaning are still linked via tail.",
        "The same happens with wing \"part of a building\" and wing \"political group\" which are linked via policy.",
        "However, whereas there are many edges within an area of meaning, there is only a small number of (weak) links between different areas of meaning.",
        "To detect the different areas of meaning in our local graphs, we use a cluster algorithm for graphs (Markov clustering, MCL) developed by van Dongen (2000).",
        "The idea underlying the MCL-algorithm is that random walks within the graph will tend to stay in the same cluster rather than jump between clusters.",
        "The following notation and description of the MCL algorithm borrows heavily from van Dongen (2000).",
        "Let Gw denote the local graph around the ambiguous word w. The adjacency matrix Mqw of a graph Gw is defined by setting {Mqw )pq equal to the weight of the edge between nodes vp and vq.",
        "Normalizing the columns of Mqw results in the Markov Matrix Tqw whose entries (Tqw )pq can be interpreted as transition probability from vq to vp.",
        "It can easily be shown that the k-th power of Tqwlists the probabilities {Tq )pq of a path of length k starting at node vq and ending at node vp.",
        "The MCL-algorithm simulates flow in Gw by iteratively recomputing the set of transition probabilities via two steps, expansion and inflation.",
        "The expansion step corresponds with talcing the k-th power of Tqw as outlined above and allows nodes to see new neighbours.",
        "The inflation step takes each matrix entry to the r-th power and then rescales each column so that the entries sum to l.Via inflation, popular neighbours are further supported at the expense of less popular ones.",
        "Flow within dense regions in the graph is concentrated by both expansion and inflation.",
        "Eventually, flow between dense regions will disappear, the matrix of transition probabilities Tqw will converge and the limiting matrix can be interpreted as a clustering of the graph."

        "The output of the MCL-algorithm strongly depends on the inflation and expansion parameters r and k as well as the size of the local graph which serves as input to MCL.",
        "An appropriate choice of the inflation parameter r can depend on the ambiguous word w to be clustered.",
        "In case of homonymy, a small inflation parameter r would be appropriate.",
        "However, there are ambiguous words with more closely related senses which are metaphorical or metonymic variations of one another.",
        "In that case, the different regions of meaning are more strongly interlinked and a small power coefficient r would lump different meanings together.",
        "Usually, one sense of an ambiguous word w is much more frequent than its other senses present in the corpus.",
        "If the local graph handed over to the MCL process is small, we might miss some of u>'s meanings in the corpus.",
        "On the other hand, if the local graph is too big, we will get a lot of noise.",
        "Below, we outline an algorithm which circumvents the problem of choosing the right parameters.",
        "In contrast to pure Markov clustering, we don't try to find a complete clustering of Gw into senses at once.",
        "Instead, in each step of the iterative process, we try to find the most disctinctive cluster c of Gw (i.e. the most distinctive meaning of w) only.",
        "We then recompute the local graph Gw by discriminating against c's features.",
        "This is achieved, in a manner similar to Pantel and Lin's (2002) sense clustering approach, by removing c's features from the set of features used for finding similar words.",
        "The process is stopped if the similarity between w and its best neighbour under the reduced set of features is below a fixed threshold.",
        "Let F be the set of w's features, and let L be the output of the algorithm, i.e. a list of sense clusters initially empty.",
        "The algorithm consists of the following steps:",
        "1.",
        "Compute a small local graph Gw around w using the set of features F. If the similarity between w and its closest neighbour is below a fixed threshold go to 6.",
        "2.",
        "Recursively remove all nodes of degree one.",
        "Then remove the node corresponding with w from Gw.",
        "3.",
        "Apply MCL to Gw with a fairly big inflation parameter r which is fixed.",
        "4.",
        "Take the \"best\" cluster (the one that is most strongly connected to w in Gw before removal of w), add it to the final list of clusters L and remove/devalue its features from F. 5.",
        "Go back to 1 with the reduced/devalued set of features F. 6.",
        "Go through the final list of clusters L and assign a name to each cluster using a broad-coverage taxonomy (see below).",
        "Merge semantically close clusters using a taxonomy-based semantic distance measure (Budanit-sky and Hirst, 2001) and assign a class-label to the newly formed cluster.",
        "7.",
        "Output the list of class-labels which best represent the different senses of w in the corpus.",
        "The local graph in step 1 consists of w, the n\\ neighbours of w and the 112 neighbours of the neighbours of w. Since in each iteration we only attempt to find the \"best\" cluster, it suffices to build a relatively small graph in 1.",
        "Step 2 removes noisy strings of nodes pointing away from Gw.",
        "The removal of w from Gw might already separate the different areas of meaning, but will at least significantly loosen the ties between them.",
        "In our simple model based on noun co-occurrences in lists, step 5 corresponds to rebuilding the graph under the restriction that the nodes in the new graph not co-occur (or at least not very often) with any of the cluster members already extracted.",
        "The class-labelling (step 6) is accomplished using the taxonomic structure of WordNet, using a robust algorithm developed specially for this purpose.",
        "The hypernym which subsumes as many cluster members as possible and does so as closely as possible in the taxonomic tree is chosen as class-label.",
        "The family of such algorithms is described in (Widdows, 2003)."
