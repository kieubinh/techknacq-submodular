        "The SUMTlME project aims to develop generic techniques to produce textual summaries of time series data (Sripada et al., 2001).",
        "We initially worked in two domains, meteorology and gas turbines.",
        "In meteorology we generate textual weather forecasts from weather data such as wind speed, wind direction, and wave heights.",
        "In gas turbines we generate textual summaries of unexpected patterns in sensor data such as exhaust temperature, liquid fuel flow, and turbine speed.",
        "In each of these domains we are working with industrial collaborators and have built prototype systems.",
        "Using the experience from both these domains we have now started working on physiological time series data in collaboration with NEONATE (Ewing et al., 2002) project.",
        "The main objective of NEONATE has been to produce a decision support system for the medical personnel working in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).",
        "In the NEONATE project, a research nurse has been employed to collect data from the neonatal intensive care unit at Simpson Maternity Hospital, Edinburgh using a software tool, BabyWatch (Ewing et al., 2002).",
        "Physiological parameters such as heart rate, mean blood pressure and temperature are recorded at one-second frequency using various probes attached to the baby.",
        "In order to monitor the health of babies, medical personnel (doctors and nurses) working in the neonatal unit are required to inspect such data continually.",
        "Currently they use visual displays of the data.",
        "Our system will generate textual summaries of these data as an aid to the medical personnel.",
        "We believe that interpreting textual summaries is lot quicker and does not require much mathematical (statistical) knowledge when compared to interpreting graphical displays."

      "text": [
        "We have carried out a variety of knowledge acquisition (KA) activities using multiple techniques developed in the expert system community (Scott, Clayton, and Gibson, 1991) to understand how humans perform data summarization.",
        "Figure 1 shows a time series plot of mean blood pressure sampled every second for three hours.",
        "Figure 2 shows its summary extracted from a small corpus of human written summaries we analyzed.",
        "The summary text in Figure 2 has the doctor's interpretation of the data (for instance, this is an inadequate blood pressure and '.. and I suspect that dopamine has been started ...') interwoven with pure data description (for instance, '...BP is fairly stable at round about 30kpa ....').",
        "Based on our KA studies we have made a number of observations about neonatal data summarization.",
        "A few of them are:",
        "• Raw data contains a number of artifacts due to external events such as baby handling and blood sampling.",
        "These artifacts need to be separated from the input data before summarizing.",
        "The example data shown in Figure 1, contains one blood sampling artifact at 4:08.",
        "• Summaries should report rises and falls in the data.",
        "• Summaries should report actual numerical values of the parameter being summarized.",
        "Artifact separation was not required in the other two domains; it was unique to neonatal data.",
        "One of the experts, with whom we did KA explained that physiological data without artifacts reflect the true physiology of the underlying baby.",
        "He explained further that artifact data could be interesting in its own right if summarized separately because such summaries show how the underlying baby is reacting to the external actions.",
        "Interestingly, we have made some general observations about data summarization across all the three domains.",
        "• Summarization needs some domain knowledge reflecting how data will be used.",
        "In the domain of neonatal care it is in the form of knowledge about artifacts.",
        "In the domain of meteorology it is in the form of knowledge of what is important.",
        "For example, changes in wind speeds and directions are important in marine forecasts but not in public forecasts unless gales are predicted.",
        "Finally in the domain of gas turbine it is in the form of important patterns.",
        "For instance, damped oscillations and steps are significant for monitoring turbines.",
        "• This knowledge, however, can be integrated into standard data analysis al go-On the BP trace the BP is fairly stable at round about 30kpa until 04:20 with the exception of the blood sampling artifact at just about 04:08.",
        "This is an inadequate blood pressure and has fallen further at 04:20 and I suspect that dopamine has been started at this point because from about 04:23 there is a steady increase in the BP until 04:50 when the BP is now 40.",
        "This is much more adequate.",
        "There are in some oscillations presumably as the infusion rate of dopamine has been turned down until the BP settles down to round about 34. rithms.",
        "In the domain of meteorology user thresholds have been used for determining stopping criterion for segmentation.",
        "In the domain of gas turbines domain knowledge has been used for classifying patterns."

        "Finally the fourth module, realization is responsible for generating the grammatical output.",
        "We have used the small corpus we collected from NEONATE, to build the micro planner and realizer.",
        "The most important question in summarization is 'what data points from the input should be included in the summary?'",
        "Any model of summarization needs to find ways to reduce the size of the input data set (or improve its accessibility) without significantly altering its content (or informa-tiveness).",
        "This process is sensitive to the domain constraints such as limits on parameter values.",
        "It is clear from our own studies on data summarization and also from the earlier studies by others (Shahar, 1997; Boyd, 1998; Kulkich, 1983) that data summarization needs data analysis to determine the trends and patterns present in the data set.",

        "There are many algorithms for segmentation developed in the KDD community.",
        "These algorithms differ from each other in the control information they use and the way they process data (such as top-down and bottom-up).",
        "We have selected one of them known as the bottom-up algorithm.",
        "This algorithm has been explained in great detail in (Keogh et al., 2001) and will not be described here.",
        "According to Keogh's description, the number of segments produced (which determines the detail to which the data is summarized) depends upon a user-specified limit.",
        "In our case, this limit cannot be the same for all segments.",
        "Segments joining smaller values might have different error limit compared to those that join larger values.",
        "These user-defined limits (thresholds) control the segmentation process in a way suited for summarization.",
        "In general, data analysis algorithms such as segmentation need to be adapted to suit the summarization requirements (Sripada et al., 2002).",
        "For the initial prototype we have assumed a variety of control values and produced output summaries for each.",
        "We intend to obtain feedback on this from the doctors.",

        "In our case, summary series contains intervals with similar trend.",
        "In some cases, content for the summary could be derived from all the intervals in the summary series.",
