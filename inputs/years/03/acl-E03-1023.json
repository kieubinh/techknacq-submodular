        "Translation knowledge acquisition from parallel/comparative corpora is one of the most important research topics of corpus-based MT.",
        "This is because it is necessary for an MT system to (semi-)automatically increase its translation knowledge in order for it to be used in the real world situation.",
        "One limitation of the corpus-based translation knowledge acquisition approach is that the techniques of translation knowledge acquisition heavily rely on availability of parallel/comparative corpora.",
        "However, the sizes as well as the domain of existing parallel/comparative corpora are limited, while it is very expensive to manually collect parallel/comparative corpora.",
        "Therefore, it is quite important to overcome this resource scarcity bottleneck in corpus-based translation knowledge acquisition research.",
        "In order to solve this problem, this paper focuses on bilingual news articles on WWW news sites as a source for translation knowledge acquisition.",
        "In the case of WWW news sites in Japan,",
        "Within this framework of translation knowledge acquisition from WWW news sites, this paper studies issues on the effect of cross-language retrieval of relevant texts in bilingual lexicon acquisition from comparable corpora.",
        "First, we show that, due to its computational complexity, it is difficult to straightforwardly apply previously studied techniques of bilingual term correspondence estimation from comparable corpora, especially in the case of large scale evaluation such as those presented in this paper.",
        "Then, we show that, with the help of cross-language retrieval of relevant texts, this computational difficulty can be easily avoided by reducing the candidate bilingual term pairs against which bilingual term correspondences are estimated.",

        "Previously studied techniques of estimating bilingual term correspondences from comparable corpora are mostly based on the idea that semantically similar words appear in similar contexts (Fung, 1995; Rapp, 1995; Kaji and Aizono, 1996; Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996; Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Tanaka, 2002).",
        "In those techniques, frequency information of contextual words co-occurring in the monolingual text is stored and their similarity is measured across languages.",
        "The following gives a rough formalization of the previous approaches to acquiring bilingual term correspondences from comparable corpora.",
        "Suppose that CCe and CCj denote an English corpus and a Japanese corpus, respectively, and that they can be considered as comparable corpora.",
        "Then, in the previous approaches, for each English term in CCe and each Japanese term tj in CCj, occurrences of surrounding words are recorded in the form of some vector cv(tE, CCe) and cv(tj, CCj), respectively.",
        "In previous works, as weights of these contextual vectors, word frequencies or modified weights such as tf â–  idf are used.",
        "Finally, for every pair of an English term and a Japanese term tj, bilingual term correspondence corrEj{tE,tj) is estimated in terms of a certain similarity measure sim(cv(tE,CCE),cv(tj,CCj)) between contextual vectors cv(tE, CCe) and cv(tj, CCj): Here, in the modeling of contextual similarities across languages, earlier works such as Fung (1995), Rapp (1995), and Tanaka and Iwasaki (1996) studied to measure the similarities of contextual co-occurrence patterns across languages without the help of any existing bilingual lexicons.",
        "On the other hand, later works such as Kaji and Aizono (1996), Fung and Yee (1998), Rapp (1999), and Tanaka (2002) studied to exploit existing bilingual lexicons as initial seed for modeling of contextual similarities across languages.",
        "As the similarity measure sim(cv(tE,CCE)-,cv(tj,CCj)) between contextual vectors cv(tE,CCE) and cv(tj,CCj), measures such as cosine measure, dice coefficient, and Jaccard coefficient are used."

        "dj as well as the Japanese translation dj of each English article are next segmented into word sequences, and word frequency vectors v(dj) and v(djIT) are generated.",
        "Then, cosine similarities between v(dj) and v(djIT) are calculated and pairs of articles dj and dE which satisfy certain criterion are considered as candidates for \"identical\" or \"relevant\" article pairs.",
        "As will be described in section 4.1, on WWW news sites in Japan, the number of articles updated per day is far greater (5^30 times) in Japanese than in English.",
        "Thus, it is much easier to find cross-lingually relevant articles for each English query article than for each Japanese query article.",
        "Considering this fact, we estimate bilingual term correspondences from the results of cross-lingually retrieving relevant Japanese articles with English query articles.",
        "For each English query article d'E in CCe and its Japanese translation d jIT', the set D j of Japanese articles with cosine similarities higher than or equal to a certain lower bound Ld is constructed: This section describes the techniques we apply to the task of estimating bilingual term correspondences from cross-lingually relevant texts.",
        "Here, we compare several techniques in order to evaluate the effect of cross-language retrieval of relevant texts in the performance of acquiring bilingual term correspondences from comparable corpora.",
        "In the first technique, we regard cross-lingually relevant texts as a pseudo-parallel corpus, where standard techniques of estimating bilingual term correspondences from parallel corpora are employed.",
        "In the second technique, we regard cross-lingually relevant texts as a comparable corpus, where bilingual term correspondences are estimated in terms of contextual similarities across languages.",
        "In this second approach, we further evaluate the effect of cross-language retrieval of relevant texts by comparing the cases with/without reducing candidates of bilingual term pairs with the help of cross-lingually relevant text pairs.",
        "Here, we describe how to estimate bilingual term correspondences from cross-lingually relevant texts by regarding them as a pseudo-parallel corpus.",
        "First, we concatenate constituent Japanese articles of Dj into one article D'j, and regard the article pair dE and D'j as a pseudo-parallel sentence pair.",
        "Next, we collect such pseudo-parallel sentence pairs and construct a pseudo-parallel corpus PPCej of English and Japanese articles: Then, we apply standard techniques of estimating bilingual term correspondences from parallel corpora (Matsumoto and Utsuro, 2000) to this pseudo-parallel corpus PPCej.",
        "First, from a pseudo-parallel sentence pair dlE and D'j, we extract monolingual (possibly compound) term pair where those term pairs are possibly required to satisfy frequency lower bounds and the upper bound of the number of constituent words.",
        "Tnen, based on the contingency table of co-occurrence frequencies of tE ana t j below, we estimate bilingual term correspondences according to the statistical measures such as the mutual information, the cj> statistic, the dice coefficient, and the log-likelihood ratio.",
        "We compare the performance of those four measures, where the <p statistic and the log-likelihood ratio perform best, the dice coefficient the second best, and the mutual information the worst.",
        "In section 4.3, we show results with the <fi statistic as the bilingual term correspondence corrEj{tE-, tj): 2/ (ad â€“ be) Next, we describe how to estimate bilingual term correspondences from cross-lingually relevant texts by regarding them as a comparable corpus.",
        "Here, when selecting the candidates of bilingual term pairs against which bilingual term correspondences are estimated, we evaluate two approaches.",
        "In the first approach, as described in section 2 for the case of acquisition from comparable corpora, for every pair of an English term and a Japanese term, bilingual term correspondence is estimated.",
        "In the second approach, on the other hand, as described in the previous section for the case of acquisition from (pseudo-) parallel corpora, the candidates of bilingual term pairs are selected from a pseudo-parallel sentence pair dlE and Dj as in the formula (2).",
        "In this second approach, we intend to evaluate the effect of cross-language retrieval of relevant texts in the performance of acquiring bilingual term correspondences from comparable corpora, i.e., in reducing useless bilingual term pairs and in increasing the estimated confidence of useful bilingual term pairs.",
        "More specifically, first, a reduced but cross-lingually more relevant comparable corpus is constructed from the result of cross-language retrieval of relevant news articles in section 3.1.",
        "Referring to the definition of the set D j of relevant Japanese articles in the equation (1), the reduced English corpus RCe is constructed by collecting English query articles each of which has at least one relevant Japanese article: Next, the reduced Japanese corpus RCj that is cross-lingually relevant to RCe is constructed by collecting those relevant Japanese articles: Then, for each English term i# in RCe and each Japanese term tj in RCj, occurrences of surrounding words are recorded in the form of some vector cv(tE, RCe) and cv(tj, RCj), respectively.",
        "Here, more precisely, the contextual vector cv(tE, RCe) of an English term tE is constructed by summing up the word frequency vector v(sjITl) of Japanese translation Sj4Tl of each English sentence sE which contains tE'.",

        "Here, it is important to note that bilingual term correspondence estimation by \"pseudo-parallel with CLIR\" has another advantage over that by \"contextual similarity with CLIR: reduced/full\" in terms of computational complexity.",
        "Also note that the performance of \"pseudo-parallel with CLIR\" is affected little by the similarity lower bounds On the other hand, for \"contextual similarity with CLIR: reduced/full\", the performance becomes worse as the similarity lower bound Ld becomes smaller and the cross-lingually relevant English/Japanese corpus RCe and RCj becomes noisier.",
        "More specifically, for \"full\", as the similarity lower bound Ld becomes smaller, more and more correct bilingual term pairs become outside of the 100-best candidates.",
        "For \"reduced\", the rate of correct bilingual term pairs included within the 5-best candidates decreases from 70 to 40%, and that within the 10-best decreases from 73 to 45%, as the similarity lower bound Ld becomes smaller.",
        "Furthermore, \"reduced\" outperforms \"full\" and their performance gap seems to become larger as the similarity lower bound Ld becomes larger.",
