        "Current machine translation technology is not able to guarantee high quality translations for large domains.",
        "Hence, in many applications, post-editing of the machine translation output is necessary.",
        "In such an environment, the main goal of the machine translation system is not to produce translations that are understandable for an inexperienced recipient but to support a professional human post-editor.",
        "Typically, a better quality of the produced machine translation text yields a reduced post-editing effort.",
        "From an application point of view, many additional aspects have to be considered: the user interface, the used formats and the additional support tools such as lexicons, terminological databases or translation memories.",
        "The concept of interactive machine translation, first suggested by (Foster et al., 1996), finds a very natural implementation in the framework of statistical machine translation.",
        "In interactive machine translation, the basic idea is to provide an environment to a human translator that interactively reacts upon the input as the user writes or corrects the translation.",
        "In such an approach, the system suggests an extension of a sentence that the human user either accepts or ignores.",
        "An implementation of such a tool was performed in the TransType project (Foster et al., 1996; Foster et al., 1997; Langlais et al., 2000).",
        "The user interface of the TransType system combines a machine translation system and a text editor into a single application.",
        "The human translator types the translation of a given source text.",
        "For each prefix of a word, the machine translation system computes the most probable extension of this word and presents this to the user.",
        "The human translator either accepts this translation by pressing a certain key or ignores the suggestion and continues typing.",
        "Rather than single-word predictions, as in the TransType approach, it is preferable that the suggested extension consists of multiple words or whole phrases.",
        "Ideally, the whole sentence should be suggested completely and the human translator should have the freedom to accept any prefix of the suggested translation.",
        "In the following, we will first describe the problem from a statistical point of view.",
        "For the resulting decision rule, we will describe efficient approximations based on word hypotheses graphs.",
        "Afterwards, we will present some results.",
        "Finally, we will describe the implemented prototype system."
