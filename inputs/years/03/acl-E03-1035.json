        "Multiword phrases may have nonliteral translations, or one of several equally valid literal translations may be strongly preferred in practice.",
        "Automatically learning translations of single words from parallel corpora has been much studied over the past ten years or so (Melamed, 2000, and references), but learning translations of multiword phrases has received less attention.",
        "(See Section 5 for a review of prior work in this area.)",
        "In this paper, we develop a new approach to learning phrase translations from parallel corpora, and show that it performs with very high coverage and accuracy on a named-entity phrase translation task.",
        "Moreover, analysis of a subset of our evaluation results suggests that the method should also perform well on more general phrase translation tasks.",
        "In our approach, we are given a sentence-aligned parallel corpus annotated with a set of phrases in one of the two languages (the source language), and our goal is identify the corresponding phrases in the corpus in the other language (the target language), ranking the translation pairs in order of confidence.",
        "Certain segments of the target language corpus may be annotated as constituting lexical compounds, which may or may not include the translations of the source language phrases of interest.",

      "text": [
        "Named-entity expressions (Chinchor and Marsh, 1997) are any words or phrases that name a specific entity.",
        "While often thought of in terms of categories such as persons, organizations, or locations, in technical text a much wider range of types of entities are often named.",
        "In software manuals, for example, named-entity expressions inelude names of menu items, dialogue boxes, software systems, etc.",
        "While named-entity expressions are typically used as proper nouns, those encountered in technical text often do not have the syntactic form of nouns or noun phrases.",
        "Consider, Click the View Source Tables button.",
        "In this sentence, View Source Tables has the syntactic form of a nonfinite verb phrase, but it is used like a proper noun.",
        "It would be difficult to recognize as a named-entity expression, except for the fact that in English, all or most of the words in named-entity expressions are typically capitalized.",
        "Capitalization conventions of French and Spanish, however, make it harder to recognize named-entity phrases, because often only the first word of the phrase is capitalized.",
        "For example, in our data, the French translation of View Source Tables is Afficher les tables source.",
        "Embedded in a sentence, it is difficult to determine the extent of such a named-entity expression using only monolingual lexical information.",
        "If we could fully parse the sentence, we might be able to recognize Afficher les tables source as a named-entity expression; but it is very difficult to parse a sentence where something that looks like a nonfinite verb phrase is used like a proper noun, unless the parser already knows that there is something special about that phrase.",
        "Our problem, therefore, is to find the phrases that are translations of the English expressions, without necessarily having previously recognized that they are in fact complete phrases.",
        "Our approach addresses the identification and translation problems simultaneously.",
        "Taking English as our source language, we use capitalization clues to identify named-entity phrases in the English portion of a sentence-aligned parallel corpus, and then we apply statistical techniques to decide which contiguous sequences of words in the target language portion of the corpus are most likely to correspond to the English phrases.",
        "We can then add the learned named-entity phrases to a phrasal lexicon that can be used to better parse target language sentences, as well as adding the translation pairs to a bilingual translation dictionary."

      "heading": "3 The Algorithm",
      "text": [
        "Our algorithm begins by computing a fairly simple bilingual-word-association metric on the parallel corpus, which is then used to construct three progressively more refined phrase translation models.",
        "The first model is used only to initialize the second, which in turn is used only to initialize the third, which is the model actually used.",
        "Although the algorithm is designed to take advantage of some special properities of named-entity phrase translation, it is in no way limited to this task, and can be applied to any phrase translation task in which a set of fixed phrases can be inden-tified on one side of a bilingual parallel corpus, whose translations on the on the other side are desired.",
        "A random sample of the output of our phrase translation learner is shown in Table l. All these examples, except for the last, were judged to be correct in context in our evaluation.",
        "In addition to statistics derived from the corpus, the first model embodies two nonstatistical heuristics.",
        "The first is simply that we do not hypothesize translations of source language phrases that would require splitting predetermined lexical compounds, if any, in the target language.",
        "The second heuristic is that if the phrase whose translation is sought occurs in exactly the same form in the target language sentence as in the source language sentence, we assume that it is the corresponding phrase in that sentence with probability 1.0.",
        "This is a very important heuristic in our test corpus, because almost 17% of the source language test phrases are names or technical terms that occur untranslated in the target language text.",
        "We start by measuring the degree of association between a source language word s and a target language word t (ignoring upper/lower case distinctions) in terms of the frequencies with which s occurs in sentences of the source language part of the corpus and t occurs in sentences of the target language part of the corpus, compared to the frequency with which s and t co-occur in aligned sentences of the corpus.",
        "The particular measure we use is the log-likelihood-ratio statistic recommended by Dunning (1993).",
        "In the past we have found that this word-association metric provides an excellent basis for 'Words joined by \"_\" were indentified as compounds by the monolingual tokenizers prior to applying our algorithm.",
        "Table 1 : Random sample of translations produced.",
        "learning single-word translation relationships, and the higher the score, the more likely the association is to be a true translation relation.",
        "However, with this particular metric there is no obvious way to combine the scores for indvidual word pairs into a composite score for phrase translation candidates; so we use the scores indirectly to estimate some relevant probabilities, which can then be combined to yield a composite score.",
        "To do this, we make another pass through the parallel corpus, and for each word s in the source language sentence of an aligned sentence pair, we note which word t in the target language sentence of the pair has the strongest association with s. If there is no word having a positive association with s above a certain cut-off, we take the empty word e to have the highest association with s in the given sentence pair.",
        "We do this in both directions, since even if the word most strongly associated with s is t, the word most strongly associated with t might be some other word s'.",
        "For each pair of words s and t, we keep a count of how many times t occurs as the word most strongly associated with s, and vice versa.",
        "From these counts, we estimate (using a modified form of Good-Turing smoothing) the probability Pi(t\\s) that an occurrence of a source language word s will have a word t as its most strongly associated word in the corresponding aligned target language sentence, as well as the probability P[(s\\t) that an occurrence of a target language word t will have a word s as its most strongly associated word in the corresponding aligned source language sentence.",
        "The key idea of our first model is that if a candidate substring of a target language sentence corresponds to a selected source language phrase, then the words in the candidate target language substring should associate most strongly with words of the selected target language phrase, and the words of the target language sentence outside the candidate substring should associate most strongly with words of the source language sentence outside the selected phrase.",
        "We compute a composite score for a particular partitioning of the target language sentence by summing the logarithms of the association probabilities for the strongest associations we can find of words in the selected source language phrase to words in the candidate target language substring (and vice versa), which we call the inside score, added to the sum of the logarithms of the association probabilities for the strongest associations we can find for the words of the source language sentence outside the selected phrase to the words of the target language sentence outside the candidate substring (and vice versa), which we call the outside score.",
        "Symbolically, let s,s' be words in the source language sentence S; let t, t' be words in the target language sentence T; let S' be a substring of S; let T' be a substring of T conjectured to be the translation of S'.",
        "Then, Thus if a target language word outside the candidate translation has a high probability of associating with a source language word in the selected phrase, that candidate translation is likely to get a lower composite score than another candidate translation that does include that particular target language word.",
        "While this is not actually a generative model, the probabilities being combined are comparable, and it seems to work well in practice.",
        "Since in named-entity translation from English to Spanish or French, capitalization is relevant in determining the phrase translation (and since the word-association statistic ignores capitalization), we add to the composite score a log probability estimated for three capitalization possibilities: the target language phrase begins with a capitalized word, the target language phrase has no capitalized words, or the target language phrase contains capitalized words, but does not begin with one.",
        "Let Pcapt(T\") represent the probability that a target language translation of a source language named-entity expression falls into the capitalization class of T. The final expression for the Model 1 score of a source language phrase S' and a hypothesized target language translation T\" is, then, The capitalization class probabilities are initially taken to be uniform and are iteratively recomputed by Viterbi re-estimation.",
        "In this way, we are able to learn that an English named-entity phrase is likely to correspond to a Spanish or French phrase in which the first word is capitalized.",
        "This is only a strong probability and not a certainty, however.",
        "In the random sample of the output of our system that we selected for evaluation, we found that 20% of the source language phrases had hypothesized target language translations in which the first word is not capitalized.",
        "Model 2 replaces the inside score and capitalization log probability of the Model 1 by a new inside score computed as the logarithm of a holistic estimate of the conditional probability of the target language candidate occurring as the translation of the source language phrase, P2(T'\\S'), times the conditional probability of the source language phrase occuring as the translation of the target language candidate, P2(S'\\T').",
        "This unusual statistic was chosen to mirror as closely as possible the structure of the first model; we are simply replacing approximations of these probabilities estimated from sets of single-word associations with estimates based on occurrences of the complete phrases.",
        "This whole-phrase-based inside score is combined with the original word-association-based outside score, using a scale factor a to account for the fact that the new version of the inside score can be expected to have a different degree of variability from the one it is replacing.",
        "If we did not do this, the exaggerated variance due to false independence assumptions in the individual probabilities combined in the computation of the outside score would overwhelm the reduced variance of the inside score.",
        "The scale factor a is simply the ratio of the standard deviation of the inside scores as estimated in the first model and the standard deviation of the initial estimates of the inside scores for the second model.",
        "The Model 2 scores, then, are of the form The initial values for the phrase translation probabilities are estimated according to the first model, and iteratively re-estimated using EM, by treating the Model 2 scores as log probabilities and normalizing them across the candidate translations in each sentence pair for each source language phrase.",
        "The effect of moving from Model 1 to Model 2 is to let tendencies in the translation of particular phrases across sentences influence the choice of a translation in a particular sentence.",
        "If a given phrase has a clearly preferred translation in several sentences, that can be taken into account in choosing a translation for the phrase in a sentence where the individual word association probabilities leave the translation of the phrase unclear.",
        "Model 3 consists of computing the log-likelihood-ratio metric for all the selected phrases and candidate translations, based on the whole phrases rather than the individual words composing them, but counting as co-occurrences only pairs consisting of a selected phrase and its highest scoring candidate translation in a particular aligned sentence pair.",
        "We initialize this model by finding the highest scoring translation of each occurrence of each selected source language phrase according to Model 2, and we iteratively recompute the parameters using Viterbi re-estimation.",
        "When this re-estimation converges, we have our final set of phrase translation scores, in terms of the log-likelihood-ratio metric for whole phrases.",
        "The main point of Model 3 is to obtain a consistent set of log-likelihood-ratio scores to use as a confidence measure for the phrase translation pairs.",
        "This could be computed just in a single pass, but the Viterbi re-estimation ensures that the data we are computing the log-likelihood-ratio scores from is consistent with the resulting scores.",
        "That is, it ensures that we do not count an instance in the data of a particular translation pair, when there is a higher scoring possibility according to the confidence measure we are computing."

        "These included cases where English words were incorrectly included in or omitted from the phrase so that there was no single corresponding French phrase, or where an incorrect identification of a French lexical compound connected words in the translation of the English phrase with words not in the translation.",
        "The remaining 15% of the cases excluded from \"good input\" were cases where the French sentence simply did not contain any phrase corresponding to the English phrase, either because of free translation or because of errors in sentence alignment.",

        "Dagan and Church's translationproposing method somewhat resembles a crude version of our Model 1, and Kupiec's method is somewhat like our Model 3 (replacing log-likihood-ratio scores with joint probabilities and Viterbi re-estimation with EM); otherwise, all the methods are quite different.",
