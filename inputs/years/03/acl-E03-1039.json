        "We present a new grammar formalism for parsing with freer word-order languages, motivated by recent linguistic research in German and the Slavic languages.",
        "Unlike CFGs, these grammars contain two primitive notions of constituency that are used to preserve the semantic or interpretational aspects of phrase structure, while at the same time providing a more efficient backbone for parsing based on word-order and contiguity constraints.",
        "A simple parsing algorithm is presented, and compilation of grammars into Constraint Handling Rules is also discussed."

      "heading": "1 Motivation",
      "text": [
        "There is a growing awareness among computational linguists that, in order for the functionality of current real-world natural language applications to progress to the next level, access to thematic roles and grammatical function assignment, i.e., \"who did what to whom,\" will be just as important as a probabilistic model's ability to predict the next word in a string.",
        "In striving to represent useful meaning relations, we, and the annotated corpora we use, have dutifully followed the common assumption in linguistics that the assignment of relations are artifacts of configurational ones – primitive relationships between nodes in phrase-structure trees licensed by a grammar.",
        "In the case of parsing with English, there have been some remarkable successes in the last five years, most notably that of Collins (1999) and several successive improvements, who use knowledge about headedness and subcategorisation, traditional n-grams and some information about unbounded dependencies to dramatically improve on our ability to predict the most likely phrase-structure tree given a string of words – with the tacit assumption that this tree has something to do with interpretation.",
        "While there have also been more modest successes with purely dependency-based grammars in the realm of freer word-order (FWO) languages, these often map dependency trees to phrase structure trees, and even agreeing on what the best phrase-structure tree should be in these languages is not easy.",
        "Predicting the tree from data, moreover, seems utterly intractable, given the number of movement operations and empty projections that would be involved in the standard approach.",
        "While dependency-based grammar seems like a very appealing alternative in that context, phrases are a fact of life.",
        "No FWO language is completely free, and while the subunits like NPs that seem semantically intuitive to us may not always be realized as contiguous substrings in the strings of a language, there are often other contiguous substrings defined on the basis of prosodic effects, discourse relationships and/or purely formal syntactic rules that are adhered to.",
        "Invariably, dependency-based approaches must use various ad hoc devices under names such as \"emancipation\" to make exceptions where these notions of contiguity do not agree.",
        "The constraints from these levels of linguistic structure interact, and phrases – of some variety – are the basic units for defining this interaction.",
        "For computational purposes, these constraints are interesting because they can be used to restrict search and, in the context of statistical parsing, to militate against less likely interpretations."

        "There has, in fact, been a considerable undercurrent of linguistics research, beginning as early as Curry (1961), that challenges the Chomskyan assumption that one flavour of constituency exists on which constraints from all of these levels of linguistic structure can happily agree.",
        "Curry (1961) distinguished what he called tec-togrammatical structure, on which semantic interpretation takes place, from a phenogrammatical structure, which deals with word order, morphology and (dis)contiguities.",
        "Much of this work, including Curry's, has not been very formal.",
        "The purpose of this paper is to present one possible formalisation of it, and in a manner particularly consistent with how Curry's work has developed within HPSG (Kathol, 2000).",
        "The one exception to this informality, Lexical-Functional Grammar (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982), is worth noting, since it is also widely used by computational linguists.",
        "LFG, to its credit, had the foresight to distinguish two different kinds of structure very early on.",
        "One of them, functional or f-structure, is represented using a feature structure that directly indicates thematic role and grammatical function assignment, among other things, without any appeal to a primitive \"f-constituent.\" While a more conservative representation (a phrase structure tree) will be used here for tectogrammatical structure, it would be entirely consistent with the spirit of the present work to use feature structures or even dependency trees in the context of this level of phrase structure.",
        "In LFG, the other, constituent or c-structure, which corresponds roughly to phenogrammatical structure, uses a phrase structure tree labelled with very tectogrammatical-looking categories: nouns, PPs, on occasion NPs, etc.",
        "Where these are not realised as contiguous substrings, c-structure trees are generally just flatter and wider-branching, in order to match the daughters of these discontiguous constituents directly, contiguously, and in the acceptable orders.",
        "What is missing here is a primitive in the formalism for talking about contiguous substrings that may not have a semantic, tectogrammatical significance, and a primitive for talking about non-tectogrammatical regions over which word order constraints are expressed.",
        "Examples of the former are quite evident in the Slavic languages, such as with second-position clitics.",
        "As their name suggests, these clitics occur after something in first position.",
        "That something can be a normal tectogrammatical constituent, like an NP, or it can be a prosodic word, such as a preposition and first adjective of an NP (Browne, 1974), or, in certain circumstances, it can be a sequence of discourse-linked NPs (Penn, 1997).",
        "Of the latter, probably the best-known example is the German Mittelfeld.",
        "Within this field, pronouns generally precede prosodically heavier NPs (and with a particular order prescribed among multiple pronouns), and temporal adjuncts generally precede locatival adjuncts.",
        "It is false to claim that these ordering constraints holds only within a VP or over an entire clause.",
        "The Mittelfeld is, in fact, defined in linear terms, as the substring bounded on the left by either a complementizer or a finite verb, and on the right by a periphrastic verbal complex.",
        "Linear fields like the Mittelfeld, usually called topological fields in the HPSG literature, are defined relative to some region, in this case German clauses, in which other fields may also be defined.",
        "These fields are linearly ordered with respect to one another, and sometimes have constraints on how many words or tectogrammatical constituents they can contain.",
        "Regions may also occur inside fields of larger regions, such as with embedded clauses in German.",
        "What emerges from this characterisation is an extended context-free formalism in which right-hand-sides of rules can use the Kleene star (as in LFG c-stractures).",
        "What is different about these extended CFGs is that they do not provide interpretations – only a parse into linearly defined fields and regions.",
        "The present formalism consists of two parallel representational devices, one being this extended CFG and the other, an interpretive tectogrammatical tree structure with potentially crossing links.",
        "Along with these come constraints that associate substructures from the two representations, in a very similar spirit to LFG structural correspondence functions.",
        "The idea of using topological fields as a guide for general parsing appears to have originated with Oliva (1992); more recent work primarily folds in parochial facts from German, including Duchier (2001), which presents German topological parsing as a constraint satisfaction problem.",
        "The present approach actually received its inspiration initially from Slavic language word-order data, but can be applied equally well to German.",
        "Synchronous tree-adjoining grammars (Shieber and Schabes, 1990) bear some resemblance to the parallel derivations used here, although the same constituents are used there in both."

        "We can state three characterizing assumptions that restrict the expressive power of this formalism:",
        "• Topological Linearity: all word-order constraints can be witnessed by a topology defined on some linear region.",
        "• Topological Locality: discontiguities may exist due to scrambling, but they are not unbounded.",
        "Hence all discontiguities can be characterized in some local region of bounded topological size.",
        "• Qualified Isomorphy: While linear and local regions are not always the same as traditional (tectogrammatical) constituents, they themselves are the same.",
        "Furthermore, principles governing linear order and discontigu-ity are stated relative to the smallest common region that witnesses the substrings being ordered or dislocated.",
        "Topological Linearity agrees with the assumption made in traditional ID/LP grammars that linear precedence constraints apply within some region, although with ID/LP, that region is a tectogram-matically defined subtree.",
        "Linearity can be enforced by assigning substrings to different topological fields.",
        "Compared to relative statements of linear order, e.g., NP < VP, topological fields allow one to make more absolute statements about linear position that are crucial for thinking about FWO syntax in a more modular fashion.",
        "Qualified Isomorphy refines an assumption made in earlier work on topological fields that every word simply bears a unique topological field.",
        "Topological structure is nested because the tectogrammatical structures it constrains are.",
        "Using phenogrammatical trees of nested regions allows us to order the words of an embedded clause, for example, without contradicting their placement relative to the words of a matrix clause because which field a word bears is relative to the region being considered.",
        "We begin with the basic primitives from which grammars are constructed: Definition 1 A topological signature is a quintuple, (C, Field, Region, S, Phon), such that: • £ is a constraint language for describing tectogrammatical categories, with a countable set of variables, • Field is a set of topological fields, such as the German Mittelfeld, • Region is a set of regions, such as clauses, relative to which topological fields are defined, • X is a lexicon, and • Phon : U – > X* is a function that maps elements in an interpretation, I, of C to phonological strings.",
        "C could be as simple as variables and constants representing atomic categories like NP, or a description logic for feature structures, for example.",
        "It can be a language with disjunction, although there is obviously a computational cost to be paid for this.",
        "Definition 2 A set of topological fields, Field, induces a unique set of field descriptors, Desc(Field), such that for every f 6 Field: • /+ 6 Desc(Field) (1 or more fields).",
        "We can now define our phenogrammatical structures.",
        "These are the extended CFG rules that divide regions topologically into fields: Definition 3 Given a topological signature, a phenogrammatical rule is of the form r Desc(Field), and n > 0.",
        "When we look at the parse tree that corresponds to a derivation with a set of pheno-rules over some string, we see that every field and region can account for some contiguous substring that its subtree dominates.",
        "This is called the yield of that field or region.",
        "We can extend this notion of yield to tectogrammatical categories, although the substrings that correspond to these may not be contiguous.",
        "We could, following Johnson (1985), think of yields as bit vectors defined over a fixed length corresponding to the length of the input, for example.",
        "Structural constraints constrain pheno-yields in terms of tecto-yields and vice versa.",
        "We look at them in terms of whether one covers another, i.e., substring inclusion.",
        "Definition 4 Given a topological signature, the structural constraints, C, over that signature are, for every <j) 6 C, f E Field, and r 6 Region:",
        "• covering: (f> covers /, (f> covers r, f covered_by <f>, r covered_by <fr, • matching: <fi matches /, <fi matches r, f matched.by 0, r matched.by <f>, • compaction: (<fi).",
        "Structural constraints are interpreted with universal quantification on their left-hand sides and existential quantification on their right hand sides, so <f> REL / is not equivalent to its dual / REL_6y (j).",
        "Covering constraints specify that the phonological yield of every/some tectogrammatical category denoted by <f) consumes, or includes, the phonological yield of some/every field or region f /r, although the yield of (j) may also extend into other phenogrammatical constituents.",
        "A special case of covering is matching, e.g., cfr matches f. This is when the phonological yield of every/some tectogrammatical category denoted by <f> is exactly the same as the phonological yield of some/every field or region f jr. As shorthand, we also allow (f> < – > //rfor</> covers f Szf/r covered'Jby (f>.",
        "Similarly, matching constraints with universal quantification on both sides are written as <fi -4=>-fir.",
        "Linkage constraints are essentially the converse of phenogrammatical structural rules: they license the links in a phenogrammatical tree with field mothers and region daughters.",
        "Linkage rules are always unary-branching.",
        "A field contains at most one region, with the alternative being one lexical item, i.e., a pre-terminal field.",
        "Compaction constraints indicate that a tectogrammatical constituent has a phonological yield with no discontiguities.",
        "To these, we can also add universally quantified implication constraints, $ – t ip, which are the usual ones from constraint-based grammar – any tectogrammatical constituent in the denotation of <fi is also in the denotation of tp.",
        "We are now in a position to introduce the tectogrammatical rules, which tell us how to build tectogrammatical structures.",
        "These are subject to the universally quantified constraints above, but can also specify constraints on a particular daughter: Definition 5 Given a topological signature and n G N, the indexed structural constraints, Cn, over that signature are, for every 1 < i,j < n, 0 < k < n, f 6 Field, and r G Region:",
        "• covering: i covers /, i covers r, • matching: i matches f/r,f/r matched.by i, • immediate precedence: i « j, • compaction: (k).",

        "The indices in indexed constraints refer to the mother or daughter constituents in a tectogrammatical rule.",
        "In the absence of any indexed constraints, a tecto-rule makes no assumptions about the linear relationships among its daughters.",
        "Relative precedence and immediate precedence can be used to describe traditional phrase structure, where it exists, which can also be provided as an idiom: <j>Q <f>\\... <f>n. Note that, as with traditional ID/LP, compaction can be specified in the absence of precedence, which serves to specify contiguity separately from linear order; unlike ID/LP, precedence can be specified in the absence of contiguity (Goetz and Penn, 1997; Suhre, 1999).",
