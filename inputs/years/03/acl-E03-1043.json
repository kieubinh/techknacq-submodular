        "In November 2002, the Slovenian-German-Slovenian online dictionary contained more than 4,800 entries which correspond to words, selected word forms and expressions appearing in the textbook Odkrivajmo slovenscino, a beginners' textbook for Slovenian (Cuk et al., 1996).",
        "The entire content of the textbook is covered.",
        "The textbook is used in teaching Slovenian especially in German, French or Italian speaking communities.",
        "It contains Slovenian-only text, explanations and exercises.",
        "As there is neither an index nor a vocabulary list, the online dictionary is a valuable completion of this educational material.",
        "However, it can be - and actually is - used independently of the textbook.",
        "The current version of the online dictionary contains the following elements, based on Odkrivajmo slovenscino:",
        "• all lemmas appearing in the texts, explanations, instructions and exercises; • irregular inflected forms as well as the first person singular form of verbs; • common conversational phrases and multiword expressions as well as some contextual examples of words and grammatical forms.",
        "Grammar information for both languages and information on stressed syllables for the Slovenian entries are contained in additional fields.",
        "For both languages, three different kinds of search are possible: 2. match a text string as a part of the dictionary entry; 3. match a text string at the beginning of the dictionary entry.",
        "In the current version, the internal structure of the dictionary is a table containing one-to-one correspondences of words, word forms, and phrases.",
        "If an item has more than one equivalent in the other language, as many entries as necessary are created."

      "text": [
        "The evaluations of the Slovenian part of the dictionary concern its coverage of a) the corpus of the Slovenian newspaper DELO, as included in the ZRC SAZU corpus by the end of November 2002 (cf. Subsection 3.1); b) user queries to the dictionary which have been logged since the publication of the first trial version in April 2002 (cf. Subsection 3.2).",
        "Based on these analyses, some qualitative remarks about the most frequent missing items will be made (cf. Subsection 3.3).",
        "The evaluation is based on the Slovenian part of the complete \"vocabulary\" (words, inflected forms, expressions) of the dictionary.",
        "The 4,841 entries actually contain 4,354 distinct Slovenian entries; this number is smaller than the overall number because some words are polysemous, or some expressions can have different translations.",
        "The minimum number of Slovenian lemmas in the dictionary can be approximated by counting those entries which either contain no space in both languages, or which are reflexive verbs (ending on \"_se\" in Slovenian or starting with \"sich_\" in German): There are 2,428 such entries.",
        "To evaluate the coverage of texts by the Slovenian side of the dictionary, we chose the wordform list with frequencies of DELO, the main Slovenian daily, from January 1998 to August 2002.",
        "About 75% of the text of the Monday-Saturday edition is sent in ASCII format every day via email to a small list of handicapped (\"DELO for the blind\") and to research users (Nova beseda).",
        "DELO is a good source for modern Slovenian, the text is spell-checked and proof-read, the error-rate is low (Jakopin, 2002).",
        "The results of our evaluation will give an approximation of how well the lexical knowledge represented in the dictionary which can be interpreted as that of a learner after finishing the study of the textbook - overlaps with the lexical content of newspaper text.",
        "The word list of the DELO newspaper corpus at ZRC SAZU in its November 2002 version contains 930,977 distinct word forms with an overall occurence of 73,412,302.",
        "Using the Corpus Laboratory lemmatizer (Jakopin, 2002), the 30,000 most frequent word forms (with an overall occurrence of 64,465,582 and a coverage of 87.8% of the whole corpus) were lemmatized.",
        "25,598 out of these 30,000 word forms were recognized by the lemmatizer.",
        "The recognized word forms, which cover 82.8% of the entire DELO corpus (cf. Table 1), will serve as the basis of our evaluation.",
        "Word forms of each single lemma that corresponds to an entry in the dictionary will be counted as covered.",
        "For ambiguous word forms, the procedure is more complicated: In this case the lemmatizer output will consist of a set of possible lemmas (cf. Table 2).",
        "As only a part of the corpus is POS-tagged (Jakopin and Bizjak, 1997), these sets cannot be disambiguated.",
        "We decided to evaluate them by marking with an asterisk all those lemmas that are not covered by the dictionary; if at least one of the alternative lemmas is unmarked, the underlying word form will be counted as covered.",
        "Tables 3 and 4 show parts of the sorted result of the marking procedure.",
        "words",
        "distinct word forms",
        "distinct lemmas or lemma sets",
        "The politico-economical context of the newspaper is reflected by nouns like predsednik 'chairman', zakon 'law', minister 'minister' and pod-jetje 'company', which are among the most frequent missing ones.",
        "Out of these, only zakon is also among the 30 most popular and unmatched user queries.",
        "An analysis of the unmatched user queries shows popular missing lemmas in the general domain, like pozdrav 'greeting; regards', postaja 'station', krava 'cow' and odpad 'waste; rubbish'.",
        "Economical or legal terms of daily life are popular as well: pogodba 'contract', potrditi 'to confirm', racun 'bill' and davek 'tax' can be mentioned as missing from the dictionary."

      "text": [
        "Using an approximated method of untagged corpus coverage evaluation, we found that a dictionary of general Slovenian based on a beginners' textbook covers nearly 70% of the 82.8% most frequent lemmatized words in a big newspaper corpus.",
        "The textbook also contains lemmas which are less frequent in the corpus.",
        "A comparison of the corpus evaluation results with an analysis of the most popular user queries shows differences in the distribution of word classes among the most frequent unmatched items.",
        "Corpus coverage can be quickly enhanced by the insertion of some closed class items, while dictionary users are more interested in open class items.",
        "The dictionary will be enlarged based on these quantitative and qualitative corpus and query analyses.",
        "Using a tagset covering the grammar information necessary for the Slovenian language (cf. e.g. http://bos.zrc-sazu.si/cgi/ckb_oo.html, (Jakopin and Bizjak, 1997)), the grammar information about Slovenian lemmas and word forms will be completed."
