        "There are two main strategies in corpus-based machine translation: (i) Example-Based Machine Translation (EBMT; Nagao, 1984; Somers, 1999) and (ii) Statistical Machine Translation (SMT; Brown et al., 1993; Knight, 1997; Ney, 2001; Al-shawi et al., 2000).",
        "C is developing both technologies in parallel and blending them.",
        "In this paper, we introduce three different machine translation systems: D, HP AT, and SAT.",
        "The three MT systems are characterized by different translation units.",
        "D, HP AT, and SAT use sentences, phrases, and words, respectively.",
        "D (Sentence-based EBMT): It retrieves the most similar example by DP-matching of the input and example sentences and adjusts the gap between the input and the retrieved example by using dictionaries.",
        "(Sumita 2001) HP AT (Phrase-based EBMT): Based on phrase-aligned bilingual trees, transfer patterns are generated.",
        "According to the patterns, the source phrase structure is obtained and converted to generate target sentences.",
        "(Tmamura 2002) SAT (Word-based SMT): Watanabe et al.",
        "(2002b) implemented SAT dealing with Japanese and English on top of a word-based SMT framework (Brown et al.",
        "1993).",
        "3 Competition on the Same Corpus 3.1 Resources In our competitive evaluation of the MT systems, we used the BTEC corpus, which is a collection of Japanese sentences and their English translations typically found in phrasebooks for tourists.",
        "The size is about 150 thousand sentence pairs.",
        "A quality evaluation was done using a test set consisting of 345 sentences selected randomly from the above corpus, and the remaining sentences were used for learning and verification.",
        "For each source sentence in the test set, 16 reference translations were prepared by 5 bilingual translators.",
        "We used bilingual dictionaries and thesauri of about fifty thousand words for the travel domain.",
        "We used the measures below.",
        "The BLEU score and the RED rank are measured by referring to the test corpus, i.e., a set of input sentences and their multiple reference translations; the HUMAN rank and the estimated TOETC score are judged by bilingual translators.",
        "HUMAN rank: In our evaluation, 9 translators who are native speakers of the target language ranked the MT translations into 4 ranks: A, B, C, and D, from good to bad (Sumita et al., 1999).",
        "RED rank: An automatic ranker is learned as a decision tree from HUMAN-ranked examples.",
        "It exploits edit-distances between MT and multiple reference translations (Akiba et al., 2001).",
        "(2) BLEU score: The MT translations are scored based on the precision of N-grams in an entire set of multiple reference translations (Papineni et al., 2002).",
        "It ranges from 1.0 (best) down to 0.0 (worst).",
        "(3) Estimated TOEIC score: It is important to interpret MT performance from the viewpoint of a language proficiency test such as TOEIC.",
        "A translator compared MT translations with human ones, then, MT's proficiency is estimated by regression analysis (Sugaya et al., 2000).",
        "It ranges from 10 {lowest) to 990 points {perfect).",
        "Table 1 wraps up the results.",
        "So far, SMT has been applied mainly to language pairs of similar European languages.",
        "Skeptical opinions dominate about the effectiveness or applicability of SMT to dissimilar language pairs.",
        "However, we implemented SMT for translation between Japanese and English.",
        "They are dissimilar in many points, such as word order and lexical systems.",
        "We found that SAT, which is an SMT, worked in both J-to-E and E-to-J directions.",
        "The EBMT systems, HP AT and D, surpassed SAT in the HUMAN rank.",
        "This is the reverse result obtained in a Verbmobil experiment (Ney, 2001) where an SMT system scored highest.",
        "We are studying these interesting contradictory observations.",
        "Let's consider the relationships among the HUMAN rank, the RED rank, and the BLEU score.",
        "While RED accords with HUMAN, BLEU fails to agree with HUMAN in the EJ evaluation.",
        "One reason for this is that the BLEU score favors SAT translations in that they are more similar to the reference translation from the viewpoint of N-grams.",
        "Let's move on to the estimated TOEIC score of the most accurate JE system in the experiment.",
        "Dachieved a high score of 870.",
        "This is more than one hundred points higher than the average score of a Japanese businessperson in an overseas department of a company."

        "Thus, we could obtain a large increase in accuracy if it were possible to select the best one of the three different translations for each input sentence.",
        "Unlike other approaches such as (Brown and Frederking, 1995), we do not merge multiple results into a single one but we select the best one because the large difference between multiple translations for distant language pairs such as Japanese and English makes merging infeasible.",
        "Methods using N-gram statistics of a target language corpus have been proposed before (Brown and Frederking, 1995; Callison-Burch et al., 2001).",
        "They are based on the assumptions that (1) the naturalness of the translations is effective for selecting good translations because they are sensitive to the broken target sentences due to errors in translation processes, and (2) the source and target correspondences from the semantic point of view are maintained in a state-of-the-art translation system.",
