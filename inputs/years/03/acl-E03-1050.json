        "Statistical machine translation systems typically use a translation model trained on bilingual data and a language model for the target language, trained on perhaps some larger monolingual data.",
        "Often the amount of clean parallel data is limited.",
        "This leads to the question of whether translation quality can be improved by using additional noisier bilingual data.",
        "Some approaches, like (Fung and MxKeown, 1997), have been developed to extract word translations from non-parallel corpora.",
        "In (Munteanu and Marcu, 2002) bilingual suffix trees are used to extract parallel sequences of words from a comparable corpus.",
        "95% of those phrase translation pairs were judged to be correct.",
        "However, no results where reported if these additional translation correspondences resulted in improved translation quality."

      "text": [
        "Statistical translation as introduced in (Brown et al., 1993) is based on word-to-word translations.",
        "The SMT system used in this study relies on multiword to multi-word translations.",
        "The term phrase translations will be used throughout this paper without implying that these multi-word translation pairs are phrases in some linguistic sense.",
        "Phrase translations can be extracted from the Viterbi alignment of the alignment model.",
        "Phrase translation pairs are seen only a few times.",
        "Actually, most of the longer phrases are seen only once in even the larger corpora.",
        "Using relative frequency to estimate the translation probability would make most of the phrase translation probabilities 1.0.",
        "This would lead to two consequences: First, phrase translation would always be preferred over a translation generated using word translations from the statistical and manual lexicons, even if the phrase translation is wrong, due to misalignment.",
        "Secondly, two translations would often have the same probability.",
        "As the language model probability is larger for shorter phrases this will usually result in overall shorter sentences, which sometimes are too short.",
        "To make phrase translations comparable to the word translations the translation probability is calculated on the basis of the word translation probabilities resulting from IBMl-type alignment.",
        "This now gives the desired property that longer translations get higher probabilities.",
        "If the additional word should not be part of the phrase translation then these additional probabilities p{fj\\ej) which go into the sum will be small, i.e. the phrase translation probabilities will be very similar and the language model gives a bias toward the shorter translation.",
        "If, however, this additional word is actually the translation of one of the words in the source phrase then the additional probabilities going into the summation are large, resulting in an overall larger phrase translation probability.",
        "More importantly, calculating the phrase translation probability on the basis of word translation probabilities increases the robustness.",
        "Wrong phrase pairs resulting from errors in the Viterbi alignment will have a low probability.",
        "3 What's in the Training Data 3.1 The Corpora To train the Chinese-to-English translation system 4 different corpora were used: 1) Chinese treebank data (LDC2002E17): this is a small corpus (90K words) for which a treebank has been built.",
        "2) Chinese news stories, collected and translated by the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS).",
        "3) Hong Kong news corpus distributed through LDC (LDC2000T46).",
        "4) Xinhua news: Chinese and English news stories publish by the Xinhua news agency.",
        "The first three corpora are truly bilingual corpora in that the English part is actually a translation of the Chinese.",
        "Together, the form the clean corpus which has 9.7 million words.",
        "The Xinhua news corpus (XN) is not a parallel corpus.",
        "The Chinese and English news stories are typically not translations of each other.",
        "The Chinese news contains more national news whereas the English news is more about international events.",
        "Only a small percentage of all stories is close enough to be considered as comparable.",
        "Identification of these story pairs was done automatically at LDC using lexical information as described in (Xiaoyi Ma, 1999).",
        "In this approach a document B is considered an approximate translation of document A if the similarity between A and B is above some threshold, where similarity is defined as the ratio of tokens from A for which a translation appears in document B in a nearby position.",
        "The document with the highest similarity is selected.",
        "For the Xinhua News corpus less then 2% of the entire news stories could be aligned.",
        "Inspection showed that even these pairs can not be considered to be true translations of each other.",
        "In our translation experiments we also used the LDC Chinese English dictionary (LDC2002E27).",
        "This dictionary has about 53,000 Chinese entries with on average 3 translations each.",
        "The FBIS, Hong Kong news and Xinhua news corpora all required sentence alignment.",
        "Different sentence alignment methods have been proposed and shown to give reliable results for parallel corpora.",
        "For non-parallel but comparable corpora sentence alignment is more challenging as it requires - in addition to finding a good alignment also a means to distinguish between sentence pairs which are likely to be translations of each other and those which are aligned to each other but can not be considered translations.",
        "An iterative approach to sentence alignment for this kind of noisy data has been described in (Bing Zhao, 2002).",
        "This approached was used to sentence align the Xinhua News stories.",
        "Sentence length and lexical information is used to calculate sentence alignment scores.",
        "The alignment algorithm allows for insertions and deletions.",
        "These sentences are removed as are sentence pairs which have a low overall sentence alignment score.",
        "About 30% of the sentence pairs were deleted to result in the final corpus of 2.7 million words.",
        "The test data used in the following analysis and also in the translation experiments is a set of 993 sentences from different Chinese news wires, which has been used in the TIDES MT evaluation in December 2001.",
        "To get good translations requires first of all that the vocabulary of the test sentences is well covered by the training data.",
        "Coverage can be expressed in terms of tokens, i.e. how many of the tokens in the test sentences are covered by the vocabulary of the training corpus, and in terms of types, i.e. how many of the word types in the test sentences have been seen in the training data.",
        "A problem with Chinese is of course that the vocabulary depends heavily on the word segmentation.",
        "In a way the vocabulary has to be determined first, as a word list is typically used to do the segmentation.",
        "There is a certain trade-off: a large word list for segmentation will result in more unseen words in the test sentences with respect to a training corpus.",
        "A small word list will lead to more errors in segmentation.",
        "For the experiments reported in this paper a word list with 43, 959 entries was used for word segmentation.",
        "Our statistical translation system uses not only word-to-word translations but also phrase translations.",
        "The more phrases in the test sentences are found in the training data, the better.",
        "And longer phrases will generally result in better translations, as they show larger cohesiveness and better word order in the target language.",
        "The n-gram coverage analysis takes all n-grams from the test sentences for n=2, n=3, ... and finds all occurrences of these n-grams in the different training corpora.",
        "From Table 2 we see that the Xinhua news corpus, which is only about a quarter of the size of the clean data, contains a much larger number of long word sequences occurring also in the test data.",
        "This is no surprise, as part of the test sentences come from Xinhua news, even though they date from a year not included in the training data.",
        "Adding this corpus to the other training data therefore gives the potential to extract more and longer phrase to phrase translations which could result in better translations.",
        "Many of the detected n-grams are actually overlapping, resulting from a very small number of very long matches was detected.",
        "And each n-gram contains m (n-m+l)-grams.",
        "The longest matching n-grams in the Xinhua news corpus were 56, 53, 43, 34, 31, 28, 24, 21 words long, each occurring once."
