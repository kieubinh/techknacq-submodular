      "text": [
        "In this paper, we present an extension to Topological Dependency Grammar (Duchier and Debusmann, 2001) enabling us to analyse e.g. word order variation and tune as means to indicate what is the topic and what is the focus of an expression - i.e. its information structure (cf. §2, §4).",
        "Using a constraint-based approach, we can analyse the surface form of an expression in terms of the information structure that it realizes.",
        "The information structure of an expression is a core part of its meaning: it indicates how the expression relates to the discourse context.",
        "Information structure thus constitutes a crucial factor in determining an expression's contextual appropriateness or interpretability.",
        "Particularly in applications that involve human-computer interaction, information structure has thus been found to have a great impact on the understandability of computer-generated language, e.g. question/answering dialogues (Prevost and Steedman, 1994; Hoffman, 1995; Kruijff-Korbayova et al., 2003) or generation (Kruijff-Korbayova et al., 2002).",
        "In this paper we concentrate on information structure and the syntax/semantics-interface: We want to be able to reconstruct an expression's information structure at the level of meaning, given the expression's surface form.",
        "To realize information structure a language may employ a variety of means, not only word order or tune but also morphology or marked syntactic constructions.",
        "Collectively we call these means structural indications of informativity, after (Vallduvf andEngdahl, 1996; Kruijff, 2001).",
        "As §2 illustrates, languages are not restricted to using just a single means.",
        "Within a single expression several types of indications can normally be used simultaneously.",
        "The indications may constrain the expression's well-formedness, and it is through their interaction that the indications help realize information structure.",
        "It is precisely this interaction that presents a problem for existing accounts of information structure and its realization.",
        "Although accounts normally acknowledge that there are various types of structural indications, most of them focus solely on modelling the use of a single type of structural indication.",
        "For example, (Steedman, 2000) focuses on tune, (Hoffman, 1995) or (Hajicova et al., 1995) focus on word order.",
        "Such focus would be unproblematic if it were clear how these accounts could be extended to cover multiple, interacting types of structural indications.",
        "However, even for (Steedman, 2000; Hoffman, 1995), which are the formally most detailed, this is by no means obvious.",
        "CCG's underlying principles (notably, the Principle of Adjacency) forces Hoffman to introduce separate derivations for establishing an expression's syntactic structure (incl. word order) and its information structure.",
        "This detaches information structure from word order as an indication of the former, a problem that arguably gets aggravated if one were to try to incorporate Steedman's model of tune.",
        "The contribution we make here is the presentation of a framework that (i) can describe the use of any number of structural indications in realizing information structure in a perspicuous way, and that (ii) is amenable to a formalization in the style of TDG to extend the latter's efficient constraint-based parser.",
        "A proviso: Given the limited space, we do not deal with contrast in this paper.",
        "Overview: §2 presents data motivating our point that languages can use several types of structural indications of informativity simultaneously, and the effect this may have on grammaticality.",
        "§3 introduces the necessary basic concepts of TDG.",
        "In §4 we discuss how to extend TDG to deal with information structure: We outline the underlying linguistic model, and specify the formal details of the extension.",
        "The resulting model we then apply to the data of §2.",
        "We close with conclusions."

        "When a speaker wants to communicate some meaning to a hearer, she does that against a background of discourse referents that have already been activated in the context, and which are (presumably) shared between speaker and hearer.",
        "The meaning a speaker communicates relates to these already established referents, and presents more (\"new\") information about these referents.",
        "The former part of the meaning we call the topic, the latter the focus.",
        "An expression's information structure is the division of its meaning into a topic and a focus (Sgall et al., 1986; Vallduvf, 1990).",
        "Languages may realize information structure in various ways.",
        "For example, in a language with a relatively free word order, variations in linearization are prototypically used to indicate different information structure (Sgall et al., 1986; Hoffman, 1995; Kruijff, 2001).",
        "This explains why different variations, though equally grammatical, are usually not equally interchangeable in a given context.",
        "To illustrate the idea of context-dependence, consider the Czech example in (1) and its grammatical variations in (2).",
        "\"John ate a donut.\" b.",
        "[Koblihu] t snëdl [Honza] f ■ c. [Honza koblihu] t [snëdl] f",
        "(1) illustrates an \"all-focus\" sentence - the entire meaning is new.",
        "The examples in (2) presuppose different items to be present (\"salient\") in the already established dialogue.",
        "For example, if the speaker utters (2b) in a context where there is no donut, the hearer would most likely reply with \"What donut?",
        "!\", whereas (2a) assumes that \"Honza\" is a person the hearer can identify.",
        "Not every language has a relatively free word order, though.",
        "English has a fixed word order where it concerns complements, and therefore usually resorts to using tune to realize information structure.",
        "The examples in (3) illustrate several possible information structures, given the placement of the pitch accent.",
        "b.",
        "[John]f [gave]r [Mary]r [\"Moby Dick\"] t. c. [John]r [gave]r [Mary]j?",
        "[\"Moby Dick\"]T. Particularly in languages that have a degree of word order freedom inbetween English and Slavic languages like Czech, we can find examples of a strong interaction between word order and tune.",
        "For example, consider the Dutch examples in (4) and (5).",
        "(4) illustrates the all-focus case.",
        "(5a-c) show well-formed variations interprétable on different contexts.",
        "(5d) however, is ill-formed.",
        "By placing \"Moby Dick\" sentence initial and putting a non-contrastive stress on it, it gets interpreted as the subject of the (active) verb \"lezen\".",
        "(4) Jan las \"Moby dick\" John read-PAST \"Moby Dick\" John read \"Moby dick\" ' Subscript T indicates that the item belongs to the topic, F that it belongs to the focus.",

        "We would like to argue that similar interactions between word order and tune can also be observed in English.",
        "English has more freedom in ordering adjuncts, as (7) illustrates (Sgall et al., 1986).",

        "The boundaries between topic and focus in (7) arise from non-canonical ordering of adjuncts, and the tendency of SVO languages like English to place focus items towards the end of the sentence.",
        "For example, in (7b) the tO-PP and from-PP are inverted - the from-PP is part of the focus, whereas the non-canonical ordering of the tO-PP and the from-PP makes us place the topic/focus-boundary between these two PPs.",
        "The same idea applies to (7a): Only the on-PP is ordered non-canonically with respect to the rest of the complements and adjuncts, hence we put the topic/focus-boundary between the on-PP and the subject.",
        "We elaborate this in §4.",
        "English is relatively free in placing pitch accent - given a canonical order, (3).",
        "When varying the word order as in (7), we find that the interaction between word order and tune leads to strong preferences in interpretation.",
        "The examples in (8) illustrate this effect.",
        "We interpret elements from the question as topical (in the answer).",

        "■ We see these preferences as a weaker version of the effect such interaction has on well-formedness observed for Dutch.",
        "The example in (8c) leads to a dispreferred (#) interpretation: In English, constituents coming after the pitch accent (here, TO Paris) are interpreted by default as given (resulting in [\"from London\"] t).",
        "Though the word order is well-formed, as is the placement of the pitch accent on the tO-PP, the resulting surface form is not appropriate in the given context.",
        "(8b) is #'d because its non-canonical ordering of the PPs would suggest a topic/focus-boundary between the tO-PP and the FROM-PP, suggesting the tO-PP to be given.",
        "To recapitulate, variation in the placement of (non-contrastive) pitch accent or in word order helps indicate the boundary between topic and focus.",
        "Furthermore, when tune and word order are both used to realize information structure, they constrain one another.",
        "In §4 we present a formalization in TDG that captures these phenomena.",

        "Both trees are simultaneously constrained by a lexical assignment that e.g. restricts the licensed edges.",
        "Furthermore TDG stipulates that they must be related by an emancipation mechanism whereby a word is allowed to climb up and land in the topological domain of a syntactic ancestor.",
        "For example, the German sentence (9) Maria iiberredet ihn ein Buch zu lesen Mary convinces him a book to read receives the following analysis, where (10) is the syntax tree and (11) the topological tree: Native speakers prefer (8a) over (8b), yet do not rule out (8b) as strongly as (8c); hence the ?",

        "In this, we reach beyond existing approaches such as (Steedman, 2000), (Hoffman, 1995), or (Hajicova et al., 1995).",
        "The approach is conceptually related to (Krui-jff, 2001), who presents a framework in which different types of structural indications can interact.",
        "However, Kruijff's framework does not come with an efficient implementation, and is formally more intricate than the constraint-based approach we present here.",
        "One topic for further research is how to derive a logical representation from the analysis we now obtain, similar to (Kruijff, 2001; Copestake et al., 1999) or (Baldridge and Kruijff, 2002).",
        "Having a logical representation would provide a convenient bridge to discourse interpretation.",
