        "Text segmentation is an important problem in information retrieval.",
        "Its goal is the division of a text into homogeneous (\"lexically coherent\") segments, i.e segments exhibiting the following properties: (a) each segment deals with a particular subject and (b) contiguous segments deal with different subjects.",
        "Those segments can be retrieved from a large database of unformatted (or loosely formatted) text as being relevant to a query.",
        "This paper presents a dynamic programming algorithm which performs linear segmentation by global minimization of a segmentation cost.",
        "The :As opposed to hierarchical segmentation (Yaari, 1997) segmentation cost is defined by a function consisting of two factors: (a) within-segment word similarity and (b) prior information about segment length.",
        "Our algorithm has the advantage of being able to be applied to either large texts - to segment them into their constituent parts (e.g. to segment an article into sections) - or to a stream of independent, concatenated texts (e.g. to segment a transcript of news into separate stories).",
        "For the calculation of the segment homogeneity (or alternatively heterogeneity) of a text, several segmentation algorithms using a variety of criteria have been proposed in the literature.",
        "Some of those use linguistic criteria such as cue phrases, punctuation marks, prosodic features, reference, syntax and lexical attraction (Beeferman et al., 1997; Hirschberg and Litman, 1993; Passoneau and Litman, 1993).",
        "Others, following Halliday and Hasan's theory (Halliday and Hasan, 1976), utilize statistical similarity measures such as word cooccurrence.",
        "For example the linear discourse segmentation algorithm proposed by Morris and Hirst (Morris and Hirst, 1991) is based on lexical cohesion relations determined by use of Roget's thesaurus (Roget, 1977).",
        "In the same direction Kozima's algorithm (Kozima, 1993; Kozima and Furugori, 1993) computes the semantic similarity between words using a semantic network constructed from a subset of the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English.",
        "Local minima of the similarity scores correspond to the positions of topic boundaries in the text.",
        "focused on the similarity between adjacent part of texts.",
        "They used a sliding window of text and plotted the number of first-used words in the window as a function of the window position within the text.",
        "In this plot, segment boundaries correspond to deep valleys followed by sharp upturns.",
        "Kan (Kan et al., 1998) expanded the same idea by combining word-usage with visual layout information.",
        "On the other hand, other researchers focused on the similarity between all parts of a text.",
        "A graphical representation of this similarity is a dotplot.",
        "Reynar (Reynar, 1998; Reynar, 1999) and Choi (Choi, 2000; Choi et al., 2001) used dotplots in conjunction with divisive clustering (which can be seen as a form of approximate and local optimization) to perform linear text segmentation.",
        "A relevant work has been proposed by Yaari (Yaari, 1997) who used divisive / agglomerative clustering to perform hierarchical segmentation.",
        "Another approach to clustering performs exact and global optimization by dynamic programming; this was used by Ponte and Croft (Ponte and Croft, 1997; Xu and Croft, 1996), Heinonen (Heinonen, 1998) and Utiyama and Isahara (Utiyama and Isa-hara, 2001).",
        "Finally, other researchers use probabilistic approaches to text segmentation including the use of hidden Markov models (Yamron et al., 1999) , (Blei and Moreno, 2001).",
        "Also Beeferman (Beeferman et al., 1997) calculated the probability distribution on segment boundaries by utilizing word usage statistics, cue words and several other features."

        "Suppose that a text contains T sentences and its vocabulary contains L distinct words (e.g words that are not included in the stop list, other wise most sentences would be similar to most others).",
        "This text can be represented by a T x L matrix F defined as follows: for t = 1, 2,.... T and I = 1, 2,L we set The sentence similarity matrix of the text is a T x T matrix D where for s, t – 1, 2,T we set 0.",
        "This means that Dsj – 1 if\" the s-th and t-th sentence have at least one word in common.",
        "Every part of the original text corresponds to a sub-matrix of D. It is expected that submatrices which correspond to actual segments will have many sentences with words in common, thus will contain many \"ones\".",
        "Further justification for the use of this similarity matrix and graphical representation can be found in (Petridis et al., 2001), (Reynar, 1998; Reynar, 1999) and (Choi, 2000; Choi et al., 2001) We make the assumption that segment boundaries always occur at the ends of sentences.",
        "A segmentation of a text is a partition of the set {1,2, ...,T\\ into K subsets (i.e. segments, where K is a variable number) of the form {1, 2,t±}, 2,T} and can be represented by a vector t = (to, t\\,tx), where to,ti,...,tK are the segment boundaries corresponding to the last sentence of each subset.",
        "Dynamic programming guarantees the optimality of the result with respect to the input and the parameters.",
        "Following the approach of (Heinonen, 1998) we use a dynamic programming algorithm which decides the locations of the segment boundaries by calculating the globally optimal splitting t on the basis of a similarity matrix (or a curve), a preferred fragment length and a cost function defined.",
        "Given a similarity matrix D and the parameters p, a, r, 7 (the role of each of which will be described in the sequel) the dynamic programming algorithm tries to minimize a segmentation cost function J(t: /j, o, r, 7 ) with respect to t (here t is the independent variable which is actually a vector specifying the boundary position of each segment and the number of segments K while jx a, r, 7 are parameters) which is defined as follows: iff 1-th word is in t-th sentence 0 else.",
        "Hence the sum of the costs of the K segments constitutes the total segmentation cost; the cost of each segment is the sum of the following two terms (with their relative importance weighted by the parameter 7):"

        "to (word) similarity between sentences.",
        "The numerator of this term is the total number of ones in the D submatrix corresponding to the k-th segment.",
        "In the case where the parameter r is equal to 2, (tk – tk-i)' correspond to the area of submatrix and the above fraction corresponds to \"segment density\".",
        "A \"generalized density\" is obtained when r 7^ 2 and enables us to control the degree of influence of the surface with regard to the \"information\" (i.e the number of ones) included in it.",
        "Strong intra-segment similarity (as measured by the number of words which are common between sentences belonging to the segment) is indicated by large values of irrespective of the exact value of r. Segments with high density and small deviation from average segment length (i.e a small value of the corresponding J(t;ya, r, 7 ) ) provide a \"good\" segmentation vector t. The global minimum of J(t; u a, r, 7 ) provides the optimal segmentation t. It is worth mentioning that the optimal t specifies both the optimal number of segments K and the optimal positions of the segment boundaries t^.ti, ...,1k.",

        "First, high precision can be obtained at the expense of low recall and conversely.",
        "Additionally, those two indices penalize equally every inaccurately estimated segment boundary whether it is near or far from a true segment boundary.",
        "An alternative measure Pk which overcomes the shortcomings of precision and recall and measures segmentation maccuracy was introduced recently by Beeferman et al. (Beeferman et al., 1997).",
        "Intuitively, Pk measures the proportion of \"sentences which are wrongly predicted to belong to the same segment (while actually they belong in different segments)\" or \"sentences which are wrongly predicted to belong to different segments (while actually they belong to the same segment)\".",
        "Pj, is a measure of how well the true and hypothetical segmentations agree (with a low value of F\\ indicating high accuracy (Beeferman et al., 1997)).",
        "Pfc penalizes near-boundary errors less than far-boundary errors.",
        "Hence Pk evaluates segmentation accuracy more accurately than precision and recall.",
        "Our experiments were conducted using Choi's publicly available text collection (Choi, 2000; Choi et al., 2001).",
        "This collection consists of 700 texts, each text being a concatenation of ten text segments.",

        "We believe that the good performance of our algorithm is the result of the combination of the following facts: First, the use of a segment length term in the cost function seems to improve segmentation accuracy significantly, as it can be seen in Figures 1-4.",
        "Second, measuring segment length on the basis of sentences rather on the basis of words improves segmentation accuracy.",
        "Third, the use of \"generalized density\" (r ^ 2) appears to significantly improve performance.",
        "Even though the use of \"true density\" (r = 2) appears more natural, the best segmentation performance (minimum value of Pk) is achieved for significantly smaller values of r (as it can be see from the Figures 1-4 and the obtained results).",
        "This performance in most cases is improved when using appropriate values of p a, 7 and r derived from training data and parameter validation.",

        "First, sentence similarity is computed globally through the use of the D matrix and dotplot.",
        "Second, this global similarity information is also optimized globally by the use of the dynamic programming algorithm.",
