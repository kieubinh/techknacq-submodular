        "This paper introduces the NECA MNLG; a Multimodal Natural Language Generator.",

        "The NECA system generates dialogue scripts for animated characters.",
        "A first demonstrator in the car sales domain (ESHOWROOM) has been implemented.",
        "It allows a user to browse a database of cars, select a car, select two characters and their attributes, and subsequently view an automatically generated film of a dialogue about the selected car.",
        "The demonstrator takes the following input:",
        "• A database with facts about the selected car (maximum speed, horse power, etc.).",
        "• A database which correlates facts with value judgements.",
        "1NECA stands for ‘Net Environment for Embodied Emotional Conversational Agents’ and is an EU-IST project.",

        "2.",
        "Personal preferences concerning cars (e.g., a preference for safe cars).",
        "3.",
        "Role of the character (seller or customer).",
        "This input is processed in a pipeline that consists of the following modules in this order:",
        "• A DIALOGUE PLANNER, which produces an abstract description of the dialogue (the dialogue plan).",
        "• A MULTI-MODAL NATURAL LANGUAGE GENERATOR which specifies linguistic and non-linguistic realizations for the dialogue acts in the dialogue plan.",
        "• A SPEECH SYNTHESIS MODULE, which adds information for Speech.",
        "• A GESTURE ASSIGNMENT MODULE, which controls the temporal coordination of gestures and speech.",
        "• A PLAYER, which plays the animated characters and the corresponding speech sound files.",
        "Each step in the pipeline adds more concrete information to the dialogue plan/script until finally a player can render it.",
        "A single XML compliant representation language, called RRL, has been developed for representing the Dialogue Script at its various stages of completion (Piwek et al., 2002).",
        "In this paper, we describe the requirements for the NECA MNLG, how these have been translated into design solutions and finally some of aspects of the implementation."

      "heading": "2 Requirements",
      "text": [
        "The requirements in this section derive primarly from the use case of the NECA system.",
        "We do, however, try to indicate in what respects these requirements transcend this specific application and are desirable for generation systems in general.",
        "In the NECA system, the dialogue planner creates a dialogue plan consisting of (1) a description of the participants, (2) a characterization of the common ground at the outset of the dialogue in terms of Discourse Representation Theory (Kamp and Reyle, 1993) and (3) a set of dialogue acts and their temporal ordering.",
        "For each dialogue act, the type, speaker, set of addressees, semantic content, what it is a reaction to (i.e., its rhetorical relation to other dialogue acts), and emotions of the speaker can be specified.",
        "The amount of information which the dialogue planner actually provides for each of these attributes varies, however, per dialogue act: for some dialogue acts, a full semantic content can be provided –in the form of a Discourse Representation Structure– whereas for other acts, no semantic content is available at all.",
        "Typically, the dialogue planner can provide detailed semantics for utterances whose content is covered by the domain model (e.g., the car domain) whereas this is not possible for utterances which play an important role in the conversation but are not part of the domain model (e.g., greetings).",
        "This state of affairs is shared with most real-world applications.",
        "Since generation by grammar rules is primarily driven by the input semantics, for certain dialogue acts full grammar rules cannot be used.",
        "These dialogue acts may be primarily characterized in terms of their, possibly domain specific, dialogue act type (greeting, refusal, etc.).",
        "Thus, we need a generator which can cope with both types of input, and map them to the appropriate output.",
        "Input with little or no semantic content can typically be dealt with through templates or canned text, whereas input with fully specified semantic content can be dealt with through proper grammar rules.",
        "Summarizing, we need a generator which can cope with (linguistic) resources that contain an arbritary combination of grammar rules, templates and canned text.",
        "In the NECA project the aim is to generate behaviour for animated agents which simulates affective situated face-to-face conversational interaction.",
        "This means that the utterances of the agents have to be adapted not only to the content of the information which is exchanged but also to many other properties of the interlocutors, such as their emotional state, gender, cultural background, etc.",
        "The generator should therefore allow for such parameters to be part of its input.",
        "The application in which our generator is being used is currently fielded as part of a net-environment.",
        "The application will be evaluated with users through online questionnaires which are integrated in the application and analysis of log files (to answer questions such as ‘Do users try different settings of the application?’, etc.",
        "See Krenn et al., 2002).",
        "Therefore, the generator will have to be fast in order for it not to negatively affect the user experience of the system."

      "text": [
        "The NECA MNLG adopts the conventional pipeline architecture for generators (Reiter and Dale, 2000).",
        "Its input is a RRL dialogue plan.",
        "This is parsed and internally represented as a PROFIT typed feature structure (Erbach, 1995).",
        "Subsequently, the dialogue acts in the plan are realized in accordance with their temporal order.",
        "For each act, first a deep syntactic structure is generated.",
        "The deep structure of referring expressions is dealt with in a separate module, which takes the common ground of the interlocutors into account.",
        "Subsequently, lexical realization (agreement, inflection) and punctuation is performed.",
        "Finally, turn-taking gestures are added and the output is mapped back into the RRL XML format.",
        "Here let us concentrate on our approach to the generation of deep syntactic structure and how it satisfies the first two requirements.",
        "The input to the MNLG is a node (i.e., feature structure) stipulating the syntactic type of the output (e.g., sentence: <s), semantics and further information on the current dialogue act in PROFIT:2",
        "Thus various types of information are combined within one input node.",
        "Generation consists of taking the input node and using it to create a tree representation of the output.",
        "For this purpose, the MNLG tries to match the input node with the mother node of one of the trees in its tree repository.",
        "This tree repository contains trees which can represent proper grammar rules, templates and canned text.",
        "Matching trees might in turn have incomplete daughter nodes.",
        "These are recursively expanded by matching them with the trees in the repository, until all daughters are complete.",
        "A daughter node is complete if it is lexically realized (i.e., the attribute form of the node has a value) or it is of the type <np and the semantics is an open variable.",
        "In the latter instance, the node is expanded in a separate step by the referring expressions generation module.",
        "This module finds the discourse referent in the common ground which binds the open variable and constructs a description of the object in question.",
        "The description is composed of the properties which the object has according to the common ground, but can also be empty if the object is highly salient.",
        "The module is based on the work of Krahmer and The-une (2002).",
        "The (empty) description is mapped to a deep syntactic structure using the tree repository.",
        "Lexicalization subsequently yields expressions such as ‘it’ (empty descriptive content) or, for instance, ‘the red car’.",
        "Let us return to the tree repository and illustrate how templates and rules can be represented uniformly.",
        "The representation of a tree is of the",
        "the list of trees can be empty, yielding a tree consisting of one node: (Node,[]).",
        "The following is a template for dialogue acts of type greeting with no semantic content and a polite speaker.",
        "This is a template for the text ‘Hello!",
        "My name is SPEAKER’.",
        "Where SPEAKER is a variable which is bound to the name of the speaker of the utterance.",
        "The noun phrase (< np) for this name is generated by the referring expression generation module.",
        "The following is a tree representing a grammar rule of the familiar type S – * NP VP:",
        "Note that this rule applies to an input node whose semantic content contains a negation.",
        "The negation is passed on to the VP subtree via the feature negated.",
        "The attributes argGap and auxGap allow us to capture unbounded dependencies via feature perlocation.",
        "Our use of trees is related to the Tree Adjoining Grammar approach to generation (e.g., Stone and Doran, 1997).3",
        "...) The value of the attribute currentAct is passed on from the mother node to the daughter nodes.",
        "Thus any pragmatic information (personality, politeness, emotion, etc.)",
        "is passed on through the tree and can be accessed at a later stage, for instance, when lexical items are selected."

        "The NECA MNLG has been implemented in PROLOG.",
        "The output is in the form of an RRL XML document.",
        "Table 1 provides a sample of the response times of the compiled code running on a Pentium III Mobile 1200 Mhz with Sicstus 3.8.5 PROLOG.",
        "We timed the complete generation process from parsing the XML input to producing XML output, including generation of deep syntactic structure, referring expressions, turn taking gestures (not discussed in this paper), etc.",
        "The results show generation times for entire dialogues and according to whether the generator was asked to produce exactly one solution or select at random a solution from a set of at most ten generated solutions (the latter strategy was implemented to obtain more variation in the generator output).",
        "On average for = 1 the generation time for an individual dialogue act is almostioo of a second.",
        "For < 10 it is too of a second.",
        "The generator uses a repository of 138 trees (including the two examples given above).",
        "The repository has been developed for and integrated into the ESHOWROOM system which is currently being fielded.",
        "A start is being made with porting the MNLG to a new domain and documentation is being created to allow our project partners to carry out this task.",
        "We hope that our efforts will contribute to addressing a challenge expressed in (Re-tem, supporting fast generation.",
        "Moreover, by using features for unbounded dependencies we do not require the adjunction operation, which is incompatible with our topdown generation approach.",
        "We follow Nicolov et al.",
        "(1996), who also use TAG, in their commitment to flat semantics.",
        "Their generator does, however, not take pragmatic constraints into account.",
        "iter, 1999): “We hope that future systems such as STOP will be able to make more use of deep techniques, because of advances in linguistics and the development of reusable wide-coverage NLG components that are robust, well-documented and well engineered as software artifacts.” In our view the best way to approach this goal is by providing a framework which allows for the flexible integration of shallow and deep generation, thus making it possible that in the course of various projects, deep analyses can be developed alongside the shallow solutions which are difficult to avoid altogether in software development projects, due to the pressure to deliver a complete system within a certain span of time."
