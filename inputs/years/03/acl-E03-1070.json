        "Open domain Question Answering (QA) is an information retrieval paradigm that is attracting increasing attention from the information retrieval (IR), information extraction (IE), and natural language processing (NLP) communities (AAAI Spring Symposium Series 2002, ACL-EACL 2002).",
        "A QA system retrieves concise answers to open-domain natural language questions, where a large text collection (termed the QA corpus) is used as the source for these answers.",
        "Contrary to traditional IR tasks, it is not acceptable for a QA system to retrieve a full document, or a paragraph, in response to a question.",
        "Contrary to traditional IE tasks, no pre-specified domain restrictions are placed on the questions, which may be of any type and in any topic.",
        "Modern QA systems must therefore combine the strengths of traditional IR and NLP/IE to provide an apposite way to answering questions.",
        "The QA task in the TREC conference series (Voorhees 2002) has motivated much of the recent works focusing on fact-based, short-answer questions.",
        "Examples of such questions include: \"Who is Tom Cruise married to?\" or \"How many chromosomes does a human zygote have?\".",
        "For the most recent TREC-11 conference, the task consists of 500 questions posed over a QA corpus containing more than one million newspaper articles.",
        "Instead of previous years' 50-byte or 250-byte text fragments, exact answers are expected from the QA corpus with supports of documentary evidences.",
        "One of the major challenges in TREC-style QA is to overcome the mismatch in the lexical representations between the query space and document space.",
        "This mismatch, also known as the QA gap, is caused by the differences in the set of terms used in the question formulation and answer strings in the corpus.",
        "Given a source, such as the QA corpus, that contains only a relatively small number of answers to a query, we are faced with the difficulty to map the questions to answers by way of uncovering the complex lexical, syntactic, or semantic relationships between the question and the answer strings.",
        "Recent redundancy-based approaches (Brill et al. 2002, Clarke et al. 2002, Kwok et al. 2001, Radev et al. 2001) proposed the use of data, instead of methods, to do most of the work to bridge the QA gap.",
        "These methods suggest that the greater the answer redundancy in the source data collection, the more likely that we can find an answer that occurs in a simple relation to the question.",
        "With the availability of rich linguistic resources, we can also minimize the need to perform complex linguistic processing.",
        "However, this does not mean that NLP is now out of the picture.",
        "For some question/answer pairs, deep reasoning is still needed to relate the two.",
        "Many QA research groups have used a variety of linguistic resources - part-of-speech tagging, syntactic parsing, semantic relations, named entity extraction, WordNet, online dictionaries, query logs and ontologies, etc (Harabagiu et al. 2002, Hovy et al. 2002).",
        "This paper investigates the integration of both linguistic knowledge and external resources for TPvEC-style question answering.",
        "In particular, we describe a high performance question answering system called QUALIFIER (QUestion Answering by Lexical Fabric and External Resources) and analyze its effectiveness using the TREC-11 benchmark.",
        "Our results show that combining lexical information and external resources with a custom text search produces an effective question-answering system.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 presents related work.",
        "Sections 3 and 4 respectively discuss the design and architecture of the system.",
        "Section 5 elaborates on the use of external resources for QA, while Section 6 details the experimental results.",
        "Section 7 concludes the paper with discussions for future work."

        "The idea of using the external resources for question answering is an emerging topic of interest among the computational linguistic communities.",
        "The TREC-10 QA track demonstrated that the use of the Web redundancy could be exploited at different levels in the process of finding answers to natural language questions.",
        "Several studies (Brill et al. 2002,Clarke et al. 2002, Kwok et al. 2001) suggested that the application of Web search can improve the precision of a QA system by 25-30%.",
        "A common feature of these approaches is to use the Web to introduce data redundancy for a more reliable answer extraction from local text collections.",
        "Radev et al. [20] proposed a probabilistic algorithm that learns the best query paraphrase of a question searching the Web.",

      "text": [
        "To effectively perform open domain QA, two fundamental problems must be solved.",
        "The first is to bridge the gap between the query and document spaces.",
        "Most recent QA systems adopt the following general pipelined approach to: (a) classify the question according to the type of its answer; (b) employ IR technology, with the question as a query, to retrieve a small portion of the document collection; and (c) analyze the returned documents to detect entities of the appropriate type.",
        "In step (b), the traditional IR systems assume that there is close lexical similarity between the queries and the corresponding documents.",
        "In practice, however, there is often very little overlap between the terms used in a question and those appearing in its answer.",
        "For example, the best response to the question \"Where's a good place to get dinner?\" might be \"McDonald's\" and \"Jade Crystal Kitchen has nice Shanghai Tang Bao \", which have no tokens in common with the query.",
        "Usually, the QA gap reveals itself at four different levels, namely, the lexical, syntactic, semantic and discourse levels.",
        "As a result, the traditional bag-of-words retrieval techniques might be less effective at matching questions to exact answers than matching keywords to documents.",
        "The second fundamental problem is to exploit the associations among QA event elements.",
        "The world consists of two basic types of things: entities and events.",
        "From their definitions in WordNet, an entity is anything having existence (living or nonliving) and an event is something that happens at a given place and time.",
        "This taxonomy is also applicable to QA task, i.e., the questions can be considered as enquiries about either entities or events.",
        "Usually, the entity questions expect the entity properties or the entities themselves as the answers, such as the definition questions.",
        "More generally, questions often show great interests in several aspects of events, namely Location, Time, Subject, Object, Quantity and Description.",
        "Table 1 shows the correspondences of the most common WH-question classes and the QA event elements.",
        "Our major observation is that a QA event shows great cohesive affinity to all its elements and the elements are likely to be closely coupled by this event.",
        "Although some elements may appear in different places of the text collection or may even be absent, there must be innate associations among these elements if they belong to the same event.",
        "Hence, even if we only know a portion of the elements (e.g. Time, Subject, Object), we can use this information to narrow the search process to find the rest of elements (e.g.",
        "Location, etc).",
        "However, it is difficult to find correct unknown element(s) because of insufficient and inexact known elements.",
        "To tackle these two problems effectively, we explore the use of external resources to extract terms that are highly correlated with the query, and use these terms to expand the query.",
        "Instead of treating the web and linguistic resources separately, we explore an innovative approach to fuse the lexical and semantic knowledge to support effective QA.",
        "Our focus is to link the questions and the answers together by discovering a portion or all of the elements for certain QA events.",
        "We explore the use of world knowledge (the Web and WordNet glosses) to find more known elements and exploit the lexical knowledge (WordNet synsets and morphemics) to find their exact forms.",
        "We would like to call our approach Event-based QA."

      "heading": "4 System Architecture",
      "text": [
        "Our system, named QUALIFIER, adopts the by now more or less standard QA system architecture as shown in Figure 1.",
        "It includes modules to perform question analysis, query formulation by using external resources, document retrieval, candidate sentence selection and exact answer extraction.",
        "During question analysis, QUALIFIER identifies detailed question classes, answer types, and pertinent content query terms or phrases to facilitate the seeking of exact answers.",
        "It uses a rule-based question classifier to perform the syntactic-semantic analysis of the questions and determines the question types in a two-level question taxonomy.",
        "The first level in the question taxonomy corresponds to the more general named entities based QA.",
        "like Human, Location, Time, Number, Object, Description and Others.",
        "The second level contains question classes that correspond to finegrained named entities to facilitate accurate answer extraction.",
        "Examples of second level classes for, say Location, are Country, City, State, River, Mountain etc.",
        "The taxonomy is similar to that used in Li & Roth 2002.",
        "Our rule-based approach could achieve an accuracy of over 98% on TREC-11 questions.",
        "At the stage in query formulation, QUALIFIER uses the knowledge of both the Web and WordNet to expand the original query.",
        "This is done by first using the original query to search the web for top Nw documents and extracting additional web terms that co-occur frequently in the local context of the query terms.",
        "It then uses WordNet to find other terms in the retrieved web documents that are lexically related to the expanded query terms.",
        "Given the expanded query, QUALIFIER employs the MG system (Witten et al. 1999) to search for top N ranking documents in the QA corpus.",
        "Next, it selects candidate answer sentences from the top returned documents.",
        "These sentences are ranked based on certain criteria to maximize the answer recall and precision (Yang & Chua 2003).",
        "NLP analysis is performed on these candidate sentences to extract part-of-speech tags, base Noun Phrases, Named Entities, etc.",
        "Finally, QUALIFIER performs answer selection by matching the expected answer type to the NLP results.",
        "Named entity in the candidate sentence is returned as the final answer if it fits the expected answer type and is within a short distance to the original query.",
        "The following section describes the details of the query formulation and answer selection using external recourses."

        "For the short, factual questions in TREC, the queries are either too brief or do not fully cover the terms used in the corpus.",
        "Given a query, cj(0) = [qi(0) q2<0) ...qk(0) ] usually with k<=4, the problem for retrieving all the documents relevant to g0) is that the query does not contain most of the terms used in the document space to represent the same concept.",
        "For example, given the question: \"What is the name of the volcano that destroyed the ancient city of Pompeii?\", two of the passages containing possible answer in the QA corpus are: a.",
        "79 - Mount Vesuvius erupts and buries Italian cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum.",
        "b.",
        "In A.D. 79, long-dormant Mount Vesuvius erupted, burying the Roman cities of Pompeii and Herculaneum in volcanic ash.",
        "As can be seen, there are very few common content words between the question and the passages.",
        "Thus we resort to using general open resources to overcome this problem.",
        "The external general resources that can be readily used include the Web, WordNet, Knowledge bases, and query logs.",
        "In our system, we focus on the amalgamation of the Web and WordNet.",
        "The Web is the most rapidly growing and complete knowledge resource in the world now.",
        "The terms in the relevant documents retrieved from the Web are likely to be similar or even the same as those in the QA corpus since they both contain information about the facts of nature or the factual events in the history.",
        "Data redundancy of the web documents plays an important role to effectively retrieve the information for a certain entity or an element of an event.",
        "Aiming to solve the question-answer chasm at the semantic and discourse levels, QUALIFIER uses the Web as an additional resource to get more knowledge of the entities and events.",
        "It uses on the original content words in g0) to retrieve the top Nw documents in the Web using Google and then extracts the terms in those documents that are highly correlated with the original query terms.",

        "Finally, QUALIFIER merges all W; to form for g°\\ For the above Pompeii example, the top 10 terms extracted from the Web are: \"Vesuvius 79 ad roman eruption herculaneum buried active Italian \".",
        "The Web is useful at bridging the semantic and discourse gaps by providing the words that occur frequently with the original query terms in the local context.",
        "It however, lacks information on lexical relationships among these terms.",
        "In contrast to the Web, WordNet focuses on the lexical knowledge fabric by unearthing the \"synonymous\" terms.",
        "Thus to overcome the QA gap at the lexical and syntactic levels, QUALIFIER looks up WordNet to find words that are lexically related to the original content words.",
        "For the aforementioned Pompeii example, we find the followings by searching the glosses and synsets.",
        "a.",
        "Ancient -Gloss: \"belonging to times long past especially of the historical period before the fall of the Western Roman Empire\" -Synset: {age-old, antique} b. Volcano -Gloss: \"a fissure in the earth's crust (or in the surface of some other planet) through which molten lava and gases erupt\" -Synset: {vent, crater} c. Destroy -Gloss: \"destroy completely; damage irreparably\" -Synset: {ruin} Obviously, the glosses and synsets of the terms in q(0) contain useful terms that relate to potential answer candidates in the QA corpus.",
        "Here we use WordNet to extract the gloss words Gq and synset words Sq for g(0>.",
        "To link questions and answers at all the four levels of gaps, i.e., the lexical, syntactic, semantic and discourse levels, we need to combine the external knowledge sources.",
        "One approach is to expand the query by adding the top k words in Cq, and those in Gq and Sq.",
        "However, if we simply append all the terms, the resulting expanded query will likely to be too broad and contain too many terms out of context.",
        "Our experiments indicate that in many cases, adding additional terms from WordNet, i.e. those from Gq and Sq, adds more noise than information to the query.",
        "In general, we need to restrict the glosses and synonyms to only those terms found in the web documents, to ensure that they are in the right context.",
        "We solve this problem by using Gq and Sq to increase terms found in Cq as follow: Given wke_Cq:",
        "• if wke Gq, increase wk by a; • if wke Sq, increase wk by (3; where 0<p<a< 1.",
        "The final weight for each term is normalized and the top m terms above a certain cut-off threshold o are selected for expanding the original query as: q(1)= q(0)+{top m termseCq with weights>a} (2) where m=20 initially in our experiments.",
        "For the Pompeii example, the final expanded query is: \"volcano destroyed ancient city Pompeii Vesuvius eruption 79 ad roman herculaneum \".",

        "One promising advantage of our approach is that we are able to answer any factual questions about the elements in this QA event other than just \"What is the name of the volcano that destroyed the ancient city of Pompeii?",
        "\".",
        "For instance, we can easily handle questions like \"When was the ancient city of Pompeii destroyed?\" and \"Which two Roman cities were destroyed by Mount Vesuvius?\" etc.",

        "Currently, we are exploring the use of Semantic Perceptron Net (Liu & Chua 2001) to derive semantic word groups in order to form a more structured utilization of external knowledge.",
        "Given cj(1), QUALIFIER makes use of the MG tool to retrieve up to N (N=50) relevant documents from the QA corpus.",
        "We choose Boolean retrieval because of the short length of the queries, and to avoid returning too many irrelevant documents when using the similarity based retrieval.",
        "If q(1> does not return sufficient number of relevant documents, the extra terms added is reduced and the Boolean search is repeated.",
        "Therefore, we successively relax the constraint to ensure precision.",

        "It selects the top k sentences by evaluating the similarity between each of the sentences with the query in terms of basic query terms, noun phrases, answer target, etc.",

        "From these sentences, it extracts the string that matches the question classes (answer target) as the answer.",

        "Sometimes, there may be more than one matching strings in a single sentence.",
        "We will choose the string, which is nearest to the original query terms.",
        "For some questions, the system cannot find any answer and so we reduce the number of extra terms (w<20 in Equation 2) added to q<0) by p (p=l).",
