        "The use of maximum entropy (me) models has become popular in Statistical nlp; some example applications include part-of-speech (pos) tagging (Ratnaparkhi, 1996), parsing (Ratnaparkhi, 1999; Johnson et al., 1999) and language modelling (Rosenfeld, 1996).",
        "Many tagging problems have been successfully modelled in the me framework, including pos tagging, with state of the art performance (van Halteren et al., 2001), \"su-pertagging\" (Clark, 2002) and chunking (Koeling, 2000).",
        "Generalised Iterative Scaling (gis) is a very simple algorithm for estimating the parameters of a me model.",
        "The original formulation of gis (Darroch and Ratcliff, 1972) required the sum of the feature values for each event to be constant.",
        "Since this is not the case for many applications, the standard method is to add a \"correction\", or \"slack\", feature to each event.",
        "Improved Iterative Scaling (us) (Berger et al., 1996; Delia Pietra et al., 1997) eliminated the correction feature to improve the convergence rate of the algorithm.",
        "However, the extra book keeping required for iis means that gis is often faster in practice (Malouf, 2002).",
        "This paper shows, by a simple adaptation of Berger's proof for the convergence of iis (Berger, 1997), that gis does not require a correction feature.",
        "We also investigate how the use of a correction feature affects the performance of me taggers.",
        "gis and lis obtain a maximum likelihood estimate (mle) of the parameters, and, like other mle methods, are susceptible to overfitting.",
        "A simple technique used to avoid overfitting is a frequency cutoff, in which only frequently occurring features are included in the model (Ratnaparkhi, 1998) .",
        "However, more sophisticated smoothing techniques exist, such as the use of a Gaussian prior on the parameters of the model (Chen and Rosenfeld, 1999).",
        "This technique has been applied to language modelling (Chen and Rosenfeld, 1999) , text classification (Nigam et al., 1999) and parsing (Johnson et al., 1999), but to our knowledge it has not been compared with the use of a feature cutoff.",
        "We explore the combination of Gaussian smoothing and a simple cutoff for two tagging tasks.",
        "The two taggers used for the experiments are a pos tagger, trained on the wsj Penn Treebank, and a \"supertagger\", which assigns tags from the much larger set of lexical types from Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG) (Clark, 2002).",
        "Elimination of the correction feature and use of appropriate smoothing methods result in state of the art performance for both tagging tasks."

        "A conditional ME model, also known as a log-linear model, has the following form: where the functions fi are the features of the model, the At are the parameters, or weights, and Z(x) is a normalisation constant.",
        "This form can be derived by choosing the model with maximum entropy (i.e. the most uniform model) from a set of models that satisfy a certain set of constraints.",
        "The constraints are that the expected value of each feature fi according to the model p is equal to some value Ki (Rosenfeld, 1996): Calculating the expected value according to p requires summing over all contexts x, which is not possible in practice.",
        "Therefore we use the now standard approximation (Rosenfeld, 1996): where p(x) is the relative frequency of context x in the data.",
        "This is convenient because p(x) is zero for all those events not seen in the training data.",
        "Finding the maximum entropy model that satisfies these constraints is a constrained optimisation problem, which can be solved using the method of Lagrange multipliers, and leads to the form in (1) where the A; are the Lagrange multipliers.",
        "A natural choice for K, is the empirical expected value of the feature fi: which leads to the following set of constraints: An alternative motivation for this model is that, starting with the log-linear form in (1) and deriving (conditional) MLEs, we arrive at the same solution as the ME model which satisfies the constraints in (5)."

        "Moreover, we show in the Appendix, by a simple adaptation of Berger's proof for the convergence of us (Berger, 1997), that Gis converges to the maximum likelihood model without a correction feature.",
        "The proof works by introducing a correction feature with fixed weight of 0 into the IIS convergence proof.",
        "This feature does not contribute to the model and can be ignored during weight update.",
        "Introducing this null feature still satisfies Jensen's inequality, which is used to provide a lower bound on the change in likelihood between iterations, and the existing GIS weight update (7) can still be derived analytically.",
        "An advantage of GIS is that it is a very simple algorithm, made even simpler by the removal of the correction feature.",
