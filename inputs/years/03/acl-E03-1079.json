        "Incorrect attachment of prepositional phrases often constitutes the main source of errors in current parsing systems.",
        "Correct attachment of PPs is necessary to construct a parse tree which will support the proper interpretation of constituents in the sentence.",
        "Consider the time-worn example I saw the man with the telescope It is important to determine if the PP with the telescope is to be attached as a sister to the noun the man, restricting its interpretation, or if it is to be attached to the verb, thereby indicating the instrument of the main action described by the sentence.",
        "Based on examples of this sort, recent approaches have formalised the problem of disambiguating PP attachments as a binary choice, distinguishing between attachment of a PP to a given verb or to the verb's direct object (Ratnaparkhi et al., 1994; Collins and Brooks, 1995).",
        "This is, however, a simplification of the problem, which does not take the nature of the attachment into account.",
        "Precisely, it does not distinguish PP arguments from PP adjuncts.",
        "Consider the following example, which contains two PPs, both modifying the verb.",
        "Put the block on the table in the morning The first PP is a locative PP required by the sub-categorisation frame of the verb put, while in the morning is an optional descriptor of the time at which the action was performed.",
        "Though both attached to the verb, the two PPs entertain different relationships with the verb - the first is an argument while the latter is an adjunct.",
        "Analogous examples could be built for attachments to the noun.",
        "Is it important to model not just the site but also the nature of the attachment of a PP into the tree structure?",
        "We would like to claim that it is.",
        "Distinguishing arguments from adjuncts is key to identifying the semantic kernel of a sentence.",
        "Extracting the core meaning of a sentence or phrase, in turn, is necessary for automatic acquisition of important lexical knowledge, such as subcategori-sation frames and argument structures, which is used in several NLP tasks and applications, such as parsing or machine translation (Srinivas and Joshi, 1999; Dorr, 1997).",
        "Moreover, from a quantitative point of view, arguments and adjuncts have different statistical properties, requiring different statistical techniques.",
        "For example, (Hindle and Rooth, 1993) clearly indicate that their lexical association technique performs much better for arguments than for adjuncts, whether the attachment is to the verb or to the noun.",
        "Researchers have abstracted away from this distinction, because identifying arguments and adjuncts is a notoriously difficult task, taxing many native speakers' intuitions and requiring complex world knowledge.",
        "The usual expectation has been that this discrimination is not amenable to a corpus-based treatment.",
        "In recent work, however, we succeed in distinguishing arguments from adjuncts using evidence extracted from a parsed corpus (Merlo and Leybold, 2001).",
        "Our method develops corpus-based statistical correlates for the diagnostics used in linguistics to decide whether a PP is an argument or an adjunct.",
        "A numerical vectorial representation of the notion of argument-hood is provided, which supports automatic classification, reaching 86% accuracy.",
        "In the current paper, we extend this work and propose a new formulation of the PP attachment problem.",
        "We treat PP attachment as a 4-way classification of PPs into noun argument PPs, noun adjunct PPs, verb argument PPs, and verb adjunct PPs.",
        "We show that it is possible to build a classifier that solves this problem using corpus evidence, with good accuracy (74%).",
        "This classifier solves the classification problem directly, in one step.",
        "Interestingly, we show that a 4-way classifier reaches better accuracy than a two-step sequence of binary classifiers, which first solve the noun-verb attachment problem and then refine the attachment decision into argument or adjunct.",
        "This result indicates that the current formulation of the PP attachment problem cannot be considered a first step in the solution of the final 4-way discrimination task.",
        "Finally, we note that the improvement is especially due to a better recognition of verbs' arguments, thus providing more accurate information to many NLP tasks and applications.",
        "Solving this novel 4-way classification task crucially relies on the ability to distinguish arguments from adjuncts using corpus counts."

        "Few attempts have been made to distinguish arguments from adjuncts automatically (Buchholz, 1999; Merlo and Leybold, 2001; Villavicencio, 2002; Aldezabal et al., 2002).",
        "The core difficulty in this enterprise is to define the notion of argument precisely.",
        "There is a consensus in linguistics that arguments and adjuncts are different both with respect to their function in the sentence and in the way they themselves are interpreted (Jackendoff, 1977; Marantz, 1984; Pollard and Sag, 1987; Grimshaw, 1990).",
        "With respect to their function, an argument fills a role in the relation described by its associated head, while an adjunct predicates a separate property of its associate head or phrase.",
        "With respect to their interpretation, a complement is an argument if its interpretation depends exclusively on the head with which it is associated, while it is an adjunct if its interpretation remains relatively constant when associating with different heads (Grimshaw, 1990, 108).",
        "Restricting the discussion to PPs, these differences are illustrated in the following examples (PP-argument in bold), see also (Schütze, 1995, 100).",
        "a) Kim camps/jogs/meditates on Sunday b) Kim depended on Sandy In example a) the PP on Sunday can be construed without any reference to the preceding part of the sentence, and it preserves its meaning even when combining with different heads.",
        "This is, however, not the case for b).",
        "Here, the PP can only be properly understood in connection with the rest of the sentence: Sandy is the person on whom someone depends.",
        "These semantic distinctions surface in observable syntactic differences, giving rise to a set of linguistic diagnostics to determine whether a PP is an adjunct or an argument.",
        "We illustrate here those countable diagnostics that can be approximated statistically and estimated using corpus counts, thus combining linguistic insight with the robustness of corpus-based methods."

        "Many diagnostics for argumenthood have been proposed in the literature (Schütze, 1995).",
        "Some of them require complex syntactic manipulation of the sentence, such as wft-extraction, and are therefore too difficult to apply automatically.",
        "We extend our previous work (Merlo and Leybold, 2001) and choose six diagnostics that can be captured by simple corpus counts: head dependence, op-tionality, iterativity, ordering, copular paraphrase, and deverbal nominalisation.",
        "These diagnostics tap into the deeper semantic properties that distinguish arguments from adjuncts.",
        "Head Dependence Arguments depend on their lexical heads, because they form an integral part of the phrase.",
        "Adjuncts do not.",
        "Consequently, PP-arguments can only appear with the specific verbal or nominal head by which they are lexically selected, while PP-adjuncts can co-occur with a far greater range of different heads than arguments (Pollard and Sag, 1987, 136), as illustrated in the example sentences below (PP-argument in bold).",
        "a) a man/woman/scarecrow with gray hair b) a student/*punk/*watermelon of physics We capture this insight by measuring the dispersion of the distribution over the different verbs or nouns that co-occur with a given PP in a corpus.",
        "We expect adjunct PPs to have higher dispersion than argument PPs.",
        "Differently from our previous simpler implementation (Merlo and Leybold, 2001), we use entropy as a measure of the dispersion of the distribution, as indicated in (1) (ft indicates the noun or verb head to which the PP is attached).",
        "Optionality In most cases of verb attachment,PP-arguments are obligatory elements of a given sentence whose absence leads to ungrammatical-ity, while adjuncts do not contribute to the semantics of any particular verb, hence they are optional, as illustrated in the following examples: a) John put the book in the room b) *John put the book c) John saw/read the book in the room d) John saw/read the book The notion of optionality can be captured by the conditional probability of a PP given a particular verbal head, P(PP\\v).",
        "!We do not compute this measure for nominal heads as PP are always optional when governed by a nominal head.",
        "Iterativity and Ordering Arguments cannot be iterated and they must be adjacent to the selecting lexical head.",
        "Neither of these two restrictions apply to adjuncts, as illustrated in the examples below.",
        "a) * Chris rented the gazebo to girls, to boys b) Kim met Sandy in Baltimore in the hotel lobby in a corner Thus, the probability of a PP being an adjunct can be approximated as the probability of its occurrence in second position in a sequence of PPs, as indicated in (2).",
        "Copular Paraphrase The diagnostic of copular paraphrase is specific to the distinction of NPs arguments and adjuncts (Schütze, 1995, 103).",
        "NP arguments cannot be paraphrased by a copular relative clause (examples b and b'), while adjuncts can (examples a and a').",
        "a) a man from Paris a') a man who was from Paris b) the weight of the cow b') *the weight that was of the cow Thus, the probability that a PP is an adjunct can be approximated by the probability of its occurrence following a copular verb, such as be, become, appear, seem, remain (Quirk et al., 1985), as indicated in (3).",
        "Déverbal Nouns This diagnostic is based on the observation that PPs following a déverbal noun are likely to be arguments.",
        "This diagnostic can be captured by a probability indicators function, that assigns probability 1 of being an argument to PPs following a déverbal noun and 0 otherwise.",
        "In conclusion, the different properties of arguments and adjuncts can be reduced to surface indicators, which can be estimated by appropriate corpus counts."

        "Iterativity and ordering are approximated by collecting counts indicating the proportion of cases in which a given PP in first position had been found in second position in a sequence of multiple PPs over the total of PPs in second position, as indicated in (6).",
        "The problem of sparse data here is especially serious, because of the small frequencies of multiple PPs.",
        "We estimate this measure in a single variant using a backed-off estimation (Katz, 1987), where we replace lexical items by their WordNet classes.",
        "Copular paraphrase is captured by calculating the proportion of times a given PP follows a copular verb over all the times it appears following any verb.",

        "The discrimination between noun and verb attachment can be performed first, and then further refined into attachment as argument or adjunct, performing the 4-way classification in two steps.",
        "The two-step approach would be the natural way of extending current PP attachment disambiguation methods to the more specific 4-way attachment we propose here.",

        "Tables 1 reports the classification accuracy of the two comparative experiments performed.",
        "All reported numbers are averages of accuracies on 9 different data samples.",
        "The first column reports the baseline accuracy for both tasks, calculated by performing the classification using only the feature preposition.",
        "The second column shows the results of an experiment where all the features described above were used for the classification.",
        "The third column reports the results in which only the lexical heads and most effective features - determined experimentally - were used.",
        "The fourth column reports the results in which the lexical heads and their classes together with the most effective features were used.",
        "For the two-step classification experiment, we determined the best feature for each classifier independently.",
        "We observe that the 4-way classification is better in both cases, even if the two-step method decomposes the problem in simpler tasks.",
        "The degradation in performance of the two-step approach compared to the 4-way classification is not unexpected and is likely due to the inappropriate underlying assumptions about the distribution of the data.",
        "A two-step approach assumes that the preferred attachment in the first step subsumes the preferred attachment in the second step.",
        "For example, it assumes that a given PP can first be classified as attached to the verb and then refined as a verb argument.",
        "Numerically, this assumption is only verified if the largest proportion of cases over the four possible attachments is a subset of the larger proportion of cases in the disambiguation between noun and verb attachment.",
        "In general, this assumption holds if the distribution of cases is very skewed.",
        "But in some case it does not hold.",
        "For example, consider a hypothetical ambiguous PP sequence, distributed across the four possible outcomes with the following proportions: N-arg .25; N-adj .35; V-arg .4; V-adj 0.",
        "As can be easily seen, a two-step approach relying directly on the proportion of cases in the data would classify this sequence as an NP attachment at first (.25 + .35 = .6 > .4), assigning it to the N-adj class in a second step.",
        "However, the most likely assignment in a 4-way classification, and the correct one, is that the PP is an argument of the verb.",
        "Detailed data analysis of our corpus indicates that some n-way ambiguities exist and that in these cases even distributions of attachments, though rare, do arise in practice.",
        "Multiple ambiguities arise, not at the level of word sequences, but at the level of the abstract representations used to cope with sparse data.",
        "For example, they arise for PPs represented as a preposition and the semantic class of the PP-internal noun.",
        "For such abstract representations, one can find a few instances of the unskewed distribution illustrated above.",
        "For these cases, a two-step approach would favour the wrong solution.",
        "Consider the case of the PP consisting of the preposition at and the WordNet class 14 (group), whose relative frequencies in the Penn Treebank are N-arg .12, N-adj .41, V-arg 0, V-adj .47.",
        "A two-step approach would first choose a noun attachment, and further refine the choice to adjunct, while the most frequent case is the verb adjunct attachment case.",
        "Another similar example, is the case of the PP consisting of the preposition from and the WordNet class 4 (artifact).",
        "In this instance, a two-step approach would favour a verb attachment at first, further refined into argument attachment, while the preferred attachment is A more refined analysis of the errors of our classifiers confirms this interpretation.",
        "Table 2 shows the F-scores for a sample used in the experiment reported in the fourth column of Table 1.",
        "As can be seen, the 4-way classification is a little worse for noun attachments (due to worse recall of noun adjuncts) but better for the verb attachments.",
        "The distribution of the errors reveals that improvements can be observed in distinguishing noun arguments and verb arguments - clearly an instance in which the actual attachment site does not subsume the assigned attachment.",
        "This result confirms that it is misleading to formalise PP attachment as a binary problem, assuming that a distinction between arguments and adjuncts can be performed later, if necessary, without loss of accuracy.",
        "The 4-way classification also reveals a little improvements in the discrimination of verb arguments from verb adjuncts (especially fewer verb arguments misclassified as adjuncts).",
        "Improvements in the precision of verb arguments is particularly relevant, as this class of attachments is crucial in supporting further language processing tasks, which usually require precise knowledge of a verb's subcategorization frame.",
        "In conclusion, these results show that good accuracy on a fine-grained and informative classification of PPs can be achieved using corpus counts.",
        "Moreover, classification of PPs performed with a single classifier is more accurate than sequencing binary classifiers: by tackling the 4-way discrimination problem directly, the approach does not rely on any assumption on the distribution of the data, and thereby reaches better accuracy.",
        "Finally, a result of particular interest is the improved discrimination of verb arguments from verb adjuncts compared to a two-step approach, a promising result for all the numerous NLP tasks and applications that rely on the correct identification of a verb's subcategorization frame."
