        "There are currently a number of POS-tagged Chinese corpora available, based on different tagsets and theoretical frameworks.",
        "Some are more semantic-oriented in determining the syntactic category of a word.",
        "For instance, CKIP (1993) had a very fine-grained classification of Chinese verbs based on thematic structures.",
        "Others are mainly based on syntactic distribution (e.g. Yu et ai, 1998; Xia, 2000) where POS tags are assigned mainly depending on the syntactic properties of the target words.",
        "Given the many-to-many relation between grammatical function and lexical category in Chinese, it is often not straightforward as to how certain words should be tagged in particular sentences.",
        "For example, should the verb '[ft |j |huai2yi2 (to suspect) be given the same tag in all cases in (l)?",
        "The digits following the Hanyu pinyin indicate the tone.",
        "(1) a. mmMi&SM (I suspect he is a thief) wo3 huai2yi2 tal shi4 zei2 b. ft!l?BMfiM:S'[iH (He wears a suspicious look) tal man3lian3 Imai2yi2 blao3qing2 c xlH^SfilJlMS (Tnis is only my suspicion) zheA zhi3shi4 wo3 de5 huai2yi2 Most Chinese grammarians would suggest that Chinese words have predefined lexical categories mainly based on their syntactic properties, which should not be contingent upon the grammatical function the words play in particular sentences (e.g. Zhu, 2001).",
        "In this study, however, we will show that categorial fluidity (i.e. the relative flexibility of a word being used for different grammatical functions) should be captured in the tagging of large corpora to provide an important resource for the study of this special linguistic phenomenon, as well as for lexicography and natural language processing.",
        "In Section 2, we first discuss POS ambiguity and categorial fluidity in Chinese and the difficulty thus posed on tagging.",
        "Then in Section 3, we report on a preliminary empirical study of the categorial fluidity and shift between Chinese verbs and nouns.",
        "The implications for POS tagging are explored in Section 4, followed by a conclusion with future work in Section 5."

        "The major problem in POS tagging, for all languages alike, is probably that of ambiguity.",
        "Where a word has multiple potential POS tags, the ambiguity has to be resolved in context.",
        "The problem of POS ambiguity is especially salient for Chinese, mainly for two reasons.",
        "First, categorial change in Chinese words is not often associated with morphological marking.",
        "Thus the same word form can have more than one syntactic categories, and this difference is not marked by any derivational affixes.",
        "For example, the word yMM$ Ung3dao3, can be a verb (to lead) or a noun (leader), as in (2).",
        "(2) a. yMMSMMM (to lead the country forward) Ung3dao3 guo2jial qian2jin4 b. mW^nn^mm (He is our leader) tal shi4 wo3men2 de5 Ung3dao3 Second, the same Chinese word can have different grammatical functions in individual sentences.",
        "There is no one-to-one relationship between grammatical function and syntactic category.",
        "As in (3), the word (sing) is the predicate in (a) but is the modifier in (b).",
        "tal chang4gel b. HiKS^ (singing skill) chang4gel ji4qiao3 POS ambiguity is a serious problem for Chinese in a small portion of the Chinese lexicon, but especially among the most frequently used lexical items (Liu, 2000).",
        "Moreover, we may think of categorial fluidity as a continuum, from genuine ambiguities to specific cases of \"word play\".",
        "Any categorial shift undergoes a transition, moving from the \"word play\" end toward the genuine ambiguity end.",
        "Thus we distinguish three levels of ambiguity, namely:",
        "• Regular ambiguity: a word has multiple POSs which are well accepted and described in any existing lexicon, as in (4).",
        "• Transitional ambiguity: a word undergoes a process of categorial shift, where it originally belongs to a particular syntactic category and gradually assumes usage of another category as well.",
        "Many prepositions in Chinese are evolved from verbs, as in (5).",
        "Categorial shift from verb to noun is also common, as discussed in the next section.",
        "• Innovative ambiguity: sometimes words are deliberately used in peculiar ways to create a special effect, as in (6).",
        "Such individual cases cannot be regarded as genuine ambiguity, until the special use becomes common enough.",
        "yil zhangl tai3bu4 b. iSJfciSP (rice ready, open mouth) fan4 lai2 zhangl kou3 c jjfl^ (Mr. Zhang) zhangl xianlshengl (5) a.

        "As said, when innovative uses become frequent enough, at some point they might be considered, or at least treated as, genuine ambiguities.",
        "Nevertheless, it is the process of transition that is of linguistic interest, and the usage frequencies from corpus data gathered over time would give good evidence for it.",
        "As a result, when tagging a corpus, the different uses of the same word must be sufficiently represented to enable this kind of longitudinal empirical study to be carried out.",
        "In the following section, we will first discuss a preliminary study along this line, and then in Section 4, we will further discuss the implications on the requirements of POS tagging."

        "Very often when a verb is nominalised, it loses part of a verb's syntactic features.",

        "At what point is the shift significant enough to become genuine ambiguity?",

        "There are around 6.6K verbs, excluding auxiliary and copula verbs.",
        "Out of these, 672 were found also tagged nouns or nominalised verbs.",
        "In other words, about 10% of all verbs in the subcorpus were playing a role somewhere in the verb-noun categorial shift.",
        "A simple ratio (Eq.l) was computed for all the 672 verbs to give a picture of the categorial shift as reflected by the preliminarily tagged data.",
        "The log ratio was used to give a linear scale.",
        "If verb usage outnumbers noun usage to a certain extent, i.e. when r >> 0, it suggests that the word is originally a verb and has just started to shift.",
        "If verb usage and noun usage are more or less equal, i.e. when r ~ 0, then either the shift is mature enough or there is genuine ambiguity.",
        "Meanwhile, if noun usage outnumbers verb usage by a lot, it would mean that either the verb has over shifted or the word is originally a noun and is occasionally denominalised (i.e. beginning to shift).",
        "Preliminary analysis of the data shows that about 58% of the words have r>0.3, that is, verb usage at least doubles noun usage for these words.",
        "About 23% have r between -0.3 and 0.3.",
        "These are the words of which verb usage and noun usage are quite balanced.",

        "Chinese POS tagging can so far be grouped into two approaches.",
        "One holds that words have predefined POSs independent of sentential contexts.",
        "So as long as the form and the meaning do not change, the POS does not change.",
        "Another approach is of the view that grammatical function within a particular sentence determines POSs.",
        "So a word is sometimes tagged as verb and sometimes as noun depending on its syntactic distribution in any given sentence.",
        "The debate between the two approaches has never been settled, and in this section we will discuss if there can be a compromised approach by considering the practical and theoretical concerns of POS tagging.",
        "There are at least two practical concerns in Chinese POS tagging.",
        "First, we want to obtain information on the distribution of word uses.",
        "It may defeat the purpose of corpus tagging if every word is tagged independent of sentential contexts.",
        "Second, we need to distinguish between different syntactic structures, as in (12).",
        "hong2shaol pai2gu3 a. V-O: to roast spare ribs b. Mod-Head: roasted spare ribs If (12) is always tagged as a verb followed by a noun, the two different readings cannot be distinguished.",
        "Hence apparently it would be preferable to assign different tags to a word when it is used in different syntactic distribution.",
        "However, this introduces a crisis for the whole classification of Chinese syntactic categories because any given word cannot be prescribed a category and any category cannot be adequately described.",
        "Moreover, it upsets the compactness and the organisation of the lexicon.",
        "Hence even if the ambiguities are still in the transitional stage and should not be kept in the lexicon, it is still preferable to have them captured and reflected in a tagged corpus.",
        "Xia's (2000) approach does not accommodate such transitional usages, but assigns a verb tag if the word is used as a verb and a noun tag if it is used as a noun.",
        "CKIP (1993) assigns the same tag to the same word, but uses features to encode specific grammatical functions, such as using [+nom] to indicate a nominalised usage of a verb.",
        "For the current study, we reckon that the categorial fluidity information should be captured as early as the tagging begins.",
        "So we attempted to resolve the conflict between theoretical and practical concerns via the design of the tagset.",
        "In that case the final lexicon would be theoretically valid on the one hand, and the tagged corpus would be of practical use for NLP tasks (e.g. parsing) on the other.",
        "In our approach, each tag consists of a letter code for the general classification (i.e. noun, verb, etc.)",
        "of the word, and another for the sub-classification according to the particular context.",
        "For example, when a verb is used as the subject on its own (i.e. no modification, not in a phrase, etc.",
        "), we tag it as Vx.",
        "Thus on the one hand we still recognise it as a verb, but on the other hand we can distinguish it from its normal form of usage.",
        "Moreover, theoretically we do not treat it as nominalised but if for any practical reason someone might want it this way, he or she can easily extract all the Vx-tagged words and mark them nouns."
