        "Today, many NLP applications make active use of thesauri like WordNet, which serve as background lexical knowledge for processing the semantics of words and documents.",
        "However, maintaining a thesaurus so that it sufficiently covers the lexicon of novel text data requires a lot of time and effort, which may be prohibitive in many settings.",
        "One possibility to (semi-) automatically enrich a thesaurus with new items is to exploit the distributional hypothesis.",
        "According to this approach, the meaning of a new word is first represented as the totality of textual contexts where it occurs and then assigned to that semantic class which members exhibit similar occurrence patterns.",
        "The distributional approach was shown to be quite effective for tasks where new words need to be assigned to a limited number of classes (up to 5; e.g., Riloff and Shepherd, 1997; Roark and Charniak, 1998).",
        "However, its application to numerous classes, as would be the case with a thesaurus of a realistic size, proves to be much more challenging.",
        "For example , Alfonseca and Manandhar (2002) attain the ned measures of distributional and imilarity",
        "In the present paper we propose a method that is particularly effective for the task of classifying words into numerous classes forming a hierarchy.",
        "The position of a class inside the hierarchy reflects the degree of its semantic similarity to other classes.",
        "Besides distributional data, our method integrates this semantic information: the classification decision is a function of both (1) the distributional similarity of the new word to the target class and (2) the strength of the semantic relatedness of the target class to other likely candidates.",
        "Thus, using the thesaurus as background knowledge we aim to make up for possible insufficient quality of the distributional data."

        "We evaluate our approach on the task where nouns are classified into a predefined set of semantic classes.",
        "Thereby, the meaning of each noun n is represented as a distributional feature vector, where features are verbs ve V linked to the noun by predicate-object relations.",
        "The values of the features are conditional probabilities P(vk) estimated from the frequencies observed in the corpus.",
        "To measure the similarity between vectors of nouns n and m, we used the Li distance metric: To assign a noun to a class, we use the k nearest neighbors algorithm (KNN): for each test noun, it first determines a set of k nearest neighbors according to the similarity metric and aS-Learning Accuracy (Hahn andSchattinger 1998) as an evaluation measure is described in Section 3.",
        "\" We also experimented with the cosine, Jaccard coefficient and the skew divergence getting somewhat more favorable results for L i. signs the noun to the class that has the majority among the nearest neighbors.",
        "In doing so, a classifier produces a ranked list of candidate classes, where the rank of a class is determined by the number of its members present in the nearest neighbor set.",
        "Our classification method combines the ranking score for a class given by the classifier with the semantic relatedness between several top-ranking candidates.",
        "It prefers to assign new words to those classes that are semantically related to other likely candidate classes and disfavors those classes that appear to be semantically distant from other candidates.",
        "To assess the semantic similarity between classes in a thesaurus, we needed such a measure that is independent of corpus data.",
        "We chose the measure used in (Hahn and Schattinger 1998).",
        "To compare classes c and d, one first determines their least common hypernym h. The semantic similarity T between c and d is then defined as the proportion of the length len(h, r) of the path between h and the root node r to the sum of lengths len{h,r), len(c,h), and len(d,h): T is directly proportional to the length between the least common hypernym and the root, which captures the intuition that a given length between two concrete concepts signifies greater similarity than the same length between two abstract concepts.",
        "T is such that 0< T< 1, with T - 1 signifying the maximum semantic similarity.",
        "These two sources of evidence are then combined to calculate a new score for each class c: where A (c) is the score for the class c given by the classifier; D is a set of top ranking classes other than c (their number is chosen experimentally); T(c,d) is semantic similarity between c and a class dsD.",
        "The function is dependent on the free parameter fi 03>1), which modifies T in such a way that only those classes d, that are semantically closest to c, contribute to the final score fore.",
        "The classification procedure can be summarized as follows: See (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2001) for a review of semantic similarity measures.",
        "In principle, it can be any type of a classifier that assigns some score to each class, such as votes of nearest neighbors in the case of KNN or probabilities in the case of Naïve Bayes.",
        "Step 1: For a new word w, a standard classifier proposes a set of most likely candidate classes; the score A (c) for each of the classes is remembered.",
        "Step 2: A new score S(c) for each class c is computed by adding to A (c) the sum of A (d) over de D, each weighted by the semantic similarity T(c,d).",
        "Step 3: w is assigned to c with the biggest S(c).",
        "3 Test data and evaluation methods",
        "The proposed method was tested on the distributional data on nouns obtained from two corpora: the British National Corpus (BNC) and the Associated Press 1988 corpus (AP).",
        "The BNC data consisted of over 1.34 million verb-object cooccurrence pairs, whereby the objects were both direct and prepositional; only those pairs extracted from the corpus were retained that appeared more than once and which involved nouns appearing with at least 5 different verbs.",
        "The AP dataset contained 0.73 million verbs-direct objects pairs, which involved 1000 most frequent nouns in the corpus.",
        "The semantic classes used in the experiments were constructed from WordNet noun synsets as follows.",
        "Each synset positioned seven edges below the topmost level formed a class by subsuming all its hyponym synsets.",
        "Then all classes that contained less than 5 nouns were discarded.",
        "Thus the BNC nouns formed 233 classes with 1807 unique nouns and the AP nouns formed 137 classes with 816 unique nouns.",
        "For both datasets, presence of a noun in multiple classes was allowed.",
        "The experiments were conducted using tenfold cross-validation.",
        "The nouns present in the constructed classes were divided into a training set and a test set.",
        "After that the ability of the cla s-sifiers to recover the original class of a test noun was tested.",
        "Their performance was evaluated in terms of precision and in terms of learning accuracy (Hahn and Schattinger, 1998).",
        "The latter is a measure designed specifically to evaluate the quality of classifying instances into a hierarchy of classes.",
        "It describes the semantic similarity between the assigned class and the correct class (Equation 2) averaged over all test instances."

        "The first was the one that determines the score for a class by simply counting its members among the nearest neighbors (\"baseline\").",
        "The second was the distance-weighted version of KNN: each neighbor voted for its class or classes with a weight proportional to its distributional similarity to the test word (\"distributional similarity weighting\").",
        "The weight in the third version was determined according to Equation 3, whereby A(c) was just the number of votes for the class (i.e., without considering the distributional similarity values, \"semantic similarity weighting\").",
        "Figure 1 describes the precision demonstrated by these three weighting possibilities on the BNC data (for \"semantic similarity weighting\", the parameter fi was tuned to 5).",

        "The semantic weighting schema performs not as well as the distributional one in terms of precision.",
        "In terms of learning accuracy, however, it surpasses it at greater values of k. This can be explained by the fact that one is more likely to obtain valuable semantic information about a class, when one estimates its relatedness in the thesaurus to a bigger number of classes.",

        "We thus saw that both distributional and semantic weighting provide useful evidence about the class for a new word.",
        "In the next step, we tested their combination: in Equation 3, A(C) was the sum of neighbors' votes, each weighted by the distributional similarity of the neighbor to the test word.",
        "Figure 3 compares the precision and learning accuracy of the combined weighting schema to the distributional weighting.",
        "Table 2 compares the best results of two schemas on the data of the both corpora.",
