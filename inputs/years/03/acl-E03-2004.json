        "Producing spoken output with contextually appropriate intonation is one of the challenges for flexible dialogue systems with dynamically constructed output and synthesized speech.",
        "It is a well known fact that intonation reflects the relation of an utterance to the context, and that contextually inappropriate intonation may have negative effect on intelligibility or lead to confusion.",
        "We demonstrate improvements of contextual appropriateness of English and German intonation in the GoDiS system.",
        "Intonation is controlled by information structure, which is determined from the context representation in the information state of the system using the information-state update approach to dialogue.",
        "This note is structured as follows.",
        "In §2 we give an overview of GoDiS and its information-state update approach.",
        "In §3 we introduce the information structure partitioning we employ, and the rules we use to determine it from the information state.",
        "In §4 we describe the generation of spoken output with contextually varied intonation in GoDiS using the Festival and Mary text-to-speech synthesis systems.",

      "text": [
        "One of the goals of the information-state update approach is to encourage modularity, reusability and plug-and-play; to demonstrate this, GoDiS has been adapted to several different dialogue types (information-seeking, action-oriented), domains (travel agency, autoroute, mobile phone, VCR) and languages (English, Swedish, German) (Larsson, 2002).Speech input and output are also supported in GoDiS.",
        "The GoDiS architecture is shown in Fig. 1.",
        "It is an instantiation of the general TrindiKit architecture (Larsson and Ericsson, 2002).",
        "The information state in GoDiS represented as a record (Fig.",
        "2) is a modified version of the dialogue game board (Ginzburg, 1996).",
        "The main division is between information which is private to an agent and that which is shared between agents.",

        "Information structure (IS) refers to the organization speakers impose on their utterances to relate them to the context (what they believe is shared) and the intended context change (corresponding to their communicative intentions).",
        "The approach to IS we employ follows (Steed-man, 2000).",
        "This choice is motivated by the insights that Steedman incorporates and the degree of their explicit formalization.",
        "We thus use two dimensions of IS: (i) a partitioning into Theme and Rheme, corresponding to a semantic aboutness relation; and (ii) a further partitioning of both Theme and Rheme into Background and Focus, reflecting a contrast between alternatives in the context against which the actual Theme and Rheme are cast.",
        "E.g., the IS-partitioning suitable in the context of The heater in the hall is out.",
        "But what is the status of the light in the hall?'}",
        "*We print words bearing pitch accents in SMALL CAPl-Intonation is one of the means by which IS can be realized.",
        "For English, Steedman has argued that IS is homomorphic to intonation structure: The Theme/Rheme partitioning determines the overall intonation pattern: different accents are used within the Theme (L+H*, L*+H) and within the Rheme (H*, L*, H*+L, H+L*).",
        "The Focus/Background partitioning determines the placement of pitch accents: they are assigned to the words realizing the Focus within Theme and Rheme.",
        "A Rheme must always contain a Focus, while Themes can be unmarked (without Focus) or marked (with Focus).",
        "Tunes are obtained by combining accents with appropriate boundaries and boundary tones.",
        "Steedman has argued that the contour H*LL% is one of the \"rheme tunes\" in assertions in English, and L+H*LH% is a (marked) Theme-tune.",
        "For German, we adopt H+L*LL% as a default rheme tune, and L+H*H-% for a marked theme (these accents are the ones implemented as defaults in the Mary system we use to synthesise German; cf. (Kruijff-Korbayova et al., 2003) for more discussion).",
        "We have implemented IS-assignment to system moves in GoDiS as a module invoked from the selection algorithm (cf.",
        "Fig.",
        "1).",
        "The module takes as input the propositional content of a dialogue move, and returns this content IS-partitioned.",

        "database lexicon domain knowledge First, the QudTR rule partitions the content into Rheme and Theme, according to the question topmost on QUD.",
        "Next, the determination of the Background/Focus partitioning within each Theme and Rheme is done using a notion of (semantic) parallelism, by two complementary rules which differ in what the source of alternatives is taken to be: The ComFB rule tries to assign Focus on the basis of the previous dialogue context, looking for alternatives in the shared.com field of the information state.",
        "If this fails to assign any Focus, the rule DomFB assigns Focus by looking for alternatives in the domain representation.",
        "(See (Prevost, 1995) for a similar algorithm.)",
        "The IS partitioning of a dialogue move content is encoded by the operators rh for Rheme, foc-rh for Rheme-Focus and focjth for Theme-Focus.",
        "Finally, the IS-partitioned content is sent to the generation module, which produces a string of words with an annotation of the IS partitioning using an internal set of labels <rh>, <f_rh> and <f_th>, respectively."
