      "text": [
        "Written text for communication is of growing importance in e-mails, SMS, newsgroups, web pages – even in synchronous communication situations like chatting, transmitted by electronic devices (computers, cellular phones, handhelds).",
        "Computer assisted text entry methods such as ambiguous keyboards are feasible for synchronous and even for asynchronous communication scenarios as they allow complex communication on small electronic devices.",
        "Various systems on the mobile phone and handheld market promise a solution to easier and faster text entry.",
        "People with communication disorders are a second group of users who can benefit from 'The project is partially funded by the DFG – German Research Foundation – under grant HA 2716/2-1.",
        "computer-assisted text input.",
        "Often, speech impairments coincide with severe motor impairments.",
        "Standard keyboards or graphical input devices are often unsuitable for motor impaired users.",
        "Sometimes, only the operation of one or a very small number of physical switches is possible via buttons, joystick, eye-tracking or otherwise.",
        "These two contexts of use are considerably different: Mobile communication typically happens in the context of asynchronous telecommunication (although fast exchange via SMS or email sometimes develops into a synchronous communication situation).",
        "Alternative and augmentative (AAC) methods typically deal with communication strategies in synchronous, face-to-face contexts where, e.g., an electronic communication aid is used to produce a text that is synthesized by a text-to-speech system.",
        "(Of course, the produced text can also be utilized in asynchronous telecommunication.)",
        "However, in both contexts the challenging goal is to efficiently produce short pieces of – usually highly variable – natural language text under difficult circumstances.",
        "The small size of the device is one factor prohibiting the use of a full keyboard, the other factor is the user's restricted motor function.",
        "Both application areas share the aim of a personalized language model to be most effective for the user."

      "heading": "2 Efficient text input methods",
      "text": [
        "Two main classes of efficient text input methods can be identified.",
        "First, on a standard QWERTY keyboard, input can be accelerated by predicting completion of commands and other word strings (Darragh and Witten, 1992), which reduces the number of keystrokes necessary to enter a word.",
        "Motion impaired users who cannot access a full keyboard are slowed down because they have to select each individual key in multiple steps (scanning).",
        "Second, ambiguous keyboards give rise to communication based on a reduced number of keys (down to 4, cf.",
        "Fig.",
        "1).",
        "Typing on these devices, the user presses the key corresponding to the letter only once.",
        "When the key corresponding to the space bar is pressed, a dictionary is consulted to find all words corresponding to the ambiguous code.",
        "The advantages of an ambiguous keyboard with word disambiguation for users of AAC devices are outlined by Kushler (1998).",
        "The efficiency of an ambiguous keyboard approximates one keystroke per letter.",
        "Apart from literacy, no memorization of special encodings is required.",
        "Attention to the display is required only after the word has been typed.",
        "A keyboard with fewer and larger keys may allow easier direct selection for users who otherwise may depend on scanning.",
        "An obstacle to both strategies, prediction and disambiguation, may arise from gaps in the electronic lexicon.",
        "If a word is not known to the system, the user of an ambiguous keyboard has to leave the typing mode in order to enter the word by other means.",
        "Another drawback of ambiguous text entry is the increased cognitive load imposed on users while typing the word: They may be unable to see the letters of the word already typed and therefore have to memorize the input position."

        "Assistive devices have to respond to dramatically varying needs (Edwards, 1995).",
        "Therefore, in order to be useful, they should allow adaptation to specific requirements.",
        "We decided basically to design an open architecture for a communication system with publicly available sources.",
        "Scaffolding for our implementation is provided by the programmable and extendable Emacs text editor, which already includes many text entry and manipulation functions useful in our context.",
        "Furthermore, operating system support (e.g. sockets), basic applications like mail, and a development environment with extensive documentation are at the programmer's fingertips.",
        "All components in the communication aid dealing with input/output have been implemented as Emacs Lisp modules.",
        "Our communication aid called UKO-II (Fig.",
        "1) is adaptable in two ways: First, the system is customizable to differing keyboard layouts and to the selection of word suggestions or additional editing commands.",
        "Second, a layered structure of language models controls the disambiguation process and adapts to the user's text input.",
        "We discuss both modes in turn.",
        "Our text entry interface presumes n (n > 1) physical buttons.",
        "This parameter is determined either by the user's motor functions or the device's available buttons.",
        "For n > 4, a genetic algorithm computes a distribution of letters that optimizes the length of suggested word lists with respect to the fixed word frequency information provided by the lexicon.",
        "We utilize the frequencies of the CELEX database (Baayen et ah, 1995) either for German or English; cf. Kiihn and Garbe (2001) for off-line design of the entire keyboard layout.",
        "If n < 3, the keys have to be selected on a virtual keyboard {scanning).",
        "In our project the keyboard is tailored to a user with cerebral palsy.",
        "No more than four buttons can be accessed directly.",
        "Three buttons are ambiguous letter keys with sets of letters assigned to them.",
        "The fourth button invokes letter deletion, command mode or word disambiguation.",
        "Words are entered by pressing the corresponding ambiguous key once for each letter.",
        "Only after the word is completed, the user disambiguates the input by selecting the intended word in a list of hits provided by the language model.",

        "Furthermore, the user can add personal vocabulary such as proper names.",
        "Except for the stop word list, the layers are combined by interpolating the probabilities for any word proposal.",
        "Alternatively, the user chooses explicitly between the local text model, a domain model or the general model in order to disambiguate a word.",
        "We have implemented several language models providing the user with ranked lists of predicted words for ambiguous input.",
        "Communication between a language model and the text entry interface is handled in a client/server setting implemented by sockets.",
        "Sockets enable a clearly distinct interface to the language model components.",
