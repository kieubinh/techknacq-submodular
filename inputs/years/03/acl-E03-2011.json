        "The natural language spoken dialogue system AGORA (TID's advanced system of services development) has been developed using a Collaborative Dialogue model with Mixed Initiative and Computational Linguistic models and experiences.",
        "Thanks to these technologies, the system is highly flexible and it doesn't need keywords or directed menus.",
        "In this demo you will see the multilingual ability and the proacti-vity possibilities of the system.",
        "You will also observe a multiservice system and a vocal platform with the last advances in data collection of expert subdialogues."

        "The most important feature of any modern speech-system is the vast amount of information that must manage.",
        "The exponential growth of this amount of information has introduced new complexity to these systems.",
        "We have developed a Customer Communication Speech System, AGORA, based on a natural spoken dialogue with four basic pillars:",
        "■ Proactivity.",
        "■ Recuperation and Management of dialogue mistakes.",
        "■ Learning Skill to structure and store different kinds of knowledge.",
        "■ Reusing Ability of expert subdialogue modules.",
        "This technology enables people to communicate and obtain information in an intuitive way without the necessity of guided menus that request the user to know keywords or special terminology.",
        "The system is Collaborative with free interaction and not guided.",
        "Users can ask any question to the system, when and how they want to, using their own everyday words and phrases, just as if they were talking to another person.",
        "AGORA it's been used successfully in a wide range of information services in which customers have been able to communicate with a presential or remote machine monitored by this system.",
        "Moreover AGORA has the possibility of incorporating new services since it's a platform of association, composed by a Kernel and an increasing amount of modules or subdialogues.",
        "Another important advantage of AGORA is its infrastructure that facilitates the fast generation of new services and applications.",
        "Therefore, it's not a system that just works for certain services.",
        "In fact, it's been used in a wide range of customer services like information services, Voice Portals, etc.",
        "AGORA is also multilingual and so has the ability to keep dialogues in different languages.",
        "By changing only three configuration files, the system is able to \"speak\" in the selected language.",
        "- AGORA needs to have control (see Figure 2) over multilingual Automatic Speech Recognition and Text-to-Speech engines and Semantic Parsers.",
        "Furthermore, as we allow a dynamic change of language during the progress of a particular dialogue, our architecture must deal with the dynamic activation/deactivation of these resources for a particular language.",
        "- We need to define language-independent dialogue labels to represent the output of the different parsers for different languages in order to produce the same semantic content.",
        "We do that by specifying what kind of specific dialogue label or dialogue functions the user will be allowed to perform.",
        "A dialogue label such as yes-answer would then correspond to a grammar YES-ANSWER for all possible ways of answering yes in this kind of dialogue in one particular language.",
        "Proactivity Module.",
        "The behavior change that the system does according to its proactivity is produced through a prediction made by the combination of the measurement of certain parameters as follow: Evolution Capacity: The capacity that the user has to follow the conversation with a focused objective."

        "According to this, the system will provide suitable help to the user whether he requests it or not.",
        "User preferences: the preferences of the user can be collected when he expresses them spontaneously or by the observation of the previous times he has entered the system (frequent uses).",
        "With this information, the system will be able to inform the user of those actions classified as his favorites, and it will anticipate this way to the requests of the user, although it will always leave him the initiave.",
        "System's Predictions.",
        "To achieve this proactivity, the Interpreters of the Kernel evaluate the knowledge that it's gathered during the conversation and they divide it in two different structures; the Instantaneous Knowledge (kept just during each interaction) and the Permanent Knowledge (kept during the whole conversation or for the most part of it).",
        "These two knowledges inform the rest of the modules about the situation of the conversation and which one is the goal expressed by the user.",
        "Then, the Dialogue Manager evaluates the possible alternatives in order to take finally a decision that is translated in an outgoing phrase."

        "Moreover a user can switch dynamically from one language to another just saying expressions like \"now I prefer to speak in Catalan\".",
        "We will illustrate, therefore, in a real application working on a mobile telephony platform, this multilingual and multiservice environment with Proactivity.",
        "Demonstration of SQUEL Environment: Our Environment Services Generation Tool; \"SQUEL\", for the design and development of a complex SLDS, is based on the basic architecture of AGORA and it has tools and facilities for the Design, Generation, Configuration and Administration of new services.",
        "To take advantage of this capacity it has been created a method for designing new services that monitors the process.",
        "This method is thought to ease the designer's work and make it more comfortable.",
        "SQUEL is used in sequential phases: The Design phase: the general behaviour of the system is thought and defined.",
        "The service is also structured depending on its nature; if it's sequential or distributed, with subdialogues or without them (Figure 1), etc.",
        "The Configuration phase: once the Describer is completed, the system get its semantics concepts from the parser and the Output Phrases get labelled according the different states of the conversation and the acts of dialogue that the system manager need to consider.",
        "Finally, the Module of the Management of Resources (TTS, Recogniser, Player, Record, etc.)",
        "would get configured according to the language employed by the user and the system in their conversation."
