        "Text Summarization (TS) can be decomposed into three phases: analysing the input text to obtain text representation, transforming it into a summary representation, and synthesizing an appropriate output form to generate the summary text.",
        "Much of the early work in summarization has been concerned with detecting relevant elements of text and presenting them in the \"shortest possible form\".",
        "More recently, an increasing attention has been devoted to the adequacy of the resulting texts to a human user.",
        "Well-formedness, cohesion and coherence are currently under inspection, not only because they improve the quality of a summary as a text, but also because they can reduce the final summary by reducing the reading time and cost that is needed to process it.",
        "TS systems that performed best in last DUC contest (DUC, 2002) apply template-driven summarization, by information-extraction procedures in the line of (Schank and Abelson, 1977).",
        "This approach yields very good results in assessing relevance and keeping well-formedness, but it is dependent on a clearly defined representation of the information need to be fulfilled and, in most cases, also on some regularities of the kind of texts to be summarized.",
        "In more generic TS, genre-dependent regularities are not always found, and template-driven analysis cannot capture the variety of texts.",
        "In addition, the information need is usually very fuzzy.",
        "In these circumstances, the most reliable source of information on relevance and coherence properties of a text is the source text itself.",
        "An adequate representation of that text should account not only for relevant elements, but also for the relations holding between them, in the diverse textual levels.",
        "Exploiting the discursive properties of text seems to accomplish both these requirements, since they have language-wide validity can be successfully combined with information at superficial or semantic level.",
        "In this paper, we present an integration of two kinds of discursive information, cohesion and coherence, to obtain an adequate representation of text for the task of TS.",
        "Our starting point is an extractive informative summarization system that exploits the cohesive properties of text by building and ranking lexical chains (see Section 3).",
        "This system is enhanced with discourse coherence information (Section 5.3).",
        "Experiments were carried out on the combination of these two kinds of information, and results were evaluated on a Spanish news agency corpus (Section 5)."

        "Traditionally, two main components have been distinguished in the discursive structure of a text: cohesion and coherence.",
        "As denned by (Halliday and Hasan, 1976), cohesion tries to account for relationships among the elements of a text.",
        "Four broad categories of cohesion are identified: reference, ellipsis, conjunction, and lexical cohesion.",
        "On the other hand, coherence is represented in terms of relations between text segments, such as elaboration, cause or explanation.",
        "(Mani, 2001) argues that an integration of these two kinds of discursive information would yield significant improvements in the task of text summarization.",
        "(Corston-Oliver and Dolan, 1999) showed that eliminating discursive satellites as defined by the Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann and Thompson, 1988), yields an improvement in the task of Information Retrieval.",
        "Precision is improved because only words in discursively relevant text locations are taken into account as indexing terms, while traditional methods treat texts as unstructured bags of words.",
        "Some analogous experiments have been carried out in the area of TS.",
        "(Brunn et al., 2001; Alonso and Fuentes, 2002) claim that the performance of summarizers based on lexical chains can be improved by ignoring possible chain members if they occur in irrelevant locations such as subordinate clauses, and therefore only consider chain candidates in main clauses.",
        "However, syntactical subordination does not always map discursive relevance.",
        "For example, in clauses expressing finality or dominated by a verb of cognition, like Y said that X, the syntactically subordinate clause X is discursively nuclear, while the main clause is less relevant (Verhagen, 2001).",
        "In (Alonso and Fuentes, 2002), we showed that identifying and removing discursively motivated satellites yields an improvement in the task of text summarization.",
        "Nevertheless, we will show that a more adequate representation of the source text can be obtained by ranking chain members in accordance to their position in the discourse structure, instead of simply eliminating them."

        "As can be seen in Figure 1 (left) the text is first segmented, at different granularity levels (paragraph, sentence, clause) depending on the application.",
        "To detect chain candidates, the text is morphologically analysed, and the lemma and POS of each word are obtained.",
        "Then, Named Entities are identified and classified in a gazzetteer.",

        "Semantic tagging of common nouns is been performed with is-a relations by attaching Euro Word-Net (Vossen, 1998) synsets to them.",
        "Named Entities are been semantically tagged with instance relations by a set of trigger words, like former president, queen, etc., associated to each of them in a gazzetteer.",
        "Semantic relations between common nouns and Named Entities can be established via the EWN synset of the trigger words associated to a each entity.",
        "Chain candidates are common nouns, Named Entities, definite noun phrases and pronouns, with no word sense disambiguation.",
        "For each chain candidate, three kinds of relations are considered, as defined by (Barzilay, 1997):",
        "• Extra-strong between repetitions of a word.",
        "• Strong between two words connected by a direct EuroWordNet relation.",
        "• Medium-strong if the path length between the EuroWordNet synsets of the words is longer than one.",
        "Being based on general resources and principles, the system is highly parametrisable.",
        "It has a relative independence because it may obtain summaries for texts in any language for which there is a version of WordNet an tools for POS tagging and Named Entity recognition and classification.",
        "It can also be parametrised for obtaining summaries of various lengths and at granularity levels.",
        "As for relevance assessment, some constraints can be set on chain building, like determining the maximum distance between WN synsets of chain candidates for building medium-strong chains, or the type of chain merging when using gazetteer information.",
        "Once lexical chains are built, they are scored according to a number of heuristics that consider characteristics such as their length, the kind of relation between their words and the point of text where they start.",
        "Textual Units (TUs) are ranked according to the number and type of chains crossing them, and the TUs which are ranked highest are extracted as a summary.",
        "This ranking of TUs can be parametrised so that a TU can be assigned a different relative scoring if it is crossed by a strong chain, by a Named Entity Chain or by a co-reference chain.",
        "For a better adaptation to textual genres, heuristics schemata can be applied.",
        "However, linguistic structure is not taken into account for scoring the relevance lexical chains or TUs, since the relevance of chain elements is calculated irrespective of other discourse information.",
        "Consequently, the strength of lexical chains is exclusively based on lexic.",
        "This partial representation can be even misleading to discover the relevant elements of a text.",
        "For example, a Named Entity that is nominally conveying a piece of news in a document can present a very tight pattern of occurrence, without being actually relevant to the aim of the text.",
        "The same applies to other linguistic structures, such as recurring parallelisms, examples or adjuncts.",
        "Nevertheless, the relative relevance of these elements is usually marked structurally, either by sentential or discursive syntax."

        "The information stored in this DM lexicon was used for identifying inter and intra-sentential discourse segments (Alonso and Castellon, 2001) and the discursive relations holding between them.",
        "Discourse segments were taken as Textual Units by the Lexical Chain summarizer, thus allowing a finer granularity level than sentences.",
        "Two combinations of DM descriptive features were used, in order to account for the interaction of different structural information with the lexical information of lexical chains.",
        "On the one hand, nucleus-satellite relations were identified by the combination of matter and structure dimensions of DMs.",
        "This rhetorical information yielded a hierarchical structure of text, so that satellites are subordinate to nucleus and they are accordingly considered less relevant.",
        "On the other hand, the argumentative line of text was traced via the argumentation and also structure DM dimensions, so that segments were tagged with their contribution to the progression of the argumentation.",
        "These two kinds of structural analyses are complementary.",

        "A number of experiments were carried out in order to test whether taking into account the structural status of the textual unit where a chain member occurs can improve the relevance assessment of lexical chains (see Figure 2).",
        "Since the DM lexicon and the evaluation corpus were available only for Spanish, the experiments were limited to that language.",
        "Linguistic preprocessing was performed with the CLiC-TALP system (Carmona et al., 1998; Arevalo et al., 2002).",
        "For the evaluation of the different experiments, the evaluation software MEADeval (MEA, 2002) was used, to compare the obtained summaries with a golden standard (see Section 5.1).",
        "From this package, the usual precision and recall measures were selected, as well as the simple cosine.",
        "Simple cosine (simply cosine from now on) was chosen because it provides a measure of similarity between the golden standard and the obtained extracts, overcoming the limitations of measures depending on concrete textual units.",
        "The corpus used for evaluation was created within Hermes project, to evaluate automatic summariz",
        "To avoid the variability of human generated abstracts, human summarizers built an extract-based golden standard.",
        "Paragraphs were chosen as the basic textual unit because they are self-contained meaning units.",
        "In most of the cases, paragraphs contained a single sentence.",
        "Every paragraph in a story was ranked from 0 to 2, according to its relevance.",
        "31 human judges summarized the corpus, so that at least 5 different evaluations were obtained for each story.",
        "Golden standards were obtained coming as close as possible to the 10% of the length of the original text (19% compression average).",
        "The two main shortcomings of this corpus are its small size and the fact that it belongs to the journalistic genre.",
        "However, we know of no other corpus for summary evaluation in Spanish.",
        "The performance of the Lexical Chain System with no discourse structural information was taken as the base to improve.",
        "(Fuentes and Rodriguez, 2002) report on a number of experiments to evaluate the effect of different parameters on the results of lexical chains.",
        "To keep comparability with the golden standard, and to adequately calculate precision and recall measures, paragraph-sized TUs were extracted at 10% compression rate.",
        "Some parameters were left unaltered for the whole of the experiment set: only strong or extra strong chains were built, no information from defined noun phrases or trigger words could be used and only short co-reference chains were built.",
        "Results are presented in Table 1.",
        "The first column in the table shows the main parameters governing each trial: simple lexical chains, lexical chains successively augmented with proper noun and co-Reference chains, and finally giving special weighting to the 1st TU because of global document structure appliable to the journalistic genre.",
        "Two heuristics schemata were experimented: heuristic 1 ranks as most relevant the first TU crossed by a strong chain, while heuristic 2 ranks highest the TU crossed by the maximum of strong chains.",
        "An evaluation of SweSum (SweSum, 2002), a summarization system available for Spanish, is also provided as a comparison ground.",
        "Trials with SweSum were carried out with the default parameters of the system.",
        "In addition, the first paragraph of every text, the so-called lead summary, was taken as a dummy baseline.",
        "As can be seen in Table 1, the lead achieves the best results, with almost the best possible score.",
        "This is due to the pyramidal organisation of the journalistic genre, that causes most relevant information to be placed at the beginning of the text.",
        "Consequently, any heuristic assigning more relevance to the beginning of the text will achieve better results in this kind of genre.",
        "This is the case for the default parameters of SweSum and heuristic 1.",
        "However, it must be noted that lexical chain summarizer produces results with high cosine and low precision, while SweSum yields high precision and low cosine.",
        "This means that, while the textual units extracted by the summarizer are not identical to the ones in the golden standard, their content is not dissimilar.",
        "This seems to indicate that the summarizer successfully captures content-based relevance, which is genre-independent.",
        "Consequently, the lexical chain summarizer should be able to capture relevance when applied to non-journalistic texts.",
        "This seems to be supported by the fact that heuristic 2 improves cosine over precision four points higher than heuristic 1, which seems more genre-dependent.",
        "Unexpectedly, co-reference chains cause a decrease in the performance of the system.",
        "This may be due to their limited length, and also to the fact that both full forms and pronouns are given the same score, which does not capture the difference in relevance signalled by the difference in form.",
        "Structural discursive information was integrated with only those parameters of the lexical chain summarizer that exploited general discursive information.",
        "Heuristic 1 was not considered because it is too genre-dependent.",
        "No co-reference information was taken into account, since it does not seem to yield any improvement.",
        "The results of integrating lexical chains with discourse structural information can be seen in Table 2.",
        "Following the design sketched in Figure 5, the performance of the lexical chains summarizer was first evaluated on a text where satellites had been removed.",
        "As stated by (Brunn et al., 2001; Alonso and Fuentes, 2002), removing satellites slightly improves the relevance assessment of the lexical chainer (by one point).",
        "Secondly, discourse coherence information was incorporated.",
        "Rhetorical and argumentative informations were distinguished, since the first identifies mainly unimportant parts of text and the second identifies both important and unimportant.",
        "Identifying satellites instead of removing them",
        "When argumentative information is provided, an improvement of .5 in performance is observed in all three metrics in comparison to removing satellites.",
        "As can be expected, ranking the first TU higher results in better measures, because of the nature of the genre.",
        "When this parameter is set, removing satellites outperforms the results obtained by taking into account discourse structural information in precision.",
        "However, this can also be due to the fact that when the text is compressed, TUs are shorter, and a higher number of them can be extracted within the fixed compression rate.",
        "It must be noted, though, that recall does not drop for these summaries.",
        "Lastly, intra-sentential and sentential satellites of the best summary obtained by lexical chains were removed, increasing compression of the resulting summaries from an average 18.84% for lexical chain summaries to a 14.43% for summaries which were sentence-compressed.",
        "Moreover, since sentences were shortened, readability was increased, which can be considered as a further factor of compression.",
        "However, these summaries have not been evaluated with the MEADe-val package because no golden standard was available for textual units smaller than paragraphs.",
        "Precision and recall measures could not be calculated for summaries that removed satellites, because they could not be compared with the golden standard, consisting only full sentences.",
        "The presented evaluation successfully shows the improvements of integrating cohesion and coherence, but it has two weak points.",
        "First, the small size of the corpus and the fact that it represents a single genre, which does not allow for safe generalisations.",
        "Second, the fact that evaluation metrics fall short in assessing the improvements yielded by the combination of these two discursive informations, since they cannot account for quantitative improvements at granularity levels different from the unit used in the golden standard, and therefore a full evaluation of summaries involving sentence compression is precluded.",
        "Moreover, qualitative improvements on general text coherence cannot be captured, nor their impact on summary readability.",
        "As stated by (Goldstein et al., 1999), \"one of the unresolved problems in summarization evaluation is how to penalize extraneous non-useful information contained in a summary\".",
        "We have tried to address this problem by identifying text segments which carry non-useful information, but the presented metrics do not capture this improvement."

        "Moreover, the system presents portability to a variety of languages, as long as it has the knowledge sources required, basically, shallow tools for morpho-syntactical analysis, a version of WordNet for building and ranking lexical chains, and a lexicon of discourse markers for obtaining a certain discourse structure.",
        "Future work concerning the lexical chain summarizer will be focussed in building longer lexical chains, exploiting other relations in EWN, merging chains and even merging heterogeneous information.",
        "Improvements in the analysis of structural discursive information include enhancing the scope to paragraph and global document level, integrating heterogeneous discursive information and proving language-wide validity of Discourse Marker information.",
        "To provide an adequate assessment of the achieved improvements, the evaluation procedure is currently being changed.",
        "Given the enormous cost of building a comprehensive corpus for summary evaluation, the system has been partially adapted to English, so that it can be evaluated with the data and procedures of (DUC, 2002).",
        "Nevertheless, our future efforts will also be directed to gathering a corpus of Spanish texts with abstracts from which to automatically obtain a corpus of extracts with their corresponding texts, as proposed by (Marcu, 1999).",
        "Concerning qualitative evaluation, we will try to apply evaluation metrics that are able to capture content and coherence aspects of summaries, such as more complex content similarity or readability measures."
