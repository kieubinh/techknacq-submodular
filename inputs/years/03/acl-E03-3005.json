        "A particular development that has received much attention in recent work on dialogue modelling is the use of information states to characterise the state of each dialogue participant's information as the conversation proceeds.",
        "The information state approach to dialogue, as developed for instance in the TRINDI project (e.g. (Bohlin et al., 1999; Traum et al., 1999)), assumes that some aspects of dialogue management are best captured in terms of the relevant information that is available to each dialogue participant at each state of the conversation, along with a full account of the possible update mechanisms that change this information.",
        "Unlike classical Artificial Intelligence approaches built on the basis of axiomatic theories of rational agency, information state accounts tend to avoid 'See e.g. (Cohen and Levesque, 1990; Grosz and Sidner, 1990; Sadek, 1991).",
        "the use of logical frameworks and concentrate on dialogue-specific notions such as common ground, discourse obligations and questions under discussion.",
        "In this paper we explore the possibility of using a modal logic paradigm, namely Dynamic Logic (Harel et al., 2000), originally conceived as a formal system to reason about computer programs, to formalise information states and update processes on information states.",
        "In particular, we present a dynamic logic formalisation of Ginzburg's dialogue gameboard (DGB) as introduced in (Ginzburg, 1996; Ginzburg, ms) and (Larsson, 2002).",
        "From a more general point of view, we show that Dynamic Logic is particularly well suited to develop rigorous formal foundations for an approach to dialogue dynamics based on information state updates.",
        "The structure of the paper is as follows: First, we introduce the basic notions of First-Order Dynamic Logic, describing its syntax and semantics.",
        "After briefly characterising the structure of the dialogue gameboard in Section 3, our formalisation is presented in Section 4.",
        "We define the formal language and its semantic interpretation, and discuss how the different components of the dialogue gameboard have been modelled.",
        "In Section 5, we show how the rules of conversational interaction can be expressed within the formalism and explain some examples in detail.",
        "Finally, in Section 6, we present our conclusions and indicate some directions for future research."

        "The formalisation we present in this paper is based on the first-order version of Dynamic Logic (DL) as it is discussed in (Harel et al., 2000) and (Goldblatt, 1992).",
        "In short, DL is a multi-modal logic with a possible worlds semantics, which distinguishes between expressions of two sorts: formulae and programs.",
        "The language of DL is that of first-order logic together with a set of modal operators: for each program a there are a box [ a ] and a diamond < a > operator.",
        "The set of possible worlds (or states) in the model is the set of all possible assignments to the variables in the language.",
        "Atomic programs change the values assigned to particular variables.",
        "They can be combined to form complex programs by means of a repertoire of program constructs, such as sequence ; , non-deterministic choice U, iteration * and test Originally, DL was conceived as a formal system to reason about programs, formalising correctness specifications and proving rigorously that those specifications are met by a particular program.",
        "From a more general perspective, however, it can be viewed as a formal system to reason about transformations on states.",
        "In this sense, it is particularly well suited to provide a fine characterisation of the dynamic processes that take place in dialogue as updates on the information states of the dialogue participants.",
        "In the remainder of this section, we formally introduce the syntax and the semantics of DL.",
        "The language of first-order DL is built upon First-Order Logic.",
        "It is generated by some first-order vocabulary £ made up of a set of predicate symbols, a set of function symbols, a set of constants and a set of variables.",
        "In addition to the prepositional connectives and the universal and existential quantifier symbols, the language also includes two modal operators [ ] and <>, a set IT of programs a and the program constructs ;, U, * and ?.",

        "Following the pioneering work of philosophers like (Lewis, 1979) and (Stalnaker, 1979), the theory of context developed by Jonathan Ginzburg joins a line of research which, instead of focusing on the intentional attitudes of the dialogue participants, highlights the public and conventional aspects of communication.",
        "Under this perspective, a dialogue can be thought of as a conversational scoreboard that keeps track of the state of the conversation.",
        "The dialogue gameboard (DGB), Ginzburg's particular version of the conversational scoreboard, plays a central role in his theory of context.",
        "It can be seen as the context relative to which conventionalised interaction is assumed to take place.",
        "The DGB provides a structured characterisation of the information which the dialogue participants view as common in terms of three main components: a set of FACTS, which the dialogue participants take as common ground, a partially ordered set of questions under discussion QUD, and the LATEST-MOVE made in the dialogue.",
        "Inspired by the notion of dialogue game (e.g. (Ham-blin, 1970; Carlson, 1983)), Ginzburg assumes that each move made by a dialogue participant determines a restricted set of options for follow-up in the dialogue, constraining what can be said and how.",
        "The framework has been used to provide an account of the kind of context that licenses elliptical responses in dialogue (Ginzburg, 1999; Fernandez and Ginzburg, 2002; Fernandez et al., 2003) and has also been the starting point of implemented dialogue systems such as GoDiS (Cooper et al., 2001) and IBiS (Larsson, 2002)."

        "To model context in dialogue as it is understood in Ginzburg's DGB, we will consider a particular domain of interpretation which includes entities such as agents (the dialogue participants), questions, propositions and dialogue moves.",
        "For the sake of simplicity, in this paper we restrict ourselves to four dialogue move types, namely ask, assert, clarification request and acknowledge.",
        "The main strategy to reason about the effects of conversational interaction on the DGB, will be to represent its main components as variables ranging over different domains.",
        "In what follows, we introduce the details of our formalism.",
        "Let £ be a first-order DL language with equality made up of unary predicate symbols Q, P, G, DP, binary predicate symbols infl(uences) and ans(wers), a ternary predicate symbol Utt, a function symbol whether, constants a. b, ask, ass, cl r and ack, and an infinite set Var of variables x. Var includes a set V\\ = {LMa, LM5, UTT} of special individual variables and a set V2 = {FACTS, QUDa, QUD6, PENDINGa, PENDING;,} of stack variables.",
        "We also introduce a function symbol head to be applied to stack variables.",
        "The set of variable symbols Var also includes symbols i, j which range over the set of dialogue participants, symbols q,q' and p.p ranging over questions and propositions respectively, symbols r. r' ranging over propositions or questions, symbols to, to' ranging over moves, and symbols u, u' ranging over utterances.",
        "Language £ is interpreted over a first-order structure A = {D,I}.",
        "The domain D of A is made up of a set of dialogue participants DPV = {a, b}, a set of questions Qv, a set of propositions Pv, a set of dialogue moves M – {ask, ass, clr, ack}, and an element 1 which is used to interpret the predicate symbol G, i.e. we setT(G) = {1}.",
        "A number of relations are declared over D: infl is interpreted as a binary relation on Qv, ans as a binary relation between Pvand Qv, and Utt as a set of utterances UttP, that will be modelled as triples (i,m,r) of a dialogue participant, a dialogue move and either a proposition or a question.",
        "The function symbol whether is interpreted as a function whether such that for every proposition p, whether(p) £ Qv.",
        "Finally, head is interpreted as a function that maps every string to its first element.",
        "Recall that stack variables range over strings of elements in the domain: Let Q*, P*, Utt* denote the set of all finite-length strings over Qv', Pv and Utt, respectively.",
        "This will be used later on to model the stack variables in V2.",
        "As mention earlier, in DL, transitions between states are changes in variable assignment.",
        "We therefore represent the dynamic aspects of the information state as variables ranging over different domains.",
        "In particular, we use the variable names FACTS, QUD and LM to represent the three different components of the DGB.",
        "We also include two additional variables UTT and PENDING.",
        "New utterances are assigned to UTT and, in case the addressee cannot ground their content, they are also assigned to PENDING.",
        "This allows to distinguish between two kinds of grounding: content grounding (the value of UTT is assigned to LM) and proposition grounding or acceptance (a proposition is incorporated onto FACTS).",
        "To model content grounding we use a unary predicate G and assume that G{x) only holds when the addressee of a particular utterance can ground its content.",
        "That is, according to the formalisation introduced in Section 4.1, G(x) will be true in all those states where v(x) – 1.",
        "As an abbreviation, we will write G when G(x) and v(x) – 1, and -*G otherwise.",
        "One of the assumptions behind the DGB is that a realistic characterisation of context must allow for asymmetries between the information available to the different dialogue participants at a given point in a conversation.",
        "Thus, although the DGB attempts to represent the publicly accessible information at each state of the dialogue, it does so in terms of the collection of individual information states of the participants.",
        "In the current formalisation, however, only QUD, LM and PENDING are relative to each dialogue participant, while FACTS and UTT are unique.",
        "This is an obvious choice for the case of UTT, which is just used to hold new contributions publicly uttered by any dialogue participant.",
        "In the case of FACTS, however, this is a simplification motivated by the fact that the current formalisation only attempts to model simplified situations where FACTS is assumed to be empty at the initial state, and only propositions that have been commonly agreed on can be integrated into it.",
        "Thus, there is no room for disagreements in this respect, and the set of FACTS is always the same for the two dialogue participants.",
        "We model QUD and PENDING as stacks, in a way that is very much inspired by QUD's actual implementation in the GoDiS dialogue system (Cooper etal.",
        "2001).",
        "Although we think of FACTS as a set, for technical reasons that will become clear below, we also model FACTS as a stack.",
        "On the other hand, UTT and LM range over utterances, i.e. triples (i,m,r), where i is interpreted as the speaker of u, m is the dialogue move performed by u and r represents its content.",
        "Formally: w(FACTS) g P* u(QUDa) g Q* v(QUBb) g Q* i;(PENDINGa) E Utt* u(PENDINGf,) g Utt* t;(LMa) g UttP The reason why FACTS is modelled as a stack variable is that we want to be able to check whether a particular element (i.e. some proposition) is in FACTS, and we want to be able to express this in the object language.",
        "Modelling FACTS as a variable ranging over strings of propositions allows us to use the pop program to check whether a particular element x belongs to FACTS or not: if x is in FACTS and we pop the stack repeatedly, x will show up at some point as the head 'Arguably, there are reasons to postulate some kind of order within the set of facts.",
        "See (Ginzburg, 1997) for an account of the restrictions on which contextually presupposed facts can serve as antecedents for some anaphoric elements.",

        "Our main aim in this section is to show that the formalism outlined previously can be used to express the rules underlying cooperative conversational interaction in terms of update operations on the DGB.",
        "The current formalisation attempts to model three different scenarios: asking and responding to a question, integrating a proposition into the commonly agreed facts, and asking for clarification when the content of an utterance has not been grounded.",
        "In (Fernandez, 2003) these scenarios were modelled in the form of complex DL programs corresponding to conventional protocols.",
        "From an abstract point of view, protocols can be thought of as a way to characterise the range of possible follow-ups in cooperative dialogue or, alternatively, as a representation of the obligations the dialogue participants are socially committed to (see (Traum and Allen, 1994; Kreutel and Matheson, 1999)).",
        "In the present paper, however, we opt for a different strategy: our aim here is to describe the appropriateness conditions for each particular scenario by means of a set of axioms, that is, a set of formulas we postulate to be valid in the model.",
        "The aim of these formulas is to restrict the operations that can be performed on the DGB components.",

        "This situation triggers a request for clarification that should be performed by speaker b.",

        "In the current formalisation, all propositions have to be acknowledged before being introduced into the commonly agreed facts.",
        "Only once an assertion has been acknowledged it is considered to be accepted by the two dialogue participants.",
        "The axioms formalising the integration of a proposition into FACTS are shown in Table 5.",
        "The formulas follow the pattern already described in the previous subsection.",
        "In this case, the antecedent of the first formula describes a situation where an utterance u performing an ack dialogue move is both the value of LMa and LM5, the head's value of QUDa and QUD5 is whether(p), where p is a proposition, andp is not in FACTS.",
        "This is the situation that licenses the integration of a proposition into the common ground.",

        "The consequent of the formula expresses what the appropriate responses are in this situation.",
        "This is achieved by means of a diamond formula which guarantees that there is a state reachable by assigning some utterance (i, to, r) to UTT, and a box formula which ensures that the utterance assigned to UTT will only be either an answer to the question under discussion or a question which influences it.",
        "Once a question under discussion has been answered, it can be popped from QUD.",

        "Although the aims of DPL, mostly restricted to anaphorical relations across sentence boundaries, are rather different from ours, its guiding idea (i.e. that the meaning of a natural language sentence does not lie in its truth conditions, but rather in its potential to change context) is in line with the perspective taken in this paper.",

        "In this respect, a formalisation along the same lines as the one outlined in the present paper has been used in (Fernandez, 2003) to characterise the internal structure of Inquiry-Oriented Dialogues.",
        "There are many issues that remain still open, perhaps the most straightforward being how to use the current formalisation for instance to prove desirable properties of particular dialogue systems.",
