        "This article addresses the issue of determining the most accessible quantifier scope reading for a sentence.",
        "Quantifiers are elements of natural and logical languages (such as each, no, and some in English and ∀ and ∃ in predicate calculus) that have certain semantic properties.",
        "Loosely speaking, they express that a proposition holds for some proportion of a set of individuals.",
        "One peculiarity of these expressions is that there can be semantic differences that depend on the order in which the quantifiers are interpreted.",
        "These are known as scope differences.",
        "(1) Everyone likes two songs on this album.",
        "As an example of the sort of interpretive differences we are talking about, consider the sentence in (1).",
        "There are two readings of this sentence; which reading is meant depends on which of the two quantified expressions everyone and two songs on this album takes wide scope.",
        "The first reading, in which everyone takes wide scope, simply implies that every person has a certain preference, not necessarily related to anyone else’s.",
        "This reading can be paraphrased as “Pick any person, and that person will like two songs on this album.” The second reading, in which everyone takes narrow scope, implies that there are two specific songs on the album of which everyone is fond, say, “Blue Moon” and “My Way.” In theoretical linguistics, attention has been primarily focused on the issue of scope generation.",
        "Researchers applying the techniques of quantifier raising and Cooper storage have been concerned mainly with enumerating all of the scope readings for a",
        "sentence that are possible, without regard to their relative likelihood or naturalness.",
        "Recently, however, linguists such as Kuno, Takami, and Wu (1999) have begun to turn their attention to scope prediction, or determining the relative accessibility of different scope readings.",
        "In computational linguistics, more attention has been paid to the factors that determine scope preferences.",
        "Systems such as the SRI Core Language Engine (Moran 1988; Moran and Pereira 1992), LUNAR (Woods 1986), and TEAM (Martin, Appelt, and Pereira 1986) have employed scope critics that use heuristics to decide between alternative scopings.",
        "However, the rules that these systems use in making quantifier scope decisions are motivated only by the researchers’ intuitions, and no empirical results have been published regarding their accuracy.",
        "In this article, we use the tools of machine learning to construct a data-driven model of quantifier scope preferences.",
        "For theoretical linguistics, this model serves as an illustration that Kuno, Takami, and Wu’s approach can capture some of the clearest generalizations about quantifier scoping.",
        "For computational linguistics, this article provides a baseline result on the task of scope prediction, with which other scope critics can be compared.",
        "In addition, it is the most extensive empirical investigation of which we are aware that collects data of any kind regarding the relative frequency of different quantifier scope readings in English text.1 Section 2 briefly discusses treatments of scoping issues in theoretical linguistics, and Section 3 reviews the computational work that has been done on natural language quantifier scope.",
        "In Section 4 we introduce the models that we use to predict quantifier scoping, as well as the data on which they are trained and tested.",
        "Section 5 combines the scope model of the previous section with a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) model of syntax and addresses the issue of whether these two modules of grammar ought to be combined in serial, with information from the syntax feeding the quantifier scope module, or in parallel, with each module constraining the structures provided by the other."

      "heading": "2. Approaches to Quantifier Scope in Theoretical Linguistics",
      "text": [
        "Most, if not all, linguistic treatments of quantifier scope have closely integrated it with the way in which the syntactic structure of a sentence is built up.",
        "Montague (1973) used a syntactic rule to introduce a quantified expression into a derivation at the point where it was to take scope, whereas generative semantic analyses such as McCawley (1998) represented the scope of quantification at deep structure, transformationally lowering quantifiers into their surface positions during the course of the derivation.",
        "More recent work in the interpretive paradigm takes the opposite approach, extracting quantifiers from their surface positions to their scope positions by means of a quantifier-raising (QR) transformation (May 1985; Aoun and Li 1993; Hornstein 1995).",
        "Another popular technique is to percolate scope information up through the syntactic tree using Cooper storage (Cooper 1983; Hobbs and Shieber 1987; Pollard 1989; Nerbonne 1993; Park 1995; Pollard and Yoo 1998).",
        "The QR approach to dealing with scope in linguistics consists in the claim that there is a covert transformation applying to syntactic structures that moves quantified elements out of the position in which they are found on the surface and raises them to a higher position that reflects their scope.",
        "The various incarnations of the strategy that",
        "Simple illustration of the QR approach to quantifier scope generation.",
        "follows from this claim differ in the precise characterization of this QR transformation, what conditions are placed upon it, and what tree-configurational relationship is required for one operator to take scope over another.",
        "The general idea of QR is represented in Figure 1, a schematic analysis of the reading of the sentence Someone saw everyone in which someone takes wide scope (i.e., ‘there is some person x such that for all persons y, x saw y’).",
        "In the Cooper storage approach, quantifiers are gathered into a store and passed upward through a syntactic tree.",
        "At certain nodes along the way, quantifiers may be retrieved from the store and take scope.",
        "The relative scope of quantifiers is determined by where each quantifier is retrieved from the store, with quantifiers higher in the tree taking wide scope over lower ones.",
        "As with QR, different authors implement this scheme in slightly different ways, but the simplest case is represented in Figure 2, the Cooper storage analog of Figure 1.",
        "These structural approaches, QR and Cooper storage, have in common that they allow syntactic factors to have an effect only on the scope readings that are available for a given sentence.",
        "They are also similar in addressing only the issue of scope generation, or identifying all and only the accessible readings for each sentence.",
        "That is to say, they do not address the issue of the relative salience of these readings.",
        "Kuno, Takami, and Wu (1999, 2001) propose to model the scope of quantified elements with a set of interacting expert systems that basically consists of a weighted vote taken of the various factors that may influence scope readings.",
        "This model is meant to account not only for scope generation, but also for “the relative strengths of the potential scope interpretations of a given sentence” (1999, page 63).",
        "They illustrate the plausibility of this approach in their paper by presenting a number of examples that are accounted for fairly well by the approach even when an unweighted vote of the factors is allowed to be taken.",
        "So, for example, in Kuno, Takami and Wu’s (49b) (1999), repeated here as (2), the correct prediction is made: that the sentence is unambiguous with the first quantified noun phrase (NP) taking wide scope over the second (the reading in which we don’t all have to hate the same people).",
        "Table 1 illustrates how the votes of each of Kuno, Takami, and Wu’s “experts” contribute to this outcome.",
        "Since the expression many of us/you receives more votes, and the numbers for the two competing quantified expressions are quite far apart, the first one is predicted to take wide scope unambiguously.",
        "(2) Many of us/you hate some of them.",
        "Some adherents of the structural approaches also seem to acknowledge the necessity of eventually coming to terms with the factors that play a role in determining scope preferences in language.",
        "Aoun and Li (2000) claim that the lexical scope preferences of quantifiers “are not ruled out under a structural account” (page 140).",
        "It is clear from the surrounding discussion, though, that they intend such lexical requirements to be taken care of in some nonsyntactic component of grammar.",
        "Although Kuno, Takami, and Wu’s dialogue with Aoun and Li in Language has been portrayed by both sides as a debate over the correct way of modeling quantifier scope, they are not really modeling the same things.",
        "Whereas Aoun and Li (1993) provide an account of scope generation, Kuno, Takami, and Wu (1999) intend to model both scope generation and scope prediction.",
        "The model of scope preferences provided in this article is an empirically based refinement of the approach taken by Kuno, Takami, and Wu, but in principle it is consistent with a structural account of scope generation.",
        "Higgins and Sadock Modeling Scope Preferences",
        "3.",
        "Approaches to Quantifier Scope in Computational Linguistics",
        "Many studies, such as Pereira (1990) and Park (1995), have dealt with the issue of scope generation from a computational perspective.",
        "Attempts have also been made in computational work to extend a pure Cooper storage approach to handle scope prediction.",
        "Hobbs and Shieber (1987) discuss the possibility of incorporating some sort of ordering heuristics into the SRI scope generation system, in the hopes of producing a ranked list of possible scope readings, but ultimately are forced to acknowledge that “[t]he modifications turn out to be quite complicated if we wish to order quantifiers according to lexical heuristics, such as having each out-scope some.",
        "Because of the recursive nature of the algorithm, there are limits to the amount of ordering that can be done in this manner” (page 55).",
        "The stepwise nature of these scope mechanisms makes it hard to state the factors that influence the preference for one quantifier to take scope over another.",
        "Those natural language processing (NLP) systems that have managed to provide some sort of account of quantifier scope preferences have done so by using a separate system of heuristics (or scope critics) that apply postsyntactically to determine the most likely scoping.",
        "LUNAR (Woods 1986), TEAM (Martin, Appelt, and Pereira 1986), and the SRI Core Language Engine as described by Moran (1988; Moran and Pereira 1992) all employ scope rules of this sort.",
        "By and large, these rules are of an ad hoc nature, implementing a linguist’s intuitive idea of what factors determine scope possibilities, and no results have been published regarding the accuracy of these methods.",
        "For example, Moran (1988) incorporates rules from other NLP systems and from VanLehn (1978), such as a preference for a logically weaker interpretation, the tendency for each to take wide scope, and a ban on raising a quantifier across multiple major clause boundaries.",
        "The testing of Moran’s system is “limited to checking conformance to the stated rules” (pages 40–41).",
        "In addition, these systems are generally incapable of handling unrestricted text such as that found in the Wall Street Journal corpus in a robust way, because they need to do a full semantic analysis of a sentence in order to make scope predictions.",
        "The statistical basis of the model presented in this article offers increased robustness and the possibility of more serious evaluation on the basis of corpus data."

        "Determining which among multiple quantifiers in a sentence takes wide scope, given a number of different sources of evidence, is an example of what is known in machine learning as a classification task (Mitchell 1996).",
        "There are many types of classifiers that may be applied to this task that both are more sophisticated than the approach suggested by Kuno, Takami, and Wu and have a more solid probabilistic foundation.",
        "These include the naive Bayes classifier (Manning and Sch¨utze 1999; Jurafsky and Martin 2000), maximum-entropy models (Berger, Della Pietra, and Della Pietra 1996; Ratnaparkhi 1997), and the single-layer perceptron (Bishop 1995).",
        "We employ these classifier models here primarily because of their straightforward probabilistic interpretation and their similarity to the scope model of Kuno, Takami, and Wu (since they each could be said to implement a kind of weighted voting of factors).",

        "Figure 3 shows an example of a training sentence with the scope reading indicated.",
        "The quantifier lower in the tree bears the tag “Q1,” and the higher quantifier bears the tag “Q2,” so this sentence is interpreted such that the lower quantifier has wide scope.",
        "Reversing the tags would have meant that the higher quantifier takes wide scope, and while if both quantifiers had been marked “Q1,” this would have indicated that there is no scope interaction between them (as when they are logically independent or take scope in different conjuncts of a conjoined phrase).2 The sentences tagged were chosen from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) section of the Penn Treebank to have a certain set of attributes that simplify the task of designing the quantifier scope module of the grammar.",
        "First, in order to simplify the coding process, each sentence has exactly two scope-taking elements of the sort considered for this project.",
        "These include most NPs that begin with a determiner, predeterminer, or quantifier phrase (QP)4 but exclude NPs in which the determiner is a, an, or the.",
        "Ex2 This “no interaction” class is a sort of “elsewhere” category that results from phrasing the classification question as “Which quantifier takes wider scope in the preferred reading?” Where there is no scope interaction, the answer is “neither.” This includes cases in which the relative scope of operators does not correspond to a difference in meaning, as in One woman bought one horse, or when they take scope in different propositional domains, such as in Mary bought two horses and sold three sheep.",
        "The human coders used in this study were instructed to choose class 0 whenever there was not a clear preference for one of the two scope readings.",
        "3 This restriction that each sentence contain only two quantified elements does not actually exclude many sentences from consideration.",
        "We identified only 61 sentences with three quantifiers of the sort we consider and 12 sentences with four.",
        "In addition, our review of these sentences revealed that many of them simply involve lists in which the quantifiers do not interact in terms of scope (as in, for example, “We ask that you turn off all cell phones, extinguish all cigarettes, and open any candy before the performance begins”).",
        "Thus, the class of sentences with more than two quantifiers is small and seems to involve even simpler quantifier interactions than those found in our corpus.",
        "Higgins and Sadock Modeling Scope Preferences",
        "Tagged Wall Street Journal text from the Penn Treebank.",
        "The lower quantifier takes wide scope, indicated by its tag “Q1.” cluding these determiners from consideration largely avoids the problem of generics and the complexities of assigning scope readings to definite descriptions.",
        "In addition, only sentences that had the root node S were considered.",
        "This serves to exclude sentence fragments and interrogative sentence types.",
        "Our data set therefore differs systematically from the full WSJ corpus, but we believe it is sufficient to allow many generalizations about English quantification to be induced.",
        "Given these restrictions on the input data, the task of the scope classifier is a choice among three alternatives:5 (Class 0) There is no scopal interaction.",

        "(Class 2) The second quantifier takes wide scope.",

        "The category QP is particularly unintuitive in that it does not correspond to a quantified noun phrase, but to a measure expression, such as more than half.",
        "5 Some linguists may find it strange that we have chosen to treat the choice of preferred scoping for two quantified elements as a tripartite decision, since the possibility of independence is seldom treated in the linguistic literature.",
        "As we are dealing with corpus data in this experiment, we cannot afford to ignore this possibility.",
        " The result is a set of 893 sentences,6 annotated with Penn Treebank II parse trees and hand-tagged for the primary scope reading.",
        "To assess the reliability of the hand-tagged data used in this project, the data were coded a second time by an independent coder, in addition to the reference coding.",
        "The independent codings agreed with the reference coding on 76.3% of sentences.",
        "The kappa statistic (Cohen 1960) for agreement was .52, with a 95% confidence interval between .40 and .64.",
        "Krippendorff (1980) has been widely cited as advocating the view that kappa values greater than .8 should be taken as indicating good reliability, with values between .67 and .8 indicating tentative reliability, but we are satisfied with the level of intercoder agreement on this task.",
        "As Carletta (1996) notes, many tasks in computational linguistics are simply more difficult than the content analysis classifications addressed by Krippendorff, and according to Fleiss (1981), kappa values between .4 and .75 indicate fair to good agreement anyhow.",
        "Discussion between the coders revealed that there was no single cause for their differences in judgments when such differences existed.",
        "Many cases of disagreement stem from different assumptions regarding the lexical quantifiers involved.",
        "For example, the coders sometimes differed on whether a given instance of the word any corresponds to a narrow-scope existential, as we conventionally treat it when it is in the scope of negation, or the “free-choice” version of any.",
        "To take another example, two universal quantifiers are independent in predicate calculus (∀x∀y[φ] ⇐⇒ ∀y∀x[φ]), but in creating our scope-tagged corpus, it was often difficult to decide whether two universal-like English quantifiers (such as each, any, every, and all) were actually independent in a given sentence.",
        "Some differences in coding stemmed from coder disagreements about whether a quantifier within a fixed expression (e.g., all the hoopla) truly interacts with other operators in the sentence.",
        "Of course, another major factor contributing to intercoder variation is the fact that our data sentences, taken from Wall Street Journal text, are sometimes quite long and complex in structure, involving multiple scope-taking operators in addition to the quantified NPs.",
        "In such cases, the coders sometimes had difficulty clearly distinguishing the readings in question.",
        "Because of the relatively small amount of data we had, we used the technique of tenfold cross-validation in evaluating our classifiers, in each case choosing 89 of the 893 total data sentences from the data as a test set and training on the remaining 804.",
        "We preprocessed the data in order to extract the information from each sentence that we would be treating as relevant to the prediction of quantifier scoping in this project.",
        "(Although the initial coding of the preferred scope reading for each sentence was done manually, this preprocessing of the data was done automatically.)",
        "At the end of this preprocessing, each sentence was represented as a record containing the following information (see the Appendix for a list of annotation codes for Penn Treebank):",
        "• the syntactic category, according to Penn Treebank conventions, of the first quantifier (e.g., DT for each, NN for everyone, or QP for more than half) • the first quantifier as a lexical item (e.g., each or everyone).",
        "For a QP consisting of multiple words, this field contains the head word, or “CD” in case the head is a cardinal number.",
        "• the syntactic category of the second quantifier • the second quantifier as a lexical item",
        "Example record corresponding to the sentence shown in Figure 3.",
        "• the syntactic category of the lowest node dominating both quantified NPs (the “join” node) • whether the first quantified NP c-commands the second • whether the second quantified NP c-commands the first • the number of nodes intervening7 between the two quantified NPs • a list of the different categories of nodes that intervene between the quantified NPs (actually, for each nonterminal category, there is a distinct binary feature indicating whether a node of that category intervenes) • whether a conjoined node intervenes between the quantified NPs • a list of the punctuation types that are immediately dominated by nodes intervening between the two NPs (again, for each punctuation tag in the treebank there is a distinct binary feature indicating whether such punctuation intervenes)",
        "Figure 4 illustrates how these features would be used to encode the example in Figure 3.",
        "The items of information included in the record, as listed above, are not the exact factors that Kuno, Takami, and Wu (1999) suggest be taken into consideration in making scope predictions, and they are certainly not sufficient to determine the proper scope reading for all sentences completely.",
        "Surely pragmatic factors and real-world knowledge influence our interpretations as well, although these are not represented here.",
        "This list does, however, provide information that could potentially be useful in predicting the best scope reading for a particular sentence.",

        "The identity of each lexical quantifier clearly should allow our classifiers to make the generalization that each tends to take wide scope, if this word is found in the data, and perhaps even learn the regularity underlying Kuno, Takami, and Wu’s observation that universal quantifiers tend to outscope existentials."

        "As the table shows, the single-layer perceptron has much better classification performance than the naive Bayes classifier and maximum-entropy model, possibly because the training of the network aims to minimize error in the activation of the classification output nodes, which is directly related to the classification task at hand, whereas the other models do not directly make use of the notion of “classification error.” The perceptron also uses a sort of weighted voting and could be interpreted as an implementation of Kuno, Takami, and Wu’s proposal for scope determination.",
        "This clearly illustrates that the tenability of their proposal hinges on the exact details of its implementation, since all of our classifier models are reasonable interpretations of their approach, but they have very different performance results on our scope determination task.",

        "simply more frequent in the training data than the other two classes, the weights for this class tend to be higher.",
        "Therefore, we also list some of the best predictor features for classes 1 and 2 in the table.",
        "The first and third-ranked features in Table 8 show that an intervening comma or colon will make the classifier tend toward class 0, “no scope interaction.” This finding by the classifier is similar to the maximum-entropy classifier’s finding an intervening quotation mark relevant and can be taken as an indication that quantifiers in distant syntactic subdomains are unlikely to interact.",
