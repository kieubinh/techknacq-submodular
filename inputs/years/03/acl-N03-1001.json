        "A major bottleneck in building data-driven speech processing applications is the need to manually transcribe training utterances into words.",
        "The resulting corpus of transcribed word strings is then used to train application-specific language models for speech recognition, and in some cases also to train the natural language components of the application.",
        "Some of these speech processing applications make use of utterance classification, for example when assigning a call destination to naturally spoken user utterances (Gorin et al., 1997; Carpenter and Chu-Carroll, 1998), or as an initial step in converting speech to actions in spoken interfaces (Alshawi and Douglas, 2001).",
        "In this paper we present an approach to utterance classification that avoids the manual effort of transcribing training utterances into word strings.",
        "Instead, only the desired utterance class needs to be associated with each sample utterance.",
        "The method combines automatic training of application-specific phonotactic models together with token sequence classifiers.",
        "The accuracy of this phone-string utterance classification method turns out to be surprisingly close to what can be achieved by conventional methods involving word-trigram language models that require manual transcription.",
        "To quantify this, we present empirical accuracy results from three different call-routing applications comparing our method with conventional utterance classification using word-trigram recognition.",
        "Previous work at AT&T on utterance classification without words used information theoretic metrics to discover “acoustic morphemes” from untranscribed utterances paired with routing destinations (Gorin et al., 1999; Levit et al., 2001; Petrovska-Delacretaz et al., 2000).",
        "However, that approach has so far proved impractical: the major obstacle to practical utility was the low runtime detection rate of acoustic morphemes discovered during training.",
        "This led to a high false rejection rate (between 40% and 50% for 1-best recognition output) when a word-based classification algorithm (the one described by Wright et.",
        "al (1997)) was applied to the detected sequence of acoustic morphemes.",
        "More generally, previous work using phone string (or phone-lattice) recognition has concentrated on tasks involving retrieval of audio or video (Jones et al., 1996; Foote et al., 1997; Ng and Zue, 1998; Choi et al., 1999).",
        "In those tasks, performance of phone-based systems was not comparable to the accuracy obtainable from word-based systems, but rather the rationale was avoiding the difficulty of building wide coverage statistical language models for handling the wide range of subject matter that a typical retrieval system, such as a system for retrieving news clips, needs to cover.",
        "In the work presented here, the task is somewhat different: the system can automatically learn to identify and act on relatively short phone subsequences that are specific to the speech in a limited domain of discourse, resulting in task accuracy that is comparable to word-based methods.",
        "In section 2 we describe the utterance classification method.",
        "Section 3 describes the experimental setup and the data sets used in the experiments.",
        "Section 4 presents the main comparison of the performance of the method against a “conventional” approach using manual transcription and word-based models.",
        "Section 5 gives some concluding remarks."

      "text": [
        "The runtime operation of our utterance classification method is simple.",
        "It involves applying two models (which are trained as described in the next subsection): A statistical n-gram phonotactic model and a phone string classification model.",
        "At runtime, the phonotactic model is used by an automatic speech recognition system to convert a new input utterance into a phone string which is mapped to an output class by applying the classification model.",
        "(We will often refer to an output class as an “action”, for example transfer to a specific call-routing destination).",
        "The configuration at runtime is as shown in Figure 1.",
        "More details about the specific recognizer and classifier components used in our experiments are given in the Section 3.",
        "The classifier can optionally make use of more information about the context of an utterance to improve the accuracy of mapping to actions.",
        "As noted in Figure 1, in the experiments presented here, we use a single additional feature as a proxy for the utterance context, specifically, the identity of the spoken prompt that elicited the utterance.",
        "It should be noted, however, that inclusion of such additional information is not central to the method: Whether, and how much, context information to include to improve classification accuracy will depend on the application.",
        "Other candidate aspects of context may include the dialog state, the day of week, the role of the speaker, and so on."

      "heading": "2.2 Training Procedure",
      "text": [
        "Training is divided into two phases.",
        "First, train a phone n-gram model using only the training utterance speech files and a domain-independent acoustic model.",
        "Second, train a classification model mapping phone strings and prompts (the classifier inputs) to actions (the classifier outputs).",
        "The recognition training phase is an iterative procedure in which a phone n-gram model is refined successively: The phone strings resulting from the current pass over the speech files are used to construct the phone n-gram model for the next iteration.",
        "In other words, this is a “Viterbi re-estimation” or “1-best re-estimation” process.",
        "We currently only re-estimate the n-gram model, so the same general-purpose HMM acoustic model is used for ASR decoding in all iterations.",
        "Other more expensive n-gram re-estimation methods can be used instead, including ones in which successive n-gram models are re-estimated from n-best or lattice ASR output.",
        "Candidates for the initial model used in this procedure are an unweighted phone loop or a general purpose phonotactic model for the language being recognized.",
        "The steps of the training process are as follows.",
        "(The procedure is depicted in Figure 2.)",
        "1.",
        "Set the phone string model G to an initial phone string model.",
        "Initialize the n-gram order N to 1.",
        "(Here ‘order’ means the size of the n-grams, so for example 2 means bi-grams.)",
        "2.",
        "Set S to the set of phone strings resulting from recognizing the training speech files with G (after possibly adjusting the insertion penalty, as explained below).",
        "3.",
        "Estimate an n-gram model G' of order N from the set of strings S. 4.",
        "IfN<Nma.,,set N<--N+1and G<--G'and go to step 2, otherwise continue with step 5.",
        "5.",
        "For each recognized string s E S, construct a classifier input pair (s, r) where r is the prompt that elicited the utterance recognized as s. 6.",
        "Train a classification model M to generalize the training function f : (s, r) – > a, where a is the action associated with the utterance recognized as s. 7.",
        "Return the classifier model M and the final n-gram model G' as the results of the training procedure.",
        "Instead of increasing the order N of the phone n-gram model during re-estimation, an alternative would be to iterate Nma., times with a fixed n-gram order, possibly with successively increased weight being given to the language model vs. the acoustic model in ASR decoding.",
        "One issue that arises in the context of unsupervised recognition without transcription is how to adjust recognition parameters that affect the length of recognized strings.",
        "In conventional training of recognizers from word transcriptions, a “word insertion penalty” is typically tuned after comparing recognizer output against transcriptions.",
        "To address this issue, we estimate the expected speaking rate (in phones per second) for the relevant type of speech (human-computer interaction in these experiments).",
        "The token insertion penalty of the recognizer is then adjusted so that the speaking rate for automatically detected speech in a small sample of training data approximates the expected speaking rate."
