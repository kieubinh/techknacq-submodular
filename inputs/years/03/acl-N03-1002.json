        "Named Entity (NE) extraction is an important subtask of document processing such as information extraction and question answering.",

        "However, there are some cases where segmentation granularity contradicts the results of morphological analysis and the building units of NEs, so that extraction of some NEs are inherently impossible in this setting.",
        "To cope with the unit problem, we propose a character-based chunking method.",
        "Firstly, the input sentence is analyzed redundantly by a statistical morphological analyzer to produce multiple (n-best) answers.",
        "Then, each character is annotated with its character types and its possible POS tags of the top n-best answers.",
        "Finally, a support vector machine-based chunker picks up some portions of the input sentence as NEs.",

        "A common standard data set for Japanese NE extraction is provided by IREX workshop (IREX Committee, editor, 1999).",
        "Generally, Japanese NE extraction is done in the following steps: Firstly, a Japanese text is segmented into words and is annotated with POS tags by a morphological analyzer.",
        "Then, a chunker brings together the words into NE chunks based on contextual information.",
        "However, such a straightforward method cannot extract NEs whose segmentation boundary contradicts that of morphological analysis outputs.",
        "For example, a sentence “ ” is segmented as “",
        "and first names) as a person name and “ ” (“September”) as a date will be extracted by combining word units.",
        "On the other hand, “ ” (abbreviation of North Korea) cannot be extracted as a name of location because it is contained by the word unit “ ”(visiting North Korea).",
        "Figure 1 illustrates the example with English translation.",
        "Some previous works try to cope with the word unit problem: Uchimoto (Uchimoto et al., 2000) introduces transformation rules to modify the word units given by a morphological analyzer.",
        "Isozaki (Isozaki and Kazawa, 2002) controls the parameters of a statistical morphological analyzer so as to produce more fine-grained output.",
        "These method are used as a preprocessing of chunking.",
        "By contrast, we propose more straightforward method in which we perform the chunking process based on character units.",
        "Each character receives annotations with character type and multiple POS information of the words found by a morphological analyzer.",
        "We make use of redundant outputs of the morphological analysis as the base features for the chunker to introduce more information-rich features.",
