        "Traditional question answering (QA) systems typically employ a pipeline approach, consisting roughly of question analysis, document/passage retrieval, and answer selection (see e.g., (Prager et al., 2000; Moldovan et al., 2000; Hovy et al., 2001; Clarke et al., 2001)).",
        "Although a typical QA system classifies questions based on expected answer types, it adopts the same strategy for locating potential answers from the same corpus regardless of the question classification.",
        "In our own earlier work, we developed a specialized mechanism called Virtual Annotation for handling definition questions (e.g., “Who was Galileo?” and “What are antibiotics?”) that consults, in addition to the standard reference corpus, a structured knowledge source (WordNet) for answering such questions (Prager et al., 2001).",
        "We have shown that better performance is achieved by applying Virtual Annotation and our general purpose QA strategy in parallel.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the impact of adopting such a multi-strategy and multi-source approach to QA in a more general fashion.",
        "Our approach to question answering is additionally motivated by the success of ensemble methods in machine learning, where multiple classifiers are employed and their results are combined to produce the final output of the ensemble (for an overview, see (Dietterich, 1997)).",
        "Such ensemble methods have recently been adopted in question answering (Chu-Carroll et al., 2003b; Burger et al., 2003).",
        "In our question answering system, PIQUANT, we utilize in parallel multiple answering agents that adopt different processing strategies and consult different knowledge sources in identifying answers to given questions, and we employ resolution mechanisms to combine the results produced by the individual answering agents.",
        "We call our approach multi-strategy since we combine the results from a number of independent agents implementing different answer finding strategies.",
        "We also call it multi-source since the different agents can search for answers in multiple knowledge sources.",
        "In this paper, we focus on two answering agents that adopt fundamentally different strategies: one agent uses predominantly knowledge-based mechanisms, whereas the other agent is based on statistical methods.",
        "Our multilevel resolution algorithm enables combination of results from each answering agent at the question, passage, and/or answer levels.",
        "Our experiments show that in most cases our multilevel resolution algorithm outperforms its components, supporting a tightly-coupled design for multi-agent QA systems.",
        "Experimental results show significant performance improvement over our single-strategy, single-source baselines, with the best performing multilevel resolution algorithm achieving a 35.0% relative improvement in the number of correct answers and a 32.8% improvement in average precision, on a previously unseen test set."

        "In order to enable a multi-source and multi-strategy approach to question answering, we developed a modular and extensible QA architecture as shown in Figure 1 (Chu-Carroll et al., 2003a; Chu-Carroll et al., 2003b).",
        "With a consistent interface defined for each component, this architecture allows for easy plug-and-play of individual components for experimental purposes.",
        "In our architecture, a question is first processed by the question analysis component.",
        "The analysis results are represented as a QFrame, which minimally includes a set of question features that help activate one or more answering agents.",
        "Each answering agent takes the QFrame and generates its own set of requests to a variety of knowledge sources.",
        "This may include performing search against a text corpus and extracting answers from the resulting passages, or performing a query against a structured knowledge source, such as WordNet (Miller, 1995) or Cyc (Lenat, 1995).",
        "The (intermediate) results from the individual answering agents are then passed on to the answer resolution component, which combines and resolves the set of results, and either produces the system’s final answers or feeds the intermediate results back to the answering agents for further processing.",
        "We have developed multiple answering agents, some general purpose and others tailored for specific question types.",
        "Figure 1 shows the answering agents currently available in PIQUANT.",

        "In this paper, we introduced a multi-strategy and multi-source approach to question answering that enables combination of answering agents adopting different strategies and consulting multiple knowledge sources.",
        "In particular, we focused on two answering agents, one adopting a knowledge-based approach and one using statistical methods.",
        "We discussed our answer resolution component which employs a multilevel combination algorithm that allows for resolution at the question, passage, and answer levels.",
        "Best performance using the % correct metric was achieved by the three-level algorithm that combines after each stage, while highest average precision was obtained by a two-level algorithm merging at the question and answer levels, supporting a tightly-coupled design for multi-agent question answering.",
        "Our experiments showed that our best performing algorithms achieved a 35.0% relative improvement in the number of correct answers and a 32.8% improvement in average precision on a previously unseen test set."
