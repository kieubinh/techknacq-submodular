        "Spoken dialogue systems are emerging as an effective means for humans to access information spaces through natural spoken interaction with computers.",
        "These systems are usually implemented in such a way that their knowledge space is static, or is only augmented through human intervention from the system developers.",
        "A significant enhancement to the usability of such systems would be the ability to automatically acquire new knowledge through spoken interaction with its end users.",
        "Such knowledge would include both the spelling and pronunciation of a new word, as well as an understanding of its usage in the language (e.g., a semantic category).",
        "However, this is a difficult task to carry out effectively, challenging both with regard to the automatic acquisition of the sound-to-letter mapping from typically telephone-quality speech, and the system level aspect of integrating the usually off-line activities of system upgrade while seamlessly continuing the conversation with the user.",
        "The research reported here is concerned with the acquisition of the user’s name, which is entered via a “speak and spell” mode, spoken sequentially for the first and last names respectively.",
        "It is our belief that this would be the most natural way for the user to enter the information, and therefore research has been focused on designing a framework to support that model.",
        "Acquiring names is particularly difficult, not only because English is known to have highly irregular letter-to-sound rules, but also because American names come from a diverse collection of language groups.",
        "With the speak and spell entry mode, there are additional issues of locating the boundary between the spoken and spelled portions of the utterance, and of formulating a joint solution.",
        "The framework for acquiring new names is applied to an enrollment phase of an existing spoken dialogue system, the ORION task delegation system (Seneff et al., 2000).",
        "ORION allows users to specify tasks to be completed off-line, and to later be delivered to the user at a designated time, via either telephone or email.",
        "To enter the enrollment phase, the user calls the ORION system and responds to the prompt by saying, “new user,” which causes the system to enter a system-initiated subdialogue soliciting a number of facts to be entered into a form that will represent the system’s future knowledge of this individual.",
        "The system solicits the user’s full name, a password for security measures, their work, home, and cell phone numbers, and their email address, finally asking for the current time in order to establish the user’s reference time zone.",
        "After all of the information has been entered, the system confirms its proposed spellings for the names, and, if verified by the user, automatically launches a system update that enters this new information into both the speech recognition component and the natural language (NL) grammar.",
        "Thus, the next time the user calls the system, they will be able to log on by speaking their name and password.",
        "If the user rejects the proposed spelling, the system solicits further input from them, in the form of a telephone keypad entry of the spelling of the misrecog-nized name.",
        "This information is then incorporated into the search to propose a final hypothesis.",
        "Central to our methodology is the application of ANGIE (Seneff et al., 1996), a hierarchical framework capturing subword structure information, employed here to predict phoneme-grapheme mappings.",
        "In ANGIE, corpus-based statistical methods are combined with explicit linguistic information to generalize from the observation space to unseen words.",
        "Our approach extends work reported earlier (Chung and Seneff, 2002), in which spelling and pronunciation of unknown names are extracted from spoken input with the additional constraint of telephone keypad input.",
        "This work distinguishes itself in that, instead of requiring telephone keypad entries, a user is asked to speak and spell their name within a single utterance.",
        "The novelty lies in the use of a multi-stage recognizer, where the first stage proposes a letter graph derived from the spelled portion of the waveform.",
        "A second recognition pass searches the pronounced name part of the waveform; this final search is constrained by a phoneme space derived from the letter graph via ANGIE letter-to-sound mappings.",
        "In the following, previous related work is outlined in Section 2.",
        "Sections 3 details the technology of sound-to-letter acquisition, and the techniques used to implement a recognition engine to serve our unique needs.",
        "Section 4 is primarily concerned with the engineering aspects for the real time implementation.",
        "Section 5 describes some evaluation results.",

        "Deletions occur when part of the spelled portion is mistakenly identified as part of the unknown word or insertions arise when the end of a spoken word is confused for a spelled letter.",
        "However, the multi-stage system produces a marked improvement if we compare it with the single-stage letter recognizer as a baseline.",
        "WER improves by 36.4% (from 40.4% to 25.7%) for Test Set A, and 17.0% (from 58.9% to 48.9%) for Test Set B.",
        "The improvement is more pronounced for Test Set A because the words have been observed in the ANGIE training data.",
        "The most commonly confusable letter pairs are: M/N, A/E, J/G, Y/I, L/O, D/T.",
        "These letters are confusable both acoustically in the spelled letters as well as in the pronunciation of the spoken word.",
        "When the subword trigram is removed from the language model in the later stages, further WER improvements result in Test Set B (46.1%), although performance in Test Set A deteriorates.",
        "We infer that unknown words benefit more with a less constrained language model, and when more weighting is given to the ANGIE model for",
        "generating possible spelling alternatives.",
        "To evaluate the phoneme extraction accuracy, the best letter hypothesis of the multi-stage system is used to compute the phonemes, as described in Section 3.2.4.",
        "In the actual ORION system, when a user confirms the correct spelling of their name, if the name exists in the training pronunciation lexicon, the phoneme extraction stage may be redundant.",
        "This assumes the pronunciation lexicon itself is reliable, and contains all the correct alternate pronunciations of the word.",
        "For the purpose of evaluation, we examine the phoneme outputs of both in-vocabulary Test Set A, and OOV Test Set B, whose phonemic baseforms have been hand-transcribed.",
        "Within ANGIE, phonemes are marked for lexical stress and syllable onset positions.",
        "There are also many special compound phonemic units (e.g., /sp, sk, st/).",
        "A much smaller phoneme set of 50 units is derived for evaluation, by applying rules to collapse the phoneme hypotheses.",
        "The phoneme error rate (PER) for Test Set A and B are depicted in Table 3.",
        "Error rates are provided for the subsets of words where the letter hypotheses are either correct or incorrect.",
        "Many of the confusable phoneme pairs are vowels: ih/iy, ae/aa, eh/ey.",
        "Other commonly confused phoneme pairs are: m/n, en/n, er/r, l/ow, d/t, s/z, th/dh.",
        "In another experiment, we evaluated the accuracy of the phoneme extraction by using the correct letter sequence as input, instead of the highest scoring letter sequence.",
        "The PER for Test Set A is 7.2% and the PER for Test Set B is 13.3%.",
        "While phoneme error rates are generally higher than letter error rates, it should be noted that the reference baseforms for the names contain only one or two alternate pronunciations for each name.",
        "However, it is not uncommon for a name to have many irregular pronunciation variants, which are not covered in the reference baseforms.",
        "Also the phonemic baseform determined by the recognizer is likely to be one preferred by the system for the particular speaker, assumed to be the owner, of the name.",
        "Therefore, we believe that the baseforms favored by the system may be more appropriate for subsequent recognition, especially if the name is to be spoken by the same speaker.",
        "This may be the case in spite of the mismatch between the favored phonemic baseform and that in the pronunciation dictionary."

        "This paper has described a methodology and implementation for automatically acquiring user names in the ORION task delegation system.",
        "It has been shown that a novel multi-stage recognition procedure can handle an open set of names, given waveforms with the spoken name followed by the spelled letters.",
        "The overall system is also capable of incorporating the new name immediately into its language and lexical models, following the dialogue.",
        "Future work is needed on many parts of the system.",
        "As more data are collected, future experiments will be conducted with larger test sets.",
        "We can improve the letter recognizer by explicitly modeling the transition between the unknown word and the spelling component.",
        "For instance, by adding prosodic features we may be able to improve the detection of the onset of the spelling part.",
        "Our final selection process is based only on the proposed spellings obtained from the pronounced word, after feeding information from the spelled part into the second stage.",
        "However, performance may improve if we apply a strict constraint during the search, explicitly allowing only paths where the spoken and spelled part of the waveforms agree on the name spelling.",
        "Alternatively, a length constraint can be imposed on the letter sequence, once it has been observed that the second stage hypotheses for the spoken and the spelled components are inconsistent in length.",
        "As an unconstrained name recognizer, the system described here handles in the same way both observed data and previously unseen data.",
        "We would like to experiment with adding a parallel component that explicitly models some in-vocabulary words.",
        "This may boost overall accuracy by lexicalizing the most common names, such that only words that are identified as OOV need to be processed by the ANGIE sound-to-letter stage.",
        "In regards to implementation, the current hub-server configuration has allowed us to rapidly implement the system and conduct experiments.",
        "The multi-threaded approach, implemented using the hub scripting language, has been effective in allowing a smooth dialogue to proceed while the multi-stage processing takes place in the background.",
        "However, we anticipate that the multi-stage approach can be improved by folding all three stages into a single recognition server, eventually allowing real-time operation.",
        "In this case, multi-threading would only be needed for the final stage that incorporates the new words into the on-line system.",
        "The long-term objective of this work is to learn the pronunciations and spellings of general OOV data in spoken dialogue systems on domains where OOV proper nouns are prevalent.",
        "Future experiments will involve general classes of unknown words such as names of geographical locations or businesses."
