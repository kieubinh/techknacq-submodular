        "Question Answering Systems aim to determine an answer to a question by searching for a response in a collection of documents (see Voorhees 2002 for an overview of current systems).",
        "In order to achieve this (see for example Harabagiu et al.",
        "2002), systems narrow down the search by using information retrieval techniques to select a subset of documents, or paragraphs within documents, containing keywords from the question and a concept which corresponds to the correct question type (e.g. a question starting with the word “Who?” would require an answer containing a person).",
        "The exact answer sentence is then sought by either attempting to unify the answer semantically with the question, through some kind of logical transformation (e.g. Moldovan and Rus 2001) or by some form of pattern matching (e.g. Soubbotin 2002; Harabagiu et al.",
        "1999).",
        "Often, though, a single question is not enough to meet user’s goals and an elaboration or clarification dialogue is required, i.e. a dialogue with the user which would enable the answering system to refine its understanding of the questioner's needs (for reasons of space we shall not investigate here the difference between elaboration dialogues, clarification dialogues and coherent topical subdialogues and we shall hence refer to this type of dialogue simply as “clarification dialogue”, noting that this may not be entirely satisfactory from a theoretical linguistic point of view).",
        "While a number of researchers have looked at clarification dialogue from a theoretical point of view (e.g. Ginzburg 1998; Ginzburg and Sag 2000; van Beek at al.",
        "1993), or from the point of view of task oriented dialogue within a narrow domain (e.g. Ardissono and Sestero 1996), we are not aware of any work on clarification dialogue for open domain question answering systems such as the ones presented at the TREC workshops, apart from the experiments carried out for the (subsequently abandoned) “context” task in the TREC-10 QA workshop (Voorhees 2002; Harabagiu et al.",
        "2002).",
        "Here we seek to partially address this problem by looking at some particular aspect of clarification dialogues in the context of open domain question answering.",
        "In particular, we examine the problem of recognizing that a clarification dialogue is occurring, i.e. how to recognize that the current question under consideration is part of a previous series (i.e. clarifying previous questions) or the start of a new series; we then show how the recognition that a clarification dialogue is occurring can simplify the problem of answer retrieval."

        "In other words, systems were required to respond correctly to a kind of clarification dialogue in which a full understanding of questions depended on an understanding of previous questions.",
        "In order to test the ability to answer such questions correctly, a total of 42 questions were prepared by NIST staff, divided into 10 series of related question sentences which therefore constituted a type of clarification dialogue; the sentences varied in length between 3 and 8 questions, with an average of 4 questions per dialogue.",
        "These clarification dialogues were however presented to the question answering systems already classified and hence systems did not need to recognize that clarification was actually taking place.",
        "Consequently systems that simply looked for an answer in the subset of documents retrieved for the first question in a series performed well without any understanding of the fact that the questions constituted a coherent series.",
        "In a more realistic approach, systems would not be informed in advance of the start and end of a series of clarification questions and would not be able to use this information to limit the subset of documents in which an answer is to be sought."

        "relevance(s2,s, B) represents the fact that sentence s1 is less relevant than s2 in respect to the sentence s and the context B.",

        "Again this did not misclassify any \"new\" questions.",
        "Method 3a.",
        "This method employed the full algorithm described in section 5 (point 3 is the similarity measure algorithm described in section 6): clarification recognition rose to 91% of the new collection by looking at the similarity between nouns in the current question and nouns in the previous questions, in addition to reference words and the absence of verbs.",
        "Misclassification was a serious problem, however with correctly classified \"new\" questions falling to 67%.",
        "Method 3b.",
        "This was the same as method 3a, but specified a similarity threshold when employing the similarity measure described in section 6: this required the nouns in the current question to be similar to nouns in the previous question beyond a specified similarity threshold.",

        "• False positives: questions following a similar but unrelated question series.",
        "E.g. \"Are they all Muslim countries?\" (talking about religion, but in the context of a general conversation about Saudi Arabia) followed by \"What is the chief religion in Peru?\" (also about religion, but in a totally unrelated context).",
        "• Questions referring to answers, not previous",
        "questions (e.g. clarifying the meaning of a word contained in the answer, or building upon a concept defined in the answer: e.g. \"What did Antonio Carlos Tobim play?\" following \"Which famous musicians did he play with?\" in the context of a series of questions about Fank Sinatra: Antonio Carlos Tobim was referred to in the answer to the previous question, and nowhere else in the exchange.",

        "Absence of verb-noun relationships in WordNet, e.g. between to die and death, between \"battle\" and \"win\" (i.e. after a battle one side generally wins and another side loses), \"airport\" and \"visit\" (i.e. people who are visiting another country use an airport to get there) As can be seen from the tables above, the same experiments conducted on the TREC context questions yielded worse results; it was difficult to say, however, whether this was due to the small size of the TREC data or the nature of the data itself, which perhaps did not fully reflect “real” dialogues.",
        "As regards the recognition of question in a series (the recognition that a clarification I taking place), the number of sentences recognized by keyword alone was smaller in the TREC data (53% compared to 62%), while the number of questions not containing verbs was roughly similar (about 6%).",
        "The improvement given by computing noun similarity between successive questions gave worse results on the TREC data: using method 3a resulted in an improvement to the overall correctness of 19 percentage points, or a 32% increase (compared to an improvement of 25 percentage points, or a 38% increase on the collected data); using method 3b resulted in an improvement of 13 percentage points, or a 22% increase (compared to an improvement of 23 percentage points or a 35% increase on the collected data), perhaps indicating that in \"real\" conversation speakers tend to use simpler semantic relationships than what was observed in the TREC data.",
        "Recognizing that a clarification dialogue is occurring only makes sense if this information can then be used to improve answer retrieval performance.",
        "We therefore hypothesized that noting that a questioner is trying to clarify previously asked questions is important in order to determine the context in which an answer is to be sought: in other words, the answers to certain questions are constrained by the context in which they have been uttered.",

        "The information retrieval engine selects a subset of the available documents based on a number of keywords derived from the question at hand.",
        "In the simplest case, it is necessary to note that some words in the current question refer to words in previous questions or answers and hence use these other words when formulating the IR query.",
        "For example, the question “Is he married?” cannot be used as is in order to select documents, as the only word passed to the IR engine would be “married” (possibly the root version “marry”) which would return too many documents to be of any use.",
        "Noting that the “he” refers to a previously mentioned person (e.g. “Sean Connery”) would enable the answerer to seek an answer in a smaller number of documents.",
        "Moreover, given that the current question is asked in the context of a previous question, the documents retrieved for the previous related question could provide a context in which to initially seek an answer.",
        "In order to verify the usefulness of constraining the set of documents from in which to seek an answer, a subset made of 15 clarification dialogues (about 100 questions) from the given question data was analyzed by taking the initial question for a series, submitting it to the Google Internet Search Engine and then manually checking to see how many of the questions in the series could be answered simply by using the first 20 documents retrieved for the first question in a series.",
        "• 69% of clarification questions could be answered by looking within the documents used for the previous question in the series, thus indicating the usefulness of noting the occurrence of clarification dialogue.",
        "• The remaining 31% could not be answered by",
        "making reference to the previously retrieved documents, and to find an answer a different approach had to be taken.",

        "retrieved by the search engine or other, more complex techniques.",
        "An example is a question such as “Where exactly?” which requires both an understanding of the context in which the question is asked (“Where?” makes no sense on its own) and the previously given answer (which was probably a place, but not restrictive enough for the questioner).",
        "• 4% constituted mini-clarification dialogues within a",
        "larger clarification dialogue (a slight deviation from the main topic which was being investigated by the questioner) and could be answered by looking at the documents retrieved for the first question in the miniseries.",
        "Recognizing that a clarification dialogue is occurring therefore can simplify the task of retrieving an answer by specifying that an answer must be in the set of documents used the previous questions.",
        "This is consistent with the results found in the TREC context task (Voorhees 2002), which indicated that systems were capable of finding most answers to questions in a context dialogue simply by looking at the documents retrieved for the initial question in a series.",
        "As in the case of clarification dialogue recognition, therefore, simple techniques can resolve the majority of cases; nevertheless, a full solution to the problem requires more complex methods.",
        "The last case indicates that it is not enough simply to look at the documents provided by the first question in a series in order to seek an answer: it is necessary to use the documents found for a previously asked question which is related to the current question (i.e. the questioner could \"jump\" between topics).",

        "The major limitation of our algorithm is the fact that it only considers series of questions, not series of answers.",
        "As noted above, it is often necessary to look at an answer to a question to determine whether the current question is a clarification question or not.",
        "Our sentence similarity algorithm was limited by the number of semantic relationships in WordNet: for example, a big improvement would come from the use of noun-verb relationships.",
        "Future work will be directed on extending WordNet in this direction and in providing other useful semantic relationships.",
        "Work also needs to be done on using information given by answers, not just questions in recognizing clarification dialogue and on coping with the cases in which clarification dialogue recognition is not enough to retrieve an answer and where other, more complex, techniques need to be used.",
        "It would also be beneficial to examine the use of a similarity function in which similarity decayed in function of the distance in time between the current question and the past questions."
