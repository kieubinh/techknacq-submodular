        "While a simple one-best hypothesis interface between automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language understanding (NLU) suffices for restricted dialogue systems, more complex systems either operate on n-best lists as ASR) output or convert ASR word graphs (Oerder and Ney, 1993) into n-best lists, given the distribution of acoustic and language model scores (Schwartz and Chow, 1990; Tran et al., 1996).",
        "For example, in our data a user expressed the wish to see a specific city map again, as:' (1) Ich w¨urde die Karte gerne wiedersehen I would the map like to see again Looking at two SRHs from the ensuing n-best list we found that Example (1a) constituted a suitable representation of the utterance, whereas Example (1b) constituted a less adequate representation thereof.",
        "(1a) Ich w¨urde die Karte eine wieder sehen I would the map one again see (1b) Ich w¨urde die Karte eine Wiedersehen I would the map one Good Bye Facing multiple representations of a single utterance consequently poses the question, which of the different hypotheses corresponds most likely to the user’s utterance.",
        "Several ways of solving this problem have been 'All examples are displayed with the German original on top and a glossed translation below.",
        "proposed and implemented in various systems.",
        "Frequently the scores provided by the ASR system itself are used, e.g. acoustic and language model probabilities.",
        "More recently also scores provided by the NLU system have been employed, e.g. parsing scores or discourse scores (Litman et al., 1999; Engel, 2002; Alexanders-son and Becker, 2003).",
        "However, these methods assign higher scores to SRHs which are semantically incoherent and lower scores to semantically coherent ones and disagree with other.",
        "For instance, the acoustic and language model scores of Example (1b) are actually better than for Example (1a), which results from the fact that the frequencies and corresponding probabilities for important expressions, such as Good Bye, are rather high, thereby ensuring their reliable recognition.",
        "Another phenomenon found in our data consists of hypotheses such as:",
        "(2) Zeige mir alle Vergn¨ugen Show me all pleasures (3) Zeige mir alle Filmen Show me all Films",
        "In these cases language model scores are higher for Example (2) than Example (3), as the incorrect inflection on alle Filmen was less frequent in the training material than that of the correct inflection on alle Vergn¨ugen.",
        "Our data also shows - as one would intuitively expect - that the understanding-based scores generally reflect how well a given SRH is covered by the grammar employed.",
        "In many less well-formed cases these scores do not correspond to the correctness of the SRH.",
        "Generally we find instances where all existing scoring methods disagree with each other, diverge from the actual word error rate and ignore the semantic coherence.2 Neither of the aforementioned approaches systematically employs the system’s knowledge of the domains at hand.",
        "This increases the number of times where a suboptimal recognition hypothesis is passed through the system.",
