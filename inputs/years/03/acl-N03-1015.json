        "In contrast, word sense acquisition has been a human activity; inventories of word senses have been constructed by lexicographers based on their intuition.",
        "Manually constructing an inventory of word senses has suffered from problems such as high cost, arbitrary division of word senses, and mismatch to application domains.",
        "We address the problem of word sense acquisition along the lines of the WSD where word senses are defined with sets of translation equivalents in another language.",
        "Bilingual corpora or second-language corpora enable unsupervised WSD (Brown, et al., 1991; Dagan and Itai, 1994).",
        "However, the correspondence between senses of a word and its translations is not one-to-one, and therefore we need to prepare an inventory of word senses, each of which is defined with a set of synonymous translation equivalents.",
        "Although conventional bilingual dictionaries usually group translations according to their senses, the grouping differs by dictionary.",
        "In addition, senses specific to a domain are often missing while many senses irrelevant to the domain or rare senses are included.",
        "To overcome these problems, we propose a method for producing a hierarchy of clusters of translation equivalents from a bilingual corpus and a bilingual dictionary.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, there are two preceding research papers on word sense acquisition (Fukumoto and Tsujii, 1994; Pantel and Lin, 2002).",
        "Both proposed distributional word clustering algorithms that are characterized by their capabilities to produce overlapping clusters.",
        "According to their algorithms, a polysemous word is assigned to multiple clusters, each of which represents one of its senses.",
        "These and our approach differ in how to define the word sense, i.e., a set of synonyms in the same language versus a set of translation equivalents in another language.",
        "Schuetze (1998) proposed a method for dividing occurrences of a word into classes, each of which consists of contextually similar occurrences.",
        "However, it does not produce definitions of senses such as sets of synonyms and sets of translation equivalents."

        "In conventional distributional word clustering, a word is characterized by a vector or weighted set consisting of words in the same language as that of the word itself.",
        "In contrast, we propose a translingual distributional word clustering method, whereby a word is characterized by a vector or weighted set consisting of words in another language.",
        "It is based on the sense-vs.-clue correlation matrix calculation method we originally developed for unsupervised WSD (Kaji and Morimoto, 2002).",
        "That method presupposes that each sense of a target word x is defined with a synonym set consisting of the target word itself and one or more translation equivalents which represent the sense.",

        "Advantages of using translingually aligned distribution patterns Translingual distributional word clustering has advantages over conventional monolingual distributional word clustering, when they are used to cluster translation equivalents of a target word.",

        "In contrast, according to translingual distributional word clustering, \"L .A<REESU>\" is characterized by the distribution pattern for the sense of \"race\" that means \"competition\".",
        "Second, translingual distributional word clustering can exclude from the clusters translation equivalents irrelevant to the corpus.",
        "For example, a bilingual dictionary renders \"��<TOKUCHOU>\" (\"feature\") as a translation of \"race\", but that sense of \"race\" is used infrequently.",
        "If it is the case in a given domain, \"*M <TOKUCHOU>\" has low correlation with most words related to \"race\", and can therefore be excluded from any clusters.",
        "We should also mention the data-sparseness problem that hampers distributional word clustering.",
        "Generally speaking, the problem becomes more difficult in translingual distributional word clustering, since the sparseness of data in two languages is multiplied.",
        "However, the sense-vs.-clue correlation matrix calculation method overcomes this difficulty; it calculates the correlations between senses and clues iteratively to smooth out the sparse data.",

        "One of the reasons for this may be that we rely on co-occurrence in the window.",
        "The fact that most distributional word clustering methods use syntactic co-occurrence suggests that it is the most effective tool for extracting pairs of related words."

        "We presented a translingual distributional word clustering method enabling word senses, exactly a hierarchy of clusters of translation equivalents, to be acquired from a comparable corpus and a bilingual dictionary.",
        "Its effectiveness was demonstrated through an experiment using Wall Street Journal and Nihon Keizai Shimbun corpora and the EDR bilingual dictionary.",
        "The recall of senses was 87% for senses whose ratios in the corpus were not less than 5%, and the accuracy of sense definitions was 77%.",
