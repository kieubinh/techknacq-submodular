      "text": [
        "The move from isolated word to connected speech recognition engendered a qualitative improvement in the naturalness of users’ interactions with speech transcription systems, sufficient even to make up in user satisfaction for some modest increase in error rate.",
        "Nonetheless, such systems still retain an important source of unnaturalness in dictation, the requirement to utter all punctuation explicitly.",
        "In order to free the user from this burden, a transcription system would have to reconstruct the punctuation from the word sequence.",
        "For certain applications – for instance, transcription of naturally occurring speech not originally targeted to a speech recognizer (as broadcast audio) – there is no alternative to performing reconstruction of punctuation.",
        "Reconstruction of different punctuation marks is likely to respond to different techniques.",
        "Reconstruction of periods, question marks, and exclamation marks, for instance, is in large part the problem of sentence boundary detection.",
        "In this paper, we address the problem of comma restoration.",
        "The published literature on intrasen-tence punctuation restoration is quite limited, the state of the art represented by Beeferman, Berger, and Lafferty’s CYBERPUNC system, which we review in Section 2, and reimplement as a baseline for our own experiments.",
        "(See Section 5 for discussion of related work.)",
        "The CYBERPUNC system uses a simple HMM with trigram probabilities to model the comma restoration problem.",
        "It is trained on fully punctuated text, and then tested for precision and recall in reconstructing commas in text that has had them removed.",
        "Our replication of the trigram-based method yields a sentence accuracy of 47%.",
        "However, the role of the comma in text is closely related to syntactic constituency.",
        "Nunberg (1990) describes two main classes of comma: the delimiter comma, which is used to mark off a constituent, and the separator comma, which is inserted between conjoined elements with or without a conjunction.",
        "In both cases, one expects to see commas at the beginning or end of constituents, rather than in the middle.",
        "But this type of correlation is difficult to model with a flat model such as an HMM.",
        "For this reason, we explore here the use of syntactic constituency information for the purpose of comma restoration.",
        "We show that even very rarefied amounts of syntactic information can dramatically improve comma restoration performance; our best method accurately restores 58% of sentences.",
        "Furthermore, even approximate syntactic information provides significant improvement.",
        "There is, of course, great variation in appropriate punctuation of a single word stream.' For this reason, independent human annotators consider only about 86% of the sentences in the test set to be correct with respect to comma placement (Beeferman et al., 1998).",
        "Thus, a move from 47% to 58% is a quite substantial improvement, essentially a reduction in sentence error rate of some 30%."

      "text": [
        "There has been a tremendous amount of research since the early 1990’s on the problem of parsing using statistical models and evaluated by statistical measures such as crossing brackets rate.",
        "Statistical parsing, like language modeling, is presumably of interest not in and of itself but rather by virtue of its contribution to some end-user application.",
        "In the case of language modeling, speech recognition is the leading exemplar among a large set of end-user natural-language-processing applications that benefit from the technology.",
        "Further, the statistical figures of merit are appropriate just insofar as they vary more or less continuously and monotonically with the performance of the end-user application.",
        "Again, in the case of language modeling, speech recognition error rate is generally acknowledged to improve in direct relation to reduction in cross-entropy of the language model employed.",
        "For statistical parsing, it is much more difficult to say what applications actually benefit from this component technology in the sense that incremental improvements to the technology as measured by the statistical figures of merit provide incremental benefit to the application.",
        "The leading argument for parsing a sentence is that this establishes the structure upon which semantic interpretation can be performed.",
        "But it is hard to imagine in what sense an 85% correct parse is better than an 80% correct parse, as the semantic interpretation generated off of each is likely to be wrong.",
        "Barring a sensible notion of “partially correct interpretation” and an end-user application in which a partially correct interpretation is partially as good as a fully correct one, we would not expect statistical parsers to be useful for end user applications based on sentence interpretation.2 In fact, to the authors’ knowledge, the comma restoration results presented here are the first instance of an end-user application that bears on its face this crucial property, that incremental improvement on statistical parsing provides incremental improvement in the application."

        "These studies, typically based on augmenting a Markovian language model with duration or other prosodic cues as conditioning features, show that prosody information is orthogonal to language model information; combined models outperform models based on each type of information separately.",
        "We would expect therefore, that our techniques would similarly benefit from the addition of prosodic information.",

        "The performance of the method on automatically transcribed speech with its concomitant error remains to be determined.",
        "A hopeful sign is the work of Kim and Woodland (Kim and Woodland, 2001) on punctuation reconstruction using prosodic information.",
        "The performance of their system drops from an F-measure of 78% on reference transcriptions to 44% on automatically transcribed speech at a word error rate of some 20%.",
        "Nonetheless, prosodic features were still useful in improving the reconstructed punctuation even in the automatically transcribed case.",
        "The simple HMM model that we inherit from earlier work dramatically limits the features of the parse that we can easily appeal to in predicting comma locations.",
        "Many alternatives suggest themselves to expand the options, including maximum entropy models, which have been previously successfully applied to, inter alia, sentence boundary detection (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997), and transformation-based learning, as used in part-of-speech tagging and statistical parsing applications (Brill, 1995).",
        "In addition, all of the methods above are essentially nonhierarchical, based as they are on HMMs.",
        "An alternative approach would use the statistical parsing model itself as a model of comma placement, that is, to select the comma placement for a string such that the resulting reconstructed string has maximum likelihood under the statistical parsing model.",
        "This approach has the benefit that the ramifications of comma placement on all aspects of the syntactic structure are explored, but the disadvantage that the longer distance lexical relationships found in a trigram model are eliminated.",
        "Nonetheless, even under these severe constraints and using quite simple features distilled from the parse, we can reduce sentence error by 20%, with the potential of another 8% if statistical parsers were to approach Treebank quality.",
        "As such, comma restoration may stand as the first end-user application that benefits from statistical parsing technology smoothly and incrementally.",
        "Finally, our methods use features that are orthogonal to the prosodic features that other researchers have explored.",
