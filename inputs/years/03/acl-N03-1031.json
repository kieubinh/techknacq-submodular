        "Current state-of-the-art statistical parsers (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000) are trained on large annotated corpora such as the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "However, the production of such corpora is expensive and labor-intensive.",
        "Given this bottleneck, there is considerable interest in (partially) automating the annotation process.",
        "To overcome this bottleneck, two approaches from machine learning have been applied to training parsers.",
        "One is sample selection (Thompson et al., 1999; Hwa, 2000; Tang et al., 2002), a variant of active learning (Cohn et al., 1994), which tries to identify a small set of unlabeled sentences with high training utility for the human to label1.",
        "Sentences with high training utility are those most likely to improve the parser.",
        "The other approach, and the focus of this paper, is co-training (Sarkar, 2001), a mostly-unsupervised algorithm that replaces the human by having two (or more) parsers label training examples for each other.",
        "The goal is for both parsers to improve by bootstrapping off each other’s strengths.",
        "Because the parsers may label examples incorrectly, only a subset of their output, chosen by some selection mechanism, is used in order to minimize errors.",
        "The choice of selection method significantly affects the quality of the resulting parsers.",
        "We investigate a novel approach of selecting training examples for co-training parsers by incorporating the idea of maximizing training utility from sample selection.",
        "The selection mechanism is integral to both sample selection and co-training; however, because co-training and sample selection have different goals, their selection methods focus on different criteria: co-training typically favors selecting accurately labeled examples, while sample selection typically favors selecting examples with high training utility, which often are not sentences that the parsers already label accurately.",
        "In this work, we investigate selection methods for co-training that explore the trade-off between maximizing training utility and minimizing errors.",
        "Empirical studies were conducted to compare selection methods under both co-training and a semi-supervised framework called corrected co-training (Pierce and Cardie, 2001), in which the selected examples are manually checked and corrected before being added to the",
        "training data.",
        "For co-training, we show that the benefit of selecting examples with high training utility can offset the additional errors they contain.",
        "For corrected co-training, we show that selecting examples with high training utility reduces the number of sentences the human annotator has to check.",
        "For both frameworks, we show that selection methods that maximize training utility find labeled examples that result in better trained parsers than those that only minimize error."

        "We have considered three selection methods that have different priorities in balancing the two (often competing) criteria of accuracy and training utility.",
        "We have empirically compared their effect on co-training, in which two parsers label data for each other, as well as corrected co-training, in which a human corrects the parser labeled data before adding it to the training set.",
        "Our results suggest that training utility is an important selection criterion to consider, even at the cost of potentially reducing the accuracy of the training data.",
        "In our empirical studies, the selection method that aims to maximize training utility, Sdiff-n, consistently finds better examples than the one that aims to maximize accuracy, Sabove-n. Our results also suggest that the selection method that aims to maximize both accuracy and utility, Sint-n, shows promise in improving co-training parsers and in reducing human effort for corrected co-training; however, a much larger unlabeled data set is needed to verify the benefit of Sint-n.",
        "The results of this study indicate the need for scoring functions that are better estimates of the accuracy of the parser’s output than conditional probabilities.",
        "Our oracle experiments show that, by using effective selection methods, the co-training process can improve parser peformance even when the newly labeled parses are not completely accurate.",
        "This suggests that co-training may still be beneficial when using a practical scoring function that might only coarsely distinguish accurate parses from inaccurate parses.",
        "Further avenues to explore include the development of selection methods to efficiently approximate maximizing the objective function of parser agreement on unlabeled data, following the work of Dasgupta et al.",
        "(2002) and Abney (2002).",
        "Also, co-training might be made more effective if partial parses were used as training data.",
        "Finally, we are conducting experiments to compare corrected co-training with other active learning methods.",
        "We hope these studies will reveal ways to combine the strengths of co-training and active learning to make better use of unlabeled data."
