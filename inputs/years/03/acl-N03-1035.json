        "We propose a gold standard for evaluating two types of information extraction output -- noun phrase (NP) chunks (Abney 1991; Ramshaw and Marcus 1995) and technical terms (Justeson and Katz 1995; Daille 2000; Jacquemin 2002).",
        "The gold standard is built around the notion that since different semantic and syntactic variants of terms are arguably correct, a fully satisfactory assessment of the quality of the output must include task-based evaluation.",
        "We conducted an experiment that assessed subjects’ choice of index terms in an information access task.",
        "Subjects showed significant preference for index terms that are longer, as measured by number of words, and more complex, as measured by number of prepositions.",
        "These terms, which were identified by a human indexer, serve as the gold standard.",
        "The experimental protocol is a reliable and rigorous method for evaluating the quality of a set of terms.",
        "An important advantage of this task-based evaluation is that a set of index terms which is different than the gold standard can ‘win’ by providing better information access than the gold standard itself does.",
        "And although the individual human subject experiments are time consuming, the experimental interface, test materials and data analysis programs are completely reusable."

        "The standard metrics for evaluation of the output of NLP systems are precision and recall.",
        "Given an arguably correct list of the units that a system would identify if it performed perfectly, there should in principle be no discrepancy between the units identified by a system and the units that are either useful in a particular application or are preferred by human beings for use in a particular task.",
        "But when the satisfactory output can take many different forms, as in summarization and generation, evaluation by precision and recall is not sufficient.",
        "In these cases, the challenge for system designers and users is to effectively distinguish between systems that provide generally satisfactory output and systems that do not.",
        "NP chunks (Abney 1991; Ramshaw and Marcus 1995; Evans and Zhai 1996; Frantzi and Ananiadou 1996) and technical terms (Dagan and Church 1994; Justeson and Katz 1995; Daille 1996; Jacquemin 2001; Bourigault et al.",
        "2002) fall into this difficult-to-assess category.",
        "NPs are recursive structures.",
        "For the maximal NP large number of recent newspaper articles on biomedical science and clinical practice, a full-fledged parser would legitimately identify (at least) seven NPs in addition to the maximal one: large number; recent newspaper articles; large number of recent newspaper articles; biomedical science; clinical practice; biomedical science and clinical practice; and recent newspaper articles on biomedical science and clinical practice.",
        "To evaluate the performance of a parser, NP chunks can usefully be evaluated by a gold standard; many systems (e.g., Ramshaw and Marcus 1995 and Cardie and Pierce 1988) use the Penn Treebank for this type of evaluation.",
        "But for most applications, output that lists a maximal NP and each of its component NPs is bulky and redundant.",
        "Even a system that achieves 100% precision and recall in identifying all of the NPs in a document needs criteria for determining which units to use in different contexts or applications.",
        "Technical terms are a subset of NP chunks.",
        "Jacquemin (2001:3) defines terms as multi-word “vehicles of scientific and technical information”.1 The operational difficulty, of course, is to decide whether a specific term is a vehicle of scientific and technical information (e.g., birth date or light truck).",
        "Evaluation of mechanisms that filter out some terms while retaining others is subject to this difficulty.",
        "This is exactly the kind of case where context plays a significant role in deciding whether a term conforms to a definition and where experts disagree.",
        "In this paper, we turn to an information access task in order to assess terms identified by different techniques.",
        "There are two basic types of information access mechanisms, searching and browsing.",
        "In searching, the user generates the search terms; in",
        "lected terms; by this measure the subjects’ preference for the human terms was more than 7 times greater than the preference for either of the automatic techniques.",
        "(In Table 1 and in the rest of this paper, all index term counts are by type rather than by token, unless otherwise indicated.)",
        "subjects relative to number of terms in the entire index.",
        "This initial experiment strongly indicates that 1) people have a demonstrable preference for different types of index terms; 2) these human terms are a very good gold standard.",
        "If subjects use a greater proportion of the terms identified by a particular technique, the terms can be judged better than the terms identified by another technique, even if the terms are different.",
        "Any automatic technique capable of identifying terms that are preferred over these human terms would be a very strong system indeed.",
        "Furthermore, the properties of the terms preferred by the experimental subjects can be used to guide design of systems for identifying and selecting NP chunks and technical terms.",
        "In the next section, we describe the design of the experiment and in Section 3, we report on what the experimental data shows about human preferences for different kinds of index terms."

        "Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.)",
        "Subjects used the Experimental Searching and Browsing Interface (ESBI) which forces them to access text via the index terms; direct text searching was prohibited.",

        "However, when users do not know (or can’t remember) the exact expression used in relevant documents, they necessarily struggle to find relevant information in full-text search systems.",

        "In fact, the distinction between task-based evaluation of a system and precision/recall evaluation of the quality of system output is similar to the extrinsic/intrinsic evaluation of summarization (Gallier and Jones 1993).",
        "In order to focus on the subjects’ choice of index terms rather than on other aspects of the information access process, we asked subject to find answers to questions in a college level text book.",
        "Subjects used the Experimental Searching and Browsing Interface (ESBI) to browse a list of terms that were identified by different techniques and then merged.",
        "Subjects select an index term by clicking on it in order to hy-perlink to the text itself.",
        "By design, ESBI forces the subjects to access the text indirectly, by searching and browsing the list of index terms, rather than by direct searching of the text.",
        "Three sets of terms were used in the experiment: one set (HS) was identified using the head-sorting method of Wacholder (1998); the second set (TT) was identified by an implementation of the technical term algorithm of Justeson and Katz (1995); a third set (HUM) was created by a human indexer.",

        "In this section, we address a number of questions about this method.",
        "1) What properties of terms can this technique be used to study?",
        "• One word or many.",
        "There are two parts to the process of identifying NP terms: NP chunks that are candidate terms must be identified and candidate terms must be filtered in order to select a subset appropriate for use in the intended application.",
        "Justeson and Katz (1995) is an example of an algorithm where the process used for identifying NP chunks is also the filtering process.",
        "A byproduct of this technique is that single-word terms are excluded.",
        "In part, this is because it is much harder to determine in context which single words actually qualify as terms.",
        "But dictionaries of technical terminology have many one-word terms.",

        "least in part because this bypasses the need to solve the quite difficult attachment problem, i.e., to determine which simpler NPs should be combined to output a more complex NP.",
        "But if people find complex NPs more useful than simpler ones, it is important to focus on improvement of techniques to reliably identify more complex terms.",
        "• Semantic and syntactic terms variants.",

        "(1996), Jacquemin (2001) and others address the question of how to identify semantic (synonymous) and syntactic variants.",
        "But independent of the question of how to recognize variants is the question of which variants are to be preferred for different kinds of uses.",
        "• Impact of errors.",
        "Real-world NLP systems",
        "have a measurable error rate.",
        "By conducting experiments in which terms with errors are include in the set of test terms, the impact of these errors can be measured.",
        "The usefulness of a set of terms presumably is at least in part a function of the impact of the errors, whether the errors are a by-product of the algorithm or the implementation of the algorithm.",
        "2) Could the set of human index terms be used as a gold standard without conducting the human subject experiments?",
        "This of course could be done, but then the terms are being evaluated by a fixed standard – by definition, no set of terms can do better than the gold standard.",
        "This experimental method leaves open the possibility that there is a set of terms that is better than the gold standard.",
        "In this case, of course, the gold standard would no longer be a gold standard -- perhaps we would have to call it a platinum standard.",
        "3) How reproducible is the experiment?",
        "The experiment can be rerun with any set of terms deemed to be representative of the content of the Rice text.",
        "The preparation of the materials for additional texts is admittedly time-consuming.",
        "But over time a sizable corpus of experimental materials in different domains could be built up.",
        "These materials could be used for training as well as for testing.",
        "4) How extensible is the gold standard?",
        "The experimental protocol will be validated only if equally useful index terms can be created for other texts.",
        "We anticipate that they can.",
        "5) How can this research help in the design of real world NLP systems?",
        "This technique can help in assessing the relative usefulness of existing techniques for identifying terms.",
        "It is possible, for example, there already exist techniques for identifying terms that are superior to the two tested here.",
        "If we can find such systems, their algorithms should be preferred.",
        "If not, there remains a need for development of algorithms to identify single word terms and complex phrases.",
        "6) Do the benefits of this evaluation technique outweigh the costs?",
        "Given the fundamental difficulty of evaluating NP chunks and technical terms, task-based evaluation is a promising supplement to evaluation by precision and recall.",
        "These relatively time-consuming human subject experiments surely will not be undertaken by most system developers; ideally, they should be performed by neutral parties who do not have a stake in the outcome.",
        "7) Should automated indexes try to imitate human indexers?",
        "Automated indexes should contain terms that are most easily processed by users.",
        "If the properties of such terms can be reliably discovered, developers of systems that identify terms intended to be processed by people surely should pay attention."

        "In this paper we have reported on a rigorous experimental technique for black-box evaluation of the usefulness of NP chunks and technical terms in an information access task.",
        "Our experiment shows that it is possible to reliably identify human preferences for sets of terms.",
        "The set of human terms created for use in a back-of-the-book index serves as a gold standard.",
        "An advantage of the task-based evaluation is that a set of terms could outperform the gold standard; any system that could do this would be a good system indeed.",
        "The two automatic methods that we evaluated performed much less well than the terms created by the human indexer; we plan to evaluate additional techniques for term identification in the hope of identifying automatic methods that identify index terms that people prefer over the human terms.",
        "We also plan to prepare test materials in different domains, and assess in greater depth the properties of the terms that our experimental subjects preferred; our goal is to develop practical guidelines for the identification and selection of technical terms that are optimal for human users.",
        "We will also study the impact of semantic differences between terms on user preferences and investigate whether terms which are preferred for information access are equally suitable for other NLP tasks."
