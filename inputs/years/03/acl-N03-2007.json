        "This paper describes an application of active learning methods to the classification of phone strings recognized using unsupervised phono-tactic models.",
        "The only training data required for classification using these recognition methods is assigning class labels to the audio files.",
        "The work described here demonstrates that substantial savings in this effort can be obtained by actively selecting examples to be labeled using confidence scores from the Boos-Texter classifier.",
        "The saving in class labeling effort is evaluated on two different spoken language system domains in terms both of the number of utterances to be labeled and the length of the labeled utterances in phones.",
        "We show that savings in labeling effort of around 30% can be obtained using active selection of examples."

        "A major barrier to the rapid and cost-effective development of spoken language processing applications is the need for time-consuming and expensive human transcription and annotation of collected data.",
        "Extensive transcription of audio is generally undertaken to provide word-level labeling to train recognition models.",
        "Applications that use statistically trained classification as a component of an understanding system also require this transcribed text to train on, plus an assignment of class labels to each utterance.",
        "In recent work by Alshawi (2003) reported in this conference, new methods for unsupervised training of phone string recognizers have been developed, removing the need for word-level transcription.",
        "The phone-string output of such recognizers has been used in classification tasks using the BoosTexter text classification algorithm, giving utterance classfication accuracy that is surprisingly close to that obtained using conventionally trained word trigram models requiring transcription.",
        "The only training data required for classification using these recognition methods is assigning class labels to the audio files.",
        "The aim of the work described in this paper is to amplify this advantage by reducing the amount of effort required to train classifiers for phone-based systems by actively selecting which utterances to assign class labels.",
        "Active learning has been applied to classification problems before (McCallum and Nigam, 1998; Tur et al., 2003), but not to classifiying phone strings."

        "In this method, the training inputs to recognition model training are simply the set of audio files that have been recorded from the application.",
        "The recognition training phase is an iterative procedure in which a phone n-gram model is refined successively: The phone strings resulting from the current pass over the speech files are used to construct the phone n-gram model for the next iteration.",
        "We currently only re-estimate the n-gram model, so the same general-purpose HMM acoustic model is used for ASR decoding in all iterations.",
        "Recognition training can be briefly described as follows.",
        "First, set the phone sequence model to an initial phone string model.",
        "This initial model used can be an unweighted phone loop or a general purpose phonotac-tic model for the language being recognized.",
        "Then, for successively larger n-grams, produce the output set of phone sequences from recognizing the training speech files with the current phone sequence model, and train the next larger n-gram phone sequence model on this output corpus."

        "However, a closer inspection of the chosen examples reveals that, on average, the actively selected utterances are nearly 1.5 times longer than the random selection in terms of number of phones.",

        "By actively choosing the examples with the lowest confidence scores first, we can get the same classification results with around 60-70% of the utterances labeled in HMIHY and TTSHD.",

        "We therefore augmented our active learning selection to include a constraint on the length of the utterances, measured in recognized phones.",
        "If we simply take effort to be proportional to the number of phones in the utterances selected (likely to result in a conservative estimate of savings), the effort reduction at 4,000 utterances is around 30% even for the more complex HMIHY domain.",
        "Further investigation is needed into the best way to measure overall labeling effort, and into refinements of the active learning process to optimize that labeling effort."
