        "Sentences can be represented by various expressions even though they have the same meaning.",

        "In this paper, we propose an automatic quantitative expansion method for a sentence set that contains sentences of the same meaning (called an equivalent sentence set), as a paraphrasing technique.",
        "Our method is roughly structured from the following two phases.",
        "1.",
        "Extract phrasal correspondences that have the same meaning (called equivalent phrases) from the source equivalent sentence set (acquisition phase).",
        "2.",
        "Based on the parse tree of the sentence selected from the source set, generate target sentences by recursively substituting the equivalent phrases for the source phrases (generation phase).",
        "Paraphrasing is regarded as machine translation into the same language.",
        "In this paper, we apply syntactic substitution for generating sentences, which corresponds to transfer-based machine translation.",
        "In addition, Hierarchical Phrase Alignment (HPA) (Imamura, 2001), which is an automatic acquisition method for machine translation rules, is applied to acquire the paraphrasing rules.",
        "Namely, two equivalent sentences are regarded as bilingual sentences, and simplified machine translation is carried out.",
        "Paraphrasing by our method has the following characteristics.",
        "• Not only lexical paraphrasing but also phrasal paraphrasing can be generated because our method is based on structural substitution.",
        "• Equivalent phrases extracted by HPA are not only semantically but also grammatically equivalent.",
        "Thus, our method rarely generates ungrammatical sentences by substitution.",
        "Expansion of the equivalent sentence set can be applied to automatic evaluation of machine translation quality (Papineni et al., 2002; Akiba et al., 2001), for example.",
        "These methods evaluate the quality of the translation by measuring the similarity between machine translation results and translations done by humans (called references).",
        "However, the accuracy increases when multiple references are applied because one source sentence can be translated into multiple target expressions.",
        "Our method generates multiple sentences that are suitable for this purpose."

        "Hierarchical Phrase Alignment is based on the assumption that an “equivalent phrase pair has the same information and the same grammatical role.” We decompose this assumption into the following two conditions for computation.",
        "• The words in the phrase pair correspond, with no deficiency and no excess.",
        "• The phrases are of the same syntactic category.",

        "Check all combinations of syntactic nodes between",
        "the sentences.",
        "If the node pair satisfies the above two conditions, then output the pair as an equivalent phrase.",
        "Namely, if no words in the phrase link to the outside of the other phrase, and the nodes have the same category, the phrase pair is regarded as equivalent.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of equivalent phrase extraction from source equivalent sentences.",
        "The upper sentence is interrogative, the lower sentence is imperative, and they have the same meaning.",
        "For example, focusing on the upper phrase “get me,” this phrase is VP and contains two word links.",
        "However, no nodes contain only the links ‘get’, and ‘me’ in the lower sentence.",
        "On the other hand, focusing on the upper phrase “get me a taxi,” it contains four word links that correspond to the lower phrase “get a taxi for me”, and they have the same syntactic category.",
        "Therefore, the node pair VP (4) is regarded as an equivalent phrase.",
        "By iterating the above process, HPA consequently extracts eight nodes as equivalents from the source sentences shown in Figure 1.",
        "Excluding the identical phrases, the following three phrases are acquired as equivalent phrases.",
        "• “get me a taxi” and “get a taxi for me” • “10 in the morning” and “10 a.m.” • “at 10 in the morning” and “at 10 a.m.”",
        "HPA can extract phrasal correspondences from source equivalent sentences even if their sentence structures are significantly different.",
        "In addition, because node pairs have to be in the same syntactic category, un-paraphrasable correspondences, such as “morning” and “a.m.,” are ignored even though they have word links."
