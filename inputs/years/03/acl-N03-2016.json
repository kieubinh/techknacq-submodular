        "In the context of machine translation, the term cognates denotes words in different languages that are similar in their orthographic or phonetic form and are possible translations of each other.",
        "The similarity is usually due either to a genetic relationship (e.g. English night and German nacht) or borrowing from one language to another (e.g. English sprint and Japanese supurinto).",
        "In a broad sense, cognates include not only genetically related words and borrowings but also names, numbers, and punctuation.",
        "Practically all bitexts (bilingual parallel corpora) contain some kind of cognates.",
        "If the languages are represented in different scripts, a phonetic transcription or transliteration of one or both parts of the bitext is a prerequisite for identifying cognates.",
        "Cognates have been employed for a number of bitext-related tasks, including sentence alignment (Simard et al., 1992), inducing translation lexicons (Mann and Ya-rowsky, 2001), and improving statistical machine translation models (Al-Onaizan et al., 1999).",
        "Cognates are particularly useful when machine-readable bilingual dictionaries are not available.",
        "Al-Onaizan et al.",
        "(1999) experimented with using bilingual dictionaries and cognates in the training of Czech–English translation models.",
        "They found that appending probable cognates to the training bitext significantly lowered the perplexity score on the test bitext (in some cases more than when using a bilingual dictionary), and observed improvement in word alignments of test sentences.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the problem of incorporating the potentially valuable cognate information into the translation models of Brown et al.",
        "(1990), which, in their original formulation, consider lexical items in abstraction of their form.",
        "For training of the models, we use the GIZA program (Al-Onaizan et al., 1999).",
        "A list of likely cognate pairs is extracted from the training corpus on the basis of orthographic similarity, and appended to the corpus itself.",
        "The objective is to reinforce the co-ocurrence count between cognates in addition to already existing co-ocurrences.",
        "The results of experiments conducted on a variety of bitexts show that cognate identification can improve word alignments, which leads to better translation models, and, consequently, translations of higher quality.",
        "The improvement is achieved without modifying the statistical training algorithm."

        "We experimented with three word similarity measures: Simard’s condition, Dice’s coefficient, and LCSR.",
        "Simard et al.",
        "(1992) proposed a simple condition for detecting probable cognates in French–English bitexts: two words are considered cognates if they are at least four characters long and their first four characters are identical.",
        "Dice’s coefficient is defined as the ratio of the number of shared character bigrams to the total number of bigrams in both words.",
        "For example, colour and couleur share three bigrams (co, ou, and ur), so their Dice’s coefficient is 611 - 0.55.",
        "The Longest Common Subsequence Ratio (LCSR) of two words is computed by dividing the length of their longest common subsequence by the length of the longer word.",
        "For example,",
        "mon subsequence is “c-o-l-u-r”.",
        "In order to identify a set of likely cognates in a tokenized and sentence-aligned bitext, each aligned segment is split into words, and all possible word pairings are stored in a file.",
        "Numbers and punctuation are not considered, since we feel that they warrant a more specific approach.",
        "After sorting and removing duplicates, the file represents all possible one-to-one word alignments of the bitext.",
        "Also removed are the pairs that include English function words, and words shorter than the minimum length (usually set at four characters).",
        "For each word pair, a similarity measure is computed, and the file is again sorted, this time by the computed similarity value.",
        "If the measure returns a non-binary similarity value, true cognates are very frequent near the top of the list, and become less frequent towards the bottom.",
        "The set of likely cognates is obtained by selecting all pairs with similarity above a certain threshold.",
        "Typically, lowering the threshold increases recall while decreasing precision of the set.",
        "Finally, one or more copies of the resulting set of likely cognates are concatenated with the training set."

        "The actual translations were produced with a greedy decoder (Germann et al., 2001).",
        "For the evaluation of translation quality, we used the BLEU metric (Papineni et al., 2002), which measures the n-gram overlap between the translated output and one or more reference translations.",

        "The duplication factor was arbitrarily selected on the basis of earlier experiments with a different training and test set taken from Hansards.",
        "The incorporation of the cognate information resulted in a 10% reduction of the word alignment error rate, from 17.6% to 15.8%, and a corresponding improvement in both precision and recall.",
        "An examination of randomly selected alignments confirms the observation of Al-Onaizan et al.",
        "(1999) that the use of cognate information reduces the tendency of rare words to align to many co-occurring words.",
