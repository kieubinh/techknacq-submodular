        "Practical NLP applications such as text summarization and question-answering place increasing demands on the processing of temporal information.",
        "In multi-document summarization of news, it is important to know the relative order of events so as to correctly merge and present information.",
        "In question-answering, one would like to be able to ask when an event occurs, or what events occurred prior to a particular event.",
        "Such capabilities presuppose an ability to infer the temporal order of events in discourse.",
        "A number of different knowledge sources appear to be involved in inferring event ordering (Lascarides and Asher 1993), including tense and aspect (1), temporal adverbials (2), and world knowledge (3).",
        "(1) Max entered the room.",
        "He had drunk/was drinking the wine.",
        "(2) A drunken man died in the central Phillipines when he put a firecracker under his armpit.",
        "(3) U. N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali Sunday opened a meeting of ....Boutros-Ghali arrived in Nairobi from South Africa, ...",
        "As (Bell 1999) has pointed out, the temporal structure of news is dictated by perceived news value rather than chronology.",
        "Thus, the latest news is often presented first, instead of events being described in order of occurrence (the latter ordering is called the narrative convention).",
        "This paper describes a domain-independent approach to temporally anchoring and ordering events in news.",
        "The approach is motivated by a pilot experiment with 8 subjects providing news event-ordering judgments which revealed that the narrative convention applied only 47% of the time in ordering the events in successive past-tense clauses.",
        "Our approach involves mixed-initiative corpus annotation, with automatic tagging to identify clause structure, tense, aspect, and temporal adverbials, as well as tagging of reference times and anchoring of events with respect to reference times.",
        "We report on machine learning results from event-time anchoring judgments."

        "Our pilot experiment also revealed that the proportion of clauses with explicit time expressions (TIMEX2) is approximately 25%, suggesting that anchoring the events to just the explicit times wouldn’t be sufficient.",

        "The system also anchors the event’s time with respect to the tval (at, before, or after) when the tval is an explicit reference time.",

        "Most of the errors in computed tvals had to do with the tval being assigned erroneously the document date rather than reverting to a non-immediately previous tval.",
