        "Semantic Extraction pertains to the assignment of semantic bindings to short units of text (usually sentences).",
        "The SE problem is quite similar to the Information Extraction (IE) task, in that in both cases we are interested only in certain predicates and their argument bindings and not in full understanding.",
        "However there are major differences as well.",
        "IE is a pre-specified and autonomous task with a narrow domain of focus, where all the information of interest is represented in the extraction template.",
