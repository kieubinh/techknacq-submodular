        "A previous project, PSET (Devlin and Tait 1998, Devlin et al.",
        "2000), has already made some progress towards lexical-level and syntax-level simplifications for poor readers.",
        "In GIRL, it is at the discourse level that choices are made that affect sentence length and selection of discourse cue phrases (phrases that render discourse relations explicit to the reader, e.g. ‘for example’, ‘so’ and ‘if’, in Figure 1).",
        "These choices are made in a module called the micro-planner (see Reiter and Dale 2000).",
        "The inputs to the microplanner are a model of a user’s reading ability and a tree-structured document plan (Reiter and Dale 2000) that includes discourse relations.",
        "In GIRL, discourse relations are schemas arranged in a discourse tree structure.",
        "Each schema has slots for semantic roles filled by daughter text spans, or daughter relations.",

        "Figure 2 shows a discourse relation tree structure with its corresponding schema.",
        "The root relation, R1, is a concession (type: concession), with one daughter relation, R2, filling the ‘concession’ slot and a text span daughter, S1, filling the ‘statement’ slot.",
        "R2 is a condition relation with two text span daughters: S3 filling the ‘condition’ slot and S2 the ‘consequent’ slot.",
        "The task of GIRL’s microplanner is to decide on the ordering of the daughters, how they should be packed into sentences (aggregation), whether there should be punctuation between the daughters, whether discourse cue phrases should be present and, if so, which ones and where they should be placed.",
        "The microplanner will ultimately adapt the choices it makes to the reading level of individual users (readers) from user models built from users’ answers to up to ninety questions from a literacy test.",
        "Our current implementation only considers two generic types of user - “good readers” and “bad readers”.",

        "We analysed seven discourse relations (Williams and Reiter 2003), including concession, condition, elaboration-additional, evaluation, example, reason and restatement, using the RST Discourse Treebank corpus (Carlson et al.",
        "2002).",
        "We analysed one hundred instances of each relation noting the following six features:",
        "• L1: length of the first text span (in words).",
        "• L2: length of the second text span (in words).",
        "• O: ordering of the text spans.",
        "• Ps: position(s) of discourse cue phrase(s).",
        "• P: between-text-span punctuation.",
        "• C: discourse cue phrase(s).",
        "An example to demonstrate these features is the concession relation in the last example given above: “If you practise, you can learn to fill informs.",
        "You made four mistakes, though.” Here, L1 is ten words (this includes the whole of the condition daughter), L2 is five words, O is concession-statement, Ps is after the statement, P is a full stop and C is “though”.",
        "These features were chosen on the basis of previous work (Moser and Moore 1996) and because they influence sentence length and lexical choice which are known to be important factors in readability.",
        "The analysis revealed some of the ways in which human authors select these features when writing for good readers.",
        "These provided a partial specification for modelling discourse-level choices that should be available in an",
        "NLG system.",
        "Furthermore the analysis demonstrated that the features are interdependent.",
        "The results from our corpus analysis (Williams and Reiter 2003) were simplified.",
        "The numbers of values for some features were cut down by reclassifying them as members of a smaller number of categories.",
        "Length became either “long” or “short”.",
        "The data for each relation was split into two, so that roughly half the L1 instances fell into the “short” category (e.g. for concession, short = 1-15 words, long = >15 words).",
        "Between-text-span punctuation was divided into just three categories: none, non-sentence-breaking, and sentence-breaking.",
        "The restatement relation was an exception because it had such a large proportion of open-parentheses (62%) that an extra category was created.",
        "In restatement, it seems that punctuation is often used instead of a cue phrase to signal the relation.",
        "The cue phrase feature was left with larger numbers of values to provide GIRL with the maximum number of choices for lexical selection.",
        "The data was reconfigured as sets of 6-tuples.",
        "Each represents a set of values for one instance of a relation: i.e. <L1,L2,O,Ps,P,C>.",
        "For instance, the concession relation described above would be represented as <short, short, concession-statement, after_statement, full stop, “though”>.",
        "We thus created seven hundred 6 tuples in total, one hundred per relation.",
        "For each relation, these were sorted, duplicates were counted and superfluous duplicates removed.",
        "Of the resulting unique 6-tuples, some were rejected and are not used in the current language choice models.",
        "For example, in the concession choice model forty-six unique 6-tuples cover 100% of the corpus data and sixteen were rejected, resulting in a coverage of 75%.",
        "For condition, forty-seven unique 6-tuples cover 100% but only twenty-six were included and these cover 72%.",
        "current language models marked with asterisks The reason why some tuples were rejected is because GIRL’s present shallow approaches to syntactic and semantic processing cannot generate them.",
        "It cannot currently generate embedded discourse text spans, nor can it generate discourse cue phrases in mid-text-span positions.",
        "Both of these would require the implementation of deeper syntactic processing.",
        "Certain 6-tuples contain discourse cue phrases that would not make sense when generated unless we implement deeper semantic processing.",
        "Figure 3 shows some examples of these.",
        "Cue phrases marked with asterisks have been rejected from the current language models because they require deeper processing.",
        "Our current method for reconfiguring the data is manual, using existing spreadsheet, database and statistics packages.",

        "We tried exploring both discriminant analysis statistics and machine learning of decision trees in attempts to identify which feature(s) would most clearly divide the data into groups.",
        "For most discourse relations, the positions of discourse cue phrases were the most discriminating features.",
        "The most crucial characteristic of the choice models we were attempting to build was that they should reflect the interdependencies of the features found in the corpus analysis.",
        "For instance, in most relations the selection of between-span punctuation is dependent on the length of the first text span.",
        "For some relations (not all), this means that as the first text span gets longer, the between-span punctuation tends to change from no punctuation, to comma, to full stop.",
        "Similarly, the selection of punctuation depends on the order of text spans, particularly with the condition relation.",
        "If the order is condition-consequent, there tends to be a comma between text spans, if the order is consequent-condition, there is often no punctuation.",
        "And so on with interdependencies between all the other features.",

        "The numbers of pairs in the “good lists” attached to each of the fifteen connections varies for each relation.",
