        "A fairly novel area of retrieval called topic detection and tracking (TDT) attempts to design methods to automatically (1) spot new, previously unreported events, and (2) follow the progress ofthe previously spotted events (Allan et al., 1998c; Yang et al., 1998).",
        "Our contribution deals with three problems in TDT.",
        "Firstly, we present a new definition for a topic that would model the event evolution, i.e., the changing nature of a topic.",
        "The previous event definitions do not really lend themselves to this change.",

        "Unlike the term-weighting model of Yang et al.",
        "(2002) this approach enables the use of introduction of different similarity measures for each semantic class.",
        "We formalize the comparison method and suggest a NN approach based on this formalization.",
        "Thirdly, we suggest the use of dynamic hierarchies in a TDT system that would decrease the exhaustive computation of the first story detection.",
        "In practice this means that we import text categorization on top of TDT.",

        "As this is mainly work-in-progress, we do not have empirical motivation for our work.",

        "The events are taking place in the world, and some of them are reported in the news.",
        "A TDT system does not perceive the events themselves, rather makes an effort in deducing them from the continuous news-stream – which is in a sense like the shadows on the wall in Plato’s cave analogy.",
        "Given this setting, what is it that we are trying to model?",
        "Typically, the text categorization is conducted using some machine learning system (Sebastiani, 2002; Yang and Liu, 1999).",
        "Such system is taught to recognize the difference between two or more predefined classes or categories by providing a good number of pre-labeled samples to learn from.",
        "As to classes and word frequencies, this training material is assumed to lend itself to the same underlying distribution as the material that is to be categorized.",
        "More formally, the documents and their labels yield to a unknown distribution.",
        "This distribution is expressed as a function that assigns to each document-label pair a boolean value indicating their relevance, i.e., The task of classification is to come up with a hypothesis that represents , practically, with the ’highest’ accuracy.",
        "This accuracy is evaluated with a pre-labeled testing material.",
        "Now, with TDT the problem is different.",
        "Let us assume that the documents and events yield to an unknown distribution represented by the function that assigns each document a boolean value indicating whether it discussed event or not.",
        "The problem is that domain of is time-dependent.",
        "The hypothesis built from the training data does not work with evaluation data, because these two data sets do not discuss the same events.",
        "Moreover, the events are very small in size compared to categories and their identity, that is, the most important terms evolve over time.",
        "We can, however, model similarity between two documents.",
        "By examining the pairwise comparisons in the training set, we can formulate a hypothesis that assigns the pair a boolean value 1 if the documents discuss the same event, 1 otherwise.",
        "Any two documents of same event are (ideally) similar in a similar way.",
        "This somewhat trivial observation has some implications worth mentioning.",
        "Firstly, by definition news documents report changes, something new with respect to what is already known.",
        "This would lead to think that the identity of an event eludes all static representations and that the representation for a topic would have to adapt automatically to the various changes in the reporting of the event.",
        "Secondly, so far the parameters and thresholds of the state-of-the-art methods in IR have tried to capture this similarity of similarity, but there does not seem be a representation expressive enough (Allan et al., 2000).",
        "Thirdly, the detection and tracking is based on pairwise comparisons which requires exhaustive computation.",
        "Yang et al.",
        "(2002) suggested topic-categories that could be used to limit the search space of the first-story detection.",

        "Although the concept of event might seem intuitively clear and self-explanatory, formulating a sound definition appears to be difficult.",
        "Predating TDT research, numerous historians and researchers of political science have wrestled with the definitions (Falk, 1989; Gerner et al., 1994).",
        "What seems to be somewhat agreed upon is that an event is some sort of activity conducted by some agent and taking place somewhere at some time.",
        "This initial definition was adopted to TDT project and it is intuitively quite sound.",
        "Practically all of the events of the TDT test set yield to the temporal proximity (“burstiness”) and the compactness.",
        "However, there is also a number of problematic cases which this definition seems to neglect: events which either have a long-lasting nature (Intifada, Kosovo–Macedonia, struggle in Columbia), escalate to several large-scale threads or campaigns (September 11), or are not tightly spatio-temporally constrained (BSE-epidemics).",
        "The events in the world are not as autonomous as this definition assumes.",
        "They are often interrelated and do not necessarily decay within weeks or a few months.",
        "Some of these problematic events would classify as activities (Papka, 1999), but when encountering a piece of news, we do not know a priori whether it is a short term event or long term activity, a start for a complex chain of events or just a simple incident.",
        "This is basically a variant of Definition 1 that in some sense tries to address the autonomy assumption.",
        "Yet, it opens a number of questions as to what are the necessary preconditions for certain event, an oil crisis, for example.",
        "What are the necessary preconditions and unavoidable consequences of Secretary Powell’s visit to Middle East or of suicide-bombing in Ramallah?",

        "In TDT, there are eleven topic types that tell what kind of other topic types are relevant.",
        "The topic type of the topic is determined by the seminal event.",
        "Since TDT2 and TDT3 corpora are produced along this guideline, this is in a sense the de facto definition.",
        "Definition 4 makes an attempt at addressing the changing or evolving nature of a topic.",
        "A seminal event can lead to several things at the same time and the connection between the various outcomes and the initial cause become less and less obvious as the events progress.",
        "As a practical consequence, the event evolution (Yang et al., 1999; Papka, 1999) causes changes in the vocabulary, especially in the crucial, identifying terms.",
        "The news documents are temporally linearly ordered, and the news stories can be said to form series of different lengths.",
        "Identifying these chains as topics is motivated by Falk’s investigations on historical events (Falk, 1989).",
        "A narrative begins as soon as the first story is encountered.",
        "Then the narrative is developed into one or more directions: simple events, like plane accidents might not have as many sub-plots as a political scandal, a war or economical crises.",
        "Then, at some point one could say the latest story is so different from the initial one that it is considered a first story for a new event.",
        "However, there could remain some sort of link that these two topics (narratives) are somehow relevant.",

        "On the contrary, appears closer to and thus it starts a new direction.",
        "Phase shows two stories, and outside the dashed ellipse.",
        "This represents a situation, where the vocabulary of the two expulsed documents is diverging from the rest of the documents, i.e., the inner cohesion of the topic is violated too much.",
        "The dotted ellipse represents the domain of possible topical shifts, i.e., stories that lead too far from the original topic.",
        "They are still regarded as part of the topic, but are on the brink of diverging from the topic and hence candidates for new first stories or seminal events.",
        "Finally, in phase the separation takes place: Three new documents, , and , are found similar to .",
        "As a result, document is separated into its own topic.",
        "Note that there is no follow-ups for , and therefore it is not cut off.",
        "The problem of text summarization is similar to detecting topical shifts: traces of all the main topics occurring in the given text need to be retained in the summarization.",
        "On the other hand, text segmentation shares some qualities with the topic shift detection.",
        "Lexical cohesion (Boguraev and Neff, 2000) has been employed in the task as well as in text segmentation (Stokes et al., 2002).",
