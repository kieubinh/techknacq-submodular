        "For example, the Cognitive Indexing representation for an Entity like Osama bin Laden contains pointers to all sentences in the data feed that mention him Fig 4, including spelling variation (i.e. Usama) and pronouns which refer to him.",
        "In future versions of the system, the Cognitive Indexing representation of Osama will include audio mentions of him as well as database entries for him.",
        "In addition to coreference, Cognitive Indexing supports standard key word lookup, relationship detection between entities and analyst authored classes of Entities."

        "Included are sentence excerpt summaries, tables of relationships between Entities and easy access to original source documents.",
        "There is also a redundant information filter on documents or sentences.",
        "ThreatTrackers allow analysts to create new categories of Entities like “Chemical Weapons Precursors “ for use inside ThreatTrackers.",
