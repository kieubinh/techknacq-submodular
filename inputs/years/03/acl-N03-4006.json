        "QCS is a software tool and development framework for efficient, organized, and streamlined IR from generic document sets.",
        "The system is designed to match a query to relevant documents, cluster the resulting subset of documents by topic, and produce a single summary for each topic.",
        "Using QCS for IR, the amount of redundant information presented to a user is reduced and the results are categorized by content.",
        "A survey of previous work using a combination of clustering and summarization to improve IR can be found in Radev et al.",
        "(2001b).",
        "Of existing IR systems employing this combination, QCS most resembles the NewsInEssence system (Radev et al., 2001a) in that both systems can produce multi-document summaries from document sets clustered by topic.",
        "However, NewsInEssence is designed for IR from HTML-linked document sets and QCS has been designed for IR from generic document sets.",
        "Furthermore, one of the most important aspects of QCS is its modularity, with the ability to plug in alternative implementations of query-based retrieval, document clustering, and summarization algorithms."

        "QCS employs a vector space model (Salton et al., 1975) to represent a set of documents.",
        "Choices for the term weighting currently include the following:",
        "• Local: term frequency, log, binary • Global: none, normal, idf, idf2, entropy • Normalization: none, normalized",
        "Detailed descriptions of each of these weighting factors as well as strategies for using each of these are presented by Dumais (1991) and Kolda and O’Leary (1998).",
        "The current computational methods used for retrieving a set of documents that best match a query, clustering a set of documents by topic, and creating a summary of multiple documents are as follows:",
        "• Querying: Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) • Clustering: spherical k-means • Summarization: a hidden Markov model (HMM) and pivoted QR",
        "Detailed descriptions of these methods presented in Deer-wester et al.",
        "(1990), Dhillon and Modha (2001), and Schlesinger et al.",
        "(2002), respectively.",
        "The interface to QCS (see Figure 1) consists of a collection of JavaTM 1 servlets which format input to and output from QCS via dynamic HTML documents.",
        "This approach allows all of the computation and formatting to take place on a JavaTM server, with the only requirement on the users’ systems being that of an HTML-enabled browser application (e.g., Netscape® 7.0 )."
