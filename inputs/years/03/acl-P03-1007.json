        "Subcategorization information is vital for successful parsing, however, manual development of large subcategorized lexicons has proved difficult because predicates change behaviour between sublanguages, domains and over time.",
        "Additionally, manually developed subcategorization lexicons do not provide the relative frequency of different sub categorization frames (SCFs) for a given predicate, essential in a probabilistic approach.",
        "Over the past years, several approaches have been proposed for automatic acquisition of sub-categorization from corpus data (e.g. (Briscoe This work was supported by UK EPSRC project GR/N36462/93: `Robust Accurate Statistical Parsing (RASP)'.",
        "and Carroll, 1997; Carroll et al., 1998; Sarkar and Zeman, 2000)).",
        "Although these approaches vary largely according to the methods used and the number of SCFs being extracted, they perform similarly.",
        "They mostly gather information about syntactic aspects of subcategorization and do not distinguish between various predicate senses.",
        "As no lexical/semantic information is typically exploited, system output is noisy and the accuracy of the resulting lexicons shows room for improvement.",
        "Recently, Korhonen (2002) has proposed a method which makes use of the predominant sense of a verb.",
        "Like the previous methods, this method also acquires sub categorization specific to a verb form rather than sense.",
        "However, it guides the acquisition process using back-off (i.e. probability) estimates based on the predominant sense of a verb in WordNet (Miller et al., 1990) (as determined by the frequency data in the associated SemCor corpus).",
        "These estimates help to correct the acquired SCF distribution and deal with sparse data.",
        "Where the sense is assigned correctly, significant improvement is reported in acquisition performance.)",
        "This result shows that for many verbs, there is some single predominating sense in corpus data which accounts for most of the verbs subcate-gorization behaviour and can therefore be usefully deployed to improve automatic acquisition.",
        "However, for many highly polysemous verbs, the 'On a set of 45 test verbs, the F-measure (Section 4.2.1) improves by 17 against the baseline method, which assumes no sense.",
        "distribution of senses in balanced corpus data tends to be flat rather than zipfian (Preiss et al., 2002).",
        "For this important group of medium and high frequency verbs, the predominant sense is not frequent enough for back-off estimates based on just this sense to yield maximum benefit.",
        "To improve the acquisition performance, we need to consider non-predominant senses as well.",
        "In addition, the assumption that the predominant sense is predictable, i.e. static across balanced corpora is questionable.",
        "While the good results obtained suggest that is often the case, the ultimate goal of automatic acquisition is to be able to produce domain specific lexicons.",
        "SCF frequencies have been shown to vary across corpus type (e.g. written vs. spoken language) and genre (e.g. financial vs. balanced text) and much of this variation is reported to be due to the effects of different corpus genres on verb sense and the effect of verb sense on subcatego-rization (Roland et al., 2000; Roland and Jurafsky, 2001).",
        "Due to a lack of large manually sense annotated corpora for each corpus type/genre, the variable predominant sense would be better determined using automatic word sense disambiguation (WSD).",
        "Such a system could also improve acquisition for verbs which do not have a clear predominant sense.",
        "A small-scale experiment with manually sense annotated data (i.e. 100% accurate WSD) has shown that it is possible to improve SCF acquisition of the `difficult' highly polysemous verbs by considering their non-predominating senses as well (Preiss and Korhonen, 2002).",
        "In this paper, a similar, but larger scale experiment is reported using a real WSD system.",
        "We introduce a new probabilistic combination WSD system, which produces probability distributions on senses, and we show that the system performs comparably on the SENSEVAL-2 English all-words task data (Palmer et al., 2002).",
        "Information from this system is incorporated in the sub categorization system using a novel method.",
        "Finally, an experiment is reported with 29 difficult verbs which shows that real WSD can be used to improve the accuracy of subcategorization acquisition.",
        "In Section 2 we introduce the basic subcatego-rization acquisition system and report the modifications made to the system to enable it to use WSD.",
        "Section 3 describes our probabilistic WSD system.",
        "Results and discussion are presented in Section 4 and conclusions are drawn in Section 5."

        "Building on the SCF acquisition framework of Briscoe and Carroll (1997), Korhonen (2002) has proposed a system which uses knowledge of verb semantics to guide the process of subcate-gorization acquisition.",
        "The system exploits the knowledge that semantically similar verbs are similar in terms of sub categorization.",
        "Levin (1993) has demonstrated that verb senses divide into semantic classes distinctive in terms of sub categorization.",
        "Korhonen (2002) shows that many verb forms also divide into such classes, according to their predominant sense.",
        "For instance, the verb form specific SCF distributions for fly and move correlate quite closely because the predominant senses of these verbs (according to the WordNet frequency data) are similar.",
        "They both belong to the Levin \"Motion verbs\".",
        "The system of Korhonen (2002) works by first identifying the sense, i.e. the semantic class for a predicate.",
        "The semantic classes are based on Levin classes (Levin, 1993); mostly on broad classes (e.g. 51.",
        "\"Motion verbs\") rather than subclasses (e.g. 51.2 \"Leave verbs\").3 Verbs are classified according to their predominant sense in WordNet.",
        "This is done using a mapping which links WordNet synsets with Levin classes.4 After the semantic class is identified, the system of Briscoe and Carroll (1997) is used to acquire a putative SCF distribution from corpus data.",
        "This system employs a robust statistical",
        "parser (Briscoe and Carroll, 2002) and a comprehensive classifier which is capable of distinguishing 163 verbal SCFs – a superset of those found in the ANLT (Boguraev and Briscoe, 1987) and COMLEX Syntax dictionaries (Grishman et al., 1994).",
        "The SCF distribution is smoothed using the probability (i.e. \"back-off') estimates of the semantic class of the verb.",
        "The smoothing method is linear interpolation (e.g. (Manning and Schiitze, 1999)).",
        "The back-off estimates are obtained using the following method:",
        "(i) 4-5 representative verbs are chosen from a verb class.5 (ii) SCF distributions are built for these verbs by manually analysing c. 300 occurrences of each verb in the British National Corpus (BNC) (Leech, 1992).",
        "(iii) The resulting SCF distributions are merged, giving equal weight to each distribution.",
        "The back-off estimates for the \"Motion verb\" fly, for example, are constructed by merging the SCF distributions for 5 other \"Motion verbs\" e.g. move, slide, arrive, travel, and sail.",
        "As a final step, a simple empirically determined threshold is used on the probability estimates after smoothing to filter out noisy SCFs."
