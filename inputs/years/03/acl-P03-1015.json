        "The simplest method to evaluate a parser is to count the parse trees it gets correct.",
        "This measure is, however, not very informative since most applications do not require one hundred percent correct parse trees.",
        "Thus, an important question in parser evaluation is how to break down parsing results.",
        "In the PARSEVAL evaluation scheme (Black et al., 1991), partially correct parses are gauged by the number of nodes they produce and have in common with the gold standard (measured in precision and recall).",
        "Another figure (crossing brackets) only counts those incorrect nodes that change the partial order induced by the tree.",
        "A problematic aspect of the PARSEVAL approach is that the weight given to particular constructions is again grammar-specific, since some grammars may need more nodes to describe them than others.",
        "Further, the approach does not pay sufficient heed to the fact that parsing decisions are often intricately twisted: One wrong decision may produce a whole series of other wrong decisions.",
        "Both these problems are circumvented when parsing results are evaluated on a more abstract level, viz. dependency structure (Lin, 1995).",
        "Dependency structure generally follows predicate-argument structure, but departs from it in that the basic building blocks are words rather than predicates.",
        "In terms of parser evaluation, the first property guarantees independence of decisions (every link is relevant also for the interpretation level), while the second property makes for a better empirical justification.",
        "for evaluation units.",
        "Dependency structure can be modelled by a directed acylic graph, with word tokens at the nodes.",
        "In labelled dependency structure, the links are furthermore classified into a certain set of grammatical roles.",
        "Dependency can be easily determined from constituent structure if in every phrase structure rule a constituent is singled out as the head (Gaifman, 1965).",
        "To derive a labelled dependency structure, all non-head constituents in a rule must be labelled with the grammatical role that links their head tokens to the head token of the head constituent.",
        "There are two cases where the divergence between predicates and word tokens makes trouble: (1) predicates expressed by more than one token, and (2) predicates expressed by no token (as they occur in ellipsis).",
        "Case 1 frequently occurs within the verb complex (of both English and German).",
        "The solution proposed in the literature (Black et al., 1991; Lin, 1995; Carroll et al., 1998; Kübler and Telljo-hann, 2002) is to define a normal form for dependency structure, where every adjunct or argument attaches to some distinguished part of the verb complex.",
        "The underlying assumption is that those cases where scope decisions in the verb complex are semantically relevant (e.g. with modal verbs) are not resolvable in syntax anyway.",
        "There is no generally accepted solution for case 2 (ellipsis).",
        "Most authors in the evaluation literature neglect it, perhaps due to its infrequency (in the NEGRA corpus, ellipsis only occurs in 1.2% of all dependency relations).",
        "Robinson (1970, 280) proposes to promote one of the dependents (preferably an obligatory one) (1a) or even all dependents (1b) to head status.",
        "(1) a. the very brave b. John likes tea and Harry coffee.",
        "A more sweeping solution to these problems is to abandon dependency structure at all and directly go for predicate-argument structure (Carroll et al., 1998).",
        "But as we argued above, moving to a more theoretical level is detrimental to comparability across grammatical frameworks."

        "According to the dependency structure approach to evaluation, the task of the parser is to find the correct dependency structure for a string, i.e. to associate every word token with pairs of head token and grammatical role or else to designate it as independent.",
        "To make the learning task easier, the number of classes should be reduced as much as possible.",
        "For one, the task could be simplified by focusing on unlabelled dependency structure (measured in “unlabelled” precision and recall (Eisner, 1996; Lin, 1995)), which is, however, in general not sufficient for further semantic processing."

        "Another possibility for reduction is to associate every word with at most one pair of head token and grammatical role, i.e. to only look at dependency trees rather than graphs.",
        "There is one case where the tree property cannot easily be maintained: coordination.",
        "Conceptually, all the conjuncts are head constituents in coordination, since the conjunction could be missing, and selectional restrictions work on the individual conjuncts (2).",
        "(2) John ate (fish and chips |*wish and ships).",
        "But if another word depends on the conjoined heads (see (4a)), the tree property is violated.",
        "A way out of the dilemma is to select a specific conjunct as modification site (Lin, 1995; Kübler and Telljohann, 2002).",
        "But unless care is taken, semantically vital information is lost in the process: Example (4) shows two readings which should be distinguished in dependency structure.",
        "A comparison of the two readings shows that if either the first conjunct or the last conjunct is unconditionally selected certain readings become undistinguishable.",
        "Rather, in order to distinguish a maximum number of readings, pre-modifiers must attach to the last conjunct and post-modifiers and coordinating conjunctions to the first conjunct2.",
        "The fact that the modifier refers to a conjunction rather than to the conjunct is recorded in the grammatical role (by adding c to it).",
        "Other constructions contradicting the tree property are arguably better treated in the lexicon anyway (e.g. control verbs (Carroll et al., 1998)) or could be solved by enriching the repertory of grammatical roles (e.g. relative clauses with null relative pronouns could be treated by adding the dependency relation between head verb and missing element to the one between head verb and modified noun).",
        "In a number of linguistic phenomena, dependency theorists disagree on which constituent should be chosen as the head.",
        "A case in point are PPs.",
        "Few grammars distinguish between adjunct and subcate-gorized PPs at the level of prepositions.",
        "In predicate-argument structure, however, the embedded NP is in one case related to the preposition, in the other to the subcategorizing verb.",
        "Accordingly, some approaches take the preposition to be the head of a PP (Robinson, 1970; Lin, 1995), others the NP (Kübler and Telljohann, 2002).",
        "Still other approaches (Tes-nière, 1959; Carroll et al., 1998) conflate verb, preposition and head noun into a triple, and thus only count content words in the evaluation.",
        "For learning, the matter can be resolved empirically:",
        "2Even in this setting some readings cannot be distinguished (see e.g. (3) where a conjunction of three modifiers would be retrieved).",
        "Nevertheless, the proposed scheme fails in only 0.0017% of all dependency tuples.",
        "(3) In New York, we never meet, but in Boston.",
        "Note that by this move we favor interpretability over proj ectiv-ity, but example (4a) is non-projective from the start.",

        "The paper has presented two approaches to German parsing (n-gram based machine learning and cascaded finite-state parsing), and evaluated them on the basis of a large amount of data.",
        "A new representation format has been introduced that allows underspecification of select types of syntactic ambiguity (attachment and subcategorization) even in the absence of a full-fledged chart.",
        "Several methods have been discussed for combining the two approaches.",
        "It has been shown that while combination with the shallow approach can only marginally improve performance of the cascaded parser if ideal disambiguation is assumed, a quite substantial rise is registered in situations closer to the real world where POS tagging is deficient and resolution of attachment and subcategorization ambiguities less than perfect.",
        "In ongoing work, we look at integrating a statistic context-free parser called BitPar, which was written by Helmut Schmid and achieves .816 F-score on NEGRA.",
        "Interestingly, the performance goes up to .9474 F-score when BitPar is combined with the FS parser (upper bound) and .9443 for the lower bound.",
        "So at least for German, combining parsers seems to be a pretty good idea.",
        "Thanks are due to Helmut Schmid and Prof. C. Rohrer for discussions, and to the reviewers for their detailed comments."
