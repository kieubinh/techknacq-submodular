        "Vector-based models of word co-occurrence have proved a useful representational framework for a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as word sense discrimination (Schütze, 1998), text segmentation (Choi et al., 2001), contextual spelling correction (Jones and Martin, 1997), automatic thesaurus extraction (Grefenstette, 1994), and notably information retrieval (Salton et al., 1975).",
        "Vector-based representations of lexical meaning have been also popular in cognitive science and figure prominently in a variety of modelling studies ranging from similarity judgements (McDonald, 2000) to semantic priming (Lund and Burgess, 1996; Lowe and McDonald, 2000) and text comprehension (Landauer and Dumais, 1997).",
        "In this approach semantic information is extracted from large bodies of text under the assumption that the context surrounding a given word provides important information about its meaning.",
        "The semantic properties of words are represented by vectors that are constructed from the observed distributional patterns of co-occurrence of their neighbouring words.",
        "Co-occurrence information is typically collected in a frequency matrix, where each row corresponds to a unique target word and each column represents its linguistic context.",
        "Contexts are defined as a small number of words surrounding the target word (Lund and Burgess, 1996; Lowe and McDonald, 2000) or as entire paragraphs, even documents (Landauer and Dumais, 1997).",
        "Context is typically treated as a set of unordered words, although in some cases syntactic information is taken into account (Lin, 1998; Grefenstette, 1994; Lee, 1999).",
        "A word can be thus viewed as a point in an n-dimensional semantic space.",
        "The semantic similarity between words can be then mathematically computed by measuring the distance between points in the semantic space using a metric such as cosine or Euclidean distance.",
        "In the variants of vector-based models where no linguistic knowledge is used, differences among parts of speech for the same word (e.g., to drink vs. a drink) are not taken into account in the construction of the semantic space, although in some cases word lexemes are used rather than word surface forms (Lowe and McDonald, 2000; McDonald, 2000).",
        "Minimal assumptions are made with respect to syntactic dependencies among words.",
        "In fact it is assumed that all context words within a certain distance from the target word are semantically relevant.",
        "The lack of syntactic information makes the building of semantic space models relatively straightforward and language independent (all that is needed is a corpus of written or spoken text).",
        "However, this entails that contextual information contributes indiscriminately to a word’s meaning.",
        "Some studies have tried to incorporate syntactic information into vector-based models.",
        "In this view, the semantic space is constructed from words that bear a syntactic relationship to the target word of interest.",
        "This makes semantic spaces more flexible, different types of contexts can be selected and words do not have to physically co-occur to be considered contextually relevant.",
        "However, existing models either concentrate on specific relations for constructing the semantic space such as objects (e.g., Lee, 1999) or collapse all types of syntactic relations available for a given target word (Grefenstette, 1994; Lin, 1998).",
        "Although syntactic information is now used to select a word’s appropriate contexts, this information is not explicitly captured in the contexts themselves (which are still represented by words) and is therefore not amenable to further processing.",
        "A commonly raised criticism for both types of semantic space models (i.e., word-based and syntax-based) concerns the notion of semantic similarity.",
        "Proximity between two words in the semantic space cannot indicate the nature of the lexical relations between them.",
        "Distributionally similar words can be antonyms, synonyms, hyponyms or in some cases semantically unrelated.",
        "This limits the application of semantic space models for NLP tasks which require distinguishing between lexical relations.",
        "In this paper we generalise semantic space models by proposing a flexible conceptualisation of context which is parametrisable in terms of syntactic relations.",
        "We develop a general framework for vector-based models which can be optimised for different tasks.",
        "Our framework allows the construction of semantic space to take place over words or syntactic relations thus bridging the distance between word-based and syntax-based models.",
        "Furthermore, we show how our model can incorporate well-defined, informative contexts in a principled way which retains information about the syntactic relations available for a given target word.",
        "We first evaluate our model on semantic priming, a phenomenon that has received much attention in computational psycholinguistics and is typically modelled using word-based semantic spaces.",
        "We next conduct a study that shows that our model is sensitive to different types of lexical relations."

        "The pairwise comparisons for model 7 are given in Table 3.",
        "The mean distances for conceptual associates (CA), phrasal associates (PA), super-ordinates/subordinates (SUP), category coordinates (CO), antonyms (ANT), and synonyms (SYN) are also shown in Table 3.",
        "There is no significant difference between PA and CA, although SUP, CO, ANT, and SYN, are all significantly different from CA (see Table 3, where x indicates statistical significance, a= .05).",
        "Furthermore, ANT and SYN are signifi - cantly different from PA. Kilgarriff and Yallop (2000) point out that manually constructed taxonomies or thesauri are typically organised according to synonymy and hyponymy for nouns and verbs and antonymy for adjectives.",
        "They further argue that for automatically constructed thesauri similar words are words that either co-occur with each other or with the same words.",
        "The relations SYN, SUP, CO, and ANT can be thought of as representing taxonomy-related knowledge, whereas CA and PA correspond to the word clusters found in automatically constructed thesauri.",
        "In fact an ANOVA reveals that the distinction between these two classes of relations can be made reliably (F(1,136) = 15.347, p < .001), after collapsing SYN, SUP, CO, and ANT into one class and CA and PA into another.",
        "Our results suggest that dependency-based vector space models can, at least to a certain degree, distinguish among different types of lexical relations, while this seems to be more difficult for traditional semantic space models.",
        "The Tukey test revealed that category coordination is reliably distinguished from all other relations and that phrasal association is reliably different from antonymy and synonymy.",
        "Taxonomy related relations (e.g., synonymy, antonymy, hyponymy) can be reliably distinguished from conceptual and phrasal association.",
        "However, no reliable differences were found between closely associated relations such as antonymy and synonymy.",
        "Our results further indicate that context encoding plays an important role in discriminating lexical relations.",
        "As in Experiment 1 our best results were obtained with the wide context specification.",
        "Also, weighting schemes such as the obliqueness hierarchy length again decreased the model’s performance (see conditions 2, 5, 9, and 13 in Figure 4), showing that dependency relations contribute equally to the representation of a word’s meaning.",
        "This points to the fact that rich context encodings with a wide range of dependency relations are promising for capturing lexical semantic distinctions.",
        "However, the Hodgson skew divergence performance for maximum context specification was lower, which indicates that collapsing all dependency relations is not the optimal method, at least for the tasks attempted here."

        "In this paper we presented a novel semantic space model that enriches traditional vector-based models with syntactic information.",
        "The model is highly general and can be optimised for different tasks.",
        "It extends prior work on syntax-based models (Grefenstette, 1994; Lin, 1998), by providing a general framework for defining context so that a large number of syntactic relations can be used in the construction of the semantic space.",
        "Our approach differs from Lin (1998) in three important ways: (a) by introducing dependency paths we can capture non-immediate relationships between words (i.e., between subjects and objects), whereas Lin considers only local context (dependency edges in our terminology); the semantic space is therefore constructed solely from isolated head/modifier pairs and their interdependencies are not taken into account; (b) Lin creates the semantic space from the set of dependency edges that are relevant for a given word; by introducing dependency labels and the path value function we can selectively weight the importance of different labels (e.g., subject, object, modifier) and parametrize the space accordingly for different tasks; (c) considerable flexibility is allowed in our formulation for selecting the dimensions of the semantic space; the latter can be words (see the leaves in Figure 1), parts of speech or dependency edges; in Lin’s approach, it is only dependency edges (features in his terminology) that form the dimensions of the semantic space.",
