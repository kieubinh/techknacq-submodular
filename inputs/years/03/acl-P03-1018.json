        "Vector spaces enjoy widespread use in information retrieval (Salton and McGill, 1983; Baeza-Yates and",
        "Ribiero-Neto, 1999), and from this original application vector models have been applied to semantic tasks such as word-sense acquisition (Landauer and Dumais, 1997; Widdows, 2003) and disambiguation (Sch¨utze, 1998).",
        "One benefit of these models is that the similarity between pairs of terms or between queries and documents is a continuous function, automatically ranking results rather than giving just a YES/NO judgment.",
        "In addition, vector models can be freely built from unlabelled text and so are both entirely unsupervised, and an accurate reflection of the way words are used in practice.",
        "In vector models, terms are usually combined to form more complicated query statements by (weighted) vector addition.",
        "Because vector addition is commutative, terms are combined in a “bag of words” fashion.",
        "While this has proved to be effective, it certainly leaves room for improvement: any genuine natural language understanding of query statements cannot rely solely on commutative addition for building more complicated expressions out of primitives.",
        "Other algebraic systems such as Boolean logic and set theory have well-known operations for building composite expressions out of more basic ones.",
        "Set-theoretic models for the logical connectives ‘AND’, ‘NOT’ and ‘OR’ are completely understood by most researchers, and used by Boolean IR systems for assembling the results to complicated queries.",
        "It is clearly desirable to develop a calculus which combines the flexible ranking of results in a vector model with the crisp efficiency of Boolean logic, a goal which has long been recognised (Salton et al., 1983) and attempted mainly for conjunction and disjunction.",
        "This paper proposes such a scheme for negation, based upon well-known linear algebra, and which also implies a vector form of disjunction.",
        "It turns out that these vector connectives are precisely those used in quantum logic (Birkhoff and von Neumann, 1936), a development which is discussed in much more detail in (Widdows and Peters, 2003).",
        "Because of its simplicity, our model is easy to understand and to implement.",
        "Vector negation is based on the intuition that unrelated meanings should be orthogonal to one another, which is to say that they should have no features in common at all.",
        "Thus vector negation generates a ‘meaning vector’ which is completely orthogonal to the negated term.",
        "Document retrieval experiments demonstrate that vector negation is not only effective at removing unwanted terms: it is also more effective than other methods at removing their synonyms and related terms.",
        "This justifies the claim that, by producing a single query vector for “a NOT b”, we remove not only unwanted strings but also unwanted meanings.",
        "We describe the underlying motivation behind this model and define the vector negation and disjunction operations in Section 2.",
        "In Section 3 we review other ways negation is implemented in Information Retrieval, comparing and contrasting with vector negation.",
        "In Section 4 we describe experiments demonstrating the benefits and drawbacks of vector negation compared with two other methods for negation.",
        "2 Negation and Disjunction in Vector Spaces In this section we use well-known linear algebra to define vector negation in terms of orthogonality and disjunction as the linear sum of subspaces.",
        "The mathematical apparatus is covered in greater detail in (Widdows and Peters, 2003).",
        "If A is a set (in some universe of discourse U), then ‘NOT A’ corresponds to the complement Al of the set A in U (by definition).",
        "By a simple analogy, let A be a vector subspace of a vector space V (equipped with a scalar product).",
        "Then the concept ‘NOT A’ should correspond to the orthogonal complement Al of A under the scalar product (Birkhoff and von Neumann, 1936, §6).",
        "If we think of a basis for V as a set of features, this says that ‘NOT A’ refers to the subspace of V which has no features in common with A.",
        "We make the following definitions.",
        "Let V be a (real) vector space equipped with a scalar product.",
        "We will use the notation A ≤ V to mean “A is a vector subspace of V.” For A ≤ V, define the orthogonal subspace Al to be the subspace Al≡{v∈V:∀a∈A,a·v=0}.",
        "For the purposes of modelling word-meanings, we might think of ‘orthogonal’ as a model for ‘completely unrelated’ (having similarity score zero).",
        "This makes perfect sense for information retrieval, where we assume (for example) that if two words never occur in the same document then they have no features in common.",
        "Definition 1 Let a, b ∈ V and A, B ≤ V .",
        "By NOT A we mean Al and by NOT a, we mean (a)1, where (a) = {λa : λ ∈ R} is the 1-dimensional subspace subspace generated by a.",
        "By a NOT B we mean the projection of a onto B1 and by a NOT b we mean the projection of a onto (b)1.",
        "We now show how to use these notions to perform calculations with individual term or query vectors in a form which is simple to program and efficient to run.",
        "Theorem 1 Let a, b ∈ V. Then a NOT b is represented by the vector a NOTb≡ a − a bb.",
        "where |b|2 = b · b is the modulus of b.",
        "Proof.",
        "A simple proof is given in (Widdows and ters, 2003).",
        "For normalised vectors, Theorem 1 takes the particularly simple form",
        "which in practice is then renormalised for consistency.",
        "One computational benefit is that Theorem 1 gives a single vector for a NOT b, so finding the similarity between any other vector and a NOT b is just a single scalar product computation.",
        "Disjunction is also simple to envisage, the expression b1 OR ... OR bn being modelled by the subspace B={λ1b1+...+λnbn: λi ∈R}.",
        "Theoretical motivation for this formulation can be found in (Birkhoff and von Neumann, 1936, §1,§6) and (Widdows and Peters, 2003): for example, B is the smallest subspace of V which contains the set {bj }.",
        "Computing the similarity between a vector a and this subspace B is computationally more expensive than for the negation of Theorem 1, because the scalar product of a with (up to) n vectors in an orthogonal basis for B must be computed.",
        "Thus the gain we get by comparing each document with the query a NOT b using only one scalar product operation is absent for disjunction.",
        "However, this benefit is regained in the case of negated disjunction.",
        "Suppose we negate not only one argument but several.",
        "If a user specifies that they want documents related to a but not b1,b2,...,bn, then (unless otherwise stated) it is clear that they only want documents related to none of the unwanted terms bi (rather than, say, the average of these terms).",
        "This motivates a process which can be thought of as a vector formulation of the classical de Morgan equivalence ∼ a∧ ∼ b ≡∼ (a ∨ b), by which the expression a AND NOT b1 AND NOT b2 ... AND NOT bn is translated to a NOT (b1 OR ... OR bn).",
        "(2) Using Definition 1, this expression can be modelled with a unique vector which is orthogonal to all of the unwanted arguments {b1}.",
        "However, unless the vectors b1, ... , bn are orthogonal (or identical), we need to obtain an orthogonal basis for the subspace b1 OR ... OR bn before we can implement a higher-dimensional version of Theorem 1.",
        "This is because the projection operators involved are in general non-commutative, one of the hallmark differences between Boolean and quantum logic.",
        "In this way vector negation generates a meaning-vector which takes into account the similarities and differences between the negative terms.",
        "A query for chip NOT computer, silicon is treated differently from a query for chip NOT computer, potato.",
        "Vector negation is capable of realising that for the first query, the two negative terms are referring to the same general topic area, but in the second case the task is to remove radically different meanings from the query.",
        "This technique has been used to remove several meanings from a query iteratively, allowing a user to ‘home in on’ the desired meaning by systematically pruning away unwanted features.",
        "2.1 Initial experiments modelling word-senses Our first experiments with vector negation were to determine whether the negation operator could find different senses of ambiguous words by negating a word closely related to one of the meanings.",
        "A vector space model was built using Latent Semantic Analysis, similar to the systems of (Landauer and Dumais, 1997; Sch¨utze, 1998).",
        "The effect of LSA is to increase linear dependency between terms, and for this reason it is likely that LSA is a crucial step in our approach.",
        "Terms were indexed depending on their co-occurrence with 1000 frequent “content-bearing words” in a 15 word context-window, giving each term 1000 coordinates.",
        "This was reduced to 100 dimensions using singular value decomposition.",
        "Later on, document vectors were assigned in the usual manner by summation of term vectors using tf-idf weighting (Salton and McGill, 1983, p. 121).",
        "Vectors were normalised, so that the standard (Euclidean) scalar product and cosine similarity coincided.",
        "This scalar product was used as a measure of term-term and term-document similarity throughout our experiments.",
        "This method was used because it has been found to be effective at producing good term-term similarities for word-sense disambiguation (Sch¨utze, 1998) and automatic lexical acquisition (Widdows, 2003), and these similarities were used to generate interesting queries and to judge the effectiveness of different forms of negation.",

        "More formally, let D be the document collection and let Di C D be the subset of documents containing the term i.",
        "Then the results to the Boolean query for a NOT b would be the set Da nDb, where D�b is the complement of Db in D. Variants of this are used within a vector model, by using vector retrieval to retrieve a (ranked) set of relevant documents and then ‘throwing away’ documents containing the unwanted terms (Salton and McGill, 1983, p. 26).",
        "This paper will refer to such methods under the general heading of ‘post-retrieval filtering’.",
        "There are at least three reasons for preferring vector negation to post-retrieval filtering.",
        "Firstly, post-retrieval filtering is not very principled and is subject to error: for example, it would remove a long document containing only one instance of the unwanted term.",
        "One might argue here that if a document containing unwanted terms is given a ‘negative-score’ rather than just disqualified, this problem is avoided.",
        "This would leaves us considering a combined score, sim(d,a NOT b) =d•a – λd•b for some parameter λ.",

        "Thus a second benefit for vector negation is that it produces a combined vector for a NOT b which enables the relevance score of each document to be computed using just one scalar product operation.",
        "The third gain is that vector retrieval proves to be better at removing not only an unwanted term but also its synonyms and related words (see Section 4), which is clearly desirable if we wish to remove not only a string of characters but the meaning represented by this string."

        "Because it associates a unique vector to each query statement involving negation, the similarity between each document and the query can be calculated using just one scalar product computation, a considerable gain in efficiency over methods which involve some form of post-retrieval filtering.",
        "We hope that these preliminary aspects will be initial gains in developing a concrete and effective system for learning, representing and composing aspects of lexical meaning."
