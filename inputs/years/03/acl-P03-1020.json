        "We want to enhance the quality of such sources in order to produce better rule-based systems and sharper statistical models.",
        "This paper focuses on truecasing, which is the process of restoring case information to raw text.",
        "Besides text rEaDaBILiTY, truecasing enhances the quality of case-carrying data, brings into the picture new corpora originally considered too noisy for various NLP tasks, and performs case normalization across styles, sources, and genres.",

        "The case-carrying alternative “US Rep. James Pond showed up riding an IT and going to a NOW meeting” is arguably better fit to be subjected to further processing.",
        "Broadcast news transcripts contain casing errors which reduce the performance of tasks such as named entity tagging.",
        "Automatic speech recognition produces non-cased text.",
        "Headlines, teasers, section headers - which carry high information content - are not properly cased for tasks such as question answering.",
        "Truecasing is an essential step in transforming these types of data into cleaner sources to be used by NLP applications.",
        "“the president” and “the President” are two viable surface forms that correctly convey the same information in the same context.",
        "Such discrepancies are usually due to differences in news source, authors, and stylistic choices.",
        "Truecasing can be used as a normalization tool across corpora in order to produce consistent, context sensitive, case information; it consistently reduces expressions to their statistical canonical form.",
        "In this paper, we attempt to show the benefits of truecasing in general as a valuable building block for NLP applications rather than promoting a specific implementation.",
        "We explore several truecasing issues and propose a statistical, language modeling based truecaser, showing its performance on news articles.",
        "Then, we present a straight forward application of truecasing on machine translation output.",

        "They also observe that real world problems generally exhibit around 90% case restoration accuracy.",
        "(Mikheev, 1999) also approaches casing disambiguation but models only instances when capitalization is expected: first word in a sentence, after a period, and after quotes.",
        "(Chieu and Ng, 2002) attempted to extract named entities from non-cased text by using a weaker classifier but without focusing on regular text or case restoration.",
        "Accents can be viewed as additional surface forms or alternate word casings.",

        "We have discussed truecasing, the process of restoring case information to badly-cased or non-cased text, and we have proposed a statistical, language modeling based truecaser which has an agreement of – 98% with professionally written news articles.",
        "Although its most direct impact is improving legibility, truecasing is useful in case normalization across styles, genres, and sources.",
        "Truecasing is a valuable component in further natural language processing.",
        "Task based evaluation shows a 26% F-measure improvement in named entity recognition when using truecasing.",
        "In the context of automatic content extraction, mention detection on automatic speech recognition text is improved by a factor of 8.",
        "Truecasing also enhances machine translation output legibility and yields a BLEU score improvement of 80.2% over the original system."
