        "The explosive growth of online texts written in natural language has prompted much research into information extraction (IE), the task of automatically extracting specific information items of interest from natural language texts.",
        "The extracted information is used to fill database records, also known as templates in the IE literature.",
        "Research efforts on IE tackle a variety of tasks.",
        "They include extracting information from semi-structured texts, such as seminar announcements, rental and job advertisements, etc., as well as from free texts, such as newspaper articles (Soderland, 1999).",
        "IE from semi-structured texts is easier than from free texts, since the layout and format of a semi-structured text provide additional useful clues to aid in extraction.",
        "Several benchmark data sets have been used to evaluate IE approaches on semi-structured texts (Soderland, 1999; Ciravegna, 2001; Chieu and Ng, 2002a).",
        "For the task of extracting information from free texts, a series of Message Understanding Conferences (MUC) provided benchmark data sets for evaluation.",
        "Several subtasks for IE from free texts have been identified.",
        "The named entity (NE) task extracts person names, organization names, location names, etc.",
        "The template element (TE) task extracts information centered around an entity, like the acronym, category, and location of a company.",
        "The template relation (TR) task extracts relations between entities.",
        "Finally, the full-scale IE task, the scenario template (ST) task, deals with extracting generic information items from free texts.",
        "To tackle the full ST task, an IE system needs to merge information from multiple sentences in general, since the information needed to fill one template can come from multiple sentences, and thus discourse processing is needed.",
        "The full-scale ST task is considerably harder than all the other IE tasks or subtasks outlined above.",
        "As is the case with many other natural language processing (NLP) tasks, there are two main approaches to IE, namely the knowledge-engineering approach and the learning approach.",
        "Most early IE systems adopted the knowledge-engineering ap-and Ng, 2002a), since we need to deal with merging information from multiple sentences to fill one template.",
        "We evaluated our learning approach on the MUC-4 task of extracting terrorist events from free texts.",
        "We chose the MUC-4 task since manually prepared templates required for training are available.1 When trained and tested on the official benchmark data of MUC-4, our learning approach achieves accuracy competitive with the best MUC-4 systems, which were all built using manually engineered rules.",

        "proach, where manually engineered rules were used for IE.",
        "More recently, machine learning approaches have been used for IE from semi-structured texts (Califf and Mooney, 1999; Soderland, 1999; Roth and Yih, 2001; Ciravegna, 2001; Chieu and Ng, 2002a), named entity extraction (Chieu and Ng, 2002b), template element extraction, and template relation extraction (Miller et al., 1998).",
        "These machine learning approaches have been successful for these tasks, achieving accuracy comparable to the knowledge-engineering approach.",
        "However, for the full-scale ST task of generic IE from free texts, the best reported method to date is still the knowledge-engineering approach.",
        "For example, almost all participating IE systems in MUC used the knowledge-engineering approach for the full-scale ST task.",
        "The one notable exception is the work of UMass at MUC-6 (Fisher et al., 1995).",
        "Unfortunately, their learning approach did considerably worse than the best MUC-6 systems.",
        "Soderland (1999) and Chieu and Ng (2002a) attempted machine learning approaches for a scaled-down version of the ST task, where it was assumed that the information needed to fill one template came from one sentence only.",
        "In this paper, we present a learning approach to the full-scale ST task of extracting information from free texts.",
        "The task we tackle is considerably more complex than that of (Soderland, 1999; Chieu The task addressed in this paper is the Scenario Template (ST) task defined in the Fourth Message Understanding Conference (MUC-4).2 The objective of this task is to extract information on terrorist events occurring in Latin American countries from free text documents.",
        "For example, given the input document in Figure 1, an IE system is to extract information items related to any terrorist events to fill zero or more database records, or templates.",
        "Each distinct terrorist event is to fill one template.",
        "An example of an output template is shown in Figure 2.",
        "Each of the 25 fields in the template is called a slot, and the string or value that fills a slot is called a slotfill.",
        "Different slots in the MUC-4 template need to be treated differently.",
        "Besides slot 0 (MESSAGE: ID) and slot 1 (MESSAGE: TEMPLATE), the other 23 slots have to be extracted or inferred from the text document.",
        "These slots can be divided into the following categories: String Slots.",
        "These slots are filled using strings extracted directly from the text document (slot 6, 9, 10, 12, 18, 19).",
        "Text Conversion Slots.",
        "These slots have to be inferred from strings in the document (slot 2, 14, 17, 21, 24).",

        "In the training phase, each input training document is first preprocessed through a chain of preprocessing modules.",
        "The outcome of the preprocessing is a full parse tree for each sentence, and corefer-ence chains linking various coreferring noun phrases both within and across sentences.",
        "The core of ALICE uses supervised learning to build one classifier for each string slot.",
        "The candidates to fill a template slot are base (non-recursive) noun phrases.",
        "A noun phrase np that occurs in a training document d and fills a template slot s is used to generate one positive training example for the classifier of slot s. Other noun phrases in the training document d are negative training examples for the classifier of slot s. The features of a training example generated from np are the verbs and other noun phrases (serving roles like agent and patient) related to np in the same sentence, as well as similar features for coreferring noun phrases of np.",
        "Thus, our features for a template slot classifier encode semantic (agent and patient roles) and discourse (coreference) information.",
        "Our experimental results in this paper demonstrate that such features are effective in learning what to fill a template slot.",
        "During testing, a new document is preprocessed through the same chain of preprocessing modules.",
        "Each candidate noun phrase np generates one test example, and it is presented to the classifier of a template slot s to determine whether np fills the slot s. A separate template manager decides whether a new template should be created to include slot s, or slot s should fill the existing template."

        "While a machine learning approach is used in (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2000) to determine general semantic roles, we used a simple rule-based traversal of the parse tree instead, which could also reliably determine the generic agent and patient role of a sentence, and this suffices for our current purpose.",

        "Thus, ALICE currently uses all occurrences of “OQUELI COLINDRES” as positive training examples, which introduces noise in the training data.",
        "We believe that annotating the string occurrences in training documents will provide higher quality training data for the learning approach and hence further improve accuracy.",
        "Although part-of-speech taggers often boast of accuracy over 95%, the errors they make can be fatal to the parsing of sentences.",
        "For example, they often tend to confuse “VBN” with “VBD”, which could change the entire parse tree.",
        "The MUC-4 corpus was provided as uppercase text, and this also has a negative impact on the named entity recognizer and part-of-speech tagger, which both make use of case information.",
        "Learning approaches have been shown to perform on par or even outperform knowledge-engineering approaches in many NLP tasks.",
        "However, the full-scale scenario template IE task was still dominated by knowledge-engineering approaches.",
        "In this paper, we demonstrate that using both state-of-art learning algorithms and full parsing, learning approaches can rival knowledge-engineering ones, bringing us a step closer to building full-scale IE systems in a domain-independent fashion with state-of-the-art accuracy."
