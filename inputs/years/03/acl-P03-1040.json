        "We present work that successfully defines a subtask of machine translation: the translation of noun phrases.",
        "We demonstrate through analysis and experiments that it is feasible and beneficial to treat noun phrase translation as a subtask.",
        "This opens the path to dedicated modeling of other types of syntactic constructs, e.g., verb clauses, where issues of subcategorization of the verb play a big role.",
        "Focusing on a narrower problem allows not only more dedicated modeling, but also the use of computationally more expensive methods.",
        "We go on to tackle the task of noun phrase translation in a maximum entropy reranking framework.",
        "Treating translation as a reranking problem instead of as a search problem enables us to use features over the full translation pair.",
        "We integrate both empirical and symbolic knowledge sources as features into our system which outperforms the best known methods in statistical machine translation.",
        "Previous work on defining subtasks within statistical machine translation has been performed on, e.g., noun-noun pair (Cao and Li, 2002) and named entity translation (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002)."

        "We have shown that noun phrase translation can be separated out as a subtask.",
        "Our manual experiments show that NP/PPs can almost always be translated as NP/PPs across many languages, and that the translation of NP/PPs usually does not require additional external context.",
        "We also demonstrated that the reduced complexity of noun phrase translation allows us to address the problem in a maximum entropy reranking framework, where we only consider the 100-best candidates of a base translation system.",
        "This enables us to introduce any features that can be computed over a full translation pair, instead of being limited to features that can be integrated into the search algorithm of the decoder, which only has access to partial translations.",
        "We improved performance of noun phrase translation by 12.3 % by using a phrase translation model, a maximum entropy reranking method and addressing specific properties of noun phrase translation: compound splitting, using the web as a language model, and syntactic features.",
        "We showed not only improvement on NP/PP translation over best known methods, but also improved overall sentence translation quality.",
        "Our long term goal is to address additional syntactic constructs in a similarly dedicated fashion.",
        "The next step would be verb clauses, where modeling of the subcategorization of the verb is important."
