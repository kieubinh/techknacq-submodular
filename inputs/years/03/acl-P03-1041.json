        "Statistical Machine Translation defines the task of translating a source language sentence (s = sl • • • sI) into a target language sentence (t = ti • • • t J) .",
        "The traditional framework presented in (Brown et al., 1993) assumes a generative process where the source sentence is passed through a noisy stochastic process to produce the target sentence.",
        "The task can be formally stated as finding the t s.t t = argmax p(tls) where the search component is commonly referred to as the decoding step (Wang and Waibel, 1998).",
        "Within the generative model, the Bayes reformulation is used to estimate p(tIs) – p(t)p(sIt) where p(t) is considered the language model, and p(slt) is the translation model; the IBM (Brown et al., 1993) models being the de facto standard.",
        "Direct translation approaches (Foster, 2000) consider estimating p(tls) directly, and work by (Och and Ney, 2002) show that similar or improved results are achieved by replacing p(sIt) in the optimization with p(tIs), at the cost of deviating from the Bayesian framework.",
        "Regardless of the approach, the question of accurately estimating a model of translation from a large parallel or comparable corpus is one of the defining components within statistical machine translation.",
        "Reordering effects across languages have been modeled in several ways, including word-based (Brown et al., 1993), template-based (Och et al., 1999) and syntax-based (Yamada, Knight, 2001).",
        "Analyzing these models from a generative mindset, they all assume that the atomic unit of lexical content is the word, and reordering effects are applied above that level.",
        "(Marcu, Wong, 2002) illustrate the effects of assuming that lexical correspondence can only be modeled at the word level, and motivate a joint probability model that explicitly generates phrase level lexical content across both languages.",
        "(Wu, 1995) presents a bracketing method that models reordering at the sentence level.",
        "Both (Marcu, Wong, 2002; Wu, 1995) model the reordering phenomenon effectively, but at significant computational expense, and tend to be difficult to scale to long sentences.",
        "Reasons to introduce phrase level translation knowledge sources have been adequately shown and confirmed by (Och, Ney, 2000), and we focus on methods to build these sources from existing, mature components within the translation process.",
        "This paper presents a method of phrase extraction from alignment data generated by IBM Models.",
        "By working directly from alignment data with appropriate measures taken to extract accurate translation pairs, we try to avoid the computational complexity that can result from methods that try to create globally consistent alignment model phrase segmentations.",
        "We first describe the information available within alignment data, and go on to describe a method for extracting high quality phrase translation pairs from such data.",
        "We then discuss the implications of adding phrasal translation pairs to the decoding process, and present evaluation results that show significant improvements when applying the described extraction technique.",
