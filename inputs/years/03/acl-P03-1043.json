        "An NE tagger recognizes and classifies text chunks that represent various proper names, time, or numerical expressions.",
        "Seven types of named entities are defined in the Message Understanding Conference (MUC) standards, namely, PERSON (PER), ORGANIZATION (ORG), LOCATION (LOC), TIME, DATE, MONEY, and PERCENT1 (MUC-7 1998).",
        "There is considerable research on NE tagging using different techniques.",
        "These include systems based on handcrafted rules (Krupka 1998), as well as systems using supervised machine learning, such as the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (Bikel 1997) and the Maximum Entropy Model (Borthwick 1998).",
        "The state-of-the-art rule-based systems and supervised learning systems can reach near-human performance for NE tagging in a targeted domain.",
        "However, both approaches face a serious knowledge bottleneck, making rapid domain porting difficult.",
        "Such systems cannot effectively support user-defined named entities.",
        "That is the motivation for using unsupervised or weakly-supervised machine learning that only requires a raw corpus from a given domain for this NE research.",
        "(Cucchiarelli & Velardi 2001) discussed boosting the performance of an existing NE tagger by unsupervised learning based on parsing structures.",
        "(Cucerzan & Yarowsky 1999), (Collins & Singer 1999) and (Kim 2002) presented various techniques using co-training schemes for NE extraction seeded by a small list of proper names or handcrafted NE rules.",
        "NE tagging has two tasks: (i) NE chunking; (ii) NE classification.",
        "Parsing-supported NE bootstrapping systems including ours only focus on NE classification, assuming NE chunks have been constructed by the parser.",
        "The key idea of co-training is the separation of features into several orthogonal views.",
        "In case of NE classification, usually one view uses the context evidence and the other relies on the lexicon evidence.",
        "Learners corresponding to different views learn from each other iteratively.",
        "One issue of co-training is the error propagation problem in the process of the iterative learning.",
        "The rule precision drops iteration-by-iteration.",
        "In the early stages, only few instances are available for learning.",
        "This makes some powerful statistical models such as HMM difficult to use due to the extremely sparse data.",
        "This paper presents a new bootstrapping approach using successive learning and concept-based seeds.",
        "The successive learning is as follows.",
        "First, some parsing-based NE rules are learned with high precision but limited recall.",
        "Then, these rules are applied to a large raw corpus to automatically generate a tagged corpus.",
        "Finally, an HMM-based NE tagger is trained using this corpus.",
        "There is no iterative learning between the two learners, hence the process is free of the error propagation problem.",
        "The resulting NE system approaches supervised NE performance for some NE types.",
        "To derive the parsing-based learner, instead of seeding the bootstrapping process with NE instances from a proper name list or handcrafted NE rules as (Cucerzan & Yarowsky 1999), (Collins & Singer 1999) and (Kim 2002), the system only requires a few common noun or pronoun seeds that correspond to the concept for the targeted NE, e.g. he/she/man/woman for PERSON NE.",
        "Such concept-based seeds share grammatical structures with the corresponding NEs, hence a parser is utilized to support bootstrapping.",
        "Since pronouns and common nouns occur more often than NE instances, richer contextual evidence is available for effective learning.",
        "Using concept-based seeds, the parsing-based NE rules can be learned in one iteration so that the error propagation problem in the iterative learning can be avoided.",
        "This method is also shown to be effective for supporting NE domain porting and is intuitive for configuring an NE system to tag user-defined NE types.",

        "The training of the first NE learner has three major properties: (i) the use of concept-based seeds, (ii) support from the parser, and (iii) representation as a decision list.",
        "This new bootstrapping approach is based on the observation that there is an underlying concept for any proper name type and this concept can be easily expressed by a set of common nouns or pronouns, similar to how concepts are defined by synsets in WordNet (Beckwith 1991).",

        "A parser is necessary for concept-based NE bootstrapping.",
        "This is due to the fact that concept-based seeds only share pattern similarity with the corresponding NEs at structural level, not at string sequence level.",

        "However, at structural level, the concept-based seeds share the same or similar linguistic patterns (e.g. Subject-Verb-Object patterns) with the corresponding types of proper names.",
        "The rationale behind using concept-based seeds in NE bootstrapping is similar to that for parsing-based word clustering (Lin 1998): conceptually similar words occur in structurally similar context.",
        "In fact, the anaphoric function of pronouns and common nouns to represent antecedent NEs indicates the substitutability of proper names by the corresponding common nouns or pronouns.",
