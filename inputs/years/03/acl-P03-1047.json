We call an MRS compact if it additionally satisfies: M4 Every handle of M occurs exactly once in an elementary predication of M. We say that a handle h immediately outscopes a handle h' in an MRS Miff there is an EP E in M such that h occurs in label and h' in argument position of E. The outscopes relation is the reflexive, transitive closure of the immediate outscopes relation.",

        "In standard MRS, however, conjunctions are encoded by labeling different EPs with the same handle.",
        "These EP-conjunctions can be replaced in a preprocessing step introducing additional EPs that make conjunctions explicit.",
        "Second, our outscope constraints are slightly less restrictive than the original “qeq-constraints.” A handle h is qeq to a handle h' in an MRS M, h =q h', if either h = h' or a quantifier h: Qx (h1, h2) occurs in M and h2 is qeq to h' in M. Thus, h =q h' implies h < h', but not the other way round.",
        "We believe that the additional strength of qeq-constraints is not needed in practice for modeling scope.",

        "Proof.",
        "Let C be a configuration of Φ.",
        "We show that it also configures norm(Φ).",
        "Let S be the simple solved form of Φ that is configured by C (Lemma 1), and S' be a minimal solved form of Φ which is more general than S. Let X: f(Y1, ... , Yn) be the topmost fragment of the tree S. This fragment must also be the topmost fragment of S', which is a tree since Φ is assumed to be weakly connected (Prop.",
        "2).",
        "S' is constructed by our algorithm (Theorem 1), so that the evaluation of solve(Φ) must choose X as free root in Φ.",
        "Since Φ is a net, some literal X: f(Y1, ... , Yn) must belong to Φ.",
        "Let ΦV = Φ |{X,Y1,...,Yn} be the restriction of Φ to the lower fragments.",
        "The weakly connected components of all Y1, ..., Yn−1 must be pairwise disjoint by F2 (which holds by Lemma 2 since X is free in Φ).",
        "The X-fragment of net Φ must satisfy one of three possible schemata of net fragments: (a) strong (b) weak (c) island weak fragments: there exists a unique weak dominance edge X <* Z in Φ and a unique hole Yn without outgoing dominance edges.",
        "The variable Z must be a root in Φ and thus be labeled.",
        "If Z is equal to X then Φ is unsatisfiable by normality condition N2, which is impossible.",
        "Hence, Z occurs in the restriction ΦV but not in the weakly connected components of any Y1, ..., Yn_1.",
        "Otherwise, the minimal solved form S9 could not be configured since the hole Yn could not be identified with any root.",
        "Furthermore, the root of the Z-component must be identified with Yn in any configuration of Φ with root X.",
        "Hence, C satisfies Yn <* Z which is add by normalization.",
        "The restriction ΦV must be a dominance net by Lemma 3, and hence, all its weakly connected components are nets.",
        "For all 1 < i < n – 1, the component of Yi in ΦV is configured by the subtree of C at node Yi, while the subtree of C at node Yn configures the component of Z in ΦV.",
        "The induction hypothesis yields that the normalizations of all these components are configured by the respective subconfigurations of C. Hence, norm(Φ) is configured by C. strong or island fragments are not altered by normalization, so we can recurse to the lower fragments (if there exist any).",
        "❑ Proposition 4.",
        "Minimal solved forms of normal, weakly connected dominance nets have configurations.",
        "Proof.",
        "By induction over the construction of minimal solved forms, we can show that all holes of minimal solved forms have a unique outgoing dominance edge at each hole.",
        "Furthermore, all minimal solved forms are trees since we assumed connectedness (Prop.2).",
        "Thus, all minimal solved forms are simple, so they have configurations (Lemma 1).",
