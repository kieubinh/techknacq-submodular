        "Usually, entire documents are translated by humans, and the sentence pairs are subsequently aligned by automatic means.",

        "We describe our approach towards reaching this goal in section 2.",
        "Although we are using resources other than monolingual data, the unsupervised nature of our approach is preserved by the fact that no direct information about non-English stemming is present in the training data.",
