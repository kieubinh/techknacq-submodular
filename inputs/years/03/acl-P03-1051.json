        "1993) and information retrieval (Franz, M. and McCarley, S. 2002).",
        "In this paper, we present a general word segmentation algorithm for handling inflectional morphology capable of segmenting a word into a prefix*-stem-suffix* sequence, using a small manually segmented corpus and a table of prefixes/suffixes of the language.",
