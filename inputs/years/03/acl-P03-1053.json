        "The exact process by which a child acquires the grammar of his or her native language is one of the most beguiling open problems of cognitive science.",
        "There has been recent interest in computer simulation of the acquisition process and the interrelationship between such models and linguistic and psycholinguistic theory.",
        "The hope is that through computational study, certain bounds can be established which may be brought to bear on pivotal issues in developmental psycholinguistics.",
        "Simulation research is a significant departure from standard learnability models that provide results through formal proof (e.g., Bertolo, 2001; Gold, 1967; Jain et al., 1999; Niyogi, 1998; Niyogi & Berwick, 1996; Pinker, 1979; Wexler & Culi-cover, 1980, among many others).",
        "Although research in learnability theory is valuable and ongoing, there are several disadvantages to formal modeling of language acquisition:",
        "• Certain proofs may involve impractically many steps for large language domains (e.g. those involving Markov methods).",
        "• Certain paradigms are too complex to readily lend themselves to deductive study (e.g. con-nectionist models).1 • Simulations provide data on intermediate stages whereas formal proofs typically prove whether a domain is (or more often is not) learnable a priori to specific trials.",
        "• Proofs generally require simplifying assumptions which are often distant from natural language.",
        "However, simulation studies are not without disadvantages and limitations.",
        "Most notable perhaps, is that out of practicality, simulations are typically carried out on small, severely circumscribed domains – usually just large enough to allow the researcher to hone in on how a particular model (e.g. a connectionist network or a principles & parameters learner) handles a few grammatical features (e.g. long-distance agreement and/or topicalization) often, though not always, in a single language.",
        "So although there have been many successful studies that demonstrate how one algorithm or another is able to acquire some aspect of grammatical structure, there is little doubt that the question of what mechanism children actually employ during the acquisition process is still open.",
        "This paper reports the development of a large, multilingual database of sentence patterns, gram",
        "mars and derivations that may be used to test computational models of syntax acquisition from widely divergent paradigms.",
        "The domain is generated from grammars that are linguistically motivated by current syntactic theory and the sentence patterns have been validated as psychologically/developmentally plausible by checking their frequency of occurrence in corpora of child-directed speech.",
        "We report here the structure of the domain, its interface and a case-study that demonstrates how the domain has been used to test the feasibility of several different acquisition strategies.",
        "The domain is currently publicly available on the web via http://146.95.2.133 and it is our hope that it will prove to be a valuable resource for investigators interested in computational models of natural language acquisition."

      "text": [
        "The focus of the language domain database, (hereafter LDD), is to make readily available the different word order patterns that children are typically exposed to, together with all possible syntactic derivations of each pattern.",
        "The patterns and their derivations are generated from a large battery of grammars that incorporate many features from the domain of natural language.",
        "At this point the multilingual language domain contains sentence patterns and their derivations generated from 3,072 abstract grammars.",
        "The patterns encode sentences in terms of tokens denoting the grammatical roles of words and complex phrases, e.g., subject (S), direct object (O1), indirect object (O2), main verb (V), auxiliary verb (Aux), adverb (Adv), preposition (P), etc.",
        "An example pattern is S Aux V O1 which corresponds to the English sentence: The little girl can make a paper airplane.",
        "There are also tokens for topic and question markers for use when a grammar specifies overt topicalization or question marking.",
        "Declarative sentences, imperative sentences, negations and questions are represented within the LDD, as is prepositional movement/stranding (pied-piping), null subjects, null topics, topicalization and several types of movement.",
        "Although more work needs to be done, a first round study of actual child-directed sentences from the CHILDES corpus (MacWhinney, 1995) indicates that our patterns capture many sentential word orders that children typically encounter in the period from 1-1/2 to 2-1/2 years; the period generally accepted by psycholinguists to be when children establish the correct word order of their native language.",
        "For example, although the LDD is currently limited to degree-0 (i.e. no embedding) and does not contain DP-internal structure, after examining by hand, several thousand sentences from corpora in the CHILDES database in five languages (English, German, Italian, Japanese and Russian), we found that approximately 85% are degree-0 and an approximate 10 out of 11 have no internal DP structure.",
        "Adopting the principles and parameters (P&P) hypothesis (Chomsky, 1981) as the underlying framework, we implemented an application that generated patterns and derivations given the following points of variation between languages:",
        "1.",
        "Affix Hopping 2.",
        "Comp Initial/Final 3.",
        "I to C Movement 4.",

        "Obligatory Wh movement",
        "The patterns have fully specified X-bar structure, and movement is implemented as HPSG local dependencies.",
        "Pattern production is generated top-down via rules applied at each subtree level.",
        "Subtree levels include: CP, C', IP, I', NegP, Neg', VP, V' and PP.",
        "After the rules are applied, the subtrees are fully specified in terms of node categories, syntactic feature values and constituent order.",
        "The subtrees are then combined by a simple unification process and syntactic features are percolated down.",
        "In particular, movement chains are represented as traditional “slash” features which are passed (locally) from parent to daughter; when unification is complete, there is a trace at the bottom of each slash-feature path.",
        "Other features include +/-NULL for non-audible tokens (e.g. S[+NULL] represents a null subject pro), +TOPIC to represent a topicalized token, +WH to represent “who”, “what”, etc.",
        "(or “qui”, “que” if one prefers), +/-FIN to mark if a verb is tensed or not and the illocutionary (ILLOC) features Q, DEC, IMP for questions, declaratives and imperatives respectively.",
        "Although further detail is beyond the scope of this paper, those interested may refer to Fodor et al.",
        "(2003) which resides on the LDD website.",
        "It is important to note that the domain is suitable for many paradigms beyond the P&P framework.",
        "For example the context-free rules (with local dependencies) could be easily extracted and used to test probabilistic CFG learning in a multilingual domain.",
        "Likewise the patterns, without their derivations, could be used as input to statistical/connectionist models which eschew traditional (generative) structure altogether and search for regularity in the left-to-right strings of tokens that makeup the learner's input stream.",
        "Or, the patterns could help bootstrap the creation of a domain that might be used to test particular types of lexical learning by using the patterns as templates where tokens may be instantiated with actual words from a lexicon of interest to the investigator.",
        "The point is that although a particular grammar formalism was used to generate the patterns, the patterns are valid independently of the formalism that was in play during generation.2 To be sure, similar domains have been constructed.",
        "The relationship between the LDD and other artificial domains is summarized in Table 1.",
        "In designing the LDD, we chose to include syntactic phenomena which: i) occur in a relatively high proportion of the known natural languages; 2 If this is the case, one might ask: Why bother with a grammar formalism at all; why not use actual child-directed speech as input instead of artificially generated patterns?",
        "Although this approach has proved workable for several types of non-generative acquisition models, a generative (or hybrid) learner is faced with the task of selecting the rules or parameter values that generate the linguistic environment being encountered by the learner.",
        "In order to simulate this, there must be some grammatical structure incorporated into the experimental design that serves as the target the learner must acquire.",
        "Constructing a viable grammar and a parser with coverage over a multilingual domain of real child-directed speech is a daunting proposition.",
        "Even building a parser to parse a single language of child-directed speech turns out to be extremely difficult.",
        "See, for example, Sagae, Lavie, & MacWhinney (2001), which discusses an impressive number of practical difficulties encountered while attempting to build a parser that could cope with the EVE corpus; one the cleanest transcriptions in the CHILDES database.",
        "By abstracting away from actual child-directed speech, we were able to build a pattern generator and include the pattern derivations in the database for retrieval during simulation runs, effectively sidestepping the need to build an online multilingual parser.",

        "iv) have been a focus of linguistic and/or psycholinguistic research; v) have a syntactic analysis that is broadly agreed on.",
        "As a result the following have been included:",
        "• By criteria (i) and (ii): negation, non-declarative sentences (questions, imperatives).",
        "• By criterion (iv): null subject parameter (Hyams 1986 and since).",
        "• By criterion (iv): affix-hopping (though not widespread in natural languages).",
        "• By criterion (v): no scrambling yet.",

        "• No verb subcategorization.",
        "• No interface with LF (cf. Briscoe 2000; Villavicencio 2000).",
        "• No discourse contexts to license sentence fragments (e.g., DP or PP fragments).",
        "• No XP-internal structure yet (except PP = P + O3, with piping or stranding).",
        "• No Linear Correspondence Axiom (Kayne 1994).",
        "• No feature checking as implementation of movement parameters (Chomsky 1995).",
        "The LDD on the web: The two primary purposes of the web-interface are to allow the user to interactively peruse the patterns and the derivations that the LDD contains and to download raw data for the user to work with locally.",
        "Users are asked to register before using the LDD online.",
        "The user ID is typically an email address, although no validity checking is carried out.",
        "The benefit of entering a valid email address is simply to have the ability to recover a forgotten password, otherwise a user can have full access anonymously.",
        "The interface has three primary areas: Grammar Selection, Sentence Selection and Data Download.",
        "First a user has to specify, on the Grammar Selection page, which settings of the 13 parameters are of interest and save those settings as an available grammar.",
        "A user may specify multiple grammars.",
        "Then in the sentence selection page a user may peruse sentences and their derivations.",
        "On this page a user may annotate the patterns and derivations however he or she wishes.",
        "All grammar settings and annotations are saved and available the next time the user logs on.",
        "Finally on the Data Download page, users may download data so that they can use the patterns and derivations offline.",
        "The derivations are stored as bracketed strings representing tree structure.",
        "These are practically indecipherable by human users.",
        "E.g.:",
        "To be readable, the derivations are displayed graphically as tree structures.",
        "Towards this end we have utilized a set of publicly available LaTex macros: QTree (Siskind & Dimitriadis, [online]).",
        "A server-side script parses the bracketed structures into the proper QTree/LaTex format from which a pdf file is generated and subsequently sent to the user's client application.",
        "Even with the graphical display, a simple sentence-by-sentence presentation is untenable given the large amount of linguistic data contained in the database.",
        "The Sentence Selection area allows users to access the data filtered by sentence type and/or by grammar features (e.g. all sentences that have obligatory-wh movement and contain a prepositional phrase), as well as by the user’s defined grammar(s) (all sentences that are \"Italian-like\").",
        "On the Data Download page, users may filter sentences as on the Sentence Selection page and download sentences in a tab-delimited format.",

        "The TLA has become a seminal model and has been extensively studied (cf. Bertolo, 2001 and references therein; Berwick & Niyogi, 1996; Frank & Kapur, 1996; Sakas, 2000; among others).",

        "The STL is error-driven.",

        "Otherwise, parse the sentence making use of any or all parametric treelets available and adopt those treelets that contribute to a successful parse.",
        "We call this parametric decoding.",
        "Because the STL can decode inputs into their parametric signatures, it stands apart from other acquisition models in that it can detect when an input sentence is parametrically ambiguous.",
        "During a parse of s, if more than one treelet could be used by the parser (i.e., a choice point is encountered), then s is parametrically ambiguous.",
        "The TLA variants do not have this capacity because they rely only on a can-parse/can’t-parse outcome and do not have access to the on-line operations of the parser.",
        "Originally, the ability to detect ambiguity was employed in two variations of the STL: the strong STL (SSTL) and the weak STL.",
        "The SSTL executes a full parallel parse of each input sentence and adopts only those treelets (parameter values) that are present in all the generated parse trees.",
        "This would seem to make the SSTL an extremely powerful, albeit psychologically implausible, learner.8 However, this is not necessarily the case.",
        "The SSTL needs some unambiguity to be present in the structures derived from the sentences of the target language.",
        "For example, there may not be a single input generated by Gtarg that when parsed yields an unambiguous treelet for a particular parameter.",
        "Unlike the SSTL, the weak STL executes a psychologically plausible left-to-right serial (deterministic) parse.",
        "One variant of the weak STL, the waiting STL (WSTL), deals with ambiguous inputs abiding by the heuristic: Don’t learn from sentences that contain a choice point.",
        "These sentences are simply discarded for the purposes of learning.",
        "This is not to imply that children do not parse ambiguous sentences they hear, but only that they set no parameters if the current evidence is ambiguous.",
        "As with the TLA, these STL variants have been studied from a mathematical perspective (Bertolo et al., 1997a; Sakas, 2000).",
        "Mathematical analyses point to the fact that the strong and weak STL are extremely efficient learners in conducive domains with some unambiguous inputs but may become paralyzed in domains with high degrees of ambiguity.",
        "These mathematical analyses among other considerations spurred a new class of weak STL variants which we informally call the guessing STL family.",
        "The basic idea behind the guessing STL models is that there is some information available even in sentences that are ambiguous, and some strategy that can exploit that information.",
        "We incorporate three different heuristics into the original STL paradigm, the RC, MC and LAC heuristics described above.",
        "Although the MC and LAC heuristics are not stochastic, we regard them as “guessing” heuristics because, unlike the WSTL, a learner cannot be certain that the parametric treelets obtained from a parse guided by MC and LAC are correct for the target.",
        "These heuristics are based on well-established human parsing strategies.",
        "Interestingly, the difference in performance between the three variants is slight.",
        "Although we have just begun to look at this data in detail, one reason may be that the typical types of problems these parsing strategies address are not included in the LDD (e.g. relative clause attachment ambiguity).",
        "Still, the STL variants perform the most efficiently of the strategies presented in this small study (approximately a 100-fold improvement over the TLA).",
        "Certainly this is due to the STL's ability to perform parametric decoding.",
