        "Along with the efforts made in accumulating bilingual corpora for many language pairs, quite a few machine translation (MT) systems that automatically acquire their knowledge from corpora have been proposed.",
        "However, knowledge for transfer-based MT acquired from corpora contains many incorrect/redundant rules due to acquisition errors or translation variety in the corpora.",
        "Such rules conflict with other existing rules and cause implausible MT results or increase ambiguity.",
        "If incorrect rules could be avoided, MT quality would necessarily improve.",
        "There are two approaches to overcoming incorrect/redundant rules:",
        "• Selecting appropriate rules in a disambiguation process during the translation (on-line processing, (Meyers et al., 2000)).",
        "• Cleaning incorrect/redundant rules after automatic acquisition (off-line processing, (Menezes and Richardson, 2001; Imamura, 2002)).",
        "We employ the second approach in this paper.",
        "The cutoff by frequency (Menezes and Richardson, 2001) and the hypothesis test (Imamura, 2002) have been applied to clean the rules.",
        "The cutoff by frequency can slightly improve MT quality, but the improvement is still insufficient from the viewpoint of the large number of redundant rules.",
        "The hypothesis test requires very large corpora in order to obtain a sufficient number of rules that are statistically confident.",
        "Another current topic of machine translation is automatic evaluation of MT quality (Papineni et al., 2002; Yasuda et al., 2001; Akiba et al., 2001).",
        "These methods aim to replace subjective evaluation in order to speed up the development cycle of MT systems.",
        "However, they can be utilized not only as developers’ aids but also for automatic tuning of MT systems (Su et al., 1992).",
        "We propose feedback cleaning that utilizes an automatic evaluation for removing incorrect/redundant translation rules as a tuning method",
        "get words are inserted by referring to a translation dictionary.",
        "Ambiguities, which occur during parsing or mapping, are resolved by selecting the rules that minimize the semantic distance between the input words and source examples (real examples in the training corpus) of the transfer rules (Furuse and Iida, 1994).",
        "For instance, when the input phrase “leave at 11 a.m.” is translated into Japanese, Rule 2 in Figure 2 is selected because the semantic distance from the source example (arrive, p.m.) is the shortest to the head words of the input phrase (leave, a.m.).",
        "(Figure 1).",
        "Our method evaluates the contribution of each rule to the MT results and removes inappropriate rules as a way to increase the evaluation scores.",
        "Since the automatic evaluation correlates with a subjective evaluation, MT quality will improve after cleaning.",
        "Our method only evaluates MT results and does not consider various conditions of the MT engine, such as parameters, interference in dictionaries, disambiguation methods, and so on.",
        "Even if an MT engine avoids incorrect/redundant rules by on-line processing, errors inevitably remain.",
        "Our method cleans the rules in advance by only focusing on the remaining errors.",
        "Thus, our method complements on-line processing and adapts translation rules to the given conditions of the MT engine."
