        "This paper is concerned with the task of knowledge-rich lexical acquisition from unannotated corpora, focusing on the case of countability in English.",
        "Knowledge-rich lexical acquisition takes unstructured text and extracts out linguistically-precise categorisations of word and expression types.",
        "By combining this with a grammar, we can build broad-coverage deep-processing tools with a minimum of human effort.",
        "This research is close in spirit to the work of Light (1996) on classifying the semantics of derivational affixes, and Siegel and McKeown (2000) on learning verb aspect.",
        "In English, nouns heading noun phrases are typically either countable or uncountable (also called count and mass).",
        "Countable nouns can be modified by denumerators, prototypically numbers, and have a morphologically marked plural form: one dog, two dogs.",
        "Uncountable nouns cannot be modified by denumerators, but can be modified by unspecific quantifiers such as much, and do not show any number distinction (prototypically being singular): *one equipment, some equipment, *two equipments.",
        "Many nouns can be used in countable or uncountable environments, with differences in interpretation.",
        "We call the lexical property that determines which uses a noun can have the noun’s countability preference.",
        "Knowledge of countability preferences is important both for the analysis and generation of English.",
        "In analysis, it helps to constrain the interpretations of parses.",
        "In generation, the countability preference determines whether a noun can become plural, and the range of possible determiners.",
        "Knowledge of countability is particularly important in machine translation, because the closest translation equivalent may have different countability from the source noun.",
        "Many languages, such as Chinese and Japanese, do not mark countability, which means that the choice of countability will be largely the responsibility of the generation component (Bond, 2001).",
        "In addition, knowledge of countability obtained from examples of use is an important resource for dictionary construction.",
        "In this paper, we learn the countability preferences of English nouns from unannotated corpora.",
        "We first annotate them automatically, and then train classifiers using a set of gold standard data, taken from COMLEX (Grishman et al., 1998) and the transfer dictionaries used by the machine translation system ALT-J/E (Ikehara et al., 1991).",
        "The classifiers and their training are described in more detail in Baldwin and Bond (2003).",
        "These are then run over the corpus to extract nouns as members of four classes – countable: dog; uncountable: furniture; bipartite: [pair of] scissors and plural only: clothes.",
        "We first discuss countability in more detail (§ 2).",
        "Then we present the lexical resources used in our experiment (§ 3).",
        "Next, we describe the learning process( § 4).",
        "We then present our results and evaluation( § 5).",

      "heading": "2 Background",
      "text": [
        "Grammatical countability is motivated by the semantic distinction between object and substance reference (also known as bounded/non-bounded or individuated/non-individuated).",
        "It is a subject of contention among linguists as to how far grammatical countability is semantically motivated and how much it is arbitrary (Wierzbicka, 1988).",
        "The prevailing position in the natural language processing community is effectively to treat countability as though it were arbitrary and encode it as a lexical property of nouns.",
        "The study of countability is complicated by the fact that most nouns can have their countability changed: either converted by a lexical rule or embedded in another noun phrase.",
        "An example of conversion is the so-called universal packager, a rule which takes an uncountable noun with an interpretation as a substance, and returns a countable noun interpreted as a portion of the substance: I would like two beers.",
        "An example of embedding is the use of a classifier, e.g. uncountable nouns can be embedded in countable noun phrases as complements of classifiers: one piece of equipment.",
        "Bond et al.",
        "(1994) suggested a division of countability into five major types, based on Allan (1980)’s noun countability preferences (NCPs).",
        "Nouns which rarely undergo conversion are marked as either fully countable, uncountable or plural only.",
        "Fully countable nouns have both singular and plural forms, and cannot be used with determiners such as much, little, a little, less and overmuch.",
        "Uncountable nouns, such as furniture, have no plural form, and can be used with much.",
        "Plural only nouns never head a singular noun phrase: goods, scissors.",
        "Nouns that are readily converted are marked as either strongly countable (for countable nouns that can be converted to uncountable, such as cake) or weakly countable (for uncountable nouns that are readily convertible to countable, such as beer).",
        "NLP systems must list countability for at least some nouns, because full knowledge of the referent of a noun phrase is not enough to predict countability.",
        "There is also a language-specific knowledge requirement.",
        "This can be shown most simply by comparing languages: different languages encode the countability of the same referent in different ways.",
        "There is nothing about the concept denoted by lightning, e.g., that rules out *a lightning being interpreted as a flash of lightning.",
        "Indeed, the German and French translation equivalents are fully countable (ein Blitz and un ´eclair respectively).",
        "Even within the same language, the same referent can be encoded countably or uncountably: clothes/clothing, things/stuff, jobs/work.",
        "Therefore, we must learn countability classes from usage examples in corpora.",
        "There are several impediments to this approach.",
        "The first is that words are frequently converted to different countabilities, sometimes in such a way that other native speakers will dispute the validity of the new usage.",
        "We do not necessarily wish to learn such rare examples, and may not need to learn more common conversions either, as they can be handled by regular lexical rules (Copestake and Briscoe, 1995).",
        "The second problem is that some constructions affect the apparent countability of their head: for example, nouns denoting a role, which are typically countable, can appear without an article in some constructions (e.g. We elected him treasurer).",
        "The third is that different senses of a word may have different countabilities: interest “a sense of concern with and curiosity” is normally countable, whereas interest “fixed charge for borrowing money” is uncountable.",
        "There have been at several earlier approaches to the automatic determination of countability.",
        "Bond and Vatikiotis-Bateson (2002) determine a noun’s countability preferences from its semantic class, and show that semantics predicts (5-way) countability 78% of the time with their ontology.",
        "O’Hara et al.",
        "(2003) get better results (89.5%) using the much larger Cyc ontology, although they only distinguish between countable and uncountable.",
        "Schwartz (2002) created an automatic countability tagger (ACT) to learn noun countabilities from the British National Corpus.",
        "ACT looks at determiner co-occurrence in singular noun chunks, and classifies the noun if and only if it occurs with a determiner which can modify only countable or uncountable nouns.",
        "The method has a coverage of around 50%, and agrees with COMLEX for 68% of the nouns marked countable and with the ALT-J/E lexicon for 88%.",
        "Agreement was worse for uncountable nouns (6% and 44% respectively)."

      "heading": "3 Resources",
      "text": [
        "Information about noun countability was obtained from two sources.",
        "One was COMLEX 3.0 (Grishman et al., 1998), which has around 22,000 noun entries.",
        "Of these, 12,922 are marked as being countable (COUNTABLE) and 4,976 as being uncountable (NCOLLECTIVE or :PLURAL *NONE*).",
        "The remainder are unmarked for countability.",
        "The other was the common noun part of ALT-J/E’s Japanese-to-English semantic transfer dictionary (Bond, 2001).",
        "It contains 71,833 linked Japanese-English pairs, each of which has a value for the noun countability preference of the English noun.",
        "Considering only unique English entries with different countability and ignoring all other information gave 56,245 entries.",
        "Nouns in the ALT-J/E dictionary are marked with one of the five major countability preference classes described in Section 2.",
        "In addition to countability, default values for number and classifier (e.g. blade for grass: blade of grass) are also part of the lexicon.",
        "We classify words into four possible classes, with some words belonging to multiple classes.",
        "The first class is countable: COMLEX’s COUNTABLE and ALT-J/E’s fully, strongly and weakly countable.",
        "The second class is uncountable: COMLEX’s NCO LLECTIVE or :PLURAL *NONE* and ALT-J/E’s strongly and weakly countable and uncountable.",
        "The third class is bipartite nouns.",
        "These can only be plural when they head a noun phrase (trousers), but singular when used as a modifier (trouser leg).",
        "When they are denumerated they use pair: a pair of scissors.",
        "COMLEX does not have a feature to mark bipartite nouns; trouser, for example, is listed as countable.",
        "Nouns in ALT-J/E marked plural only with a default classifier of pair are classified as bipartite.",
        "The last class is plural only nouns: those that only have a plural form, such as goods.",
        "They can neither be denumerated nor modified by much.",
        "Many of these nouns, such as clothes, use the plural form even as modifiers (a clothes horse).",
        "The word clothes cannot be denumerated at all.",
        "Nouns marked",
        "J/E marked plural only without the default classifier pair are classified as plural only.",
        "There was some noise in the ALT-J/E data, so this class was hand-checked, giving a total of 104 entries; 84 of these were attested in the training data.",
        "Our classification of countability is a subset of ALT-J/E’s, in that we use only the three basic ALT-J/E classes of countable, uncountable and plural only, (although we treat bipartite as a separate class, not a subclass).",
        "As we derive our countability classifications from corpus evidence, it is possible to reconstruct countability preferences (i.e. fully, strongly, or weakly countable) from the relative token occurrence of the different countabilities for that noun.",
        "In order to get an idea of the intrinsic difficulty of the countability learning task, we tested the agreement between the two resources in the form of classification accuracy.",
        "That is, we calculate the average proportion of (both positive and negative) countability classifications over which the two methods agree.",
        "E.g., COMLEX lists tomato as being only countable where ALT-J/E lists it as being both countable and uncountable.",
        "Agreement for this one noun, therefore, is 4, as there is agreement for the classes of countable, plural only and bipartite (with implicit agreement as to negative membership for the latter two classes), but not for uncountable.",
        "Averaging over the total set of nouns countability-classified in both lexicons, the mean was 93.8%.",
        "Almost half of the disagreements came from words with two countabilities in ALT-J/E but only one in COMLEX."

        "Only 139 nouns were assigned to multiple countability classes.",
        "We evaluated the classifier outputs in two ways.",
        "In the first, we compared the classifier output to the combined COMLEX and ALT-J/E lexicons: a lexicon with countability information for 63,581 nouns.",
        "The classifiers found a match for 4,982 of the nouns.",
        "The predicted countability was judged correct 94.6% of the time.",
        "This is marginally above the level of match between ALT-J/E and COMLEX (93.8%) and substantially above the baseline of all-countable at 89.7% (error reduction = 47.6%).",
        "To gain a better understanding of the classifier performance, we analysed the correlation between corpus frequency of a given target noun and its precision/recall for the countable class.5 To do this, we listed the 11,499 unannotated nouns in increasing order of corpus occurrence, and worked through the ranking calculating the mean precision and recall over each partition of 500 nouns.",
        "This resulted in the precision–recall graph given in Figure 1, from which it is evident that mean recall is proportional and precision inversely proportional to corpus fre",
        "quency.",
        "That is, for lower-frequency nouns, the classifier tends to rampantly classify nouns as countable, while for higher-frequency nouns, the classifier tends to be extremely conservative in positively classifying nouns.",
        "One possible explanation for this is that, based on the training data, the frequency of a noun is proportional to the number of countability classes it belongs to.",
        "Thus, for the more frequent nouns, evidence for alternate countability classes can cloud the judgement of a given classifier.",
        "In secondary evaluation, the authors used BNC corpus evidence to blind-annotate 100 randomly-selected nouns from the test data, and tested the correlation with the system output.",
        "This is intended to test the ability of the system to capture corpus-attested usages of nouns, rather than independent lexicographic intuitions as are described in the COMLEX and ALT-J/E lexicons.",
        "Of the 100, 28 were classified by the annotators into two or more groups (mainly countable and uncountable).",
        "On this set, the baseline of all-countable was 87.8%, and the classifiers gave an agreement of 92.4% (37.7% e.r.",
        "), agreement with the dictionaries was also 92.4%.",
        "Again, the main source of errors was the classifier only returning a single countability for each noun.",
        "To put this figure in proper perspective, we also hand-annotated 100 randomly-selected nouns from the training data (that is words in our combined lexicon) according to BNC corpus evidence.",
        "Here, we tested the correlation between the manual judgements and the combined ALT-J/E and COMLEX dictionaries.",
        "For this dataset, the baseline of all-countable was 80.5%, and agreement with the dictionaries was a modest 86.8% (32.3% e.r.).",
        "Based on this limited evaluation, therefore, our automated method is able to capture corpus-attested countabilities with greater precision than a manually-generated static repository of countability data."

        "We have proposed a knowledge-rich lexical acquisition technique for multi-classifying a given noun according to four countability classes.",
        "The technique operates over a range of feature clusters drawing on preprocessed corpus data, which are then fed into independent classifiers for each of the countability classes.",
        "The classifiers were able to selectively classify the countability preference of English nouns with a precision of 94.6%."
