        "In Lexicalized Tree-Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) (Joshi and Schabes, 1997; XTAG-Group, 2001), each word in a sentence is associated with an elementary tree, or a supertag (Joshi and Srinivas, 1994).",
        "Supertagging is the process of assigning the correct supertag to each word of an input sentence.",
        "The following two facts make supertagging attractive.",
        "Firstly supertags encode much more syntactical information than POS tags, which makes supertagging a useful pre-parsing tool, so-called, almost parsing (Srinivas and Joshi, 1999).",
        "On the",
        "other hand, as the term ’supertagging’ suggests, the time complexity of supertagging is similar to that of POS tagging, which is linear in the length of the input sentence.",
        "In this paper, we will focus on the NP chunking task, and use it as an application of supertagging.",
        "(Abney, 1991) proposed a two-phase parsing model which includes chunking and attaching.",
        "(Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) approached chucking by using Transformation Based Learning(TBL).",
        "Many machine learning techniques have been successfully applied to chunking tasks, such as Regularized Winnow (Zhang et al., 2001), SVMs (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2001), CRFs (Sha and Pereira, 2003), Maximum Entropy Model (Collins, 2002), Memory Based Learning (Sang, 2002) and SNoW (Mu˜noz et al., 1999).",
        "The previous best result on chunking in literature was achieved by Regularized Winnow (Zhang et al., 2001), which took some of the parsing results given by an English Slot Grammar-based parser as input to the chunker.",
        "The use of parsing results contributed 0.62% absolute increase in F-score.",
        "However, this approach conflicts with the purpose of chunking.",
        "Ideally, a chunker geneates n-best results, and an attacher uses chunking results to construct a parse.",
        "The dilemma is that syntactic constraints are useful in the chunking phase, but they are unavailable until the attaching phase.",
        "The reason is that POS tags are not a good labeling system to encode enough linguistic knowledge for chunking.",
        "However another labeling system, supertagging, can provide a great deal of syntactic information.",
        "In an LTAG, each word is associated with a set of possible elementary trees.",
        "An LTAG parser assigns the correct elementary tree to each word of a sentence, and uses the elementary trees of all the words to build a parse tree for the sentence.",
        "Elementary trees, which we call supertags, contain more information than POS tags, and they help to improve the chunking accuracy.",
        "Although supertags are able to encode long distance dependence, supertaggers trained with local information in fact do not take full advantage of complex information available in supertags.",
        "In order to exploit syntactic dependencies in a larger context, we propose a new model of supertagging based on Sparse Network of Winnow (SNoW) (Roth, 1998).",
        "We also propose a novel method of applying SNoW to sequential models in a way analogous to the Projection-base Markov Model (PMM) used in (Punyakanok and Roth, 2000).",
        "In contrast to PMM, we construct a SNoW classifier for each POS tag.",
        "For each word of an input sentence, its POS tag, instead of the supertag of the previous word, is used to select the corresponding SNoW classifier.",
        "This method helps to avoid the sparse data problem and forces SNoW to focus on difficult cases in the context of supertagging task.",
        "Since PMM suffers from the label bias problem (Lafferty et al., 2001), we have used two methods to cope with this problem.",
        "One method is to skip the local normalization step, and the other is to combine the results of left-to-right scan and right-to-left scan.",
        "We test our supertagger on both the hand-coded supertags used in (Chen et al., 1999) as well as the supertags extracted from Penn Treebank(PTB) (Marcus et al., 1994; Xia, 2001).",
        "On the dataset used in (Chen et al., 1999), our supertagger achieves an accuracy of 92.41%.",
        "We then apply our supertagger to NP chunking.",
        "The purpose of this paper is to find a better way to exploit syntactic information which is useful in NP chunking, but not the machine learning part.",
        "So we just use TBL, a well-known algorithm in the community of text chunking, as the machine learning tool in our research.",
        "Using TBL also allows us to easily evaluate the contribution of supertags with respect to Ramshaw and Marcus’s original work, the de facto baseline of NP chunking.",
        "The use of supertags with TBL can be easily extended to other machine learning algorithms.",
        "We repeat Ramshaw and Marcus’ Transformation Based NP chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) algorithm by substituting supertags for POS tags in the dataset.",
        "The use of supertags gives rise to almost 1% absolute increase (from 92.03% to 92.95%) in F-score under Transformation Based Learning(TBL) frame.",
        "This confirms our claim that using supertagging as a labeling system helps to increase the overall performance of NP Chunking.",
        "The supertagger presented in this paper provides an opportunity for advanced machine learning techniques to improve their performance on chunking tasks by exploiting more syntactic information encoded in the supertags."

        "But the performance of this model was worse than the traditional trigram model because it discarded local information.",
        "(Chen et al., 1999) combined the traditional trigram model and head trigram model in their trigram mixed model.",
        "In their model, context for the current word was determined by the supertag of the previous word and context for the previous word according to 6 manually defined rules.",

        "The mixed trigram model achieves better results on supertagging because it can capture both local and long distance dependencies to some extent.",
        "However, we think that a better way to find useful context is to use machine learning techniques but not define the rules manually.",
        "One approach is to switch to models like PMM, which can not only take advantage of generative models with the Viterbi algorithm, but also utilize the information in a larger contexts through flexible feature sets.",

        "We have proposed the use of supertags in the NP chunking task in order to use more syntactical dependencies which are unavailable with POS tags.",
        "In order to train a supertagger with a larger context, we have proposed a novel method of applying SNoW to the sequential model and have applied it to supertagging.",
        "Our algorithm takes advantage of rich feature sets, avoids the sparse-data problem, and forces the learning algorithm to focus on the difficult cases.",
        "Being aware of the fact that our algorithm may suffer from the label bias problem, we have used two methods to cope with this problem, and achieved desirable results.",
        "We have tested our algorithms on both the hand-coded tag set used in (Chen et al., 1999) and supertags extracted for Penn Treebank(PTB).",
        "On the same dataset as that of (Chen et al., 1999), our new supertagger achieves an accuracy of 92.41%.",
        "Compared with the supertaggers with the same decoding complexity (Chen, 2001), our algorithm achieves an error reduction of 7.1 %.",
        "We repeat Ramshaw and Marcus’ Transformation Based NP chunking (Ramshaw and Marcus, 1995) test by substituting supertags for POS tags in the dataset.",
        "The use of supertags in NP chunking gives rise to almost 1% absolute increase (from 92.03% to 92.95%) in F-score under Transformation Based Learning(TBL) frame, or an error reduction of 11.8%.",
        "The accuracy of 92.95% with our individual TBL chunker is close to results of POS-tag-based systems using advanced machine learning algorithms, such as 93.34% by voted MBL chunkers (Sang, 2002), 92.8% by SNoW chunker (Mu˜noz et al., 1999).",
        "The benefit of using a supertagger is obvious.",
        "The supertagger provides an opportunity for advanced machine learning techniques to improve their performance on chunking tasks by exploiting more syntactic information encoded in the supertags.",
        "To sum up, the supertagging algorithm presented here provides an effective and efficient way to employ syntactic information."
