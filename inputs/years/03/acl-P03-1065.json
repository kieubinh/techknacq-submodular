        "This paper presents a proven approach to identifying English PVs based on pattern matching using a formalism called Expert Lexicon.",
        "Phrasal Verbs are an important feature of the English language since they form about one third of the English verb vocabulary.1 Properly 1 For the verb vocabulary of our system based on machine-readable dictionaries and two Phrasal Verb dictionaries, phrasal verb entries constitute 33.8% of the entries.",
        "recognizing PVs is an important condition for English parsing.",
        "Like single-word verbs, each PV has its own lexical features including subcategorization features that determine its structural patterns [Fraser 1976; Bolinger 1971; Pelli 1976; Shaked 1994], e.g., look for has syntactic subcategorization and semantic features similar to those of search; carry... on shares lexical features with continue.",
        "Such lexical features can be represented in the PV lexicon in the same way as those for single-word verbs, but a parser can only use them when the PV is identified.",
        "Problems like PVs are regarded as ‘a pain in the neck for NLP’ [Sag et al.",
        "2002].",
        "A proper solution to this problem requires tighter interaction between syntax and lexicon than traditionally available [Breidt et al.",
        "1994].",
        "Simple lexical lookup leads to severe degradation in both precision and recall, as our benchmarks show (Section 4).",
        "The recall problem is mainly due to separable PVs such as turn... off which allow for syntactic units to be inserted inside the PV compound, e.g., turn it off, turn the radio off.",
        "The precision problem is caused by the ambiguous function of the particle.",
        "For example, a simple lexical lookup will mistag looked for as a phrasal verb in sentences such as He looked for quite a while but saw nothing.",
        "In short, the traditional NLP framework that separates the lexicon module from a parser makes it difficult to handle this problem properly.",
        "This paper presents an expert lexicon approach that integrates the lexical module with contextual checking based on shallow parsing results.",

      "heading": "2.1 Task Definition",
      "text": [
        "First, we define the task as the identification of PVs in support of deep parsing, not as the parsing of the structures headed by a PV.",
        "These two are separated as two tasks not only because of modularity considerations, but more importantly based on a natural labor division between NLP modules.",
        "Essential to the second argument is that these two tasks are of a different linguistic nature: the identification task belongs to (compounding) morphology (although it involves a syntactic interface) while the parsing task belongs to syntax.",
        "The naturalness of this division is reflected in the fact that there is no need for a specialized, PV-oriented parser.",
        "The same parser, mainly driven by lexical subcategorization features, can handle the structural problems for both phrasal verbs and other verbs.",
        "The following active and passive structures involving the PVs look after (corresponding to watch) and carry... on (corresponding to continue) are decoded by our deep parser after PV identification: she is being carefully ‘looked after’ (watched); we should ‘carry on’ (continue) the business for a while.",
        "There has been no unified definition of PVs among linguists.",
        "Semantic compositionality is often used as a criterion to distinguish a PV from a syntactic combination between a verb and its associated adverb or prepositional phrase [Shaked 1994].",
        "In reality, however, PVs reside in a continuum from opaque to transparent in terms of semantic compositionality [Bolinger 1971].",
        "There exist fuzzy cases such as take something away2 that may be included either as a PV or as a regular syntactic sequence.",
        "There is agreement",
        "on the vocabulary scope for the majority of PVs, as reflected in the overlapping of PV entries from major English dictionaries.",
        "English PVs are generally classified into three major types.",
        "Type I usually takes the form of an intransitive verb plus a particle word that originates from a preposition.",
        "Hence the resulting compound verb has become transitive, e.g., look for, look after, look forward to, look into, etc.",
        "Type II typically takes the form of a transitive verb plus a particle from the set {on, off, up, down}, e.g., turn... on, take... off, wake... up, let... down.",
        "Marginal cases of particles may also include {out, in, away} such as take... away, kick ... in, pull... out.3 Type III takes the form of an intransitive verb plus an adverb particle, e.g., get by, blow up, burn up, get off, etc.",
        "Note that Type II and Type III PVs have considerable overlapping in vocabulary, e.g., The bomb blew up vs.",
        "The clown blew up the balloon.",
        "The overlapping phenomenon can be handled by assigning both a transitive feature and an intransitive feature to the identified PVs in the same way that we treat the overlapping of single-word verbs.",
        "The first issue in handling PVs is inflection.",
        "A system for identifying PVs should match the inflected forms, both regular and irregular, of the leading verb.",
        "The second is the representation of the lexical identity of recognized PVs.",
        "This is to establish a PV (a compound word) as a syntactic atomic unit with all its lexical properties determined by the lexicon [Di Sciullo and Williams 1987].",
        "The output of the identification module based on a PV lexicon should support syntactic analysis and further processing.",
        "This translates into two sub-tasks: (i) lexical feature assignment, and (ii) canonical form representation.",
        "After a PV is identified, its lexical features encoded in the PV lexicon should be assigned for a parser to use.",
        "The representation of a canonical form for an identified PV is necessary to allow for individual rules to be associated with identified PVs in further processing and to facilitate verb retrieval in applications.",
        "For example, if we use turn_off as the canonical form for the PV turn... off, identified in both he turned off the radio and he",
        "turned the radio off, a search for turn_off will match all and only the mentions of this PV.",
        "The fact that PVs are separable hurts recall.",
        "In particular, for Type II, a Noun Phrase (NP) object can be inserted inside the compound verb.",
        "NP insertion is an intriguing linguistic phenomenon involving the morpho-syntactic interface: a morphological compounding process needs to interact with the formation of a syntactic unit.",
        "Type I PVs also have the separability problem, albeit to a lesser degree.",
        "The possible inserted units are adverbs in this case, e.g., look everywhere for, look carefully after.",
        "What hurts precision is spurious matches of PV negative instances.",
        "In a sentence with the structure V+[P+NP], [V+P] may be mistagged as a PV, as seen in the following pairs of examples for Type I and Type II:",
        "(1a) She [looked for] you yesterday.",
        "(1b) She looked [for quite a while] (but saw nothing).",
        "(2a) She [put on] the coat.",
        "(2b) She put [on the table] the book she borrowed yesterday.",
        "To summarize, the following is a checklist of problems that a PV identification system should handle: (i) verb inflection, (ii) lexical identity representation, (iii) separability, and (iv) negative instances."

        "An Expert Lexicon formalism is used to develop the entire phrasal verb lexicon and its associated pattern matching rules and macros.",
        "This formalism allows the phrasal verb lexicon to be called between two levels of parsing for the required morpho-syntactic interaction in phrasal verb identification.",
        "Benchmarking using both the running text corpus and sampling corpus shows that the presented approach provides a satisfactory solution to this problem.",
        "In future research, we plan to extend the successful experiment on phrasal verbs to other types of multi-word expressions and idioms using the same expert lexicon formalism."
