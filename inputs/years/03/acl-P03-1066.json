        "In recent years, many efforts have been made to utilize linguistic structure in language modeling, which for practical reasons is still dominated by trigram-based language models.",
        "There are two major obstacles to successfully incorporating linguistic structure into a language model: (1) capturing longer distance word dependencies leads to higher-order n-gram models, where the number of parameters is usually too large to estimate; (2) capturing deeper linguistic relations in a language model requires a large annotated training corpus and a decoder that assigns linguistic structure, which are not always available.",
        "This paper presents a new dependency language model (DLM) that captures long distance linguistic constraints between words via a dependency structure, i.e., a set of probabilistic dependencies that capture linguistic relations between headwords of each phrase in a sentence.",
        "To deal with the first obstacle mentioned above, we approximate long-distance linguistic dependency by a model that is similar to a skipping bigram model in which the prediction of a word is conditioned on exactly one other linguistically related word that lies arbitrarily far in the past.",
        "This dependency model is then interpolated with a headword bigram model and a word trigram model, keeping the number of parameters of the combined model manageable.",
        "To overcome the second obstacle, we used an unsupervised learning method that discovers the dependency structure of a given sentence using an Expectation-Maximization (EM)-like procedure.",
        "In this method, no manual syntactic annotation is required, thereby opening up the possibility for building a language model that performs well on a wide variety of data and languages.",
        "The proposed model is evaluated using Japanese Kana-Kanji conversion, achieving significant error rate reduction over the word trigram model."

        "A trigram language model predicts the next word based only on two preceding words, blindly discarding any other relevant word that may lie three or more positions to the left.",
        "Such a model is likely to be linguistically implausible: consider the English sentence in Figure 1(a), where a trigram model would predict cried from next seat, which does not agree with our intuition.",
        "In this paper, we define a dependency structure of a sentence as a set of probabilistic dependencies that express linguistic relations between words in a sentence by an acyclic, planar graph, where two related words are connected by an undirected graph edge (i.e., we do not differentiate the modifier and the head in a dependency).",
        "The dependency structure for the sentence in Figure 1(a) is as shown; a model that uses this dependency structure would predict cried from baby, in agreement with our intuition.",
        "A Japanese sentence is typically divided into non-overlapping phrases called bunsetsu.",
        "As shown in Figure 1(b), each bunsetsu consists of one content word, referred to here as the headword H, and several function words F. Words (more precisely, morphemes) within a bunsetsu are tightly bound with each other, which can be adequately captured by a word trigram model.",
        "However, headwords across bunsetsu boundaries also have dependency relations with each other, as the diagrams in Figure 1 show.",
        "Such long distance dependency relations are expected to provide useful and complementary information with the word trigram model in the task of next word prediction.",
        "In constructing language models for realistic applications such as speech recognition and Asian language input, we are faced with two constraints that we would like to satisfy: First, the model must operate in a left-to-right manner, because (1) the search procedures for predicting words that correspond to the input acoustic signal or phonetic string work left to right, and (2) it can be easily combined with a word trigram model in decoding.",
        "Second, the model should be computationally feasible both in training and decoding.",
        "In the next section, we offer a DLM that satisfies both of these constraints."

        "Many recent studies (e.g., Chelba and Jelinek, 2000; Charniak, 2001; Roark, 2001) adopt this approach.",
        "Similarly, dependency-based models (e.g., Collins, 1996; Chelba et al., 1997) use a dependency structure D of W instead of a parse tree T, where D is extracted from syntactic trees.",

        "DLM, on the other hand, is a non-grammar-based model, because it is not based on any syntactic annotation: the dependency structure used in language modeling was learned directly from data in an unsupervised manner, subject to two weak syntactic constraints (i.e., dependency structure is acyclic and planar).8 This resulted in capturing the dependency relations that are not precisely syntactic in nature within our model.",
        "For example, in the conversion of the string below, the word HR_ ban 'evening' was correctly predicted in DLM by using the long-distance bigram 0 ~ HR_ asa~ban 'morning~evening', even though these two words are not in any direct syntactic dependency relationship:",
        "'asks for instructions in the morning and submits daily reports in the evening' Though there is no doubt that syntactic dependency relations provide useful information for language modeling, the most linguistically related word in the previous context may come in various linguistic relations with the word being predicted, not limited to syntactic dependency.",
        "This opens up new possibilities for exploring the combination of different knowledge sources in language modeling.",
        "Regarding the function (D that maps the left context onto equivalence classes, we used a simple approximation that takes into account only one linguistically related word in left context.",
        "An alternative is to use the maximum entropy (ME) approach (Rosenfeld, 1994; Chelba et al., 1997).",
        "Although ME models provide a nice framework for incorporating arbitrary knowledge sources that can be encoded as a large set of constraints, training and using ME models is extremely computationally expensive.",
        "Our working hypothesis is that the information for predicting the new word is dominated by a very limited set of words which can be selected heuristically: in this paper, (D is defined as a heuristic function that maps D to one word in D that has the strongest linguistic relation with the word being predicted, as in (8).",
        "This hypothesis is borne out by",
        "an additional experiment we conducted, where we used two words from D that had the strongest relation with the word being predicted; this resulted in a very limited gain in CER reduction of 0.62%, which is not statistically significant (P>0.05 according to the t test).",
        "The EM-like method for learning dependency relations described in Section 3.3 has also been applied to other tasks such as hidden Markov model training (Rabiner, 1989), syntactic relation learning (Yuret, 1998), and Chinese word segmentation (Gao et al., 2002a).",
        "In applying this method, two factors need to be considered: (1) how to initialize the model (i.e. the value of the window size N), and (2) the number of iterations.",

        "We also find that a larger N results in a better initial model but makes the following iterations less effective.",
        "The possible reason is that a larger N generates more initial dependencies and would lead to a better initial model, but it also introduces noise that prevents the initial model from being improved.",

        "We have presented a dependency language model that captures linguistic constraints via a dependency structure – a set of probabilistic dependencies that express the relations between headwords of each phrase in a sentence by an acyclic, planar, undirected graph.",
        "Promising results of our experiments suggest that long-distance dependency relations can indeed be successfully exploited for the purpose of language modeling.",
        "There are many possibilities for future improvements.",
        "In particular, as discussed in Section 6, syntactic dependency structure is believed to capture useful information for informed language modeling, yet further improvements may be possible by incorporating non-syntax-based dependencies.",
        "Correlating the accuracy of the dependency parser as a parser vs. its utility in CER reduction may suggest a useful direction for further research."
