        "Corpus-based methods for syntactic learning and processing are well-established in computational linguistics.",
        "There are comprehensive and carefully worked-out corpus resources available for a number of languages, e.g. the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994) for English or the NEGRA corpus (Skut et al., 1998) for German.",
        "In semantics, the situation is different: Semantic corpus annotation is only in its initial stages, and currently only a few, mostly small, corpora are available.",
        "Semantic annotation has predominantly concentrated on word senses, e.g. in the SENSEVAL initiative (Kilgarriff, 2001), a notable exception being the Prague Treebank (Hajiˇcov´a, 1998) .",
        "As a consequence, most recent work in corpus-based semantics has taken an unsupervised approach, relying on statistical methods to extract semantic regularities from raw corpora, often using information from ontologies like WordNet (Miller et al., 1990).",
        "Meanwhile, the lack of large, domain-independent lexica providing word-semantic information is one of the most serious bottlenecks for language technology.",
        "To train tools for the acquisition of semantic information for such lexica, large, extensively annotated resources are necessary.",
        "In this paper, we present current work of the SALSA (SAarbr¨ucken Lexical Semantics Annotation and analysis) project, whose aim is to provide such a resource and to investigate efficient methods for its utilisation.",
        "In the current project phase, the focus of our research and the backbone of the annotation are semantic role relations.",
        "More specifically, our role annotation is based on the Berkeley FrameNet project (Baker et al., 1998; Johnson et al., 2002).",
        "In addition, we selectively annotate word senses and anaphoric links.",
        "The TIGER corpus (Brants et al., 2002), a 1.5M word German newspaper corpus, serves as sound syntactic basis.",
        "Besides the sparse data problem, the most serious problem for corpus-based lexical semantics is the lack of specificity of the data: Word meaning is notoriously ambiguous, vague, and subject to contextual variance.",
        "The problem has been recognised and discussed in connection with the SENSEVAL task (Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig, 2000).",
        "Annotation of frame semantic roles compounds the problem as it combines word sense assignment with the assignment of semantic roles, a task that introduces vagueness and ambiguity problems of its own.",
        "The problem can be alleviated by choosing a suitable resource as annotation basis.",
        "FrameNet roles, which are local to particular frames (abstract situations), may be better suited for the annotation task than the “classical” thematic roles concept with a small, universal and exhaustive set of roles like agent, patient, theme: The exact extension of the role concepts has never been agreed upon (Fillmore, 1968).",
        "Furthermore, the more concrete frame semantic roles may make the annotators’ task easier.",
        "The FrameNet database itself, however, cannot be taken as evidence that reliable annotation is possible: The aim of the FrameNet project is essentially lexicographic and its annotation not exhaustive; it comprises representative examples for the use of each frame and its frame elements in the BNC.",
        "While the vagueness and ambiguity problem may be mitigated by the using of a “good” resource, it will not disappear entirely, and an annotation format is needed that can cope with the inherent vagueness of word sense and semantic role assignment.",
        "Plan of the paper.",
        "In Section 2 we briefly introduce FrameNet and the TIGER corpus that we use as a basis for semantic annotation.",
        "Section 3 gives an overview of the aims of the SALSA project, and Section 4 describes the annotation with frame semantic roles.",
        "Section 5 evaluates the first annotation results and the suitability of FrameNet as an annotation resource, and Section 6 discusses the effects of vagueness and ambiguity on frame semantic role annotation.",
        "Although the current amount of annotated data does not allow for definitive judgements, we can discuss tendencies."

        "A frame is a conceptual structure that describes a situation.",
        "It is introduced by a target or frame-evoking element (FEE).",
        "The roles, called frame elements (FEs), are local to particular frames and are the participants and props of the described situations.",
        "The aim of FrameNet is to provide a comprehensive frame-semantic description of the core lexicon of English.",
        "A database of frames contains the frames’ basic conceptual structure, and names and descriptions for the available frame elements.",
        "A lexicon database associates lemmas with the frames they evoke, lists possible syntactic realizations of FEs and provides annotated examples from the BNC.",
        "The current on-line version of the frame database (Johnson et al., 2002) consists of almost 400 frames, and covers about 6,900 lexical entries.",
        "Figure 1 shows two frames.",
        "The frame REQUEST involves a FE SPEAKER who voices the request, an ADDRESSEE who is asked to do something, the MESSAGE, the request that is made, the TOPIC that the request is about, and the MEDIUM that is used to convey the request.",
        "Among the FEEs for this frame are the verb ask and the noun request.",
        "In the frame COMMERCIALTRANSACTION (henceforth CT), a BUYER gives MONEY to a SELLER and receives GOODS in exchange.",
        "This frame is evoked e.g. by the verb pay and the noun money.",
        "The TIGER Corpus.",
        "We are using the TIGER Corpus (Brants et al., 2002), a manually syntactically annotated German corpus, as a basis for our annotation.",
        "It is the largest available such corpus (80,000 sentences in its final release compared to 20,000 sentences in its predecessor NEGRA) and uses a rich annotation format.",
        "The annotation scheme is surface oriented and comparably theory-neutral.",
        "Individual words are labelled with POS information.",
        "The syntactic structures of sentences are described by relatively flat trees providing information about grammatical functions (on edge labels), syntactic categories (on node labels), and argument structure of syntactic heads (through the use of dependency-oriented constituent structures, which are close to the syntactic surface).",

        "In the second phase, we will extend these tools for the weakly supervised annotation of a much larger corpus, using the TIGER corpus as training data.",
        "Utilisation.",
        "The SALSA corpus is designed to be utilisable for many purposes, like improving statistical parsers, and extending methods for information extraction and access.",
        "The focus in the SALSA project itself is on lexical semantics, and our first use of the corpus will be to extract selectional preferences for frame elements.",
        "The SALSA corpus will be tagged with the following types of semantic information: FrameNet frames.",
        "We tag all FEEs that occur in the corpus with their appropriate frames, and specify their frame elements.",
        "Thus, our focus is different from the lexicographic orientation of the FrameNet project mentioned above.",
        "As we tag all corpus instances of each FEE, we expect to encounter a wider range of phenomena.",
        "which Currently, FrameNet only exists for English and is still under development.",
        "We will produce a “light version” of a FrameNet for German as a by-product of the annotation, reusing as many as possible of the semantic frame descriptions from the English FrameNet database.",
        "Our first results indicate that the frame structure assumed for the description of the English lexicon can be reused for German, with minor changes and extensions.",
        "Word sense.",
        "The additional value of word sense disambiguation in a corpus is obvious.",
        "However, exhaustive word sense annotation is a highly time-consuming task.",
        "Therefore we decided for a selective annotation policy, annotating only the heads of frame elements.",

        "In our example the SPEAKER is the subject NP SPD, the ADDRESSEE is the direct object NP Koalition, and the MESSAGE is the complex PP zu Gespr¨ach ¨uber Reform.",
        "So far, the frame structure follows the syntactic structure, except for that fact that the FEE, as a separable prefix verb, is realized by two syntactic nodes.",
        "However, it is not always the case that frame structure parallels syntactic structure.",

        "As shown in Fig. 3, frames are annotated as trees of depth one.",
        "Although it might seem semantically more adequate to admit deeper frame trees, e.g. to allow the MSG edge of the REQUEST frame in Fig. 3 to be the root node of the CONVERSATION tree, as its “real” semantic argument, the representation of frame structure in terms of flat and independent semantic trees seems to be preferable for a number of practical reasons: It makes the annotation process more modular and flexible – this way, no frame annotation relies on previous frame annotation.",
        "The closeness to the syntactic structure makes the annotators’ task easier.",
        "Finally, it facilitates statistical evaluation by providing small units of semantic information that are locally related to syntax.",
        "Difficult cases.",
        "Because frame elements may span more than one sentence, like in the case of direct speech, we cannot restrict ourselves to annotation at sentence level.",
        "Also, compound nouns require annotation below word level.",
        "For example, the word “Gagenforderung” (demand for wages) consists of “-forderung” (demand), which invokes the frame REQUEST, and a MESSAGE element “Gagen-”.",
        "Another interesting point is that one word may introduce more than one frame in cases of coordination and ellipsis.",
        "An example is shown in (2).",

        "Annotation process.",
        "Frame annotation proceeds one frame-evoking lemma at a time, using subcor-pora containing all instances of the lemma with some surrounding context.",
        "Since most FEEs are polysemous, there will usually be several frames relevant to a subcorpus.",
        "Annotators first select a frame for an instance of the target lemma.",
        "Then they assign frame elements.",

        "Sentences (4) and (5) exemplify the second problem.",
        "The italicised phrase in (4) may be either a SPEAKER or a MEDIUM and the one in (5) either a MEDIUM or not a frame element at all.",

        "In SALSA, we use the concept of underspecification to handle all three cases: Annotators may assign underspecified frame andframe element tags.",
        "While the cases have different semantic-pragmatic status, we tag all three of them as underspecified.",
        "This is in accordance with the general view on underspecification in semantic theory (Pinkal, 1996).",
        "Furthermore, Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig (2000) argue that it is impossible to distinguish those cases Allowing underspecified tags has several advantages.",

        "This diagnostic information can be used for improving the annotation scheme (e.g. by removing vague distinctions).",
        "Third, underspecified tags may indicate frame relations beyond an inheritance hierarchy, horizontal rather than vertical connections.",

        "For example, the CE of (4) contains the conjunct SPKR(ein Antrag) V MEDIUM (ein Antrag).",
        "Our annotation scheme guarantees that every FE name appears in at most one conjunct of CE.",
        "Exact agreement means that every conjunct of annotator A must correspond to a conjunct by annotator B, and vice versa.",
        "For partial agreement, it suffices that for each conjunct of A, one disjunct matches a disjunct in a conjunct of B, and conversely.",
        "Using this measure of partial agreement, we now evaluate underspecified annotation.",
        "The most striking result is that annotators made little use of underspecification.",

        "underspecification, accounted for roughly half of all underspecification in the REQUEST frame.",
        "63% of the frame element underspecifications are cases of optional elements, the third class in the lower half of Table 2.",
        "(Partial) agreement on underspecified tags was considerably lower than on non-underspecified tags, both in the case of frames (86%) and in the case of frame elements (54%).",
        "This was to be expected, since the cases with underspecified tags are the more difficult and controversial ones.",
        "Since underspecified annotation is so rare, overall frame and frame element agreement including underspecified annotation is virtually the same as in Table 1.",
        "It is unfortunate that annotators use underspecification only infrequently, since it can indicate interesting cases of relatedness between different frames and frame elements.",
        "However, underspecification may well find its main use during the merging of independent annotations of the same corpus.",
        "Not only underspecified annotation, also disagreement between annotators can point out vague and ambiguous cases.",
        "If, for example, one annotator has assigned SPEAKER and the other MEDIUM in sentence (4), the best course is probably to use an underspecified tag in the merged corpus."

        "We presented the SALSA project, the aim of which is to construct and utilize a large corpus reliably annotated with semantic information.",
        "While the SALSA corpus is designed to be utilizable for many purposes, our focus is on lexical semantics, in order to address one of the most serious bottlenecks for language technology today: the lack of large, domain-independent lexica.",
        "In this paper we have focused on the annotation with frame semantic roles.",
        "We have presented the annotation scheme, and we have evaluated first annotation results, which show encouraging figures for inter-annotator agreement.",
        "We have discussed the problem of vagueness and ambiguity of the data and proposed a representation for underspecified tags, which are to be used both for the annotation and the merging of individual annotations.",
        "Important next steps are: the design of a tool for semi-automatic annotation, and the extraction of selectional preferences from the annotated data.",
