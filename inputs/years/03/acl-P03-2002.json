        "To achieve this task, we developed a semantic tagger which annotates words with domain-specific informations and a selection process to extract or reject a word according to the semantic tag and the context.",
        "The rationale behind our approach, is that the relevance of a word depends strongly on how close it is to the SAR domain and its context of use.",
        "We believe that reasoning on semantic tags instead of the word is a way of getting around some of the problems of small-scale corpora.",
        "In this paper, we focus on semantic tagging based on a domain-specific ontology, a dictionary-thesaurus and the overlapping coefficient similarity measure (Manning and Schütze, 2001) to semantically annotate words.",
        "We first describe the corpus (section 2), then the overall IE system (section 3).",
        "Next we explain the different components of the semantic tagger (section 4) and we present the preliminary results of our experiments (section 5).",
