        "A number of multimodal dialogue systems are being developed in the research community.",
        "A common component in these systems is a multimodal input fusion (MMIF) module which performs the functions of collecting the user input supplied in different modalities, determining when the user has finished providing input, fusing the collected information to create a joint interpretation and sending the joint interpretation to a dialogue manager for reasoning and further processing (Oviatt et.",
        "al., 2000).",
        "A general requirement of the MMIF module is to allow flexibility in the user input and to relax any restrictions on the use of available modalities except those imposed by the application itself.",
        "The flexibility and the multiple ways to coordinate multimodal inputs pose a problem in determining, within a short time period after the last input, that a user has completed his or her turn.",
        "A method, Dynamic Time Windows, is proposed to address this issue.",
        "Dynamic Time Windows allows the use of any modality, in any order and time, with very little delay in determining the end of a user turn."

        "When providing composite multimodal input, i.e. input that needs to be interpreted or combined together for proper understanding, the user has flexibility in the timing of those multimodal inputs.",
        "Considering two inputs at a time, the user can input them either sequentially or simultaneously.",
        "A multimodal input may consist of more than two inputs, leading to a large number of composite schemes.",
        "MMIF needs to deal with these complex schemes and determine a suitable time when it is most unlikely to receive any further input and indicate the end of a user turn.",
        "The determination of the end of a user turn becomes a problem because of the following two conflicting requirements:",
        "1.",
        "For naturalness, the user should not be constrained by predefined interaction re",
        "quirements, e.g. to speak within a specified time after touching the display.",
        "To allow this flexibility in the sequential interaction metaphor, the user can provide coordinated multimodal input anytime after providing input in some modality.",
        "Also each modality has a unique processing time requirement due to differing resource needs and capture times e.g. spoken input takes longer compared with touch.",
        "The MMIF needs to consider such delays before sending information to a dialogue manager (DM).",
        "These requirements tend to increase the time to wait for further information from input modalities.",
        "2.",
        "Users would expect the system to respond as soon as they complete their input.",
        "Thus, the fusion module should take as little time as possible before sending the integrated information to the dialogue manager."

        "A multimodal command is defined as multimodal input that can be translated to a system action without the need for dialogue, for example, zooming in a certain area of a map.",
        "On the other hand, multimodal dialogue involved multi-turn interaction in which the user guided the system (or was guided by the system) to provide information or to perform some action.",
        "• When a multimodal command was issued, the user preferred the “information evaluation” and “two input” methods.",
