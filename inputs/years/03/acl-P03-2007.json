        "To improve the unstable performance of a traditional keyword-based search, a Web document should include both an index and index weight that represent the semantic content of the document.",
        "However, most of the previous works on indexing and the weighting function, which depend on statistical methods, have limitations in extracting exact indexes(Moens, 2000).",
        "The objective of this paper is to propose a method that extracts indexes efficiently and weights them according to their semantic importance degree in a document using concept vector space model.",
        "A document is regarded as a conglomerate concept that comprises by many concepts.",
        "Hence, an n-dimensional concept vector space model is defined in such a way that a document is recognized as a vector in n-dimensional concept space.",
        "We used lexical chains for the extraction of concepts.",
        "With concept vectors and text vectors, semantic indexes and their semantic importance degree are computed.",
        "Furthermore, proposed indexing method had an advantage in being independent of document length because we regarded overall text information as a value 1 and represented each index weight by the semantic information ratio of overall text information."

        "Since index terms are not equally important regarding the content of the text, they have term weights as an indicator of importance.",
        "Many weighting functions have been proposed and tested.",
        "However, most weight functions depend on the statistical methods or on the document’s term distribution tendency.",
        "Representative weighting functions include such factors as term frequency, inverse document frequency, the product of the term and inverse document frequency, and length normalization(Moens, 2000).",
        "Term frequency is useful in a long document, but not in a short document.",
        "In addition, term frequency cannot represent the exact term frequency because it does not include anaphoras, synonyms, and so on.",
        "Inverse document frequency is inappropriate for a reference collection that changes frequently because the weight of an index term needs be recomputed.",
        "A length normalization method is proposed because term frequency factors are numerous for long documents, and negligible for short ones, obscuring the real importance of terms.",
        "As this approach also uses term frequency function, it has the same disadvantage as term frequency does.",
        "Hence, we made an effort to use methods based on the linguistic phenomena to enhance the indexing performance.",
