        "In the biomedical area, the number of papers is very large and increases, as it is difficult to search the information.",

        "If the document structures, such as “title”, “sentence”, “author”, and relation between terms are tagged in the texts, then the retrieval is improved by specifying such structures.",
        "Models of the retrieval specifying both structures and words are pursued by many researchers (Chinenyanga and Kushmerick, 2001; Wolff et al., 1999; Theobald and Weilkum, 2000; Deutsch et al., 1998; Salminen and Tompa, 1994; Clarke et al., 1995).",
        "However, these models are not robust unlike keyword-based retrieval, that is, they retrieve only the exact matches for queries.",
        "In the previous research (Masuda et al., 2003), we proposed a new ranking model that enables proximal and structural search for structured text.",
        "This paper investigates an application of the ranked region algebra to information retrieval from large scale but unannotated documents.",
        "We reports in detail what kind of data can be retrieved in the experiments.",
        "Our approach is to annotate documents with document structures and semantic tags by taggers automatically, and to retrieve information by specifying both structures and words using ranked region algebra.",
        "In this paper, we apply our approach to the OHSUMED test collection (Hersh et al., 1994), which is a public test collection for information retrieval in the field of biomedical science but not tag-annotated.",
        "We annotate OHSUMED by various taggers and retrieve information from the tag-annotated corpus.",
        "We have implemented the ranking model in our retrieval engine, and had preliminary experiments to evaluate our model.",
        "In the experiments, we used the GENIA corpus (Ohta et al., 2002) as a small but manually tag-annotated corpus, and OHSUMED as a large but automatically tag-annotated corpus.",
        "The experiments show that our model succeeded in retrieving the relevant answers that an exact-matching model fails to retrieve because of lack of robustness, and the relevant answers that a non-structured model fails because of lack of structural specification.",

        "The region algebra (Salminen and Tompa, 1994; Clarke et al., 1995; Jaakkola and Kilpelainen, 1999) is a set of operators representing the relation between the extents (i.e. regions in texts), where an extent is represented by a pair of positions, beginning and ending position.",
        "Region algebra allows for the specification of the structure of text.",
        "In this paper, we suppose the region algebra proposed in (Clarke et al., 1995).",
        "It has seven operators as shown in Table 1; four containment operators (D, 0, <, 0) representing the containment relation between the extents, two combination operators (A, p) corresponding to “and” and “or” operator of the boolean model, and ordering operator (0) representing the order of words or structures in the texts.",
        "A containment relation between the extents is represented as follows: e = (ps, pe) contains e' = (pps, p�e) iff ps ≤ p's ≤ ppe ≤ pe (we express this relation as e ::1 e').",
        "The result of retrieval is a set of non-nested extents, that is defined by the following function Γ over a set of extents S:",
        "Intuitively, Γ(S) is an operation for finding the shortest matching.",
        "A set of non-nested extents matching query q is expressed as Gq.",
        "For convenience of explanation, we represent a query as a tree structure as shown in Figure 1 (‘[x]’ is a abbreviation of ‘(x) O (/x)’).",
        "This query represents ‘Retrieve the books whose title has the word “retrieval.” ’ The algorithm for finding an exact match of a query works efficiently.",
        "The time complexity of the algorithm is linear to the size of a query and the size of documents (Clarke et al., 1995)."

        "✖✗ This section describes the definition of the relevance between a document and a structured query represented by the region algebra.",
        "The key idea is that a structured query is decomposed into subqueries, and the relevance of the whole query is represented as a vector of relevance measures of subqueries.",
        "Our model assigns a relevance measure of the",
        "structured query as a vector of relevance measures of the subqueries.",
        "In other words, the relevance is defined by the number of portions matched with subqueries in a document.",
        "If an extent matches a subquery of query q, the extent will be somewhat relevant to q even when the extent does not exactly match q.",
        "Figure 2 shows an example of a query and its subqueries.",
        "In this example, even when an extent does not match the whole query exactly, if the extent matches “retrieval” or ‘[title]>“retrieval”’, the extent is considered to be relevant to the query.",
        "Subqueries are formally defined as follows.",
        "Definition 1 (Subquery) Let q be a given query and n1, ..., nm be the nodes of q. Subqueries q1, ..., qm of q are the subtrees of q.",
        "Each qi has node ni as a root node.",
        "When a relevance σ(qi, d) between a subquery qi and a document d is given, the relevance of the whole query is defined as follows.",
        "Definition 2 (Relevance of the whole query) Let q be a given query, d be a document and q1, ..., qm be subqueries of q.",
        "The relevance vector Σ (q, d) ofd is defined as follows: Σ(q, d) = (σ(q1, d), σ(q2, d), ..., σ(qm, d)) A relevance of a subquery should be defined similarly to that of keyword-based queries in the traditional ranked retrieval.",
        "For example, TFIDF, which is used in our experiments in Section 4, is the most simple and straightforward one, while other relevance measures recently proposed (Robertson and Walker, 2000; Fuhr, 1992) can be applied.",
        "TF of a subquery is calculated using the number of extents matching the subquery, and IDF of a subquery is calculated using the number of documents including the extents matching the subquery.",
        "When a text is given as Figure 3 and document collection is {(1,15),(16,30)}, extents matching each subquery in each document are shown in Table 2.",
        "TF and IDF are calculated using the number of extents matching subquery in Table 2.",
        "While we have defined a relevance of the structured query as a vector, we need to arrange the documents according to the relevance vectors.",
        "In this paper, we first map a vector into a scalar value, and then sort the documents according to this scalar measure.",
        "Three methods are introduced for the mapping from the relevance vector to the scalar measure.",
        "The first one simply works out the sum of the elements of the relevance vector.",
        "Definition 3 (Simple Sum)",
        "The second appends a coefficient representing the rareness of the structures.",
        "When the query is A D B or A a B, if the number of extents matching the query is close to the number of extents matching A, matching the query does not seem to be very important because it means that the extents that match A mostly match A D B or A a B.",
        "The case of the other operators is the same as with D and a.",
        "and when the operator op is D or <, the structure coefficient of the query A op B is:",
        "where A and B are the queries and C(A) is the number of extents that match A in the document collection.",
        "The scalar measure ρsc(qi, d) is then defined as",
        "The third is a combination of the measure of the query itself and the measure of the subqueries.",
        "Although we calculate the score of extents by subqueries instead of using only the whole query, the score of subqueries can not be compared with the score of other subqueries.",
        "We assume normalized weight of each subquery and interpolate the weight of parent node and children nodes.",
        "Definition 5 (Interpolated Coefficient) The interpolated coefficient of the query qi is recursively defined as follows: ρic(qi, d) = λ - σ(qi, d) + (1 – λ) Eci ρic(qci, d) l where ci is the child of node ni, l is the number of children of node ni, and 0 < λ < 1.",
        "This formula means that the weight of each node is defined by a weighted average of the weight of the query and its subqueries.",
        "When λ = 1, the weight of a query is normalized weight of the query.",
