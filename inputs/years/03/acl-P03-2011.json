        "The biggest problem for assigning semantic categories to words lies in the incompleteness of dictionaries.",
        "It is impractical to construct a dictionary that will contain all words that may occur in some previously unseen corpora.",
        "This issue is particularly problematic for natural language processing applications that work with Chinese texts.",
        "Specifically, for the Sinica Corpus1, Bai, Chen and Chen (1998) found that articles contain on average 3.51% words that were not listed in the Chinese Electronic Dictionary2 of 80,000 words.",
        "Because novel words are created daily, it is impossible to collect them all.",
        "Furthermore, across most of the corpora, many of these newly coined words seem to be used only once, and thus they may not even be worth collecting.",
        "However, the occurrence of unknown words makes a number of NLP (Natural Language Processing) tasks such as segmentation and word sense disambiguation more difficult.",
        "Consequently, it would be valuable to have some means of automatically assigning meaning to unknown words.",
        "This paper describes a classifier that assigns semantic thesaurus categories to unknown Chinese words.",
        "The Caraballo (1999)’s system adopted the contextual information to assign nouns to their hyponyms.",
        "Roark and Charniak (1998) used the co-occurrence of words as features to classify nouns.",
        "While context is clearly an important feature, this paper focuses on non-contextual features, which may play a key role for unknown words that occur only once",
        "and hence have limited context.",
        "The feature I focus on, following Ciaramita (2002), is morphological similarity to words whose semantic category is known.",
        "Ciaramita (2002) boosted the lexical acquisition system by simple morphological rules and found a significant improvement.",
        "Such a finding suggests that a reliable source of semantic information lies in the morphology used to construct the unknown words.",
        "In Chinese morphology, the two ways to generate new words are compounding and affixation.",
        "Orthographically, such compounding and affixation is represented by combinations of characters, and as a result, the character combinations and the morpho-syntactic relationship used to link them together can be clues for classification.",
        "Furthermore, my analysis of the Sinica Corpus indicates that only 49.68% monosyllabic3 words have one word class, but 91.67% multisyallabic words have one word class in Table 1.",
        "Once characters merge together, only 8.33% words remain ambiguous.",
        "It implies that as characters are combined together, the degree of ambiguity tends to decrease."

        "segments a word into a sequence of morphemes, b) tags the syntactic categories of morphemes, and c) predicts morpho-syntactic relationships between morphemes, such as modifier-head, verb-object and resultative verbs as shown as in Table 3.",
        "For example, if 舞 蹈 家 /wudaojia DANCE-EXPERT ‘dancer’ is an unknown word, the morphological segmentation is 舞蹈/wudao DANCE ‘dance’ and 家/jia EXPERT ‘expert’, and the relation is modifier-head.",

        "To simplify the computation, the probabilities of all leaf nodes are assumed equal.",
        "For example, the probability of Bh is .0064 and the information content of Bh is – log(.0064).",

        "The Chen and Chen (1997) algorithm is a simplification of the Resnik algorithm, which makes the simplifying assumption that the occurrence probability of each leaf node is equal.",
        "One problem for this algorithm is the insufficient coverage of the CiLin (CiLin may not cover all morphemes).",
