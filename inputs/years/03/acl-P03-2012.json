        "Most coreference resolution systems proceed in the following way: they first identify all the possible markables (for example, noun phrases) and then check one by one candidate pairs (markable27 markablej ), trying to find out whether the members of those pairs can be coreferent.",
        "As the final step, the pairs are ranked using a scoring algorithm in order to find an appropriate partition of all the markables into coreference classes.",
        "Those approaches require substantial processing: in the worst case one has to check n(2 1) candidate pairs, where n is the total number of markables found by the system.",
        "However, R. Vieira and M. Poesio have recently shown in (Vieira and Poesio, 2000) that such an exhaustive search is not needed, because many noun phrases are not anaphoric at all – about 50% of definite NPs in their corpus have no prior referents.",
        "Obviously, this number is even higher if one takes into account all the other types of NPs – for example, indefinites are almost always non-anaphoric.",
        "We can conclude that a coreference resolution engine might benefit a lot from a pre-filtering algorithm for identifying non-anaphoric entities.",
        "First, we save much processing time by discarding at least half of the markables.",
        "Second, we can hope to reduce the number of mistakes: without pre-filtering, our coreference resolution system might misclassify a discourse new entity as coreferent to some previous one.",
        "However, such a pre-filtering can also decrease the system’s performance if too many anaphoric NPs are classified as discourse new: as those NPs are not processed by the main coreference resolution module at all, we cannot find correct antecedents for them.",
        "Therefore, we are interested in an algorithm with a good precision, possibly sacrificing its recall to a reasonable extent.",
        "V. Ng and C. Cardie analysed in (Ng and Cardie, 2002) the impact of such a prefiltering on their coreference resolution engine.",
        "It turned out that an automatically induced ±discourse new classifier did not help to improve the overall performance and even decreased it.",
        "However, when more NPs were considered anaphoric (that is, the precision for the +discourse new class increased and the recall decreased), the prefiltering resulted in improving the coreference resolution.",
        "Several algorithms for identifying discourse new entities have been proposed in the literature.",
        "R. Vieira and M. Poesio use hand-crafted heuristics, encoding syntactic information.",
        "For example, the noun phrase “the inequities of the current landownership system” is classified by their system as +discourse new, because it contains the restrictive postmodification “of the current landownership system”.",
        "This approach leads to 72% precision and 69% recall for definite discourse new NPs.",
        "The system described in (Bean and Riloff, 1999) also makes use of syntactic heuristics.",
        "But in addition the authors mine discourse new entities from the corpus.",
        "Four types of entities can be classified as non-anaphoric:",
        "1. having specific syntactic structure, 2. appearing in the first sentence of some text in the training corpus, 3. exhibiting the same pattern as several expressions of type (2), 4. appearing in the corpus at least 5 times and always with the definite article (“definites-only”).",
        "Using various combinations of these methods, D. Bean and E. Riloff achieved an accuracy for definite non-anaphoric NPs of about 81 – 82% (F-measure), with various combinations of precision and recall.1 This algorithm, however, has two limitations.",
        "First, one needs a corpus consisting of many small texts.",
        "Otherwise it is impossible to find enough non-anaphoric entities of type (2) and, hence, to collect enough patterns for the entities of type (3).",
        "Second, for an entity to be recognized as “definite-only”, it should be found in the corpus at least 5 times.",
        "This automatically results in the data sparseness problem, excluding many infrequent nouns and NPs.",
        "In our approach we use machine learning to identify non-anaphoric noun-phrases.",
        "We combine syntactic heuristics with the “definite probability”.",
        "Unlike Bean and Riloff, we model definite probability using the Internet instead of the training corpus itself.",
        "This helps us to overcome the data sparseness problem to a large extent.",
        "As it has been shown recently in (Keller et al., 2002), Internet counts produce reliable data for linguistic analysis, correlating well with corpus counts and plausibility judgements.",
        "The rest of the paper is organised as follows: first we discuss our NPs classification.",
        "In Section 3, we describe briefly various data sources we used.",
        "Section 4 provides an explanation of our learning strategy and evaluation results.",
        "The approach is summarised in Section 5."

        "In our study we follow mainly E. Prince’s classification of NPs (Prince, 1981).",
        "Prince distinguishes between the discourse and the hearer givenness.The resulting taxonomy is summarised below:",
        "• brand new NPs introduce entities which are both discourse and hearer new (“a bus”), subclass of them, brand new anchored NPs contain explicit link to some given discourse entity (“a guy I work with”), • unused NPs introduce discourse new, but hearer old entities (“ Noam Chomsky ”), • evoked NPs introduce entities already present",
        "in the discourse model and thus discourse and hearer old: textually evoked NPs refer to entities which have already been mentioned in the previous discourse (“he” in “A guy I worked with says he knows your sister”), whereas situationally evoked are known for situational reasons (“you” in “Would you have change of a quarter?”), .",
        "inferrables are not discourse or hearer old, however, the speaker assumes the hearer can infer them via logical reasoning from evoked entities or other inferrables (“the driver” in “I got on a bus yesterday and the driver was drunk”), containing inferrables make this inference link explicit ( “one of these eggs”).",
        "For our present study we do not need such an elaborate classification.",
        "Moreover, various experiments of Vieira and Poesio show that even humans have difficulties distinguishing, for example, between inferrables and new NPs, or trying to find an anchor for an inferrable.",
        "So, we developed a simple taxonomy following the main Prince’s distinction between the discourse and the hearer givenness.",
        "First, we distinguish between discourse new and discourse old entities.",
        "An entity is considered discourse old ( – discourse-new) if it refers to an object or a person mentioned in the previous discourse.",
        "For example, in “The Navy is considering a new ship that [..] The Navy would like to spend about $ 200 million a year on the arsenal ship..” the first occurrence of “The Navy” and “a new ship” are classified as +discourse new, whereas the second occurrence of “The Navy” and “the arsenal ship” are classified as – discourse-new.",
        "It must be noted that many researchers, in particular, Bean and Riloff, would consider the second “the Navy” non-anaphoric, because it fully specifies its referent and does not require information on the first NP to be interpreted successfully.",
        "However, we think that a link between two instances of “the Navy” can be very helpful, for example, in the Information Extraction task.",
        "Therefore we treat those NPs as discourse old.",
        "Our – discourse-new class corresponds to Prince’s textually evoked NPs.",
        "Second, we distinguish between uniquely and non-uniquely referring expressions.",
        "Uniquely referring expressions (+unique) fully specify their referents and can be successfully interpreted without any local supportive context.",
        "Main part of the +unique class constitute entities, known to the hearer (reader) already at the moment when she starts processing the text, for example “The Mount Everest”.",
        "In addition, an NP (unknown to the reader in the very beginning) is considered unique if it fully specifies its referent due to its own content only and thus can be added as it is (maybe, for a very short time) to the reader’s World knowledge base after the processing of the text, for example, ”John Smith, chief executive of John Smith Gmbh” or “the fact that John Smith is a chief executive ofJohn Smith Gmbh”.",
        "In Prince’s terms our +unique class corresponds to the unused and, partially, new.",
        "In our Navy example (cf. above) both occurrences of “The Navy” are considered +unique, whereas “a new ship” and “the arsenal ship” are classified as – unique."
