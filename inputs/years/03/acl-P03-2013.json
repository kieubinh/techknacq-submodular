        "Moreover, Japanese speakers find this segment quite “coherent,” even though there seems to be no surface level indication of who is eating or seeing, or whose eyes are being mentioned in this four-clause discourse segment.1 However, this is not always the case with Japanese as a Second Language (JSL) learners.2 What constitutes “coherence” has been studied by many researchers.",

        "How many zeros are contained in (1), for example, largely depends on how zeros are defined.",
        "In the literature, zeros are usually defined as elements recoverable from the valency requirements of the predicate with which they occur.",
        "However, does this cover all the zeros in Japanese?",
        "Does this explain all the content connectivity created by nominal ellipsis in Japanese?",
        "In this paper, we introduce a subgroup of zeros, what we call “zero adnominals,” in contrast to other well-recognized “zero arguments” and investigate possible approaches to recognizing these newly-defined zeros, in an attempt to incorporate them in an automatic zero detecting tool for JSL teachers that aims to promote effective instruction of zeros.",
