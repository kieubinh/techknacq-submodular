        "The utilization of language technology for the creation of hyperlinks has a long history (e.g., Allen et al., 1993).",
        "Information extraction (IE) is a technology that can be applied to identifying both sources and targets of new hyperlinks.",
        "IE systems are becoming commercially viable in supporting diverse information discovery and management tasks.",
        "Similarly, automatic hyperlinking is a maturing technology designed to interrelate pieces of information, using ontologies to define the relationships.",
        "With ExtraLink, we present a novel information system that integrates both technologies in order to reach at an improved level of informativeness and comfort.",
        "Extraction and link generation occur completely in the background.",
        "Entities identified by the IE system are mapped into a domain ontology that relates concepts to a structured selection of predefined hyperlinks, which can be directly visualized on demand using a standard web browser.",
        "This way, the user can, while reading a text, immediately link up textual information to the Internet or to any other document base without accessing a search engine.",
        "The quality of the link targets is much higher than with standard search engines since, first of all, only domain-specific interpretations are sought, and second, the ontology provides additional structure, including related information.",
        "ExtraLink uses as its IE system SProUT, a generic multilingual shallow analysis platform, which currently provides linguistic processing resources for English, German, Italian, French, Spanish, Czech, Polish, Japanese, and Chinese (Becker et al., 2002).",
        "SProUT is used for tokenization, morphological analysis, and named entity recognition in free texts.",
        "In Section 2 to 4, we describe innovative features of SProUT.",
        "Section 5 gives details about the ExtraLink demonstrator."

      "text": [
        "The main motivation for developing SProUT comes from the need to have a system that (i) allows a flexible integration of different processing modules and (ii) to find a good trade-off between processing efficiency and linguistic expressiveness.",
        "On the one hand, very efficient finite state devices have been successfully applied to real-world applications.",
        "On the other hand, unification-based grammars (UBGs) are designed to capture fine-grained syntactic and semantic constraints, resulting in better descriptions of natural language phenomena.",
        "In contrast to finite state devices, unification-based grammars are also assumed to be more transparent and more easily modifiable.",
        "SProUT’s mission is to take the best from these two worlds, having a finite state machine that operates on typed feature structures (TFSs).",
        "I.e., transduction rules in SProUT do not rely on simple atomic symbols, but instead on TFSs, where the left-hand side of a rule is a regular expression over TFSs, representing the recognition pattern, and the right-hand side is a sequence of TFSs, specifying the output structure.",
        "Consequently, equality of atomic symbols is replaced by unifiability of TFSs and the output is constructed using TFS unification w.r.t.",
        "a type hierarchy.",
        "Such rules not only recognize and classify patterns, but also extract fragments embedded in the patterns and fill output templates with them.",
        "Standard finite state techniques such as minimization and determinization are no longer applicable here, due to the fact that edges in our automata are annotated by TFSs, instead of atomic symbols.",
        "However, not every outgoing edge in such an automaton must be analyzed, since TFS annotations can be arranged under subsumption, and the failure of a general edge automatically causes the failure of several, more specialized edges, without applying the unifiability test.",
        "Such information can in fact be precompiled.",
        "This and other optimization techniques are described in (Krieger and Piskorski, 2003).",
        "When compared to symbol-based finite state approaches, our method leads to smaller grammars and automata, which usually better approximate a given language."

      "text": [
        "XTDL combines two well-known frameworks, viz., typed feature structures and regular expressions.",
        "XTDL is defined on top of TDL, a definition language for TFSs (Krieger and Schäfer, 1994) that is used as a descriptive device in several grammar systems (LKB, PAGE, PET).",
        "Apart from the integration into the rule definitions, we also employ TDL in SProUT for the establishment of a type hierarchy of linguistic entities.",
        "In the example definition below, the morph type inherits from sign and introduces three more morphologically motivated attributes with the corresponding typed values: morph := sign & [ POS atom, STEM atom, INFL infl ].",
        "A rule in XTDL is straightforwardly defined as a recognition pattern on the left-hand side, written as a regular expression, and an output description on the right-hand side.",
        "A named label serves as a handle to the rule.",
        "Regular expressions over TFSs describe sequential successions of linguistic signs.",
        "We provide a couple of standard operators.",
        "Concatenation is expressed by consecutive items.",
        "Disjunction, Kleene star, Kleene plus, and optionality are represented by the operators |, *, +, and ?, resp.",
        "{n} after an expression denotes an n-fold repetition.",
        "{m,n} repeats at least m times and at most n times.",
        "The XTDL grammar rule below may illustrate the syntax.",
        "It describes a sequence of morphologically analyzed tokens (of type morph).",
        "The first TFS matches one or zero items (?)",
        "with part-of-speech Determiner.",
        "Then, zero or more Adjective items are matched (*).",
        "Finally, one or two Noun items ({1,2}) are consumed.",
        "The use of a variable (e.g., #1) in different places establishes a coreference between features.",
        "This example enforces agreement in case, number, and gender for the matched items.",
        "Eventually, the description on the RHS creates a feature structure of type phrase, where the category is coreferent with the category Noun of the rightmost token(s), and the agreement features corefer to features of the morph tokens.",
        "The choice of TDL has a couple of advantages.",
        "TFSs as such provide a rich descriptive language over linguistic structures and allow for a fine-grained inspection of input items.",
        "They represent a generalization over pure atomic symbols.",
        "Unifia-bility as a test criterion in a transition is a generalization over symbol equality.",
        "Coreferences in feature structures express structural identity.",
        "Their properties are exploited in two ways.",
        "They provide a stronger expressiveness, since they create dynamic value assignments on the automaton transitions and thus exceed the strict locality of constraints in an atomic symbol approach.",
        "Furthermore, coreferences serve as a means of information transport into the output description on the RHS of the rule.",
        "Finally, the choice of feature structures as primary citizens of the information domain makes composition of modules very simple, since input and output are all of the same abstract data type.",
        "Functional (in contrast to regular) operators are a door to the outside world of SProUT.",
        "They either serve as predicates, helping to locate complex tests that might cancel a rule application, or they construct new material, involving pieces of information from the LHS of a rule.",
        "The sketch of a rule below transfers numerals into their corresponding digits using the functional operator normalize() that is defined externally.",
        "For instance, \"one\" is mapped onto \"1\", \"two\" onto \"2\", etc.",

        "The core of SProUT comprises of the following components: (i) a finite-state machine toolkit for building, combining, and optimizing finite-state devices; (ii) a flexible XML-based regular compiler for converting regular patterns into their corresponding compressed finite-state representation (Piskorski et al., 2002); (iii) a JTFS package which provides standard operations for constructing and manipulating TFSs; and (iv) an XTDL grammar interpreter.",
        "Currently, SProUT offers three online components: a tokenizer, a gazetteer, and a morphological analyzer.",
        "The tokenizer maps character sequences to tokens and performs fine-grained token classification.",
        "The gazetteer recognizes named entities based on static named entity lexica.",

        "The XTDL-based grammar engineering platform has been used to define grammars for English, German, French, Spanish, Chinese and Japanese allowing for named entity recognition and extraction.",
        "To guarantee a comparable coverage, and to ease evaluation, an extension of the MUC-7 standard for entities has been adopted.",
        "Given the expressiveness of XTDL expressions, MUC-7/MET-2 named entity types can be enhanced with more complex internal structures.",
        "For instance, a person name ne person is defined as a subtype of enamex with the above structure.",
        "The named entity grammars can handle types such as person, location, organization, time point, time span (instead of date and time defined by MUC), percentage, and currency.",

        "SProUT is being used by several sites in both research and industrial contexts.",
