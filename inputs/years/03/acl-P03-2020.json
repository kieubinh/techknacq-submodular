        "This study aims to realize an automatic method of collecting technical terms that are related to a given seed term.",
        "In case “natural language processing” is given as a seed term, the method is expected to collect technical terms that are related to natural language processing, such as morphological analysis, parsing, information retrieval, and machine translation.",
        "The target application of the method is automatic or semi-automatic compilation of a glossary or technical-term dictionary for a certain domain.",
        "Recursive application of the method enables to collect a list of terms that are used in a certain domain: the list becomes a glossary of the domain.",
        "A technical-term dictionary can be compiled by adding an explanation for every term in the glossary, which is performed by term explainer (Sato, 2001).",
        "Automatic acquisition of technical terms in a certain domain has been studied as automatic term recognition (Kageura and Umino, 1996; Kageura and Koyama, 2000), and the methods require a large corpus that are manually prepared for a target domain.",
        "In contrast, our system, which is proposed in this paper, requires only a seed word; from this seed word, the system compiles a corpus from the Web by using search engines and produces a dozen technical terms that are closely related to the seed word."

        "The first step, compiling corpus, produces a corpus Cs for a seed term s. In general, compiling corpus is to select the appropriate passages from a document set.",
        "We use the Web for the document set and select the passages that describe s for the corpus.",
        "The actual procedure of compiling corpus is:",
        "For a given seed term s, the system first makes four queries: “s toha”, “s toiu”, “s ha”, and “s”, where toha, ha, and toiu are Japanese functional words that are often used for defining or explaining a term.",
        "Then, the system collects the top K (= 100) pages at maximum for each query by using a search engine.",

        "We send all four queries to Goo but only the query “s” to Infoseek, because Infoseek usually returns the same result for the four queries.",

        "There are several choices for implementing the checking program.",
        "Our choice is to use the Web via a search engine.",
        "A search engine returns a number, hit, which is an estimated number of pages that satisfy a given query.",

        "We have decided that we use search engine Goo for H(x), and determined Min = 100 and Max = 100, 000, based on preliminary experiments.",

        "The candidate terms can be classified from the viewpoint of term composition.",
        "Under a given seed term, we introduce the following five types for classification.",
        "Type 0 the given seed term s: e.g., (natural language processing) Type 1 a term that contains s: e.g., ■ ■ (natural language processing system) Type 2 a term that is a subsequence of s: e.g., ■ ■ (natural language) Type 3 a term that contains at least a component of s: e.g., ■ ■ (language analysis) Type 4 others: e.g., E (parsing) The reason why we introduce these types is that the following rules are true with a few exception: (1) A type-1 term is a narrower term of the seed term s; (2) A type-2 term is a broader term of the seed term s. We assume that these rules are always true: they are used to determine whether x is a broader or narrower term of s. To measure the relation degree, we use conditional probabilities, which are calculated from search engine hits.",
        "where H(s ∧ x) = “the number of pages that contain both s and x” One of two probabilities is equal to or greater than a given threshold Z, the system decides that x is closely related to s. We use Z = 0.05 as the threshold.",
        "In summary, our relation test is: If x is type-1 or type-2; or P(s |x) ≥ 0.05 or P(x |s) ≥ 0.05 then x is closely related to s. The result of the filtering step for “M ■ (natural language processing)” is in Table 1; a",

        "From these fifty terms, the system collected 610 terms in total; the average number of output terms per input is 12.2 terms.",
        "We checked whether each of the 610 terms is a correct related term of the original seed term by hand.",
        "The result is shown in the left half (Evaluation I) of Table 2.",
        "In this evaluation, 519 terms out of 610 terms were correct: the precision is 85%.",
        "From this high value, we conclude that the system can be used as a tool that helps us compile a glossary.",
        "Second, we tried to examine the recall of the system.",
        "It is impossible to calculate the actual recall value, because the ideal output is not clear and cannot be defined.",
        "To estimate the recall, we first prepared three to five target terms that should be collected from each seed word, and then checked whether each of the target terms was included in the system output.",
        "We counted the number of target terms in the following five cases.",
        "The right half (Evaluation II) in Table 2 shows the result.",
        "S: the target term was collected by the system.",
        "F: the target term was removed in the filtering step.",
        "A: the target term existed in the compiled corpus, but was not extracted by automatic term extraction.",
        "C: the target term existed in the collected web pages, but did not exist in the compiled corpus.",
        "R: the target term did not exist on the collected web pages.",
        "Only 43 terms (20%) out of 210 terms were collected by the system.",
        "This low recall primarily comes from the failure of automatic term recognition (case A in the above classification).",
        "Improvement of this step is necessary.",
        "We also examined whether each of the 210 target terms passes the filtering step.",
        "The result was that 133 (63%) terms passed; 44 terms did not satisfy the condition H(x) ≥ 100; 15 terms did not satisfy the condition H(x) ≤ 100, 000; and 18 terms did not pass the relation test.",
        "These experimental results suggest that the ATR step may be replaced with a simple and exhaustive term collector from a corpus.",
        "We have a plan to examine this possibility next."
