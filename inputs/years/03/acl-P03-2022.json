        "At first, learning data was produced by defining four attributes to measure frequency change of word quantitatively, these four attributes were extracted automatically from electronic texts.",
        "According to the comparison between the evaluation of the decision tree results and manually (Human) results, F-measures of increasing, relatively constant and decreasing classes were 0.847, 0.851, and 0.768 respectively, and the effectiveness of this method is achieved."

        "To estimate quantitatively the frequency change in the time-series variation of words in each class, this method defines four attributes (proper nouns attributes, slope of regression line, slice of regression line, and correlation coeficient) that are extracted automatically from past texts data.",
