        "Automatic speech translation has been one of prospective applications of the speech and language technology (Lavie et al., 1997; Sugaya et al., 1999; Watanabe et al.",
        "2000).",
        "One common target application has been communication assistance for travelers in a foreign travel situation.",
        "In this situation, the user will want to carry the translation device and use it in an open space, rather than sit in a computer room in front of a display.",
        "An obvious approach is to build a standalone speech translation device that is compact enough to carry around (Watanabe et al., 2000; Isotani et al., 2002).",
        "This approach is getting realistic with recent progress of hardware devices such as fast embedded CPUs and small batteries.",
        "However, because of current limitation in the amount of available computational resource, a standalone system has to compromise the speech translation accuracy.",
        "In a client-server speech translation system, it is easier to provide better quality and more functionality to the users, using abundant computational resource provided by the server machines.",
        "If the situation allows use of powerful backend server machines, that is preferable to standalone systems.",
        "In the Verbmobil system (Wahlster, 2000), mobile phones were used as the client device.",
        "The voice input to a mobile phone is sent to the central speech translation server as an ordinary speech data over the telephone network.",
        "A disadvantage of this approach is the narrow bandwidth of the telephone network connection.",
        "Even though an acoustic model can be trained with telephone-quality speech data, the lack of higher frequency information in the human voice affects the speech recognition accuracy.",
        "Introduction of 3G mobile phones will change this in the future, but it will take some time before they come into wider use in the world.",
        "Recently, wireless LAN is getting popular as a means for Internet connection.",
        "Wireless LAN connection, such as Wi-Fi (802.1 1b), provides high-speed mobile Internet access in a limited area using standard Internet Protocol.",
        "Its speed is generally enough to transmit high-quality voice for speech recognition.",
        "It is an attractive possibility for a client-server speech translation system.",
        "We developed a client-server speech translation system using PDAs with wireless LAN connectivity as clients.",
        "A client PDA sends a voice input to the server over a wireless LAN connection, and the server performs bidirectional speech translation between Japanese and English.",
        "In the next section we show an overview of the system.",
        "Section 3 and section 4 describe the speech recognition module and the machine translation module, respectively.",

        "It consists of Japanese and English speech recognition modules, Japanese-English bidirectional machine translation modules, Japanese and English speech synthesis modules and a system control module.",
        "The dictionary contains about 50K Japanese words and about 20K English words.",
        "Figure 2 shows the relation of the client and the server.",
        "The client PDA provides the user interface, and the server performs speech translation processing.",
        "The client is connected to the server by TCP/IP over wireless LAN connection (802.1 1b).",
        "The client PDA accepts the voice from the microphone, sends it to the server, receives the translated voice and outputs it from a speaker.",
        "Multiple clients can be connected to the server simultaneously.",
        "Input speech is converted into digital data with 16bit monaural 22 KHz sampling.",
        "Transmission of this raw data requires a speed more than 352Kbps",
        "(bit per second).",
        "Although it is well below the generally available speed for wireless connection, we applied G.722 speech compression algorithm to reduce the rate to 88Kbps.",
        "The original G.722 reduces a 256Kbps stream to 64Kbps (namely 1/4), and the same core algorithm is applied to a 352Kbps stream.",
        "With a lower transmission rate, more clients can simultaneously perform speech translation task.",
        "In addition, the task becomes doable even in a less stable (slower) connection.",
        "A preliminary evaluation showed that this speech compression did not affect the speech recognition accuracy."

        "The output is sent to the corresponding speech synthesis module.",
        "In travel conversation, colloquial expressions are frequently used, which seldom appear in written texts such as newspapers.",
        "The module has to deal with highly word-specific phenomena included in such colloquial and idiomatic expressions, as well as general expressions obeying more abstract, standard grammar.",
        "In other words, the module is required to deal with both instance-specific example-like knowledge and abstract rule-like knowledge at the same time.",
        "With this requirement in mind, we employed the Lexicalized Tree AutoMata-based Grammar (LTAM Grammar) as the grammar formalism (Yamabana et al., 2000).",
        "This method is in line with the strong-lexicalization approach to the grammar (Schabes et al., 1988), where each grammar rule (tree) is associated with at least one word, making all the rules lexical.",
        "An advantage of the LTAM Grammars to other strongly lexicalized grammars is an existence of a simple bottom-up chart-parsing algorithm, which is a natural extension of the context-free grammar case.",
        "Figure 4 is an overview of the bidirectional machine translation module.",
        "It uses a combined lexicalized grammar dictionary, instead of having the grammar and the dictionary separately.",

        "A preliminary evaluation of the machine translation quality was conducted using 500 randomly-chosen sentences from travel conversation corpus.",
        "A bilingual evaluator classified the translation results into three categories: Good, Understandable and Bad.",
        "A Good sentence should have no syntactic errors and its meaning has to be correctly understood.",
        "Understandable sentences may have some errors, but the central meaning of the original sentence must be conveyed without misunderstanding.",
        "If the translation does not convey the central meaning of the original text, or if it causes a misunderstanding, it is classified as Bad.",
        "With this subjective measure, the ratio of Good or Understandable sentences, i.e. sentences with which the meaning of the original sentence was properly conveyed, was 88% for the Japanese-to-English translation, and 90% for the English-to-Japanese translation.",
        "The ratio of Good sentences was 66% for the J to E translation, and 74% for the E to J translation.",
        "Compared to a standalone system, the developed system has better speech translation accuracy, and a quick response.",
        "In addition, future expansion to other domains and languages, for a wider use of speech translation, will be easier.",
        "An obvious disadvantage is the limitation of the area where a client can be used.",
        "However, it will not be an essential obstruction if the service area is naturally limited, for example, to the inside of a shop or a building.",
        "In this situation, the system will be able to provide a location-sensitive service, because the client location can be easily assumed with the Wireless LAN connectivity.",

        "In the developed system, we modified the PDA hardware so that an external compact microphone is usable.",
        "This problem may disappear in the near future, since some PDAs are equipped with external microphone jacks recently.",
        "Another remaining issue is an inferior reliability of the wireless connection, which should be solved in the near future.",
