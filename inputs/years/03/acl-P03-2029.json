        "WSD has been recognized as one of the most important subjects in natural language processing, especially in machine translation, information retrieval, and so on (Ide and V´eronis, 1998).",
        "Most of previous supervised methods can be classified into two major ones; approach based on association, and approach based on selectional restriction.",
        "The former uses some words around a target word, represented by n-word window.",
        "The latter uses some syntactic relations, say, verb-object, including necessarily a target word.",
        "However, there are some words that one approach gets good result for them while another gets worse, and vice versa.",
        "For example, suppose that we want to distinguish between “go off or discharge” and “terminate the employment” as a sense of “fire”.",
        "Consider the sentence in Brown Corpus1 :",
        "The words such as “musket”, “loaded” and “bird shot” would seem useful in deciding the sense of “fire”, and serve as clue to leading the sense to “go off or discharge”.",
        "It seems that there is no clue to another sense.",
        "For this case, an approach based on association is useful for WSD.",
        "However, an approach based on selectional restriction would not be appropriate, because these clues do not have the direct syntactic dependencies on “fire”.",
        "On the other hand, consider the sentence in EDR Corpus: Police said Haga was immediately fired from the force.",
        "The most significant fact is that “Haga” (a person’s name) appears as the direct object of “fire”.",
        "A selectional restriction approach would use this clue appropriately, because there is the direct dependency between “fire” and “Haga”.",
        "However, an association approach would make an error in deciding the sense, because “Police” and “force” tend to be a noise, from the point of view of an unordered set of words.",
        "Generally, an association does not use a syntactic dependency, and a selectional restriction uses only a part of words appeared in a sentence.",
        "In this paper, we present a new method for WSD, which uses syntactic dependencies for a whole sentence as a clue.",
        "They contain both of all words included in a sentence and all syntactic dependencies in it.",
        "Our method is based on a technique of pairwise alignment, and described in the following two sections.",
        "Using our method, we have gotten appropriate sense for various cases including above examples.",
        "In section 4, we describe our experimental result for WSD on some verbs in SENSEVAL-1 (Kilgarriff, 1998)."

      "heading": "2 Our Method",
      "text": [
        "Our method has the features on an association and a selectional restriction approach both.",
        "It can be applied with the various sentence types because our method can treat a local (direct) and a whole sentence dependency.",
        "Our method is based on the following steps; Step 1.",
        "Parse the input sentence with syntactic parser2, and find all paths from root to leaves in the resulting dependency tree.",
        "Step 2.",
        "Compare the paths from Step 1. with prototype paths prepared for each sense of the target word.",
        "Step 3.",
        "Find a summation of similarity between each prototype and input path for each sense.",
        "Step 4.",
        "Select the sense with the maximum value of the summation.",
        "We describe our method in detail in the followings.",
        "In our method, we consider paths from root to leaves in a dependency tree.",
        "For example, consider the sentence “we consider a path in a graph”.",
        "This sentence has three leaves in the dependency structure, and consequently has three paths from root to leaves; (consider, SUB, we), (consider, OBJ, path, a) and (consider, OBJ, path, in, graph, a).",
        "“SUB” and “OBJ” in the paths are the elements added automatically using some rules in order to make a remarkable difference between verb-subject and verb-object.",
        "We think this sequence structure of word would serve as a clue to WSD very well, and we regard a set of the sequences obtained from an input sentence as the context of a target word.",
        "The general intuition for WSD is that words with similar context have the same sense (Charniak, 1993; Lin, 1997).",
        "That is, once we prepare the prototype sequences for each sense, we can determine the sense of the target word as one with the most similar prototype set.",
        "We measure a similarity between a set of prototype sequences T and a set of sequences from input sentence TV.",
        "Let T and T' have a set of sequences, PT = { p1, p2, • • • , pn } and",
        "fire, SUB, person fire, OBJ, [weapon, rocket] fire, [on, upon, at], physical object fire, *, load, [into, with], weapon fire, *, setup, OBJ, weapon fire: terminate the employment fire, SUB, company fire, OBJ, [person, people, staff] fire, from, organization fire, *, hire fire, *, job",
        "PT, _ {pi , p2, ... , p' } respectively.",
        "pi and p'' are sequences of words.",
        "We define the similarity between T and T', sim (T, T'), as following:",
        "sim (T, T') is not commutative.",
        "That is, sim (T, T') sim (T',T).",
        "alignment (pi,pj') is an alignment score between the sequences pi andp'j, defined in the next section.",
        "fi is a weight function characteristic of the sequence pi, defined as following:",
        "vi otherwise where ui and vi are arbitrary constants and ti is arbitrary threshold.",
        "Using equation (1), we can estimate a similarity between the context of a target word and prototype context, and can determine the sense of a target word by selecting the prototype with the maximum similarity.",
        "An example of the prototype sequences for verb “fire” is shown in Figure 1.",
        "A prototype sequence is represented like a regular expression.",
        "For the present, we obtain the sequence by hand.",
        "The basic policy to obtain prototypes is to observe the common features on dependency trees in which target word is used in the same sense.",
        "We have some ideas about a method to obtain prototypes automatically."
