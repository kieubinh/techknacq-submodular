        "The difficulty of compound noun analysis is that the effective way of describing the semantic relations in compounds has not been identified.",

        "Rather, it should take into account the construction of the analysis model.",
        "The previous work proposed semantic approaches based on semantic categories (Levi, 1978; Isabelle, 1984; Iida et al., 1984) had proposed detailed analysis of relations between constituents in compound nouns.",
        "Some of approaches (Fabre, 1996; Johnston and Busa, 1998) take the framework of Generative Lexicon (GL) (Pustejovsky, 1995).",
        "Semantic approaches are especially well designed but they should still clarify the complete lexical factors needed for analysis model.",
        "Probabilistic approaches (Lauer, 1995; Lapata, 2002) have been proposed to disambiguate semantic relations between constituents in compounds.",
        "Their experimental results show a high performance, but only for shallow analysis of compounds using semantically tagged corpora.",
        "To be fully effective, they also need to incorporate factors that are effective in disambiguating semantic relations.",
        "It is therefore necessary to clarify what kinds of factors are related to the mechanisms that govern the relations in compounds.",
        "Against this background, we have carried out a research which aims at clarifying how lexical semantics contribute to, independently of languages, the relations in compound nouns.",
        "This paper proposes a principled approach for the analysis of semantic relations between constituents in compound nouns based on the theoretical framework of lexical conceptual structure (LCS), and shows that the framework originally developed on the basis of Japanese compound noun data works well for both Japanese and English compound nouns."
