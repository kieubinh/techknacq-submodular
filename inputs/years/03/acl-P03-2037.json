        "This paper proposes an automatic method of detecting grammar elements that decrease readability in a Japanese sentence.",

        "By defining a readability level for every grammar element, we can find which part of the sentence is difficult to read."

        "We always prefer readable texts to unreadable texts.",

        "In English, measuring readability as reading age is well studied (Johnson, 1978).",
        "The reading age is the chronological age of a reader who could just understand the text.",
        "The value is usually calculated from the sentence length and the number of syllables.",
        "From this value, we find whether a text is readable or not for readers of a specific age; however, we do not find which part we should rewrite to improve readability when the text is unreadable.",
        "The goal of our study is to present tools that help rewriting work of improving readability in Japanese.",
        "The first tool is to help detect the sentence fragments (words and phrases) that should be rewritten; in other words, it is a checker of “hard-to-read” words and phrases in a sentence.",
        "Such a checker can be realized with two components: the check list and its detector.",
        "The check list provides check items and their readability levels.",
        "The detector is a program that searches the check items in a sentence.",
        "From the detected items and their readability levels, we can identify which part of the sentence is difficult to read.",

        "Conjugation: the form of a verb or an adjective changes appropriately to the proceed word.",

        "TCS describes grammar elements in two ways.",
        "In the first way, a grammar element is described as a 3-tuple: its name, its patterns, and its example sentences.",
        "The following 3-tuple is an example of the grammar element that belongs to Level 4.",
        "Grammar elements of Level 3 and Level 4 are conjugations, functional words and sentential patterns that are defined in this first way.",
        "In the second way, a grammar element is described as a pair of its patterns and its examples.",
        "The following pair is an example of the grammar element that belongs to Level",
        "(When visiting the teacher’s home) Grammar elements of Level 1 and Level 2 are functional phrases that are defined in this second way.",
        "We decided to use this example-based definition for the check list, because the check list should be independent from the implementation of the detector.",
        "If the check list depends on detector’s implementation, the change of implementation requires change of the check list.",
        "Each item of the check list is defined as a 3-tuple: (1) readability level, (2) name, and (3) a list of example pairs.",
        "There are four readability levels according",
        "to the Japanese Language Proficiency Test.",
        "An example pair consists of an example sentence and an instance of the grammar element.",
        "It is an implicit description of the pattern detecting the grammar element.",
        "For example, the check item for ‘Adjective (predicative, negative, polite)’ is shown as follows, Level 4 Name Adjective (predicative, negative, polite) Test Pairs kono heya ha hiroku nai desu.",
        "The instance ■ /hirokunaidesu/ consists of three morphemes: (1) ■ /hiroku/, the adjective means ‘large’ in renyo form, (2) ■ /nai/, the adjective means ‘not’ in root form, and (3) ■ /desu/, the auxiliary verb ends a sentence politely.",
        "So, this test pair represents implicitly that the grammar element can be detected by a pattern “Adjective(in renyo form) + nai + desu”.",
