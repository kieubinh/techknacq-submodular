        "Reasoning about locations is essential for many NLP tasks, such as, for example, Information Extraction.",
        "Knowledge on place names comes normally from a Named Entity Recognition module.",
        "Unfortunately, most state-of-the-art Named Entity Recognition systems support very coarse-grained classifications and thus can distinguish only between locations and non-locations.",
        "One of the main components of a Named Entity Recognition system is a gazetteer – a huge list of preclassified entities.",
        "It has been shown in (Mikheev et al., 1999) that a NE Recognition system performs reasonably well for most classes even without gazetteers.",
        "Locations, however, could not be reliably identified (51,7% F-measure without gazetteers compared to 94,5% with a full gazetteer).",
        "And obviously, when one needs more sophisticated classes, including various types of locations, gazetteers should become even more important.",
        "One possible solution would be to create gazetteers manually, using World atlases, lists of place names on the Web, and already existing digital collections, such as (ADL, 2000).",
        "This task is only feasible, of course, when those resources have compatible formats and, thus, can be merged automatically.",
        "Otherwise it becomes very time-consuming.",
        "Manually compiled gazetteers can provide high-quality data.",
        "Unfortunately, these resources have some drawbacks.",
        "First, some items can simply be missing.",
        "For example, the atlases (Knaur, 1994), (Philip, 2000), and (Collins, 2001), we used in our study, do not list small islands, rivers, and mountains.",
        "Such gazetteers contain only positive information: if X is not classified as an ISLAND, we cannot say whether there is really no island with the name X, or simply the gazetteer is not complete.",
        "Another problem arises, when one wants to change the underlying classification, for example, subdividing CITY into CAPITAL and NON-CAPITAL.",
        "In this case it might be necessary to reclassify all (or substantial part of) the items.",
        "When done manually, it again becomes a very time-consuming task.",
        "Finally, geographical names vary across languages.",
        "It takes a lot of time to adjust a French gazetteer to German, moreover, such a resource can hardly bring a lot for languages with non-Latin alphabets, for example, Armenian or Japanese.",
        "Even collecting different variants of proper names in one language is a non-trivial task.",
        "One possible solution was proposed in (Smith, 2002).",
        "At least some information on almost any particular location already exists somewhere on the Internet.",
        "The only problem is that this knowledge is highly distributed over millions of web pages and, thus, difficult to find.",
        "This leads us to a conclusion that one can explore standard Data Mining techniques in order to induce gazetteers from the Internet (semi-)automatically.",
        "As it has been shown recently in (Keller et al., 2002), Internet counts produce reliable data for linguistic analysis, correlating well with corpus statistics and plausibility judgments.",
        "In this paper we present an approach for learning geographical gazetteers using very scarce resources.",
        "This work is a continuation of our previous study (Ourioupina, 2002), described briefly in Section 3.",
        "In the previous work we obtained collocational information from the Internet, using a set of manually precompiled patterns.",
        "The system used this information to learn six binary classifiers, determining for a given word, whether it is a CITY, ISLAND, RIVER, MOUNTAIN, REGION, and COUNTRY.",
        "Although the previous approach helped us to reduce hand-coding drastically, we still needed some manually encoded knowledge.",
        "In particular, we spent a lot of time looking for a reasonable set of patterns.",
        "In addition, we had to compile a small gazetteers (see Section 2 for details) to be able to train and test the system.",
        "Finally, we were only able to classify items, provided by users, and not to get new place names automatically.",
        "Classifiers, unlike gazetteers, produce negative information (X is not an ISLAND), but they are slower due to the fact that they need Internet counts.",
        "A combination of classifiers and gazetteers would do the job better.",
        "In our present study we attempt to overcome these drawbacks by applying bootstrapping, as described in (Riloff and Jones, 1999).",
        "Bootstrapping is a new approach to the machine learning task, allowing to combine efficiently small portion of labeled (seed) examples with a much bigger amount of unlabeled data.",
        "E. Riloff and R. Jones have shown, that even with a dozen of preclassi-fied items, bootstrapping-based algorithms perform well if a reasonable amount of unlabeled data is available.",
        "It must be noted, however, that Riloff and Jones run their algorithm on a carefully prepared balanced corpus.",
        "It is not a priori clear, whether bootstrapping is suitable for such noisy data as the World Wide Web.",
        "S. Brin describes in (Brin, 1998) a similar approach aiming at mining (book title, author) pairs from the Internet.",
        "Although his system was able to extract many book pairs (even some very rare ones), it needed a human expert for checking its results.",
        "Otherwise the books list could quickly get infected and the system’s performance deteriorate.",
        "This problem is extremely acute when dealing with huge noisy datasets.",
        "In our approach we apply bootstrapping techniques to six classes.1 Comparing obtained results we are able to reduce the noise substantially.",
        "Additionally, we use Machine Learning to select the most reliable candidates (names and patterns).",
        "Finally, we used the seed examples and learned classifiers not only to initialize and continue the processing, but also as another means of control over the noise.",
        "This allows us to avoid expensive manual checking.",
        "The approach is described in detail in Section 4 and evaluated in Section 5."

        "However, incorporating additional classes is not problematic.",
        "As the classes may overlap (for example, Washington belongs to the classes CITY, REGION, ISLAND and MOUNTAIN), the problem was reformulated as six binary classification tasks.",
        "Our main dataset consists of 1260 names of locations.",
        "Most of them were sampled randomly from the indexes of the World Atlases (Knaur, 1994), (Collins, 2001), and (Philip, 2000).",
        "However, this random sample contained mostly names of very small and unknown places.",
        "In order to balance it, we added a list of several countries and well-known locations, such as, for example, Tokyo or Hokkaido.",
        "Finally, our dataset contains about 10% low-frequency names (<20 Web pages pro name), 10% high-frequency names (>1000000 pages pro name, the most frequent one (California) was found by AltaVista in about 25000000 pages), and 80% medium-frequency ones.",
        "These names were classified manually using the above mentioned atlases and the Statoids webpage (Law, 2002).",
        "The same dataset was used in our previous experiments as well.",
        "An example of the classification is shown in table 1.",
        "For the present study we sampled randomly 100 items of each class from this gazetteer.",

        "As many names refer to several geographical objects, those lists overlap to some extent (for example, Victoria is both in the ISLAND and MOUNTAIN lists).",
        "Altogether the lists contain 520 different names of locations.",
        "The remaining part of the gazetteer (740 items) was reserved for testing.",
        "Both training and testing items were preclassified by hand: although Washington is only in the MOUNTAIN list, the system knows that it can be a CITY, a REGION, or an ISLAND as well (we also tried to relax this requirement, consider section 5.2 for details)."

        "The initial algorithm works as follows.",
        "For each class we constructed a set of patterns.",
        "All the patterns have the form “KEYWORD+of+X” and “X+KEYWORD”.",
        "Each class has from 3 (ISLAND) up to 10 (MOUNTAIN) different keywords.",
        "For example, for the class ISLAND we have 3 keywords (“island”, “islands”, “archipelago”) and 5 corresponding patterns (“X island”, “island of X”, “X islands”, “islands of X”, “X archipelago”).",
        "Keywords and patterns were selected manually: we tested many different candidates for keywords, collected counts (cf. bellow) for the patterns associated with a given candidate, then filtered most of them out using the t-test.",
        "The remaining patterns were checked by hand.",
        "For each name of location to be classified, we construct queries, substituting this name for the X in our patterns.",
        "We do not use morphological variants here, because morphology of proper names is quite irregular (compare, for example, the noun phrases Fijian government and Mali government – in the first case the proper name is used with the suffix -an, and in the second case – without it).",
        "The queries are sent to the AltaVista search engine.",
        "The number of pages found by AltaVista for each query is then normalized by the number of pages for the item to be classified alone (the pattern “X”, without keywords).",
        "Obtained queries (normalized and raw) are then provided to a machine learner as features.",
        "In our previous work we compared two machine learners (C4.5 and TiMBL) for this task.",
        "In our present study we use the Ripper machine learner (Cohen, 1995).",
        "The main reasons for this decision are the following: first, Ripper selects the most important features automatically, and the classifier usually contains less features than, for example, the one from C4.5.",
        "This is very important when we want to classify many items (that is exactly what happens at the end of each bootstrapping loop in our approach), because obtaining values for the features requires much time.",
        "We use our training set (520 items, cf. above) to train Ripper.",
        "The testing results (on remaining 740 items) are summarized in table 2.",
        "Compared to our original system as it was described in (Ourioupina, 2002), Ripper performed better than C4.5 and TiMBL on a smaller (320 words) training set, but slightly worse than the same learners in leave-one-out (i.e. on 1259-words training sets).",

        "However, this approach is not feasible, when dealing with such a huge noisy dataset as the Internet.",
        "Therefore we have chosen another solution: we rescore the patterns, exploiting the idea that general patterns should originally have high scores for several classes.",
        "Thus, we can compare the results for all the lists and penalize the patterns appearing in more than one of them.",
        "Currently we use a very simple formula for calculating new scores – the penalties for all the classes, except the one we are interested in, are summed up and then subtracted from the original score:",

        "This would allow us to organize classes in hierarchical way, possibly leading to useful generalizations.",
        "As the third step, we take the best patterns (currently 20 best patterns are considered) and use them in the same way we did it with the manually preselected patterns for the initial system: for each name in the training set, we substitute this name for X in all our patterns, go to the AltaVista search engine and collect corresponding counts.",

        "We ask AltaVista for all the pages, containing LEFT and RIGHT simultaneously.",
        "Then we check whether our pattern occurs in the returned files, and, if so, how exactly X is realized.",

        "In the first experiment they were all classified as [+CITY, +REGION], making the REGION data very noisy.",
        "In the second experiment we were able to increase the performance by 4.6%, classifying some of them as [+CITY, – REGION].",
        "CITIES, on the contrary, suffered a lot from the new learning strategy.",
        "First, about a half of names in the dataset are CITIES.",
        "Second, there are only few items, belonging to CITY and some other class, that are used rather seldom as [+CITY] (one of few examples is China – [+CITY, +COUNTRY]).",
        "This resulted in a very poor performance for CITIES, when the classifier is trained on positives only.",
        "We also ran our bootstrapping system using only positive example for learning.",
        "The results are summarized in table 8.",
        "For the easier classes (ISLAND, RIVER, MOUNTAIN, COUNTRY) the system performs very well.",
        "Moreover, the classifiers are almost always better than those we’ve got at the first experiment.",
        "However, one big problem arises – with this setup the system has much less control over the noise, as there are no completely correct data available at all.",
        "In particular, the system can not overcome two difficulties.",
        "First, it is not able to extract reliable patterns for CITY at the second loop and, thus, make such an improvement as we have seen in the previous section.",
        "Second, the system can not defeat the “departments” items, appeared on the REGION list after the first bootstrapping iteration.",
        "As a result, REGIONS’ performance decreases dramatically and it seems to be no way to repair the situation later.",
        "Overall, when trained on the gazetteer, the system improved significantly (2.7% on average) between the first and the second loops, the improvement affecting mainly two most difficult classes.",
        "On the contrary, when trained on positive examples only, the system improved only slightly (0.6% on average), and in rather useless manner."

        "We described an approach to the automatic acquisition of geographical gazetteers from the Internet.",
        "By applying bootstrapping techniques, we are able to learn new gazetteers starting from a small set of preclassified examples.",
        "This approach can be particularly helpful for the Named Entity Recognition task in languages, where no manually collected geographical resources are available.",
        "Apart from gazetteers, our system produce classifiers.",
        "They use Internet counts (acquired from the AltaVista search engine) to classify any entity online.",
        "Unlike gazetteers, classifiers also provide negative information: the fact, that Washington is not a RIVER, can be obtained from a classifier, whereas gazetteers can only tell us, that they do not contain any Washington river, but still, there is a chance that such a river exists.",
        "The bootstrapping approach performed reasonably well on this task – 86.5% accuracy on average after the second iteration.",
        "Moreover, high control over the noise allow the system to improve exactly on the classes with originally poor performance (CITY and REGION).",
        "There is still a lot of work to be done.",
        "First, we plan to include new classes, such as, for example, SEA, and organize them in a hierarchy.",
        "In this case we will have to investigate patterns’ distributions over classes more carefully and elaborate our rescoring strategy.",
        "Second, we plan to extend our approach to cover multi-words expressions.",
        "A half of this problem is already solved – our classifiers can deal with such names as Sri Lanka.",
        "So, we need to adjust our items extraction step to this task.",
        "We also plan to investigate more sophisticated sampling techniques to get rid of initial fully classified data.",
        "Although our first experiments with the learning from positive examples only were not very successful, we still hope to solve this problem.",
        "It would allow us to simply download seed datasets from the Internet and start processing with these partially classified data, instead of compiling a high-quality seed gazetteer manually.",
        "Finally, we plan two related experiments.",
        "The same approach can be used for classifying names into locations instead of time (for example, Edmonton is in Alberta/Canada).",
        "We also want to try the same algorithm in another language, preferably with a non-Latin alphabet.",
        "The output may be quite useful, as there are not so many geographical knowledge bases available for languages other than English."
