        "Names referring to entities can be ambiguous because different entities may have been given the same name.",
        "When one encounters foreign place names within English texts, further complication arises because the English alphabet may not represent the native writing uniquely or adequately, and transliteration has to be employed.",
        "This is true for Chinese place names.",
        "In this information age, documents on Chinese events such as news stories, commentaries, reviews, analysis, can originate from various sources and languages other than Chinese.",
        "Authors may reference Chinese place names but not necessary accompany it with the actual Chinese characters.",
        "It is therefore useful to build an automatic algorithm to decode such a place name in English and map it to the original Chinese character representation.",
        "Chinese language is written as a contiguous string of ideographs (characters) without white space.",
        "Geographic names of most cities, provinces, mountains, etc are two to four characters long.",
        "Border regions have longer place names.",
        "Unlike person names, there is not a preferred closed set for family name characters.",
        "Any of the over 6K GB-encoded character is theoretically admissible as part of a place name.",
        "When one refers to them in English text, one needs to represent them using English alphabets – a process of romanization.",
        "Two main systems exist for this process: Pinyin, official in Mainland China, and Wade-Giles convention, popular in Taiwan (see e.g. http://www.romanization.com).",
        "Their objective is to spell out the pronunciation of the Chinese characters with alphabets.",
        "Unfortunately, although written Chinese is by and large uniform (except for a few hundred characters that have simplified vs. traditional forms), spoken Chinese can vary from region to region with different dialects.",
        "The Pinyin system was introduced by the PRC government in the 1950’s.",
        "It attempts to standardize the representation according to the official Beijing Potunghua dialect (Northern China Mandarin) for the whole country.",
        "The Wade-Giles system is an older convention designed by authors of the same names in the late 19th and early 20th century, and is popular in Taiwan and some parts of South-East Asia.",
        "There are also other haphazard romanization conventions in different regions where Chinese is used.",
        "For example, Hong Kong has its own British colonial history and Southern (GuangDong) dialect, and entity names are often spelt differently.",
        "The representation ‘Hong Kong’ itself is neither Pinyin nor Wade-Giles.",
        "It should have been ‘Xiang Gang’ in the former, and ‘Hsiang Kang’ in the latter.",
        "This is also true for ‘Singapore’.",
        "In this investigation, we will mainly focus on the Pinyin convention.",
        "This is used by most of the Chinese (PRC) and there has been discussion in Taiwan to adopt it even though there are still political obstacles around this issue.",
        "There is evidence that this system is gaining popularity in the U.S. as the default choice (Library of Congress 2000).",
        "This paper investigates methods of recovering a Chinese place name in GB-encoding (the character codes used for simplified Chinese characters) when its English Pinyin is given.",
        "We have previously built a system PYName (Kwok and Deng 2002) to back-transliterate Chinese person names.",
        "This paper extends it to provide similar functionality for place names.",
        "It is a tool to help reduce ambiguity in cross language geographic entity reference, and would be useful for cross language information retrieval.",
        "The organization of this paper is as follows: Section 2 discusses some properties of Pinyin place names.",
        "Section 3 discusses the use of frequencies to help back-transliteration.",
        "Section 4 describes GeoName, our system to map English Pinyin place names to Chinese characters.",
        "Section 5 contains some evaluation of Geoname, and Section 6 contains our conclusion and future work."

        "The mapping from Chinese character to Pinyin is more or less unique because the majority of Chinese characters have only one sound (with some exceptions).",
        "Given a Pinyin, however, there can be many homophonic candidate characters depending on which sound it is.",
        "When one encounters such a Pinyin entity ambiguity can arise.",
        "Even if the context specifies the place precisely, there is still uncertainty as to its original character representation.",
        "This is true for all entity types rendered into Pinyin unless they are well known.",
        "As an example, the capital of China, Beijing, originates from the characters: J L 4 Bei; ;5: 4 jing.",
        "However, when back-transliterating from the English, the following are some of the possible mappings: Bei 4 {JU, �, �, �, f, �, &, �, ...} Jing 4{;5:, � , ff, 0, �, � , �, �, ...} Candidates like: JUff, �;5:, JU�, ... are all possible place names in addition to the intended one.",
        "In fact, these two are highly fertile Pinyin: ‘Bei’ maps to 23 and ‘jing’ maps to 20, leading to a total of 460 possible pairs.",
        "Many of the pairs of course may not be used as place names.",
        "It is possible to diminish the above ambiguity by capturing also the tone of a Pinyin character as is done in most Chinese input systems that accept Pinyin as input.",
        "The simplest convention has five tones.",
        "One tone can be assigned to each character represented as Pinyin, and this can separate the mapped characters into tonal sets.",
        "However, most printed or electronic texts such as newspapers or newswires do not have tones assigned.",
        "Our system assumes input texts have no tonal indication, and so can be adapted to online text processing.",
        "Chinese place names are mostly two to three characters long.",
        "Four-character names exist and longer ones are possible.",
        "Unlike person names where the family name character is selected from a fairly closed set, character use is practically unrestricted for places.",
        "This means that when mapping a Pinyin representation into its original Chinese format, one can result in x^y candidates, where y is the average number of possible single character mappings for each of x syllables.",
        "To further complicate the issue, place names in Pinyin can be separated with white spaces or not.",
        "For example, the representation for ���, a place near Beijing, can be written as: 'Qin Huang Dao', ‘QinHuangDao’ or 'Qinhuangdao'.",
        "The first item shows the original character one by one separated by a white space.",
        "The second item is a composite Pinyin denoting that the three individual Pinyin should be treated as a single entity.",
        "Each individual Pinyin character however is initialized with a capital letter.",
        "The third item is like the second composite but without capital letter except for the first character.",
        "(For example, on 3/25/03, the New York Times reported a coalmine explosion at ‘Mengnanzhuang’ employing this style.)",
        "All three styles can be found in texts.",
        "The first two indicate unique segmentation of the Pinyin characters.",
        "The third style however presents the additional problem of segmentation: how to recover the characters correctly.",
        "The string 'Qinhuangdao' may be broken up as 'Qin huang dao', 'Qin huang da o', ‘Qin hu ang dao’, etc.",
        "because it so happens that the listed components -- call them syllables -- are all legitimate Pinyin.",
        "Thus, the ‘Qinhuangdao’ composite can be either a three-, four or five-character entity.",
        "One can imagine the exponential increase in candidates if each Pinyin syllable maps back to ~10 possibilities, for example.",
        "There is a fourth style that employs an apostrophe to indicate syllable separation in case of extreme ambiguity such as: Xian ( R province) and Xi’an (A�r the city).",
        "This is very useful, like style one or two.",
        "Unfortunately, none of these is mandatory."

To estimate P(C), we initially used a bigram model: P(C)~P(c1)*P(c2|c1)*P(c3|c2)..*P(cN|cN-1) which turns out to be less effective than the following heuristic approach.",
        "Instead of probability, we work with occurrence frequencies of the string itself, bigrams, and single characters.",

        "It is generally true that for a character string matching some dictionary entries or previous use, the longer the length, the more legitimate it is.",
        "The issues raised in Section 2 are addressed as follows.",
        "Many Pinyin of the third style do lead to unique segmentation.",
        "For those that do not, all possible segmentations are captured, but they are sorted longest spelling sequence (and minimum syllables) first: e.g. in the previous example, ‘Qin huang dao’ is preferred over ‘Qin hu ang dao’.",
        "The candidates (c1 c2 c3.. cN) for Eqn.1 are limited to all possible combinations of characters that exist in the training data and can be mapped from the segmented Pinyin.",
