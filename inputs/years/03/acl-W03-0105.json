        "But many applications also require grounding – i.e., associating each classified text span with a referent in the world or some model thereof.",
        "The current paper discusses spatial grounding of named entities that may be referentially ambiguous, using a minimality heuristic that is informed by external geographic knowledge sources.",
        "We then apply these ideas to the creation of “visual surrogates” for news articles.",

        "Gazetteers are large lists of names of geographic entities, usually enriched with further information, such as their class (e.g., town, river, dam, etc.",
        "), their size, and their location (i.e. with respect to some relative or absolute coordinate system such as longitude and latitude).",
        "Appendix A identifies some publicly available sources.",
        "UN-LOCODE is the official gazetteer by the United Nations; it is also freely available from the UNECE Web sites and contains more than 36 000 locations in 234 countries (UNECE, 1998).",
        "The Alexandria Gazetteer (Smith et al., 1996; Frew et al., 1998) is another database of geographical entities, including both their coordinates and relationships such as: in-state-of, in-province-of, in-county-of, in-country-of, in-region-of, part-of and formerly-known-as.",
        "To date, Named Entity Recognition (NER) has only used gazetteers as evidence that a text span could be some kind of place name (LOCATION), even though their finite nature makes lists of names of limited use for classification (Mikheev et al., 1999).",
        "Here we use them for spatial grounding – relating linguistic entities of subtype LOCATION (Grishman and Sundheim, 1998) to their real-world counterparts.",
        "“World Atlases” and the gazetteers that index them are not the only resources than can be used for grounding spatial terms.",
        "In biomedicine, there are are several brain atlases of different species, using various different techniques, and focussing on both normal and disease state; as well as a digital atlas of the human body",
        "based on data from the Visible Human project.",
        "Such atlases and the nomenclatures that label their parts, provide an important resource for biomedical research and clinical diagnosis.",

        "One example of this would be in providing support for the curation of the Gene Expression Database (GXD).4 This support could come in the form of a named entity recognizer for anatomical parts in text, with grounding against the Mouse Atlas, using the gazetteer-like information in the MAN.",
        "So what is the relationship between a place name gazetteer like UN-LOCODE and the Mouse Atlas?",
        "The MAN is structured in a similar part-of hierarchy to that of geographical locations: USA embryo California organ system San Mateo County cardiovascular system Redwood City heart Because both gazetteers like UN-LOCODE and biomedical atlases like the Mouse Atlas provide spatial grounding for linguistic terms (Figure 2), both can be used to reason about spatio-temporal settings of a discourse, for instance, to resolve referential ambiguity."

        "There are many places that share the same (Berlin, Germany Berlin, WI, USA) or similar names (York, UK New York, USA), usually because historically, the founders of a new town had given it a similar or the same name as the place they emigrated from.",
        "When ambiguous place names are used in conversation or in text, it is usually clear to the hearer what specific referent is intended.",
        "First, speaker and hearer usually share some extralinguistic context and implicitly adhere to Grice’s Cooperative Principle and the “maxims” that follow, which require a speaker to provide more identifying information about a location that the recipient is believed to be unfamiliar with.",
        "Secondly, linguistic context can provide clues: an accident report on the road between Perth and Dundee promotes an interpretation of Perth in Scotland, while an accident on the road between Perth and Freemantle promotes an interpretation of Perth in Western Australia.",
        "Computers, which are bound to select referents algorithmically, can exploit linguistic context more easily than extralinguistic context, but even the use of linguistic context requires (as always) some subtle heuristic reasoning.",
        "Grounding place names mentioned in a text can support effective visualization – for instance, in a multimedia document surrogate that contains textual, video and map elements (e.g. in a question answering scenario), where we want to ensure that the video shows the region and the map is centered around the places mentioned.",
        "To make use of linguistic context in resolving ambiguous place names, we apply two different minimality heuristics (Gardent and Webber, 2001).",
        "The first we borrow (slightly modified) from work in automatic word sense disambiguation (Gale et al., 1992), calling it “one referent per discourse”.",
        "It assumes that a place name mentioned in a discourse refers to the same location throughout the discourse, just as a word is assumed to be used in the same one sense throughout the discourse.",
        "Neither is logically necessary, and hence both are simply interpretational biases.",
        "The second minimality heuristic assumes that, in cases where there is more than one place name mentioned in some span of text, the smallest region that is able to ground the whole set is the one that gives them their interpretation.5 This can be used to resolve referential ambiguity by proximity: i.e., not only is the place name Berlin taken to denote the same Berlin throughout a discourse unless mentioned otherwise,6 but so does a Potsdam men",
        "tioned together with a Berlin uniquely select the capital of Germany as the likely referent from the set of all candidate Berlins.7 To illustrate this “spatial minimality” heuristic, consider Figure 3: Assume that a mention of place A in a text could either refer to A or A .",
        "If the text also contains terms that ground unambiguously to I, J, and K, we assume the referent of A is A rather than A because the former leads to a smaller spatial context.",
        "To use this “spatial minimality” heuristic, we start by extracting all place names using a named entity recognizer.",
        "We then look up the “confusion set” of potential referents for each place name, e.g. for Berlin: Berlin, FRG (German capital); Berlin, WI, USA; Berlin, NJ, USA; Berlin, CT, USA; Berlin, NH, USA; Berlin, GA, USA; Berlin, IL, USA; Berlin, NY, USA; Berlin, ND, USA; Berlin, NJ, USA .",
        "Each member of the set of potential referents is associated with its spatial coordinates (longitude/latitude), using a gazetteer.",
        "We then compute the crossproduct of all the confusion sets.",
        "(Each member of the crossproduct contains one potential referent for each place name, along with its spatial coordinates.)",
        "For each member of the cross-product, we compute the area of the minimal polygon bounding all the potential referents, and select as the intended interpretation, the one with the smallest area.",
        "The resulting behaviour is",
        "shown in Figure 4: depending on contextually mentioned other places, a different Berlin is selected.",
        "The value of this heuristic needs to be assessed quantitatively against various types of text.",
        "In resolving anatomical designators in text, we may employ a variation of the spatial minimality heuristic, based on the fact that no listing will ever be complete with respect to all the existing or new-minted synonyms for anatomical terms.",
        "When grounding the anatomical terms in the text In subsequent stages until birth, cytokeratin 8 continues to be expressed in embryonic taste buds distributed in punctuate patterns at regular intervals along rows that are symmetrically located on both sides of the median sulcus in the dorsal anterior developing tongue.",
        "we find no median sulcus within the MAN, only alveolar sulcus, optic sulcus, pre-otic sulcus, sulcus limitans and sulcus terminalis.",
        "We just assume that all anatomical terms refer to previously recognized anatomical entities, just as we assume that all geographic terms refer to existing geographic entities and not, for example, some new town called “Berlin” or “London” that is not yet in the gazetteer.",
        "Hence median sulcus is assumed to be a synonym for one of the five sulci given in the MAN.",
        "At this point, we can invoke the spatial minimality heuristic, looking for the minimal bounding space that includes tongue and one of the five sulci, here yielding “sulcus terminalis”.",
        "Thus the spatial minimality heuristic is here pairwise point-point distances, or symbolically, using a hierarchical gazetteer’s relations, such as in-region-of.",
        "The usefulness of visual representations to convey information is widely recognized (cf. (Larkin and Simon, 1987)).",
        "Here, we use the grounding of named entities in news stories to create a visual surrogate that represents their “spatial aboutness”.",
        "Two news stories were selected from online newspapers on the same day (2003-02-21): one story (Appendix B) reports the tragic death of a baby from London in a Glasgow hospital despite flying it to a Glasgow specialist hospital in the Royal aircraft (BBC News, 2003), and the other report (Appendix C) describes the search of the Californian police for a pregnant women from Modesto, CA, who has disappeared (The Mercury News, 2003).",
        "We use the term “surrogate” to refer to a partial view of a text (e.g. (Leidner, 2002)).",
        "Figure 5 shows a textual surrogate in the form of all place names found in a text: an analyst who wants to get a quick overview about the locations involved in some item of news reportage, to decide its local interest or relevance, might find such a surrogate helpful, although the source would still have to be skim-read."
