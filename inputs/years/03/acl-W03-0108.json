        "Many questions about geographic term disambiguation are standardly handled in a statistical framework: for example, we can ask that, in the absence of contextual information, with what probability does the word Madison refer to a person (e.g. James Madison), an organization (e.g. Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan), or a place (e.g. Madison, Wisconsin), and if no other disambiguation alternative exists, we can expect these three numbers to sum to 1 (i.e. behave like probabilities).",
        "However, there are many other questions where a strictly probability-based framework is less appropriate.",
        "In particular, much of the information that could be used to disambiguate spatial references in natural language text is strongly non-local in character, and as we increase the amount of this background information, eventually we reach the point when the amount of training data per parameter is so low that there is no repeatable experiment to base probabilities on.",
        "In such cases, “probabilities” are effectively used as a stand-in for what is really our confidence in one judgment or another.",
        "In this paper we describe some of the methods used in a purely confidence-based geographic term disambiguation system that crucially relies on the notion of “positive” and “negative” context.",
        "Far more information is contained in unstructured text (such as the Web and message traffic) than in structured databases, so automatically processing ambiguous geographic references unlocks a large amount of informa",
        "tion.",
        "Adding spatial dimensions to the document search systems requires new algorithms for determining the relevance of documents.",
        "We describe methods for combining confidence-based disambiguation with measures of relevance to a user’s query.",
        "It has become clear after several decades of artificial intelligence research that automated general natural language understanding is not feasible yet.",
        "However, we have been able to make progress by restricting our effort to the well-defined domain of geographic concepts, using statistical methods on extremely large corpora.",
        "To cope with billions of documents, we have built fast algorithms for extracting and disambiguating geographic",
        "information and fast database algorithms specifically for information which has a spatial component.",
        "One form of information retrieval made possible by extracting geographic meaning in large corpora is geographic text search.",
        "Users are presented with an interface containing a traditional text search form combined with a map.",
        "They can zoom in on areas of the world that are of interest, and results of textual queries are plotted on the map (Figure 1).",
        "Other forms of data exploration are also made possible, such as exploring the spatial density pattern of documents satisfying a textual query (Figure 2).",
        "In Section 2 we explore challenges of finding geographic meaning in natural language texts and give examples of typical ambiguities.",
        "In Section 3 we introduce some of our methods for determining geographic meaning in natural language.",
        "In Section 4 we describe some of the methods of determining geographic meaning during real-time processing.",
        "In Section 5 we describe some of our training methods.",
        "In Section 6 we describe methods for combining confidence-based disambiguation with measures of relevance to a user’s query.",
        "2 Challenges of finding geographic meaning in natural language text Like other references in natural language text, geographic references are often highly underspecified and ambiguous.",
        "To take an extreme example, when encountering a reference to Al Hamra, the task is to determine which of the 65 places in the world with that name is being referred to, or even whether a place is being referred to at all, for the phrase also means red in Arabic.",
        "The same applies to the more than two dozen US towns named Madison.",
        "In fact, the majority of references to places are ambiguous in this way.",
        "Human beings have a remarkable ability to derive useful information from ambiguous and underspecified references using real-world knowledge and experience, by deriving fuzzy rules from experience and knowing when to apply them.",
        "MetaCarta imitates this process using combinations of heuristics and data mining.",
        "For example, when encountering a mention of Al Hamra, a human analyst may notice that the rest of the document is focused on a region of Oman.",
        "Even if there is no mention of Oman itself, a mention of the nearby place Safil in the same document makes it likely that the Al Hamra in Oman is referred to.",
        "Even though there is another place named Safil in Iran, the towns of Safil and Al Hamra in Oman are close to each other, while there is no Al Hamra close to Safil, Iran.",
        "People also apply real-world knowledge gained in other contexts: they know, for example, that a reference to a place called Madison, in the absence of a state, is more likely to refer to Madison, Wisconsin than the smaller Madison, Iowa; and they know that James Madison and the Madison family do not refer to places at all.",
        "Similarly they know that Ishihara does not refer to a place, even though there is a Japanese town of that name, if a government minister named Ishihara is being mentioned.",
        "Moreover, much of the information people use to disambiguate references is not contained within the document itself, but is in the form of experience gained from reading many other documents.",
        "When encountering a name, people have various associations with the uses of this name they have seen before, and have a rough idea of how often it referred to places."

        "To deal with ambiguity, for every potential reference of a name n to a point p, we estimate c(p, n), the confidence that n really refers to p. The relevance of the document to each mentioned location must also be determined, in order to present the results that best satisfy the need for both correctness and relevance to a query, as described in Section 6.",
        "There are two main phases of processing involved in the extraction of geographic information: training on large corpora, and real-time processing of a document.",
        "In order to index large volumes of documents in a reasonable time, documents must be processed at a rate of at least a hundred documents per second on a single workstation.",

        "The quality of training depends on the quality of the seed, so as the system for the real-time processing of documents improves, we iterate the training process.",
