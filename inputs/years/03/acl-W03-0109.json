        "Geographical information is spatialised information, information so to speak anchored in a geographical space.",
        "This characteristic is immediately visible on geographical documents, which describe how some phenomena (often quantified, either in a numeric or qualitative manner) are related with a spatial and also, often, temporal localisation.",
        "Figure 1 gives an example of this informational structure, extracted from our favourite corpus (Hérin, 1994), relative to the educational system in France.",
        "As a consequence a natural way to query documents will be through a 3-dimensional topic, Phenomenon-Space-Time as shown in Figure 2.",
        "The goal is to select passages that fulfil the whole bunch of criteria and to return them to the user in relevance order.",
        "The system we designed and currently develop for that purpose is divided in two tasks: an off-line one, devoted to linguistic analysis of the text, and an online one concerning querying itself.",
        "Let’s give an overall view of the process, focusing on the spatial dimension of texts and analysis.",
        "Other aspects of the project, including especially the analysis of expressions denoting phenomena, techniques used to link the three components of information (Space, Time, Phenomena) and implementation issues can be found in (Bilhaut, 2003).",
        "Concerning text analysis, the goal is to locate, extract and analyse the expressions which refer to some geographical localisation 1 so that they act as indexes of text passages.",
        "The first remark to do is that we have to cope (in general) with complex nominal expressions, not only named geographical entities, as exemplified in figure 3.",

        "The conclusion is that a literal matching of \"queries\" against \"text expressions\" simply can’t do.",
        "Expressions (and queries) must receive a linguistic analysis, discovering their structure and producing some kind of semantic representation.",

        "The first step will be to apply the same linguistic analysis, producing a symbolic representation of the same nature as what was extracted from text.",
        "We have then to perform some matching between (the representations of) the query and the text.",
        "This is not a trivial task, as the reader can guess, considering expressions and queries in figures 2 and 3.",
        "To achieve this task, we will use referential information associated with named geographical entities (long-lat coordinates) together with some computation exploiting the symbolic representations produced by the linguistic analysis.",
        "A (prospective) sketch of this process is described in section 3.",
        "Summing up to situate the project among current research, we see that the goals are those of Document Retrieval, but at an intra-document level, selecting passages (Callan, 1994).",
        "But the methods are rather (though not exclusively) those of Information Extraction in the sense of MUC’s (Pazienza, 1997) and we are quite close to Answer Extraction in the sense of (Molla, 2000).",

        "For granularity reasons (left however for further consideration), it seems desirable to presents the four passages in this order, from the closest to the farthest level."
