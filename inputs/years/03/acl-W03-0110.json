        "We are interested in collecting the largest possible set of geographic entities, so as to be able to produce a variety of extremely comprehensive gazetteers.",
        "These gazetteers are currently produced to search for both direct and indirect geospatial references in text.",
        "The production process can be tailored to produce custom gazetteers for other applications, such as historical queries.",
        "The purpose of the MetaCarta GazDB is to provide both a place and supporting mechanisms for storing, maintaining, and exporting everything we know about our collection of geographic entities.",
        "To produce a gazetteer from various data sources, we make use of a database, the GazDB, as well as two sets of scripts: conversion scripts, to transfer the data from its source format into the GazDB, and export scripts to output data from the GazDB in the form of gazetteers.",
        "The interaction between these elements is illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "Geographic input data is collected from multiple (not necessarily disjoint) sources, each with their own peculiar format.",
        "As such, the conversion scripts must perform some amount of normalization and classification of the input data in order to maintain a single unified repository",
        "of geographic data.",
        "However, in order to justify the overhead of consolidating all the data into a single entity, it must be possible to output all of it into multiple gazetteers designed for different goals.",
        "It should also be possible to perform filtering operations on the gazetteer entries, such as comparing entry names against common-language dictionaries.",
        "This can be used determine whether occurrences of gazetteer names in documents are geographically relevant (Rauch et al., 2003).",
        "This is the task for the export scripts.",
        "However, in this paper, we shall focus on the heart of the system, namely the GazDB.",
        "Section 2 describes how the GazDB relates geographic names and features.",
        "In Section 3 we describe how the GazDB handles ambiguities and inconsistencies in geographic names.",
        "Finally, in Section 4 we outline the classification and storage system used for geographic features.",
        "2 Gazetteer entries in the GazDB The most basic form of a gazetteer entry consists of a mapping between a geographic name and a geographic",
        "location.",
        "The Alexandria Digital Library Project (Hill, 2000), however, defines a gazetteer entry as also requiring a type designation to describe the entity referred to by the name and location.",
        "Because a geographical type designation classifies the physical entity rather than the name assigned to it, we think of gazetteer entries produced by the GazDB as relating geographic names and geographic features (which have inherent types).",
        "We will separately discuss geographic names and geographic features in greater detail later, and focus on the stored relations between them first.",
        "A naive approach to creating a gazetteer is to maintain a flat file with one gazetteer entry per line, as follows: Boston 42° 21’30”N, 71° 4’23”W Cambridge 42° 23’30”N, 71° 6’22”W Somerville 42° 23’15”N, 71° 6’00”W This schema is overly simplistic because it supposes a one-to-one mapping between geographic names and features, when in reality many geographic features have more than one name commonly associated with them.",
        "For instance, the tallest mountain in North America is unambiguously referred to as either Mount McKinley or De-nali.",
        "Using this gazetteer, recording both names for the mountain would result in the creation of two entries.",
        "This is highly impractical on a large scale due to space requirements and the complexity of systematically updating or modifying the gazetteer.",
        "The GazDB uses the well-known relational approach (Codd, 1970) to store the geographic data for the gazetteer.",
        "To do so, we separate the notion of a geographic name from the geographic feature that it represents.",
        "We maintain distinct tables for locations and names– mappings between names and locations are stored in a third table, keyed by the unique numerical identifiers of both the name and the location, as shown in Figure 2.",
        "This system enables the GazDB to support both many-to-one relations between names and features, as in the case of Denali and McKinley, and one-to-many relations such as London being the name of both a city in Britain and a town in Connecticut.",
        "In the GazDB, several other relational tables are used to store numerical data associated with the known geographic features.",
        "For example, population data is kept in a separate table that links census figures with the ID’s of entries in the feature table.",
        "This is useful because it facilitates queries to be performed only on inhabited places.",
        "Elevation data is stored in a similar manner.",
        "As gazetteers get updated, corrections are often made to the name or to the feature data.",
        "To update a name, we formally abandon the old ID, create a new name entry, and update the nameHfeature mapping table by replacing the old name ID with the new one, as in Figure 3.",
        "We repeat this process for each table in the GazDB that refers to the old ID– this is simple, because the tables are indexed by ID.",
        "Updating geographic locations or numerical data in the GazDB is done in an identical manner.",
        "The GazDB also includes a table for storing detailed information about the sources of the data in the GazDB– for instance, “NIMA GeoNet names datafile for Afghanistan (AF), published November 8 2002 ”.",
        "Every element in the GazDB is then associated with the appropriate entry in the source table.",
        "This enables the accountability of all entries in the GazDB, preventing the appearance of “mystery data”.",
        "The source table also allows easy, systematic, source-specific modifications of the GazDB’s entries to keep pace with frequently updated datasets, thereby maintaining the freshness of the GazDB’s data.",
        "The GazDB also includes a complete log of all updates to the database tables and entries.",
        "Because data rows are abandoned but not deleted during updates, it is possible to recreate the state of the database prior to any particular set of updates.",
        "The flexibility of the relational design also allows the inclusion of new kinds of data that were not thought of or not available in the original schema.",
        "For instance, one could add yearly precipitation data for geographic locations by creating an additional table mapping locations to rainfall amounts, without the need to re-ingest the data already in the GazDB.",
        "The GazDB also maintains a historical geographical record by capturing temporal extents for mappings – i.e. the city at 59° 54’20”N, 30° 16’9”E would be associated with the names:",
        "• St. Petersburg from 1991-present day • Leningrad from 1924-1991 • Petrograd from 1914-1924",
        "The GazDB can thus export temporally-sensitive gazetteers customized for use in historical documents."

      "text": [
        "The first hurdle is internationalization (i18n).",
        "Differences between character encodings and display capabilities result in some names taking on a variety of forms (e.g. printing S˜ao Tom´e as Sao Tome).",
        "Although the printed forms of the name are not character-identical, the name itself has not changed from its original representation.",
        "To resolve this, the GazDB defines and stores a geographic name as a triple: [canonical name, display name, search name], with each element at a different level of resolution.",
        "The canonical form of the feature’s name is kept as a 16 bit string (Unicode / UTF-8), the display form is 8 bits (ISO 8859-1), and the search name is 7-bit uppercase ASCII.",
        "These resolutions are appropriate for different purposes: wide characters are necessary for Chinese/Japanese/Korean (CJK) content, the display name is a necessary compromise given the default display capabilities of Internet browsers, and the search name is necessary given the data entry capabilities of the default (US-ASCII) keyboard.",
        "We henceforth use the term name to implicitly refer to this triple.",
        "We also support Soundex and Metaphone geographic name searches at a 7 bit resolution, by storing the hash codes in separate tables within the GazDB.",
        "However, there are cases when variances in a name arise due to multiple transliteration, rather than character encodings, as in the case of Macau and Macao.",
        "As such, we further define a spelling of a geographic name to be a similarly constructed triple of [UTF-8, 8859-1, ASCII] encodings, with the added restriction that while the authoritative name is directly associated to a geographical entity, a spelling is only directly associated to a name.",
        "Thus while Macao is a spelling variant of Macau, and Macau is the name of a city in Southern China, nonetheless Macao is not considered to be a GazDB name proper for the city."

      "heading": "3.2 Authoritativeness",
      "text": [
        "The GazDB also makes a distinction about the authoritativeness of names.",
        "We view a placename as an information resource in and of itself, independent of the feature that it names.",
        "This is analogous to the Unicode standard, where the name of a character is treated as an information resource independent of the glyph it corresponds to.",
        "There are multiple names that refer to the same geographic feature but are neither spelling variants of another nor are they seemingly derived from one another, such as Holland vs.",
        "The Netherlands or Nihon vs. Japan.",
        "Because of this, we define and maintain alternate names for each authoritative name.",
        "Each geographic entity is permitted to have only one authoritative name, but that authoritative name can have several more informal alternate names associated to it.",
        "Both alternate names and authoritative names can have variant spellings.",
        "Conflicts between authoritative names from different sources are inevitable.",
        "However, we cannot independently determine the proper solution in an objective way because we are not a mapping agency– we seek to use geographic data, not produce it.",
        "Without being able to take our own measurements, resolving these discrepancies must therefore be done on the basis of the perceived trustworthiness of the sources providing the data.",
        "The GazDB’s source data consists of many sources that can be trusted to varying degrees.",
        "We put the highest trust in the Geographic Names Information System (USGS, 2003) data and the GEOnet Names Server (NIMA, 2003) data, and mediate the incorporation of all the other sources accordingly.",
        "To enforce the distinction between the authoritative and the alternate versions of a name,, and to emphasize the authoritative name, we speak of “names” referring only to the authoritative name.",
        "For all others, we speak of “alternates” and “spellings”."

        "The administrative hierarchy serves to locate geographic entities by country, then state, county, and so forth.",
        "This is based upon both the FIPS 10-4 citeFIPS and the ISO 3166-2 (ISO, 1998) codes.",
        "However, these standards often disagree and update infrequently, so we base ours upon the Hierarchical Administrative Subdivision Codes (HASC) system (Law, 1999).",
        "Using this taxonomy, we can specify geographic entities by name and by their location within the political divisions of the world.",
        "The GazDB is capable of maintaining multiple taxonomies for geographic entities, such as one based upon physical features (for instance: “Mont Blanc is a mountain in the Alps which are in Europe”, in addition to “Mont Blanc is a mountain in France”), however these have not yet been completed.",
        "We define as an authoritative title the unambiguous list of hierarchical administrative regions that contain the geographic entity.",
        "Here New York State, United States would be the authoritative title, such that the sequence New York City, New York State, USA unambiguously refers to a single geographic entity.",
        "The authoritative title is the ordered sequence of the authoritative names for the list of hierarchical regions that contain the feature, so it is easy to compute from a hierarchical region tree in the GazDB.",
        "Other titles can be computed by using variants or spellings of the containing regions’ names, or by omitting some of them (New York City, USA, for example).",
        "We have thus imposed an order on the GazDB geographic names: each feature can have one primary (most authoritative) GazDB name and some alternate GazDB names.",
        "Each GazDB name, both primary and alternate, can have multiple spellings associated with it.",
        "All of the above are available at all three encoding resolutions.",
        "This ordering allows the GazDB to classify geographic names along three orthogonal scales: general/vernacular vs. authoritative; raw (original character encoding) vs. cooked (character-set- and transliteration-normalized); and implicit (short form) vs. explicit (long form).",
