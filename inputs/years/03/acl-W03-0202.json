        "We are building INFACT, a software system to support teachers in performing diagnostic assessment of their students’ learning.",
        "Our work is guided by the principle that assessment should be a ubiquitous and unobtrusive part of the learning process.",
        "Since many learning experiences involve writing, we focus on the analysis of free natural language text and certain other representations of student expression and behavior.",
        "We also believe that rich assessment, which informs teachers about the belief states of their students, is a valuable addition to tests with a single numeric grade.",
        "There are several parts to our system, including an on-line textual forum for class discussions, an annotation interface for teachers, and tools for displaying assessment data in various formats.",
        "The philosophy behind the system is described in (Tanimoto et al., 2000).",
        "The system facilitates small-group discussions which the teacher can monitor and intervene if there is an obvious impasse.",
        "An astute teacher with enough time can follow the discussions closely and observe as students make conceptual transitions.",
        "A major motivation for the work described in this paper is to find a way to reduce the burden on teachers who want such diagnostic information but who cannot afford the time needed to follow each discussion closely.",
        "Our system analyzes small selections of student writing, on the order of one or two sentences, and learns rules that can be used to identify common student preconceptions.",
        "Our approach to partially-automated analysis uses text markup rules consisting of patterns in a “rule language” and classifications that may be as general as “may be of interest” to “suggests preconception P17.” In addition to learning text markup rules for identifying preconceptions in online discussions, we are also learning rules for assessing short textual answers in an online diagnostic testing environment.",
        "This system poses questions to the student and uses the results to report student preconceptions to teachers and recommend resources to the student.",
        "The system asks multiple choice or numeric content questions and then, based on the response asks a short-answer follow-up question allowing the student to explain their reasoning.",
        "In this paper, we describe the results of applying our rule learning system to classifying the responses to these follow-up questions.",
        "In the following sections we discuss other work on automated essay grading, we then describe the language with which rules are represented in our system, followed by a description of the version space learning technique and our specific adaptations to allow it to learn text classification rules.",
        "Finally, we describe the empirical results of our experiments with this technique."

        "They use the similarity metric to determine whether essays have enough detail in various subtopics that the essay is expected to cover.",
        "Because of the statistical properties of the singular value decomposition underlying LSA, this system requires relatively large amounts of data to be trained, and works best on long essay questions, rather than short-answer responses.",

        "The third answer corresponds to the correct analysis of the question (Pcorrect).",
        "Both objects travel the same total distance in the same time, and neither ever moves backwards, so they have the same average speed.",
        "We analyzed the text of responses to confirm that the students’ descriptions of their reasoning matched the preconception predicted by system based on their multiple choice answer.",
        "We found that it was necessary to create two additional classes.",
        "One class was added for students who wrote that they had guessed their answer or otherwise gave an irrelevant answer in the free text (Pmisc).",

        "For most classes, the addition of the tags improved the performance over untagged data.",

        "This is not surprising as this class contains data with a variety of tags.",
        "In some cases responses that were exactly the same (e.g. two students who wrote “I guessed.”) were associated with different base question answers.",
        "This meant the addition of different tags resulting in non-matching answers.",
        "However, this doesn’t pose a great problem for the system.",

        "Currently, the only processing of the student text done by the system is the removal of stopwords and stemming.",
        "It would be interesting to preprocess the text with part-of-speech tagging and syntactic and grammatical analysis, such as identification of passive or active voice or even full parsing.",
        "Because of the broad range of ways in which students express their ideas, the system may be severely hampered by limited exposure to syntactic variation.",
        "Traditional NLP analyses might allow for the creation of rule analogues.",
        "For example, a rule that matched “subtract the initial position from the final position” might be mapped to another rule that could match “take the final position and subtract the initial position.” The application of such methods might be complicated by the fact that student writing is often highly ungrammatical and short-answer responses may well be more so.",
        "Another way to improve the performance of automatic text analysis in assessing students is to take some care in constructing the problems presented to students to ease analysis of their answers.",
        "In the responses that were assigned to Pfinal-avg, students described various qualitative comparisons between the two lines.",
        "The lines were labeled as Object A and Object B on the graph.",
        "In their responses, students referred to them as “object A”, “line A”, “graph A” and just “A”.",
        "Since “A” is a common stop-word, this effected our ability to learn rules for this preconception.",
        "We removed “A” from our stopword list, which allowed for different rules to be learned, but also allowed other rules to include “A” when it was being used as an indefinite article.",
        "The use of part-of-speech tagging may improve this situation, but so would changing the question to label the graph in a way that would be less confusing to the system.",
        "Key factors in the success or failure of experiments such as these are the variety of messages that must be mapped into a single category and degree to which usage of various words and patterns of words is consistent in implicating one category rather than another.",
        "Ultimately, the utility of techniques such as those we are studying may depend on the careful scoping of these categories and means to bias student writing towards particular styles or vocabularies.",
        "These techniques offer one approach to language analysis that lies between the purely syntactic and the thoroughly semantic ends of the spectrum.",
        "We are optimistic about their practical potential in the realm of educational assessment."
