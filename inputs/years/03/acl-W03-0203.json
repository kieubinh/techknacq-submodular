        "Multiple-choice tests have proved to be an efficient tool for measuring students' achievement.",
        "The manual construction of such tests, however, is a time-consuming and labour-intensive task.",
        "In this paper we seek to provide an alternative to the lengthy and demanding activity of developing multiple-choice tests and propose a new, NLP-based approach for generating tests from narrative texts (textbooks, encyclopaedias).",
        "The approach uses a simple set of transformational rules, a shallow parser, automatic term extraction, word sense disambiguation, a corpus and WordNet.",
        "While in the current experiment we have used an electronic textbook in linguistics to automatically generate test items in this area, we should note that the methodology is general and can be extended to practically any other area.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, no related work has been reported addressing such a type of application.2 1 This work is not concerned with (and does not discuss) the issue of whether multiple-choice tests are better assessment methodology that other types of tests.",
        "What it focuses on is a new NLP methodology to generate multiple-choice tests about facts explicitly stated in a text.",
        "2 Fairon (1999) reports that their exercises ‘can take the appearance of a multiple choice test’ (if distractors are added), but does not explain exactly as to how this can be done.",
        "2.",
        "NLP-based methodology for generation of multiple-choice test items The proposed methodology for generating multiple-choice test items is based on the premise that questions should focus on key concepts rather than addressing less central and even irrelevant concepts or ideas.",
        "Therefore the first stage of the procedure is to identify domain-specific terms which serve as ‘anchors’ of each question.",
        "By way of example, syntax is a prime candidate for a domain-specific term in the sentence \"Syntax is the branch of linguistics which studies the way words are put together into sentences\".",
        "This sentence can be then transformed into questions asking about this term such as \"Which branch of linguistics studies the way words are put together into sentences?\"",
        "or \"Which discipline studies the way words are put together into sentences?\"",
        "both of which can act as stems in multiple-choice test items.",
        "Another important premise is that distractors3 should be as semantically close to the correct answer as possible so that no additional clues are provided for the students.",
        "Semantically close distractors are more plausible and therefore better at distinguishing good, confident students from poor and uncertain ones.",
        "In the above example, the distractors for the correct answer syntax should preferably be semantics or pragmatics and not chemistry or football, for instance.",
        "In order to keep the test item comprehensible and avoid additional complexity, the test questions are generated from declarative sentences using simple transformational rules which, in turn, results in only minimal change of the original wording.",
        "Underpinned by the above principles, a system for computer-aided generation of multiple-choice test items from instructional documents in electronic form has been implemented.",
        "The system is built on separate components, which perform the following tasks: (i) term extraction, (ii) selection of distractors and (iii) question generation."

        "To retrieve terms, nouns and noun phrases are first identified, using the FDG shallow parser (Tapanainen and Järvinen 1997).",
        "Next, their frequency is counted and sorted, and nouns with a frequency over a certain threshold4 are considered as key terms.",
        "In addition, noun phrases having these key terms as heads, and satisfying the regular expression [AN]+N or [AN]*NP[AN]*N (Justeson and Katz 1996), are considered as terms.",
        "Although this method is very simple,5 the results show that, for this particular application, the performance is more than acceptable (only 3 questions did not address a domain-specific term).",
        "One of the main reasons not to employ more complicated methods for term extraction derives from the small size of the corpus used in the current experiment (10 000 words).",
        "It should be noted that, from a keyword, as in the case of the keyword \"phrase\", a list of semantically close terms including noun phrase, verb phrase, adjective phrase and adverb phrase can be obtained.",
        "In addition, a word sense disambiguation program is used to identify the correct sense of the alternatives given that WordNet frequently returns an unnecessarily high number of senses.",
        "The word sense disambiguation algorithm compares the definition of sense (as extracted from WordNet) and the context of the keyword (words around the keyword in the corpus).",
        "As an illustration, in the following extract (Kies 2003) (1) A prepositional phrase at the beginning of a sentence constitutes an introductory modifier.",

        "This rule operates in several variants, one being that if the hypernym is a key term, then a ‘Which kind of’ question may be generated (e.g. ‘Transitive verbs require objects’ would trigger the question \"Which kind of verbs require objects?\").",
        "Another rule often used transforms an SVO sentence with object representing a term into the question \"What do/does/did the S V\".",
        "By way of example, this rule would convert the sentence in example (1) into the question \"What does a prepositional phrase at the beginning of a sentence constitute?\"",

        "Finally, the analysis of the distractors confirms that it is not possible to class the manually produced test items as better quality than the ones produced with the help of the program.",

        "better on the number of distractors deemed as not useful, were assessed to contain fewer poor distractors and had a higher average difference between students in the lower and upper groups.",

        "It should be noted that the post-editors were not professional test developers.",
        "It would be interesting to investigate the impact of the program on professional test developers.",
        "This is an experiment envisaged as part of our future work.",
        "In addition to extending the set of test items to be evaluated and the samples of students taking the test, further work includes experimenting with more sophisticated term extraction techniques and with other more elaborate models for measuring semantic similarity of concepts.",
        "We would like to test the feasibility of using collocations from an appropriate domain corpus with a view to extending the choice of plausible distractors.",
        "We also envisage the development of a more comprehensive grammar for generating questions, which in turn will involve studying and experimenting with existing question generation theories.",
        "As our main objective has been to investigate the feasibility of the methodology, we have so far refrained from more advanced NLP processing of the original documents such as performing anaphora resolution and temporal or spatial reasoning which will certainly allow for more questions to be generated.",
        "Future work also envisages evaluation as to what extent the questions cover the course material.",
        "Finally, even though the agreement between post-editors appears to be a complex issue, we would like to investigate it in more depth.",
        "This agreement should be measured on semantic rather than syntactic principles, as the post-editors may produce syntactically different test questions which are semantically equivalent.",
