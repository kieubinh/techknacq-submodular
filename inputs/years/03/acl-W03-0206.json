        "Language technology programs have been widely discussed as a potential candidate for a tool suitable for the use in the context of second language writing (see e.g. Chapelle (2001)).",
        "However, in this discussion an important series of questions remain open as for example the one regarding the impact of language technology on the writing and learning activity.",
        "The uncertainty about the role that language technology programs may play in educational settings is in part related to two facts at least: the existence of false alarms generated by the program and the limited recall of important linguistic constructions in the learners’ texts.",
        "The interaction with false alarms can be highly confusing in a second language learning context and might introduce new language problems than the program is able to detect and correct.",
        "Furthermore, the emergence of false alarms during the use of language technology for writing might make the learner shifts her attention from her text to the alarms.",
        "In such situation, the learner might put much energy in dealing with false alarms and eventually, in correcting or reflecting on her text according to them and therefore in getting a false conception of having reviewed authentic language problems.",
        "This paper focuses on the development and the use of writing language tools in the context of second language.",
        "The vision guiding our work is the idea of studying and developing language tools that will be able to help writers/learners to reflect on their own language and not only help them to succeed in their revision tasks.",
        "In this sense, we agree with Swain and Lapkin’s hypothesis (1995): “... in producing the L2, a learner will on occasion become aware of (i.e. notice) a linguistic problem brought to his/her attention either by external feedback (e.g. clarification requests or internal feedback).",
        "Noticing a problem ”pushes” the learner to modify his/her output.",
        "In doing so, the learner may sometimes be forced into a more syntactic processing mode that might occur in comprehension” (p. 373 cited by Chapelle (2001)).",
        "In the light of the limitations of text analysis programs’ recall and precision, we need to search for alternative strategies to aid users to deal with false alarms and limited feedback on serious linguistic constructions not identified by the program.",
        "Even more important, it is necessary to develop a tool that also supports the whole writing process, and not only the revision process.",
        "Our starting point is a grammar checker for Swedish, called Granska (Domeij et al., 2000).",
        "We aim at developing Granska further to a language learning environment capable to support adequate functionality for second-language learning purpose.",
        "In order to develop such functionality and support we have started to conduct user studies in educational settings.",
        "The paper presents two studies guided by the following questions:",
        "• How should we go from grammar checker programs further to learning environments for second language writers?",
        "• What kinds of functionality are necessary to support in such learning environments?",
        "• How should researchers and developers work together with teachers and students in order to get a chance to introduce computer-assisted learning in second-language courses?"

      "text": [
        "The study of acquisition and development of Swedish as a second language is a vast research area that goes back to the early 70’s in Sweden.",
        "In this research work, three main perspectives can be distinguished: linguistic, sociolinguistic and pedagogical.",
        "Studies conducted through these perspectives agree on viewing the acquisition and development of second language as a multifaceted process in which is necessary to combine different foci.",
        "They have, however, most often focused on the study of speech and the development of immigrants’ communicative competence (cf. Kotsinas (1985)).",
        "Questions regarding the role of writing during the acquisition and development of a second language have usually been overlooked.",
        "Another common characteristic of all three perspectives is that they have neglected the question of the role of language tools in supporting learning, and more in particular, in helping learners to reflect on and develop awareness of the language they produce.",
        "Furthermore, the use of CALL applications in second-language education is still limited in Sweden.",
        "The few educational institutions that have introduced CALL applications in their curricula use mostly email, chat or multimedia; programs that actually have very little input from language technology research (cf. Cerratto and Borin (2002)).",
        "In this sense, it should come as no surprise that computer-assisted language learning applied to Swedish as a second language rarely incorporates features that are able to analyze learners’ written or spoken productions (cf. Cerratto and Borin (2002)).",
        "Unlike computer-assisted language learning in the context of Swedish as a second language, language tools for Swedish have an important place within the writing process of native speakers.",
        "However, concentrated as they have been on the development of robust and highly efficient algorithms and rules that are able to correctly detect and diagnose language errors, they have neglected the pedagogical potential of such tools (Vernon, 2000).",
        "Developed to support correct writing, they have often been based on models of native writers neglecting then writers who are learning Swedish as a second language."

        "Granska is a grammar checker for Swedish developed at the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden (Domeij et al., 2000).",
        "It is together with other language tools integrated in a writing environment supporting different aspects of the writing process.",
        "Granska combines probabilistic and rule-based methods to achieve high efficiency and robustness (see also Carlberger and Kann (1999)).",
        "Using special error rules, the system can detect a number of Swedish grammar problems and suggest corrections for them that are presented to the user together with instructional information.",
        "The current version of Granska, used in this study, is designed for native Swedish writers.",
        "The core of the Granska system is a statistical PoS-tagger, a collection of phenomena-based grammar checking rules, and a robust shallow parser.",
        "In the studies presented in this paper, Granska was used with a web interface.",
        "Granska’s web interface allowed the students to use any word processor they liked on any platform.",
        "Granska has been evaluated on five different text genres including mostly texts from native speakers of Swedish (Domeij et al., 2002).",
        "The recall was ranging from 37% on student essays to 87% on texts from popular science.",
        "The precision of the program was ranging from 66% on student essays to 25% on text from international news.",
        "The student essays is the text genre that mostly resemble the text genre of the learners presented in this study.",
        "To conclude, we can expect a quite good precision, but a rather low recall on the second language learners’ texts.",
        "An evaluation of the Swedish grammar checker in Microsoft Word (Birn, 2000) shows a grammar checker with better precision, but lower recall than Granska.",
        "However, comparisons on the same text genres remain to be done.",
        "One notable difference is that Word’s grammar checker does not search for the complex error type split compounds, which Granska does with some loss in precision as a result."

        "According to this perspective, the most important psychological tool is language, understood as a semiotic resource providing signs that can be flexible, and creatively used in social practices.",
        "One of the fundamental notions is that there is a psychological relation between user learner and object of activity -language-through the use of a tool (Rabardel, 1995; Cerratto, 1999; Cerratto Pargman, forthcoming).",
        "This notion inherited from the cultural-historical school of Russian psychology puts tools in the position of intermediators of human action.",
        "Considered as intermediators, tools in use are far from being transparent.",

        "”Cognitive processes and structures are transformed significantly by the acquisition of our best-recognized cultural (and intellectual) tool, namely, writing” (Olson (1995), p. 96).",

        "From this perspective, writing is of utmost importance as it affects consciousness and cognition through providing a model for speech and a theory for thinking about what is said.",

        "Quoting Wertsch (1998), he emphasizes that ”in contrast to many contemporary analyses of language which focus on the structure of the sign systems independent of any mediating role they might play, a sociocultural interpretation presupposes that one conceives of language and other sign systems in terms of how they are part of and mediate human action” (S¨alj¨o (1996), p. 84–85) ”... By acquiring concepts and discursive tools, we appropriate ways of understanding reality that have developed within particular discursive practices in different sectors in a complex society”(S¨alj¨o (1996) p. 87).",

        "As second language learners are a heterogeneous group of learners it is difficult to study them without identifying a suitable user group capable to interact with writing tools and with a certain level of language knowledge.",
        "The context of an undergraduate course in Swedish as a foreign language gave then us control of the user’s language competence.",
        "The educational setting also provided us information on grammatical knowledge and terms developed in the course.",
        "It is crucial for future applications to converge to grammatical knowledge and terms that the users are learning.",
        "But as this will probably consolidate the learners trust in the program, with the teacher’s grammatical terms echoing in the feedback from program, the effects of false alarms and limited recall will probably become an even more intricate question to be studied."
