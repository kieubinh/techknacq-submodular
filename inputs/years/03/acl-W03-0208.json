        "Computer based education systems are useful in distance learning as well as for classroom learning environment.",
        "These systems are based on intelligent tutoring systems(ITS’s) which provide an interactive learning environment to students.",
        "These systems first familiarize a student with a topic and then ask questions to assess her knowledge.",
        "Automatic evaluation of students’ answers is thus central to design of an ITS that can function without the need of continuous monitoring by a human.",
        "Examples of ITS’s that use natural language processing to understand students’ contribution are CIRCSIM (Glass, 2001), Atlas (Freedman et al., 2000), PACT (Aleven et al., 2001) etc.",
        "These systems use a parser to derive various levels of syntactic and semantic information and rules to determine the next dialog move.",
        "They perform quite well with short answers in a limited domain, but are limited to take arbitrarily long free-text input and are difficult to port across domains.",
        "These limitations can be alleviated by using latent semantic analysis(LSA), a recently developed technique for information retrieval (Deerwester et al., 1990), knowledge representation (Landauer et al., 1998), natural language understanding and cognitive modeling (Graesser et al., 1999; Graesser et al., 2000) etc.",
        "LSA has been used in various ITS’s like AutoTutor (Wiemer-Hastings et al., 1998), Intelligent Essay Assessor (Foltz et al., 1999), Summary Street (Kintsch et al., 2000), Apex (Dessus et al., 2000) etc.",
        "LSA is a statistical corpus-based natural language understanding technique that supports semantic similarity measurement between texts.",
        "Given a set of documents in the tutoring domain, LSA uses the frequency of occurrence of each word in each document to construct a word-document co-occurrence matrix.",
        "After preprocessing, singular value decomposition is performed to represent the domain knowledge into a 200 to 400 dimensional space.",
        "This space is then used for evaluating the semantic similarity between any two text units.",
        "In an ITS, LSA is used to evaluate students’ answers with respect to the ideal answers to questions in the domain (Graesser et al., 2000).",
        "This is done by finding the match between a student’s answer and the ideal answer by calculating the cosine similarity measure between their projections in LSA space.",
        "This information is used to provide interactive response to the student in terms of hint, prompt,question etc.",
        "It has been found that LSA performs as good as an intermediate expert human evaluator but not so well as an accomplished expert of the domain.",
        "This may be because LSA is a ‘bag-of-words’ approach and so lacks the word-order or syntactic information in a text document.",
        "But for correct automatic evaluation of students’ answers, a model should consider both syntax and semantics in the answer.",
        "So, one obvious way to improve the performance of LSA is to incorporate some syntactic information in it.",
        "In order to add syntactic information to LSA, recently there has been an effort in (Wiemer-Hastings and Zipitria, 2001), where a word along with its part-of-speech (POS) tag was used to construct the LSA matrix, thus capturing multiple syntactic senses of a word.",
        "But this approach, called tagged LSA, deteriorated the performance.",
        "In another attempt (Wiemer-Hastings and Zipitria, 2001), similarity between two sentences was calculated by averaging the LSA based similarity of sub-sentence structures like noun phrase, verb phrase, object phrase etc.",
        "This approach, called as structured LSA (SLSA), could improve the performance in terms of sentence-pair similarity judgment.",
        "But its performance in terms of evaluating students’ answers was poorer than that of LSA(WiemerHastings, 2000).",
        "We propose here a model called Syntactically Enhanced LSA (SELSA), where we augment each word with the part-of-speech (POS) tag of the preceding word.",
        "Thus instead of word-document co-occurence matrix, we generate a matrix in which rows correspond to all possible word - POS tag combinations and columns correspond to documents.",
        "A preceding tag indicates some kind of syntactic neighbourhood around the focus word.",
        "Depending on the preceding tag, the syntactic-semantic sense of a word can vary.",
        "Thus SELSA captures finer resolution of syntactic-semantic information compared to mere semantics of LSA.",
        "This finer information can therefore be used to evaluate a student’s answer more accurately than LSA.",
        "We compare the performance of SELSA with LSA for the AutoTutor cognitive modeling task (Graesser et al., 1999).",
        "This involves evaluating students’ answers to questions in three areas of computer science viz. hardware, operating system and networking.",
        "The performance is measured in terms of various criteria like correlation, mean absolute difference and number of correct /emphvs false evaluations by humans and by computer.",
        "SELSA is found better than LSA in terms of robustness across thresholds as well as in terms of evaluating more answers correctly, but it is having less correlation measure with human than LSA.",
        "The organization of this paper is as follows.",
        "The next section describes LSA and its applications in ITS’s.",
        "In section 3, we describe the proposed SELSA model.",

        "Thus LSA seems to be closer to human than SELSA in this particular tutoring task.",
        "This seems to support the arguments from (Lan-dauer et al., 1997) that syntax plays little role, if any, in semantic similarity judgments and text comprehension.",
        "But the likely reason behind this could be that the corpus, particularly the student answers, contained very poor syntactic structure and also that human evaluators might not have paid attention to grammatical inaccuracies in this technical domain of computer literacy.",
        "But it is also worth noting that SELSA is closer to LSA than a previous approach of adding syntactic information to LSA (Wiemer-Hastings, 2000), which had a correlation of 0.40 compared to 0.49 of LSA on the same task of evaluating students’ answers, where average inter-human correlation was 0.78 between the expert raters and 0.51 between the intermediate experts.",
        "SELSA",
        "is also comparable to tagged LSA (Wiemer-Hastings and Zipitria, 2001), which used the current POS tag instead of prevtag.",
        "It had a correlation of 0.27 compared to 0.36 of LSA in a modified evaluation task of judging similarity between two sentences where the correlation between skilled raters was 0.45 and that between non-proficient raters was 0.35.",
        "If we look at these curves more carefully, especially, their behavior across thresholds, then it is interesting to note that SELSA has wider threshold-widths(TW) than LSA across all the cases of SVD dimension R. In table (1) and (2) we have shown the 10% and 20% TW of SELSA and LSA respectively.",
        "This is calculated by finding the range over thresholds for which the correlation is within 10% and 20% of the maximum correlation.",
        "This observation shows that SELSA is much more robust across thresholds than LSA in the sense that semantic information is discriminated better in SELSA space than in LSA space.",

        "(3).",
        "Here we plotted the SELSA and LSA performances for 250 dimensions of latent space.",

        "This observation along with the previous observation about TW can be understood in the following manner.",
        "When comparing two document vectors for a cosine measure exceeding a threshold, we can consider one of the vectors to be the axis of a right circular cone with a semi-vertical angle decided by the threshold.",
        "If the other vector falls within this cone, we say the two documents are matching.",

        "We define an evaluation li by SELSA (LSA) to be correct or false as below: li CORRECT if lli – hil < CT li FALSE if lli – hil > FT where CT and FT are correctness and falsehood thresholds which were set to 0.05 and 0.95 respectively for strict measures.",
        "Number of such correct as well as false evaluations were then averaged across the four human evaluators.",

        "The maximum number of correct (maxCorrect) and the minimum number of false (minFalse) evaluations across the thresholds for each value of SVD dimensions are calculated and shown in tables (3) and (4).",
        "We observe that the best performance for SELSA is achieved at 300 dimensions with 126 correct and 30 false evaluations, while for LSA it is at 400 dimensions with 123 correct and 30 false evaluations.",
        "The average correct and false evaluations among all human-human evaluator pairs were 132 and 23 respectively.",
        "Thus here also SELSA is closer to human evaluators than LSA.",
        "In fact, for the cognitive task like AutoTutor, this is a more appealing and explicit measure than the previous two.",
        "Apart from these three measures, one can also calculate precision, recall and F-measure (Burstein et al., 2003) to evaluate the performance."

      "heading": "6 Conclusion",
      "text": [
        "Automatic evaluation of students’ answers in an intelligent tutoring system can be performed using LSA.",
        "But LSA lacks syntactic information which can be also useful for meaning representation of a text document.",
        "So, we have developed and implemented a model called syntactically enhanced LSA which generalizes LSA by augmenting a word with the POS tag of the preceding word to derive a latent syntactic-semantic information.",
        "Experimental results on the AutoTutor task of evaluating students’ answers to computer science questions show a range of",
        "performance comparison between SELSA and LSA.",
        "In terms of the correlation measure with human raters, LSA is slightly better than SELSA.",
        "But SELSA is at least as good as LSA in terms of the mean absolute difference measure.",
        "On the other end, SELSA is able to correctly evaluate a few more answers than LSA is.",
        "SELSA can do better if the training and testing corpora have a good syntactic structure.",
        "From the correlation performance analysis, it is observed that SELSA is more robust in discriminating the semantic information across a wider threshold width than LSA.",
        "It is also found that SELSA uses the syntactic information to expand the document similarity measure i.e., mere semantically similar documents are placed wider apart than syntactic-semantically similar documents in SELSA space.",
        "These initial results are part of an ongoing research towards an overall improvement of natural language understanding and modeling.",
        "Although the present version of SELSA has limited improvements over LSA, it leads to future experiments with robust characterization of syntactic neighbourhood in terms of headwords or phrase structure as well as applying smoothing across syntax to tackle the problem of sparse data estimation."
