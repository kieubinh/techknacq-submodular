        "We have submitted the ProAlign alignment system to the WPT’03 shared task.",
        "It received a 5.71% AER on the English-French task and 29.36% on the Romanian-English task.",
        "These results are with the no-null data; our output was not formatted to work with explicit nulls.",
        "ProAlign works by iteratively improving an alignment.",
        "The algorithm creates an initial alignment using search, constraints, and summed φ2 correlation-based scores (Gale and Church, 1991).",
        "This is similar to the competitive linking process (Melamed, 2000).",
        "It then learns a probability model from the current alignment, and conducts a constrained search again, this time scoring alignments according to the probability model.",
        "The process continues until results on a validation set begin to indicate over-fitting.",
        "For the purposes of our algorithm, we view an alignment as a set of links between the words in a sentence pair.",
        "Before describing the algorithm, we will define the following notation.",
        "Let E be an English sentence e1, e2, ... , em and let F be a French sentence f1, f2, ... , fn.",
        "We define a link l (ei, fj) to exist if ei and fj are a translation (or part of a translation) of one another.",
        "We define the null link l(ei, f0) to exist if ei does not correspond to a translation for any French word in F. The null link l (e0, fj) is defined similarly.",
        "An alignment A for two sentences E and F is a set of links such that every word in E and F participates in at least one link, and a word linked to e0 or f0 participates in no other links.",
        "If e occurs in E x times and f occurs in F y times, we say that e and f co-occur xy times in this sentence pair.",
        "ProAlign conducts a best-first search (with constant beam and agenda size) to search a constrained space of possible alignments.",
        "A state in this space is a partial alignment, and a transition is defined as the addition of a single link to the current state.",
        "Any link which would create a state that does not violate any constraint is considered to be a valid transition.",
        "Our start state is the empty alignment, where all words in E and F are implicitly linked to null.",
        "A terminal state is a state in which no more links can be added without violating a constraint.",
        "Our goal is to find the terminal state with the highest probability.",
        "To complete this algorithm, one requires a set of constraints and a method for determining which alignment is most likely.",
        "These are presented in the next two sections.",
        "The algorithm takes as input a set of English-French sentence pairs, along with dependency trees for the English sentences.",
        "The presence of the English dependency tree allows us to incorporate linguistic features into our model and linguistic intuitions into our constraints."

      "heading": "2 Constraints",
      "text": [
        "The model used for scoring alignments has no mechanism to prevent certain types of undesirable alignments, such as having all French words align to the same English word.",
        "To guide the search to correct alignments, we employ two constraints to limit our search for the most probable alignment.",
        "The first constraint is the one-to-one constraint (Melamed, 2000): every word (except the null words e0 and f0) participates in exactly one link.",
        "The second constraint, known as the cohesion constraint (Fox, 2002), uses the dependency tree (Mel’ˇcuk, 1987) of the English sentence to restrict possible link combinations.",
        "Given the dependency tree TE and a (partial) alignment A, the cohesion constraint requires that phrasal cohesion is maintained in the French sentence.",
        "If two phrases are disjoint in the English sentence, the alignment must not map them to overlapping intervals in the French sentence.",
        "This notion of phrasal constraints on alignments need not be restricted to phrases determined from a dependency structure.",
        "However, the experiments conducted in (Fox, 2002) indicate that dependency trees demonstrate a higher degree of phrasal cohesion during translation than other structures.",
        "Consider the partial alignment in Figure 1.",
        "The most probable lexical match for the English word to is the French word `a.",
        "When the system attempts to link to and `a, the distinct English phrases [the reboot] and [the host to discover all the devices] will be mapped to intervals in the French sentence, creating the induced phrasal intervals [`a ... [r´einitialisation] ... p´eriph´eriques].",
        "Regardless of what these French phrases will be after the alignment is completed, we know now that their intervals will overlap.",
        "Therefore, this link will not be added to the partial alignment.",
        "Suite à la réinitialisation , l' hôte repère tousles périphériques after to the reboot the host locate all the peripherals",
        "To define this notion more formally, let TE (ei) be the subtree of TE rooted at ei.",
        "The phrase span of ei, spanP(ei, TE, A), is the image of the English phrase headed by ei in F given a (partial) alignment A.",
        "More precisely, spanP(ei, TE, A) = [k1, k2], where",
        "The head span is the image of ei itself.",
        "We define spanH(ei, TE, A) = [k1, k2], where",
        "In Figure 1, for the node reboot, the phrase span is [4,4] and the head span is also [4,4]; for the node discover (with the link between to and a` in place), the phrase span is [2,11] and the head span is the empty set 0.",
        "With these definitions of phrase and head spans, we define two notions of overlap, originally introduced in (Fox, 2002) as crossings.",
        "Given a head node eh and its modifier e,,,,,, a head-modifier overlap occurs when: spanH(eh, TE, A) n spanP(e,,,,,, TE, A) =� 0 Given two nodes e,,,,,1 and e,,,,,2 which both modify the same head node, a modifier-modifier overlap occurs when: spanP(e,,,,,1 , TE, A) n spanP(e,,,,,2, TE, A) =� 0 Following (Fox, 2002), we say an alignment is cohesive with respect to TE if it does not introduce any head-modifier or modifier-modifier overlaps.",
        "For example, the alignment A in Figure 1 is not cohesive because spanP(reboot, TE, A) = [4, 4] intersects spanP(discover, TE, A) = [2,11].",
        "Since both reboot and discover modify causes, this creates a modifier-modifier overlap.",
        "One can check for constraint violations inexpensively by incrementally updating the various spans as new links are added to the partial alignment, and checking for overlap after each modification.",
