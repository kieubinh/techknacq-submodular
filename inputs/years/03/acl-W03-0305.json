        "We first represent co-occurrences between words across translations by a matrix, the rows of which represent the source language words, the columns the target language words, and the elements of the matrix the expected alignment frequencies (EAFs) for the words appearing in the corresponding row and column.",
        "Empty words are added in both languages in order to deal with words with no equivalent in the other language.",

        "The initial estimates are the observed frequencies of co-occurrences, obtained by considering each pair of aligned sentences and by incrementing the alignment frequencies accordingly.",
        "The sequence of updates will eventually converge and the EAFs are then normalized (by dividing each element by the row marginal ), so as to yield probabilistic translation lexicons, in which each source word is associated with a target word through a score.",
        "Using the bilingual lexicon thus obtained, we use a",
        "simple heuristic, based on the best match criterion described in (Gaussier et al., 2000) to align lexical words within sentences.",
        "We then count how many times two given words are aligned in such a way, and normalize the counts so as to get our final probabilistic translation lexicon."
