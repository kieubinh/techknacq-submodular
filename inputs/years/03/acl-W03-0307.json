        "The task was to indicate which word token in an English alignment sample corresponds to which word token in the French alignment sample.",
        "Two types of submission were permitted: for restricted submissions were allowed a “sentence” aligned segment of the Canadian Hansards to train the systems while unrestricted submission would be allowed to use additional resources.",
        "The performance of the systems was compared for a set of 447 English – French hand-aligned test samples which were also taken from the Canadian Hansards.",

        "The extracted dictionaries of the submitted data were compared with the extracted dictionary of the test data.",
        "We first discuss word-to-word and phrase-to-phrase alignment format.",
        "We present two different methods for extracting bilingual dictionaries from the word alignment data: a minimal dictionary contains the least number of unambiguous phrase-to-phrase translations while an exhaustive dictionary contains all possible unambiguous translations.",

        "Word alignments may have crossing and ambiguous branches.",
        "For instance in example 1, the French word “me” on position 8 has the translations “was”, and “he”, while “ai” has no connection to the English side.",
        "(ii) words (English or French) for which no alignments are given in the submitted data are assigned a null-alignment.",

        "Phrase-to-phrase alignments can be nested.",
        "For instance, the shorter English – French phrase translation 9-9 <-> 11-11 is included in the longer phrase translation 5-11 <-> 9-12:",
        "In this way structural information can be stored.",
        "On the other hand, we do not allow ambiguous phrase alignments as e.g.:",
        "evaluators inserted 7 null-alignments.",
        "In some cases (i.e. submission 11) this insertion accounts for almost 50% of the alignment data.",
        "In figure 1, “null-alignment” plots the union of the submitted alignment data and the inserted null-alignments.",
        "Null-alignments were not added to submission 16 as it provides alignment information for every word.",
        "The last data point on the x-axis (i.e. 17) represents the test data.",
        "As outlined in Melamed (1998), a sequence of words which translates in a non-compositional fashion into a target sequence is exhaustively linked (see example 2)."

        "Given the word alignment data in example 1, the minimum context required to disambiguate the French word “explications” is the phrase 5-11 <-> 9-12.",
        "From the word alignment data we generate bilingual dictionaries in two different ways: a minimal dictionary contains only the shortest unambiguous phrase-to-phrase translations.",

        "Thus, the minimal phrase dictionary extracted from example 3 contains 13 entries, while the exhaustive dictionary contains 54 entries.",

        "There were also 11 noisy entries which occurred in all generated submissions dictionaries but not in the test data dictionary.",
