        "Word alignment is a crucial part of any Machine Translation system, since it is the process of determining which words in a given source and target language sentence pair are translations of each other.",
        "This is a token level task, meaning that each word (token) in the source text is aligned with its corresponding translation in the target text.",
        "The Duluth Word Alignment System is a Perl implementation of IBM Model 2 (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "It learns a probabilistic model from sentence aligned parallel text that can then be used to align the words in another such text (that was not a part of the training process).",
        "A parallel text consists of a source language text and its translation into some target language.",
        "If we have determined which sentences are translations of each other then the text is said to be sentence aligned, where we call a source and target language sentence that are translations of each other a sentence pair.",
        "(Brown et al., 1993) introduced five statistical translation models (IBM Models 1 – 5).",
        "In general a statistical machine translation system is composed of three components: a language model, a translation model, and a decoder (Brown et al., 1988).",
        "The language model tells how probable a given sentence is in the source language, the translation model indicates how likely it is that a particular target sentence is a translation of a given source sentence, and the decoder is what actually takes a source sentence as input and produces its translation as output.",
        "Our focus is on translation models, since that is where word alignment is carried out.",
        "The IBM Models start very simply and grow steadily more complex.",
        "IBM Model 1 is based solely on the probability that a given word in the source language translates as a particular word in the target language.",
        "Thus, a word in the first position of the source sentence is just as likely to translate to a word in the target sentence that is in the first position versus one at the last position.",
        "IBM Model 2 augments these translation probabilities by taking into account how likely it is for words at particular positions in a sentence pair to be alignments of each other.",
        "This paper continues with a more detailed description of IBM Model 2.",
        "It goes on to present the implementation details of the Duluth Word Alignment System.",
        "Then we describe the data and the parameters that were used during the training and testing stages of the shared task on word alignment.",
        "Finally, we discuss our experimental results and briefly outline our future plans."

        "Model 2 is trained with sentence aligned parallel corpora.",
        "However, our goal is learn a model that can perform word alignment, and there are no examples of word alignments given in the training data.",
        "Thus, we must cast the training process as a missing data problem, where we learn about word alignments from corpora where only sentence (but not word) alignments are available.",
        "As is common with missing data problems, we use the Expectation– Maximization (EM) Algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977) to estimate the probabilities of word alignments in this model.",
        "The objective of Model 2 is to estimate the probability that a given sentence pair is aligned a certain way.",
        "This is represented by , where is the source sentence, is the target sentence, and is the proposed word alignment for the sentence pair.",
        "However, since this probability can’t be estimated directly from the training data, we must reformulate it so we can use the EM algorithm.",
        "From Bayes Rule we arrive at: where is the probability of a proposed alignment of the words in the target sentence to the words in the given source sentence.",
        "To estimate a probability for a particular alignment, we must estimate the numerator and then divide it by the sum of the probabilities of all possible alignments given the source sentence.",
        "While clear in principle, there are usually a huge number of possible word alignments between a source and target sentence, so we can’t simply estimate this for every possible alignment.",
        "Model 2 incorporates a distortion factor to limit the number of possible alignments that are considered.",
        "This factor defines the number of positions a source word may move when it is translated into the target sentence.",
        "For example, given a distortion factor of two, a source word could align with a word up to two positions to the left or right of the corresponding target word’s position.",
        "Model 2 is based on the probability of a source and target word being translations of each other, and the probability that words at particular source and target positions are translations of each other (without regard to what those words are).",
        "Thus, the numerator in Equation 1 is estimated as follows: The translation probability, , is the likelihood that , the target word at position , is the translation of a given source word that occurs at position .",
        "The alignment probability, , is the likelihood that position in the source sentence can align to a given position in the target sentence, where and are the given lengths of the source and target sentences.",
        "The denominator in Equation 1 is the sum of all the probabilities of all the possible alignments of a sentence pair.",
        "This can be estimated by taking the product of the sums of the translational and positional alignment probabilities.",
        "(3)",
        "where represents a position in the source sentence and all the other terms are as described previously.",
        "The EM algorithm begins by randomly initializing the translation and positional alignment probabilities in Equation 2.",
        "Then it estimates Equation 3 based on these values, which are then maximized for all the target words according to Equation 1.",
        "The re–estimated translation and positional alignment probabilities are normalized and the EM algorithm repeats the above process for a predetermined number of iterations or until it converges."

        "This is closely modeled after what is done in the GIZA++ tool kit (Och and Ney, 2000b).",
        "The snt2matrix program takes the snt file from plain2snt as input and outputs two files.",

        "It is made up of three different types of text: the novel 1984, by George Orwell, which contains 6,429 sentence pairs, the Romanian Constitution which contains 967 sentence pairs, and a set of selected newspaper articles collected from the Internet that contain 41,889 sentences pairs.",
        "The gold standard data used in the shared task consists of 248 manually word aligned sentence pairs that were held out of the training process.",

        "The English–French gold standard data included S and P alignments, but our system does not make this distinction, and only outputs S alignments.",
        "Submissions to the shared task evaluation were scored using precision, recall, the F-measure and the alignment error rate (AER).",
        "Precision is the number of correct alignments (C) out of the total number of alignments attempted by the system (S), while recall is the number of correct alignments (C) out of the total number of correct alignments (A) as given in the gold standard.",
        "That is, The F–measure is the harmonic mean of precision and recall: AER is defined by (Och and Ney, 2000a) and accounts for both Sure and Probable alignments in scoring.",
        "The word alignment results attained by our models are shown in Table 1.",
        "We score and report our results as no-null, since our system does not include null alignments (source words that don’t have a target translation).",
        "We",
        "also score relative to sure alignments only.",
        "During the shared task systems were scored with and without null alignments in the gold standard, so our results correspond to those without.",
        "It is apparent from Table 1 that the precision and recall of the models were not significantly affected by the distortion factor.",
        "Also, we note that the precision of the two language pairs is relatively similar.",
        "This may reflect that fact that we used approximately the same amount of training data for each language pair.",
        "However, note that the recall for English–French is much lower.",
        "We continue to investigate why this might be the case, but believe it may be due to the fact that the training data we randomly selected for the Hansards may not have been representative of the gold standard data.",
        "Finally, the alignment error rate (AER) is lower (and hence better) for English–French than Romanian– English.",
        "However, note that the F–measure for Romanian–English is higher (and therefore better) than English–French.",
        "While this may seem contradictory, AER factors in both Sure and Probable alignments into is scoring while only the English–French data included such alignments in its gold standard.",
        "The models used for our official submission to the shared task led to somewhat puzzling results, since as the number of iterations increased the precision and recall continued to fall.",
        "Upon further investigation, an error was found.",

        "Thereafter as the number of iterations increased the accuracy of the results rose and then reached a plateau that was near what is reported here.",
