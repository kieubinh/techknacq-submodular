        "The basic idea of example-based machine translation, or EBMT, is that translation examples similar to a part of an input sentence are retrieved and combined to produce a translation(Nagao, 1984).",
        "In order to make a practical MT system based on this approach, a large number of translation examples with structural correspondences are required.",
        "This naturally presupposes high-accuracy parsers and well-aligned large bilingual corpora.",
        "Over the last decade, the accuracy of the parsers improved significantly.",
        "The availability of well-aligned bilingual corpora, however, has not increased despite our expectations.",
        "In reality, the number of bilingual corpora that share the same content, such as newspapers and broadcast news, has increased steadily.",
        "We call this type of corpus a content-aligned corpus.",
        "With these observations, we started a research project that covered all aspects of constructing EBMT systems starting from using",

        "Finally, these examples are combined to generate the translation.",
