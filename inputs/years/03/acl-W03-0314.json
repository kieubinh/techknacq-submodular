        "In all of these approaches, a common problem seems to be an identification of meaningful multi-word translation units.",
        "There are a number of factors which make handling of multi-word units more complicated than it appears.",
        "First, it is a many-to-many mapping which potentially leads to a combinatorial explosion.",
        "Second, multi-word translation units are not necessarily contiguous, so an algorithm should not be hampered by the word adjacency constraint.",
        "Third, word segmentation itself is ambiguous for non-segmented languages such as Chinese or Japanese.",
        "We need to resolve such ambiguity as well.",
        "In this paper, we apply sequential pattern mining to solve the problem.",
        "First, the method effectively avoids an inherent combinatorial explosion by concatenating pairs of parallel sentences into single bilingual sequences and applying a pattern mining algorithm on those sequences.",
        "Second, it covers both rigid (gap-less) and gapped sequences.",
        "Third, it achieves a systematic way of enumerating all possible translation pair candidates, single or multi-word.",
        "Note that some are overlapped to account for word segmentation ambiguity.",
        "Our method is balanced by a conservative discovery of translation correspondences with the rationale that direct associations will win over indirect ones, thereby resolving the ambiguity."

        "We have proposed an effective method to find sequence-to-sequence correspondences from parallel corpora by sequential pattern mining.",
        "As far as multi-word translation is concerned, our method seems to work well, giving 56- 84% accuracy at 19% token coverage and 11 % type coverage.",
        "In this work, we choose English-Japanese pair and empirically evaluate our method.",
        "However, we believe the method is applicable to any language pair with appropriate language-specific preprocessing tools.",
        "As by-product of our experiment, we obtain Japanese-English parallel corpora of 150,000 sentences where alignment of validated subsequence correspondences are back-annotated.",
        "This was accomplished by looking up to a Double Array dictionary of sequential patterns constructed in the extraction method.",
        "This shows that our method can be useful not only to development of semi-automatic lexicon for data-driven machine translation, but also to annotation of corresponding subsequences in translation memory system."
