        "Automatic bilingual lexicon construction based on bilingual corpora has become an important first step for many studies and applications of natural language processing (NLP), such as machine translation (MT), cross-language information retrieval (CLIR), and bilingual text alignment.",
        "As noted in Tsuji (2002), many previous methods (Dagan et al., 1993; Kupiec, 1993; Wu and Xia, 1994; Melamed, 1996; Smadja et al., 1996) deal with this problem based on frequency of words appearing in the corpora, which can not be effectively applied to low-frequency words, such as transliterated words.",
        "These transliterated words are often domain-specific and created frequently.",
        "Many of them are not found in existing bilingual dictionaries.",
        "Thus, it is difficult to handle transliteration only via simple dictionary lookup.",
        "For CLIR, the accuracy of transliteration highly affects the performance of retrieval.",
        "In this paper, we present a framework of acquisition for English and Chinese transliterated word pairs based on the proposed statistical machine transliteration model.",
        "Recently, much research has been done on machine transliteration for many language pairs, such as English/Arabic (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002), English/Chinese (Chen et al., 1998; Lin and Chen, 2002; Wan and Verspoor, 1998), English/Japanese (Knight and Graehl, 1998), and English/Korean (Lee and Choi, 1997; Oh and Choi, 2002).",
        "Most previous approaches to machine transliteration have focused on the use of a pronunciation dictionary for converting source words into phonetic symbols, a manually assigned scoring matrix for measuring phonetic similarities between source and target words, or a method based on heuristic rules for source-to-target word transliteration.",
        "However, words with unknown pronunciations may cause problems for transliteration.",
        "In addition, using either a language-dependent penalty function to measure the similarity between bilingual word pairs, or handcrafted heuristic mapping rules for transliteration may lead to problems when porting to other language pairs.",
        "The proposed method in this paper requires no conversion of source words into phonetic symbols.",
        "The model is trained automatically on a bilingual proper name list via unsupervised learning.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives an overview of machine transliteration and describes the proposed model.",
        "Section 3 describes how to apply the model for extraction of transliterated target words from parallel texts.",
        "Experimental setup and quantitative assessment of performance are presented in Section 4.",
        "Concluding remarks are made in Section 5."

      "text": [
        "Machine transliteration can be regarded as a noisy channel, as illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "Briefly, the language model generates a source word E and the transliteration model converts the word E to a target transliteration C. Then, the channel decoder is used to find the word Ê that is the most likely to the word E that gives rise to the transliteration C. Under the noisy channel model, the back-transliteration problem is to find out the most probable word E, given transliteration C. Letting P(E) be the probability of a word E, then for a given transliteration C, the back-transliteration probability of a word E can be written as P(EIC).",
        "By Bayes’ rule, the transliteration problem can be written as follows:",
        "The first term, P(E), in Eq.",
        "(2) is the language model, the probability of E. The second term, P(CIE), in Eq.",
        "(2) is the transliteration model, the probability of the transliteration C conditioned on E. Below, we assume that E is written in English, while C is written in Chinese.",
        "Since Chinese and English are not in the same language family, there is no simple or direct way of mapping and comparison.",
        "One feasible solution is to adopt a Chinese romanization system1 to represent the pronunciation of each Chinese character.",
        "Among the many romanization systems for Chinese, Wade-Giles and Pinyin are the most widely used.",
        "The Wade-Giles system is commonly used in Taiwan today and has traditionally been popular among Western scholars.",
        "For this reason, we use the Wade-Giles system to romanize Chinese characters.",
        "However, the proposed approach is equally applicable to other romanization systems.",
        "The language model gives the prior probability P(E) which can be modeled using maximum likelihood estimation.",
        "As for the transliteration model P(CIE), we can approximate it using the transliteration unit (TU), which is a decomposition of E and C. TU is defined as a se",
        "quence of characters transliterated as a base unit.",
        "For English, a TU can be a monograph, a digraph, or a tri-graph (Wells, 2001).",
        "For Chinese, a TU can be a syllable initial, a syllable final, or a syllable (Chao, 1968) represented by corresponding romanized characters.",
        "To illustrate how this approach works, take the example of an English name, “Smith”, which can be segmented into four TUs and aligned with the romanized transliteration.",
        "Assuming that the word is segmented into “S-m-i-th”, then a possible alignment with the Chinese transliteration “P_It0 (Shihmissu)” is depicted in Figure 2."
