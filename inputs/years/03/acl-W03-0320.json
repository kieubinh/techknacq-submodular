        "The corpus of parallel texts we present consists of 3,432,212 words of English and 1,586,423 words of Inuktitut from the Nunavut Hansards.",
        "These Hansards are available to the public in electronic form in both English and Inuktitut (www.assembly.nu.ca).",
        "The Legislative Assembly of the newly created territory of Nunavut began sitting on April 1, 1999.",
        "Our corpus represents 155 days of transcribed proceedings of the Nunavut Legislative Assembly from that first session through to November 1, 2002, which was part way through the sixth session of the assembly.",
        "We gather and process these 155 documents in various ways described in the rest of this paper and make available a sentence-aligned version of the parallel texts (www.InuktitutComputing.ca/NunavutHansards).",
        "Like the French-English Canadian Hansards of parliamentary proceedings, this corpus represents a valuable resource for Machine Translation research and corpus research as well as for the development of language processing tools for Inuktitut.",
        "The work reported here takes some first steps toward these ends, and it is hoped that others will find ways to expand on this work.",
        "One reason that the Canadian Hansards, a large parallel corpus of English-French, are particularly useful for research is that they are comparatively noise free as parallel text collections go (Simard and Plamondon, 1996).",
        "This should be true of the Nunavut Hansard collection as well.",
        "The Canadian Hansard is transcribed in both languages so what was said in English is transcribed in English and then translated into French and vice versa.",
        "For the Nunavut Hansard, in contrast, a complete English version of the proceedings is prepared and then this is translated into Inuktitut, even when the original proceedings were spoken in Inuktitut."

      "text": [
        "Inuktitut is the language of the Inuit living in North Eastern Canada, that is, Nunavut (Keewatin and Baffin Island), Nunavik and Labrador.",
        "It includes six closely related spoken dialects: Kivalliq, Aivilik, North Baffin, South Baffin, Arctic Quebec (Nunavik), and Labrador.",
        "Inuktitut is a highly agglutinative language.",
        "Noun and verb roots occur with two main types of suffixes and there are many instantiations of these suffixes.",
        "The semantic suffixes modify the meaning of the root (over 250 of these in North Baffin dialect) and the grammatical suffixes indicate features like agreement and mood (approximately 700 verbal endings and over 300 nominal endings in North Baffin dialect).",
        "A single word in Inuktitut is often translated with multiple English words, sometimes corresponding to a full English clause.",
        "For example, the Inuktitut word SQL �TaSb�0.",
        "a��b��aSb`Sb (which is transliterated as qaisaJJaliniaqquunngikkaluaqpuq) corresponds to these eight English words: ‘Actually he will probably not come early today’.",
        "The verbal root is qai ‘come’, the semantic suffixes are -saali-, -niaq-, -qquu-, -nngit- and -galuaqmeaning ‘soon’, ‘a little later today or tomorrow’, ‘probability’, ‘negation’, and ‘actuality’ respectively, and finally the grammatical suffix -puq expresses the 3rd person singular of the indicative mood.",
        "This frequently occurring one-to-many correspondence represents a challenge for word correspondence.",
        "The opposite challenging situation, namely instances of many-to-one correspondences, also arises for this language pair but less frequently.",
        "The latter is therefore not addressed in this paper.",
        "Yet another challenge is the morphophonological complexity of Inuktitut as reflected in the orthography, which has two components.",
        "First, the sheer number of possible suffixes mentioned above is problematic.",
        "Second, the shape of these suffixes is variable.",
        "That is, there are significant orthographic changes to the individual morphemes when they occur in the context of a word.",
        "This type of variability can be seen in the above example at the interface of -nngit- and -galuaq-, which together become -nngikkaluaq-.",
        "Finally, it is important to note that Inuktitut has a syllabic script for which there is a standard Romanization.",
        "To give an idea of how the scripts compare, our corpus of parallel texts consists of 20,124,587 characters of English and 13,457,581 characters in Inuktitut syllabics as compared to 21,305,295 characters of Inuktitut in Roman script."

        "The algorithm used to align English-Inuktitut sentences is an extension of that presented in Gale and Church (1993).",
        "It does not identify crossing alignments where the sentence order within paragraphs in the parallel texts differs.",
        "Sentence alignments typically involve one English sentence matching one Inuktitut sentence (a 1-to-1 bead), but may also involve 2-to-1, 1-to-2, 0-to-1, 1-to-0 and 2-to-2 sentence matching patterns, or beads.",
        "Using such a length-based approach where the length of sentences is measured in characters is appropriate for our language pair since the basic assumption generally holds.",
        "Namely, longer English sentences typically correspond to longer Inuktitut sentences as measured in characters.",
        "One problem with the approach, as pointed out by Macklovitch and Hannan (1998), is that from the point where a paragraph is misaligned, it is difficult to ensure proper alignment for the remainder of the paragraph.",
        "We observed this effect in our alignment.",
        "We also observed that the large number of small paragraphs with almost identical length caused problems for the algorithm.",
        "Many alignment approaches have addressed such problems by making use of additional linguistic clues specific to the languages to be aligned.",
        "For our language pair, it was not feasible to use most of these.",
        "For example, some alignment techniques make good use of cognates (Simard and Plamondon, 1996).",
        "The assumption is that words in the two languages that share the first few letters are usually translations of each other.",
        "English and Inuktitut, however, are too distantly related to have many cognates.",
        "Even the translation of a proper name does not usually result in a cognate for our language pair, since the translation between scripts induces a phonetic translation rather than a character-preserving translation of the name, as these pairs illustrate Peter, Piita; Canada, Kanata; McLean, Makalain.",
        "Following a suggestion in Gale and Church (1993), the alignment was aided by the use of additional anchors that were available for the language pair.",
        "These anchors consisted of non-alphabetic sequences (such as 9: 00, 42-1 (1) and 1999) and 8 reliable word correspondences that occurred frequently in the corpus, including words beginning with these character sequences speaker/uqaqti and motion/pigiqati, for example."

        "For English, the main issue was ensuring that illegal or unusual characters are mapped to other characters to simplify later processing.",

        "Inuktitut syllabics can be represented using a 7-bit encoding called ProSyl, which is in many cases extended to an 8-bit encoding Tunngavik.",
        "Each syllabic character can be encoded in multiple ways that need to be mapped into a uniform scheme, such as Unicode.",
        "Each separate file was converted to HTML using a commercial product LogicTran r2net.",
        "Then, the Perl package HTML::TreeBuilder was used to purge the text of anomalies and set up the correct mappings.",
        "The output of this initial preprocessing step was a collection of HTML files in pure Unicode UTF8.",
        "Boundary Identification: The next step was to identify the paragraph and sentence boundaries for the Inuktitut and English texts.",
        "Sentences were split at periods, question marks, colons and semicolons except where the following character was a lower case letter or a number.",
        "This resulted in a number of errors but was quite accurate in general.",
        "Paragraph boundaries were inserted where such logical breaks occurred as signaled in the HTML and generally correspond to natural breaks in the original document.",
        "Using HTML indicators contributed to the number of very short paragraphs, especially toward the beginning of each document.",
        "As mentioned in section 3.",
        "1, these short paragraphs were problematic for the alignment algorithm.",
        "The collection consists of 348,619 sentences in 112,346 paragraphs in English and 352,486 sentences in 118,733 paragraphs in Inuktitut.",
        "After this step, document, paragraph and sentence boundaries were available to use as hard and soft boundaries for the Gale and Church algorithm.",
        "Syllabic Script Conversion: The word correspondence phase required a Roman script representation of the Inuktitut texts.",
        "The conversion from unicode syllabics to Roman characters was performed at this stage in the sentence alignment process using the standard ICI conversion method.",
        "Anchors: The occurrences of the lexical anchors mentioned above were found and used with a dynamic programming search to find the path with the largest number of alignments.",
        "This algorithm was written in Perl and required about two hours to process the whole corpus.",
        "All alignments that occurred in the first two sentences of each paragraph were marked as hard boundaries for the Gale and Church (1993) program as provided in their paper."

        "This lower bound rises as the PMI rises or as the amount of data increases.",
        "Many measures of association would likely work as well as the lower confidence bound on PMI.",

        "Second, it addressed the problem of low frequency events.",
        "Third, it makes the correct judgment on Gale and Church’s well-known chambre-communes problem (Gale and Church, 1991).",

        "Many previous efforts have used a similar methodology but were only able to focus on word to word correspondences (Gale and Church, 1991).",
        "Here, the English words can correspond to any substring in any Inuktitut word in the aligned region.",
        "This means that statistics have to be maintained for many possible pairs.",

        "This approach thereby addresses the challenge of Inuktitut roots and multiple semantic suffixes corresponding to individual English words.",
