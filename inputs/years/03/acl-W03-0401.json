        "Recent studies on the automatic extraction of lexicalized grammars (Xia, 1999; Chen and Vijay-Shanker, 2000; Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002a) allow the modeling of syntactic disambiguation based on linguistically motivated grammar theories including LTAG (Chiang, 2000) and CCG (Clark et al., 2002; Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002b).",
        "However, existing models of disambiguation with lexicalized grammars are a mere extension of lexicalized probabilistic context-free grammars (LPCFG) (Collins, 1996; Collins, 1997; Charniak, 1997), which are based on the decomposition ofparsing results into the syntactic/semantic dependencies of two words in a sentence under the assumption of independence of the dependencies.",
        "While LPCFG models have proved that the incorporation of lexical associations (i.e., dependencies of words) significantly improves the accuracy of parsing, this idea has been naively inherited in the recent studies on disambiguation models of lexicalized grammars.",
        "However, the disambiguation models of lexicalized grammars should be totally different from that of LPCFG, because the grammars define the relation of syntax and semantics, and can restrict the possible structure of parsing results.",
        "Parsing results cannot simply be decomposed into primitive dependencies, because the complete structure is determined by solving the syntactic constraints of a complete sentence.",
        "For example, when we apply a unification-based grammar, LPCFG-like modeling results in an inconsistent probability model because the model assigns probabilities to parsing results not allowed by the grammar (Abney, 1997).",
        "We have only two ways of adhering to LPCFG models: preserve the consistency of probability models by abandoning improvements to the lexicalized grammars using complex constraints (Chiang, 2000), or ignore the inconsistency in probability models (Clark et al., 2002).",
        "This paper provides a new model of syntactic disambiguation in which lexicalized grammars can restrict the possible structures of parsing results.",
        "Our modeling aims at providing grounds for i) producing a consistent probabilistic model of lexicalized grammars, as well as ii) evaluating the contributions of syntactic and semantic preferences to syntactic disambiguation.",
        "The model is composed of the syntax and semantics probabilities, which represent syntactic and semantic preferences respectively.",
        "The syntax probability is responsible for determining the syntactic categories chosen by words in a sentence, and the semantics probability selects the most plausible dependencies of words from candidates allowed by the syntactic categories yielded by the syntax probability.",
        "Since the sequence of syntactic categories restricts the possible structure of parsing results, the semantics probability is a conditional probability without decomposition into the primitive dependencies of words.",
        "Recently used machine learning methods including maximum entropy models (Berger et al., 1996) and support vector machines (Vapnik, 1995) provide grounds for this type of modeling, because it allows various dependent features to be incorporated into the model without the independence assumption.",
        "The above approach, however, has a serious deficiency: a lexicalized grammar assigns exponentially many parsing results because of local ambiguities in a sentence, which is problematic in estimating the parameters of a probability model.",
        "To cope with this, we adopted an algorithm of maximum entropy estimation for feature forests (Miyao and Tsujii, 2002; Geman and Johnson, 2002), which allows parameters to be efficiently estimated.",
        "The algorithm enables probabilistic modeling of complete structures, such as transition sequences in Markov models and parse trees, without dividing them into independent sub-events.",
        "The algorithm avoids exponential explosion by representing a probabilistic event by a packed representation of a feature space.",
        "If a complete structure is represented with a feature forest of a tractable size, the parameters can be efficiently estimated by dynamic programming.",
        "A series of studies on parsing with wide-coverage LFG (Johnson et al., 1999; Riezler et al., 2000; Riezler et al., 2002) have had a similar motivation to ours.",
        "Their models have also been based on a discriminative model to select a parsing result from all candidates given by the grammar.",
        "A significant difference is that we apply maximum entropy estimation for feature forests to avoid the inherent problem with estimation: the exponential explosion of parsing results given by the grammar.",
        "They assumed that parsing results would be suppressed to a reasonable number through using heuristic rules, or by carefully implementing a fully restrictive and wide-coverage grammar, which requires a considerable amount of effort to develop.",
        "Our contention is that this problem can be solved in a more sophisticated way as is discussed in this paper.",
        "Another difference is that our model is separated into syntax and semantics probabilities, which will benefit computational/linguistic investigations into the relation between syntax and semantics, and allow separate improvements to both models.",
        "Overall, the approach taken in this paper is different from existing models in the following respects.",
        "• Since it does not require the assumption of independence, the probability model is consistent with lexicalized grammars with complex constraints including unification-based grammar formalism.",
        "Our model can assign consistent probabilities to parsing results of lexicalized grammars, while the traditional models assign probabilities to parsing results not allowed by the grammar.",
        "• Since the syntax and semantics probabilities are sep",
        "arate, we can improve them individually.",
        "For example, the syntax model can be improved by smoothing using the syntactic classes of words, while the semantics model should be able to be improved by using semantic classes.",
        "In addition, the model can be a starting point that allows the theory of syntax and semantics to be evaluated through consulting an extensive corpus.",
        "We evaluated the validity of our model through experiments on a disambiguation task of parsing the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1994) with an automatically acquired LTAG grammar.",
        "To assess the contribution of the syntax and semantics probabilities to the accuracy ofparsing and to evaluate the validity of applying maximum entropy estimation for feature forests, we compared three models trained with the same training set and the same set of features.",
        "Following the experimental results, we concluded that i) a parser with the syntax probability only achieved high accuracy with the lexicalized grammar, ii) the incorporation ofpreferences for lexical association through the semantics probability resulted in significant improvements, and iii) our model recorded an accuracy that was quite close to the traditional model, which indicated the validity of applying maximum entropy estimation for feature forests.",
        "In what follows, we first describe the existing models for syntactic disambiguation, and discuss problems with them in Section 2.",
        "We then define the general form for parsing results of lexicalized grammars, and introduce our model in Section 3.",
        "We prove the validity of our approach through a series of experiments in Section 4."

        "Second, traditional and our model recorded significantly higher accuracy than syntax.",
        "The accuracy of our model was almost matched traditional, which proved the validity of probabilistic modeling with maximum entropy estimation for feature forests.",
        "The differences between traditional and our model were insignificant and the results proved that a consistent probability model of parsing can be built without the independence assumption, and attains performance that rivals the traditional models in terms of parsing accuracy.",
        "We should note that accuracy can further be improved with our model because it allows other features to be incorporated that were not used in these experiments because the model is not rely on the decomposition into the dependencies of two words.",
        "Another possibility to increase the accuracy is to refine the LTAG grammar.",
        "Although we assumed that all syntactic constraints were expressed with syntactic categories (Section 3), i.e., elementary trees, the grammar used in the experiments were not augmented with feature structures and not sufficiently restrictive to eliminate syntactically invalid structures.",
        "Since our model did not include the preferences of syntactic relations of words, we expect the refinement of the grammar will greatly improve the accuracy."

        "This paper described a novel model for syntactic disambiguation based on lexicalized grammars, where the model selects the most probable parsing result from the candidates allowed by a lexicalized grammar.",
        "Since lexicalized grammars can restrict the possible structure of parsing results, the probabilistic model cannot simply be decomposed into independent events as in the existing disambiguation models for parsing.",
        "By applying a maximum entropy model for feature forests, we achieved probabilistic modeling without decomposition.",
        "Through experiments, we proved the syntax-only model could record with high level of accuracy with a lexicalized grammar, and maximum entropy estimation for fea",
        "ture forests could attain competitive accuracy compared to the traditional model.",
        "We see this work as the first step in the application of linguistically motivated grammars to the parsing of real-world texts as well as the evaluation of linguistic theories by consulting extensive corpora.",
        "Future work should include the application of our model to other lexicalized grammars including HPSG.",
        "The development of sophisticated parsing strategies is also required to improve the accuracy and efficiency of parsing.",
        "Since parsing results of lexicalized grammars such as HPSG and CCG can include non-local dependencies, we cannot simply apply well-known parsing strategies, such as beam thresholding, which assume the local computation of preference scores.",
        "Further investigations must be left for future research."
