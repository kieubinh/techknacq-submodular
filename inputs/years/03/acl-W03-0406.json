        "To avoid this, we propose two methods to estimate the optimum iteration number in the EM algorithm.",
        "Many problems in natural language processing can be converted into classification problems, and be solved by an inductive learning method.",
        "This strategy has been very successful, but it has a serious problem in that an inductive learning method requires labeled data, which is expensive because it must be made manually.",
        "To overcome this problem, unsupervised learning methods using huge unlabeled data to boost the performance of rules learned by small labeled data have been proposed re-cently(Blum and Mitchell, 1998)(Yarowsky, 1995)(Park et al., 2000)(Li and Li, 2002).",
        "Among these methods, the method using the EM algorithm proposed by the pa-per(Nigam et al., 2000), which is referred to as the EM method in this paper, is the state of the art.",
        "However, the target of the EM method is text classification.",
        "It is hoped that this method can be applied to WSD, because WSD is the most important problem in natural language processing.",
        "The EM method works well in text classification, but often causes worse classification in WSD.",
        "The EM method is expected to improve the accuracy of learned rules step by step in proportion to the iteration number in the EM algorithm.",
        "However, this rarely happens in practice, and in many cases, the accuracy falls after a certain iteration number in the EM algorithm.",
        "In the worst case, the accuracy of the rule learned through only labeled data is degraded by using unlabeled data.",
        "To overcome this problem, we estimate an optimum iteration number in the EM algorithm, and in actual learning, we stop the iteration of the EM algorithm at the estimated number.",
        "If the estimated number is 0, it means that the EM method is not used.",
        "To estimate the optimum iteration number, we propose two methods: one uses cross validation and the other uses two heuristics besides cross validation.",

        "In experiments, we solved 50 noun WSD problems in the Japanese Dictionary Task in SENSEVAL2(Kurohashi and Shirai, 2001).",
        "The original EM method failed to boost the precision (76.78%) of the rule learned through only labeled data.",

        "In this paper, we improved the EM method proposed by Nigam et al.",
        "for text classification problems in order to apply it to WSD problems.",
        "To avoid some failures in the original EM method, we proposed two methods to estimate the optimum iteration number in the EM algorithm.",
        "In experiments, we tested with 50 noun WSD problems in the Japanese Dictionary Task in SENSEVAL2.",
        "Our two methods greatly improved the original EM method.",
        "Especially, the score of noun evaluation words was equivalent to the best public score of this task.",
        "Furthermore, our methods were also effective for verb WSD problems.",
        "In future, we will tackle three works: (1) To find other effective features for unsupervised learning of verb WSD, (2) To improve the estimation method of the optimum iteration number in the EM algorithm, and (3) To investigate the reason for the failure of the EM method."
