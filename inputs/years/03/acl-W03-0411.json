        "For FrameNet, the combined use of both collocation types achieves better performance for the individual classifiers: 70.3% versus 68.5%.",

        "A typical collegiate dictionary has dozens of senses for each of the common prepositions.",
        "These senses tend to be closely related, in contrast to the other parts of speech where there might be a variety of distinct senses.",
        "Given the recent advances in word-sense disambiguation, due in part to SENSEVAL (Edmonds and Cotton, 2001), it would seem natural to apply the same basic approach to handling the disambiguation of prepositions.",
        "Of course, it is difficult to disambiguate prepositions at the granularity present in collegiate dictionaries, as illustrated later.",
        "Nonetheless, in certain cases this is feasible.",
        "We provide results for disambiguating prepositions at two different levels of granularity.",
        "The coarse granularity is more typical of earlier work in computational linguistics, such as the role inventory proposed by Fillmore (1968), including high-level roles such as instrument and location.",
        "Recently, systems have incorporated fine-grained roles, often specific to particular domains.",
        "For example, in the Cyc KB there are close to 200 different types of semantic roles.",
        "These range from high-level roles (e.g., beneficiaries) through medium-level roles (e.g., exchanges) to highly specialized roles (e.g., catalyst).1 Preposition classification using two different semantic role inventories are investigated in this paper, taking advantage of large annotated corpora.",
        "After providing background to the work in Section 2, experiments over the semantic role annotations are discussed in Section 3.",
        "The results over TREEBANK (Marcus et al., 1994) are covered first.",

        "This shows that for the hypernym associations, only those words that occur within 5 words of the target prepositions are considered.",
        "The main difference from that of a standard WSD approach is that, during the determination of the class-based collocations, each word token is replaced by synset tokens for its hypernyms in WordNet, several of which might occur more than once.",
        "This introduces noise due to ambiguity, but given the conditional-independence selection scheme, the preference for hypernym synsets that occur for different words will compensate somewhat.",
        "O’Hara and Wiebe (2003) provide more details on the extraction of these hypernym collocations.",
        "The feature settings in Figure 1 are used in two different configurations: word-based collocations alone, and a combination of word-based and hypernym-based collocations.",
