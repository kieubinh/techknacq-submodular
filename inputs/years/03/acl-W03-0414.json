        "Then a similarity measure in the space defined by the training data serves to define a classifier for unseen data.",
        "We report evaluation results for a French dictionary, while the approach is general enough to be applied to any language pair.",
        "In a further step, we show that the proposed framework can be used to assign linguistic roles to extracted morphemes, e.g. noun plural markers.",
        "While the morphemes can be extracted using any algorithm, we present a simple algorithm for doing so.",
        "The emphasis hereby is not on the algorithm itself, but on the power of the framework to assign roles, which are ultimately indispensable for tasks such as Machine Translation."

        "The Machine Translation community has recently undergone a major shift of focus towards data-driven techniques.",
        "Among these techniques, example-based (e.g. (Brown, 1997)) and statistical (e.g. (Brown et al., 1990; Brown et al., 1993)) are best known and studied.",
        "They aim at extracting information from bilingual text and building translation systems automatically.",
        "This empirical approach overcomes the development bottleneck that traditional transfer and interlingua-based approaches face.",
        "What used to take years of human development time can now be achieved in a fraction of the time with similar accuracy.",
        "However, in studying such empirical approaches and the output of the resulting systems, there have been calls for the reincorporation of more linguistic intuition and/or knowledge.",
        "One notable example in this context is (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Yamada and Knight, 2002), who introduce syntactic knowledge into their statistical translation model.",
        "Our approach goes in a similar direction.",
        "The AVENUE system (Carbonell et al., 2002) infers syntactic transfer rules similar to the ones a human grammar writer would produce.",
        "The training data is bilingual text, and learning is facilitated by the usage of linguistic information (e.g. parses, feature information).",
        "We focus primarily on a resource-rich/resourcepoor situations, i.e. on language pairs where for one of the languages resources such as a parser are available, but not for the other language.",
        "It is outside the scope of this paper to describe our rule learning approach.",
        "The interested reader should refer to (Carbonell et al., 2002; Probst, 2002).",
        "From the brief description above it should become apparent that heavy reliance on feature-tagged dictionaries and/or parsers becomes a new bottleneck for Machine Translation development.",
        "Our work focuses on target languages for which there does exist a dictionary, but its entries may are initially not tagged with linguistic feature values, so that the dictionary is a mere word list (which is what Example-based Machine Translation and Statistical Machine Translation systems use most frequently).",
        "Having the feature values can become very useful in translation.",
        "For example, if the English sentence contains a plural noun, the system can ensure that this word is translated into a plural noun in the target language (if the learned rule requires this).",
        "Despite the importance of the feature tags, we cannot afford to build such a rich dictionary by hand.",
        "Moreover, we cannot even rely on the availability of experts that can write morphological rules for a given language.",
        "Rather, we wish to develop an algorithm that is general enough that it can be applied to any language pair and does not require knowledge of the target language’s morphology.",
        "In this paper, we explore the following features: parts of speech (pos), number on nouns, adjectives, and verbs, and tense on verbs.",
        "Furthermore, the process is fully automatic, thus eliminating the need for human expertise in a given language.",
        "Our main idea is based on using a bilingual corpus between English and a target language.",
        "In our experiments, we report results for French as the target language.",
        "We annotate the English side of the corpus with pos tags, using the Brill tagger (Brill, 1995).",
        "We further utilize a statistical bilingual (English French) dictionary in order to find candidates translations for particular English words.",
        "Our work falls in line with the bilingual analysis described in (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001; Yarowsky et al., 2001).",
        "While we use a different approach and tackle a different problem, the major reasoning steps are the same.",
        "(Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001) aim at pos tagging a target language corpus using English pos tags as well as estimation of lexical priors (i.e. what pos tags can a word have with what probability) and a tag sequence model.",
        "The authors further report results on matching inflected verb forms in the target language with infinitive verbs, as well as on noun phrase chunking.",
        "In all three cases, the information on the English side is used to infer linguistic information on the target language side.",
        "Our work follows the same idea."

        "The algorithm was further only evaluated on N, V, and J, first because they are the most likely pos (so more reliable estimates can be given), and second because the remainder of the paper only deals with these three pos.",

        "Then pick as a likely translation the word with the highest probability in the statistical dictionary that also occurs in the French sentence .",
        "We then simply add the number of times that a given word corresponds to an English word of tag , denoted by .",
        "This information is used to infer Given the way our algorithm estimates the probabilities of pos for each French word, it is clear that some noise is introduced.",
        "Therefore, any pos will be assigned a non-zero probability by the algorithm for each French word.",
        "However, as was noted by (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001), most words tend to have at most two pos.",
        "In an attempt to balance out the noise introduced by the algorithm itself, we do not want to assign more than two possible pos to each word.",
        "Thus, for each French word we only retain the two most likely tags and rescale their probabilities so that they sum to 1.",
        "Denote as the most likely tag for word , as the second most likely tag for word .",
        "Then and In order to have a target language dictionary tagged with pos, we use the statistical bilingual dictionary and extract all French words.",
        "If a French word was encountered during the pos training, it is assigned the one or two most likely tags (together with the probabilities).",
        "Otherwise, the word remains untagged, but is retained in the target language dictionary.",

        "Instead of only extracting the most likely",
        "and adjectives, evaluated on 2500 French dictionary entries.",
        "French correspondent, we take into account the correspondence probability as assigned by the statistical bilingual dictionary.",
        "Instead of simply counting how many times a French word corresponds to, say, a noun, the counts are weighted by the probability of each of the correspondences.",

        "We tested the algorithm on parts of the Hansard data, 200000 sentence pairs between English and French.",
        "The evaluation was done on 2500 French lexicon entries, which were hand-tagged with pos.",
        "For each automatically assignment pos assignment, we check whether this assignment was also given in the hand-developed partial dictionary.",
        "Partial matches are allowed, so that if the algorithm assigned one correct and one incorrect pos, the correctly assigned label is taken into account in the accuracy measure.",
        "Table 1 shows the results of the tagging estimates.",
        "It can be seen that due to the relative rarity of adjectives, the estimates are less reliable than for nouns and verbs.",
        "Further, the results show that incorporating the probabilities from the bilingual lexicon does not result in consistent estimation improvement.",
        "A possible explanation is that most of the French words that are picked as likely translations are highly ranked and correspond to the given English word with similar probabilities.",
        "(Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001) propose the same algorithm as the one proposed here for their estimation of lexical priors, with the exception that they use automatic word alignments rather than our extraction algorithm for finding corresponding words.",
        "As for (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001) estimating lexical priors is merely an intermediate step, they do not report evaluation results for this step.",

        "We begin by conjecturing that most morphemes will not be longer than four characters, and learn only patterns up to that length.",
        "Our algorithm starts by extracting all patterns in the training data of up to four characters, however restricting its attention to the dimensions in .",
        "If contains more than 4 dimensions, the algorithm works only with those 4 dimensions that had the greatest impact.",
        "All 1, 2, 3, and 4 character combinations that occur in the training data are listed together with how often they occur.",
        "The reasoning behind this is that those patterns that occur most frequently in the training data are likely those ‘responsible’ for marking the given feature.",
        "However, it is not straightforward to determine automatically how long a morpheme is.",
        "For instance, consider the English morpheme ‘-ing’ (the gerund morpheme).",
        "The algorithm will extract the patterns ‘i ’, ‘ n ’, ‘ g’, ‘in ’, ‘i g’, ‘ ng’, and ‘ing’.",
        "If we based the morpheme extraction merely on the frequency of the patterns, the algorithm would surely extract one of the single letter patterns, since they are guaranteed to occur at least as many times as the longer patterns.",
        "More likely, they will occur more frequently.",
        "In order to overcome this difficulty, we apply a subsumption filter.",
        "If a shorter patterns is subsumed by a longer one, we no longer consider it.",
        "Subsumption is defined as follows: suppose pattern appears with frequency , where as pattern appears with frequency , and that is shorter than .",
        "Then is subsumed by if The algorithm repeatedly checks for subsumption until no more subsumptions are found, at which point the remaining patterns are sorted by frequency.",
        "It then outputs the most frequent patterns.",
        "The cutoff value (i.e. how far down the list to go) is a tunable parameter.",
        "In our experiments, we set this parameter to 0.05 probability.",
        "Note that we convert the frequencies to probabilities by dividing the counts by the sum of all patterns’ frequencies.",
        "The patterns are listed simply as arrays of 4-characters (or fewer if contains fewer elements).",
        "It should be noted that the characters are listed in the order of the dimensions.",
        "This, however, does not mean that the patterns have to be contiguous.",
        "For instance, if dimension 1 has a unifying effect, and so do dimensions 14, 15, and 16, the patterns are listed as 4-character combinations in increasing order of the dimensions.",
        "For illustration purposes, table 3 lists several patterns that were extracted for past tense marking on verbs 2.",
        "All highly-ranked extracted patterns contained only letters in the last two dimensions, so that only those two dimensions are shown in the table.",
        "Further investigation and the development of a more sophisticated algorithm for extracting patterns should enable us to collapse some of the patterns into one.",
        "For instance, the patterns ‘´ee’ and ‘´es’ should be considered special cases of ‘´e ’.",
        "Note further that the algorithm extracted the pattern ‘ s’, which was caused by the fact that many verbs were marked for plural in the pass´e compos´e in French.",
        "In order to overcome this difficulty, a more complex morphology algorithm should combine findings from different pos/feature combinations.",
        "This has been left for future investigation."

        "We have presented an approach to tagging a monolingual dictionary with linguistic features such as pos, number, and tense.",
        "We use a bilingual corpus and the English pos tags to extract information that can be used to infer the feature values for the target language.",
        "We have further argued that our approach can be used to infer the morphemes that mark the linguistic features in question and to assign the morphemes linguistic meaning.",
        "While various frameworks for unsupervised morpheme extraction have been proposed, many of them more sophisticated than ours, the main advantage of this approach is that the annotation of morphemes with their meaning is immediate.",
        "We believe that this is an important contribution, as role assignment becomes indispensible for tasks such as Machine Translation.",
        "One area of future investigation is the improvement of the classification algorithm.",
        "We have only presented one approach to classification.",
        "In order to apply established algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, we will have to adopt our algorithm to extract a set of likely positive examples as well as a set of likely negative examples.",
        "This will be the next step in our process, so that we can determine the performance of our system when using various well-studied classification methods.",
        "This paper represents our first steps in bilingual feature annotation.",
        "In the future, we will investigate tagging target language words with gender and case.",
        "This information is not available in English, so it will be a more challenging problem.",
        "The extracted training data will have to be fragmented based on what has already been learned about other features.",
        "We believe that our approach can be useful for any application that can gain from linguistic information in the form of feature tags.",
        "For instance, our system (Carbonell et al., 2002) infers syntactic transfer rules, but it relies heavily on the existence of a fully-inflected, tagged target language dictionary.",
        "With the help of the work described here we can obtain such a dictionary for any language for which we have a bilingual, sentence-aligned corpus.",
        "Other approaches to Machine Translation as well as applications like shallow parsing could also benefit from this work."
