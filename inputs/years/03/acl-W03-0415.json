        "This paper demonstrates that mathematical models for measuring semantic similarity between concepts can be used to improve the learning of hyponymy relationships between concepts from free text.",
        "In particular, we show that latent semantic analysis can be used to filter results, giving an increase in precision, and that neighbors in a graph built from coordination information can be used to improve recall.",
        "The goal of extracting semantic information from text is well-established, and has encouraged work on lexical acquisition (Roark and Charniak, 1998), information extraction (Cardie, 1997), and ontology engineering (Hahn and Schnattinger, 1998).",
        "The purpose of this kind of work is to collect information about the meanings of lexical items or phrases, and the relationships between them, so that the process of building semantic resources (such as ontologies and dictionaries) by hand can be automated or at least helped.",
        "One of the standard ways of arranging concepts is in a concept hierarchy or taxonomy such as the WordNet noun taxonomy (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "The fundamental relationship between objects in a taxonomy is called hyponymy, where y is a hyponym of x if every y is also an x.",
        "For example, every trout is also a fish, so we say that trout is a hyponym (“below name”) offish and conversely, fish is a hypernym (“above name”) of trout.",
        "Other names exist for variants of the hyponymy relationship, such as an IS A relationship, a parent-node / child-node relationship, and a broader term / narrower term relationship.",
        "It is also noted that the genus of an object, in traditional lexicographic terms, is often a hypernym of that object (Guthrie et al., 1996).",
        "Throughout this paper we will write y C x for the relationship “y is a hyponym of x”.",
        "In this paper, we use the hyponymy relationship to describe subset relationships, so we regardy C x to be true if the set of y’s can reasonably be said to be a subset of the set of x’s.1 Because hyponymy relationships are so central to knowledge engineering, there have been numerous attempts to learn them from text, beginning with those of Hearst (1992).",
        "We review this work in Section 2, where we reproduce similar experiments as a baseline from which to expand.",
        "The rest of the paper demonstrates ways in which other mathematical models built from text corpora can be used to improve hyponymy extraction.",
        "In Section 3, we show how latent semantic analysis can be used to filter potential relationships according to their “semantic plausibility”.",
        "In Section 4, we show how correctly extracted relationships can be used as “seed-cases” to extract several more relationships, thus improving recall; this work shares some similarities with that of Caraballo (1999).",
        "In Section 5 we show that combining the techniques of Section 3 and Section 4 improves both precision and recall.",
        "Section 6 demonstrates that 1Another possible view is that “hyponymy” should only refer to core relationships, not contingent ones (so pheasant C bird might be accepted but pheasant C food might not be, because it depends on context and culture).",
        "We use the broader “subset” definition because contingent relationships are an important part of world-knowledge (and are therefore worth learning), and because in practice we found the distinction difficult to enforce.",
        "Another definition is given by Caraballo (1999): “... a word A is said to be a hypernym of a word B if native speakers of English accept the sentence ‘B is a (kind of) A.’ ” linguistic tools such as lemmatization can be used to reliably put the extracted relationships into a normalized or “canonical” form for addition to a semantic resource."

        "The first major attempt to extract hyponyms from text was that of Hearst (1992), described in more detail in (Hearst, 1998), who extracted relationships from the text of Grolier’s Encyclopedia.",
        "The method is illustrated by the following example.",
        "The sentence excerpt Even then, we would trail behind other European Community members, such as Germany, France and Italy... (BNC)2 indicates that Germany, France, and Italy are all European Community members.",
        "More generally, phrases of the form x such as y1 (y2, ... , and/or yam,) frequently indicate that the yz are all hyponyms of the hypernym x. Hearst identifies several other constructions that have a tendency to indicate hyponymy, calling these constructions lexicosyntactic patterns, and analyses the results.",
        "She reports that 52% of the relations extracted by the “or other” pattern (see Table 1) were judged to be “pretty good relations”.",
        "A more recent variant of this technique was implemented by Alfonseca and Manandhar (2001), who compare the collocational patterns of words from The Lord of the Rings with those of words in the WordNet taxonomy, adding new nouns to WordNet with an accuracy of 28%.",
        "Using a much more knowledge-intensive approach, Hahn and Schnattinger (1998) improve “learning accuracy” from around 50% to over 80% by forming a number of hypotheses and accepting only those which are most consistent with their current ontology.",
        "Their methods are like ours in that the “concept learning” combines information from several occurrences, but differ in that they rely on a detailed existing ontology into which to fit the new relationships between concepts.",
        "Our initial experiment was to construct a hyponymy extraction system based on the six lexicosyntactic patterns identified in (Hearst, 1998), which are listed in Table 1.",
        "We first used a chunker to mark noun groups, and then recognized and extracted noun groups occurring as part of one of the extraction patterns.3 We applied these extraction patterns to an approximately 430,000-word extract from the beginning of the",
        "Hearst (1998), which we used in the work described in this paper.",
        "Each of these patterns is taken to indicate the hyponymy relation(s) yz C x. British National Corpus (BNC).",
        "The patterns extracted 513 relations.",

        "Extracted hypernym and hyponym exactly correct as extracted.",
        "3.",

        "correct, e.g. a correct noun without a necessary prepositional phrase, a correct noun with a superfluous prepositional phrase, or a noun + prepositional phrase where the object of the preposition is correct but the preposition itself and the noun to which it attaches are superfluous.",
        "Thus these hyponymy relations are potentially correct but will require potentially difficult processing to extract an exactly correct relation.",
        "Some of the errors which would need to be corrected were in preprocessing (e.g. on the part of the noun-group chunker) and others were errors caused by our hyponymy extractor (e.g. tacking on too many or too few prepositional phrases).",
        "1.",
        "The relation extracted is correct in some sense, but is too general or too context specific to be useful.",
        "This category includes relations that could be made useful by anaphora resolution (e.g. replacing “this” with its referent).",
        "0.",
        "The relation extracted is incorrect.",
        "This results when the constructions we recognize are used for a purpose other than indicating the hyponymy relation.",
        "The results of each of the authors’ evaluations of the 100-relation random sample are show in Table 2.4 For",
        "relations (of 513 extracted) to which each of the authors assigned the five available scores.",
        "purposes of calculating precision, we consider those relations with a score of 4 or 3 to be correct and those with a lower score to be incorrect.",
        "After discussion between the authors on disputed annotations to create “gold standard” annotations, we found that 40 of the 100 relations in our random sample were correct according to this criterion.",
        "In other words, 40% of the relations extracted were exactly correct or would be correct with the use of minor post-processing consisting of lemmatization and removal of common types of qualifying words.",
        "(We describe our application of such post-processing in Section 6.)",
        "Thus our initial implementation of Hearst-style hyponymy extraction achieved 40% precision.",
        "This is less than the 52% precision reported in (Hearst, 1998).",
        "We believe this discrepancy to be mainly due to the difference between working with the BNC and Grolier’s encyclopedia – as noted by Hearst, the encyclopedia is designed to be especially rich in conceptual relationships presented in an accessible format.",
        "Various problems with the pattern-based extraction method explain the 60% of extracted relations that were incorrect and/or useless.",
        "One problem is that the constructions that we assume to indicate hyponymy are often used for other purposes.",
        "For instance, the pattern x including y1, y2, ..., and y,,, which indicates hyponymy in sentences such as Illnesses, including chronic muscle debility, herpes, tremors and eye infections, have come and gone.",
        "(BNC) and is a quite productive source of hyponymy relations, can be used instead to indicate group membership: agreement regarding the assignment of scores of 4, 3, and 2 is quite high.",
        "Indeed, considering the rougher distinction we use for reporting precision, in which scores of 4 and 3 are deemed correct and scores of 2, 1, and 0 are deemed incorrect, we found that inter-annotator agreement across all relations annotated (including those from this random sample and those from the sample described in Section 3) was 86%.",
        "We discussed each of the relations in the 14% of cases where we disagreed until we reached agreement; this produced the “gold standard” annotations to which we refer.",
        "Often entire families including young children need practical home care ... (BNC) While all children are members of families, the hyponymy relationship child C family does not hold, since it is not true that all children are families.",
        "Another source of errors in lexicosyntactic hyponymy extraction is illustrated by the sentence A kit such as Edme Best Bitter, Tom Caxton Best Bitter, or John Bull Best Bitter will be a good starting kit.",
        "(BNC) which indicates the (potentially useful) relations Edme Best Bitter C beer-brewing kit, Tom Caxton Best Bitter C beer-brewing kit, and John Bull Best Bitter C beer-brewing kit, but only when we use the context to infer that the type of “kit” referred to is a beer-brewing kit, a process that is difficult by automatic means.",
        "Without this inference, the extracted relations Edme Best Bitter C kit, etc., while correct in a certain sense, are not helpful.",

        "Solving all of the problems with pattern-based hyponymy extraction that we describe above would require near-human-level language understanding, but we have applied a far simpler technique for filtering out many of the incorrect and spurious extracted relations with good results, using a variant of latent semantic analysis (LSA) (Deerwester et al., 1990; Baeza-Yates and Ribiero-Neto, 1999, p. 44).",
        "LSA is a method for representing words as points in a vector space, whereby words which are related in meaning should be represented by points which are near to one another.",

        "Effectively, we could use LSA to measure the extent to which two words x and y usually occur in similar contexts.",
        "This LSA similarity score will be called sim(x, y).",
        "Since we expect a hyponym and its hypernym to be semantically similar, we can use the LSA similarity between two terms as a test of the plausibility of a putative hyponymy relation between those terms.",
        "If their similarity is low, it is likely that they do not have a true and useful hyponymy relationship; the relation was probably extracted erroneously for one or more of the reasons listed above.",

        "We then manually evaluated the accuracy of the top 100 extracted relations according to this ranking using the 5-point scale described in Section 2.",

        "One of the main challenges facing hyponymy extraction is that comparatively few of the correct relations that might be found in text are expressed overtly by the simple lexicosyntactic patterns used in Section 2, as was apparent in the results presented in that section.",
        "This problem has been addressed by Caraballo (1999), who describes a system that first builds an unlabelled hierarchy of noun clusters using agglomerative bottom-up clustering of vectors of noun coordination information.",
        "The leaves of this hierarchy (corresponding to nouns) are assigned hypernyms using Hearst-style lexicosyntactic patterns.",
        "Internal nodes in the hierarchy are then labelled with hypernyms of the leaves they subsume according to a vote of these subsumed leaves.",
        "We proceed along similar lines, using noun coordination information and an alternative graph-based clustering method.",
        "We do not build a complete hierarchy, but our method nonetheless obtains additional hypernym-hyponym pairs not extracted by lexicosyntactic patterns.",
        "Our method is based on the following sort of inference.",
        "Consider the sentence This is not the case with sugar, honey, grape must, cloves and other spices which increase its merit.",
        "(BNC) which provides evidence that clove is a kind of spice.",
        "Given this, the sentence Ships laden with nutmeg or cinnamon, cloves or coriander once battled the Seven Seas to bring home their precious cargo.",
        "(BNC) might suggest that nutmeg, cinnamon, and coriander are also spices, because they appear to be similar to cloves.",
        "Thus we can learn the hyponymy relations nutmeg C spice, cinnamon C spice, and coriander C spice that are not directly attested by lexicosyntactic patterns in our training corpus.",
        "This kind of information from coordination patterns has been used for work in automatic lexical acquisition (Riloff and Shepherd, 1997; Roark and Charniak, 1998; Widdows and Dorow, 2002).",
        "The basic rationale behind these methods is that words that occur together in lists are usually semantically similar in some way: for example, the phrase y1, y2, and y3 suggests that there is some link between y1 and y2, etc.",
        "Performing this analysis on a whole corpus results in a data structure which holds a collection of nouns and observed noun-noun relationships.",
        "If we think of the nouns as nodes and the noun-noun relationships as edges, this data structure is a graph (Bollob´as, 1998), and combinatoric methods can be used to analyze its structure.",
        "Work using such techniques for lexical acquisition has proceeded by building classes of related words from a single “seed-word” with some desired property (such as being a representative of a paticular semantic class).",
        "For example, in order to extract a class of words referring to kinds of disease from a corpus, you start with a single seed-word such as typhoid, and then find other nouns that occur in lists with typhoid.",
        "Using the graph model described above, Widdows and Dorow (2002) developed a combinatoric algorithm for growing clusters from a single seed-word, and used these methods to find correct new members for chosen categories with an accuracy of over 80%.",
        "The idea that certain patterns can be identified using finite-state techniques and used as evidence for semantic relationships is the same as Hearst’s (1992), but appears to be more effective for finding just similar words rather than hypernyms because there are many more instances of simple coordination patterns than of hyper-nymy patterns – in the lists we used to extract these relationships, we see much more cooccurence of words on the same ontological level than between words from different ontological levels.",
        "For example, in the BNC there are 211 instances of the phrase “fruit and vegetables” and 9 instances of “carrots and potatoes”, but no instances of “fruit and potatoes”, only 1 instance of “apples and vegetables”, and so on.",
        "This sort of approach should be ideal for improving the recall of automatic hyponymy extraction, by using the hyponym from each of the correct hypernym/hyponym pairs as a seed-word for the category represented by the hypernym – for example, from the relationship clove C spice, the word clove could be taken as a seed-word, with the assumption that words which frequently occur in coordination with clove are also names of spices.",
        "We used the algorithm of (Widdows and Dorow, 2002) on the British National Corpus to see if many more hyponymy relations would be extracted in this way.",
        "For each correct pair y C x where y was a single-word hyponym of x discovered by the lexicosyntactic patterns of Section 2, we collected the 10 words most similar to y according to this algorithm and tested to see if these neighbors were also hyponyms of x.",
        "Of the 176 extracted hyponyms that we evaluated by hand in the overlapping test sets described in Section 2 and Section 3, 95 were rated 4 or 3 on our 5-point scoring system (Section 2) by at least one of the authors.",
        "Considering these correct or nearly-correct relations in their hand-corrected form, we found that 45 of these 95 relations involved single-word hyponyms.",
        "(We restricted our attention to these 45 relations because the graph model was built using only single words as nodes in the graph.)",
        "This set of 45 correct hypernym “seed-pairs” was extended by another potential 459 pairs (slightly more than 10 for each seed-pair because if there was a tie for 10th place both neighbors were used).",
        "Of these, 211 (46%) were judged to be correct hypernym pairs and 248 (54%) were not.7 This accuracy compares favorably with the accuracy of 40% obtained for the raw hyponymy extraction experiments in Section 2, suggesting that inferring new relations by using corpus-based similarities to previously known relations is more reliable than trying to learn completely new relations even if they are directly attested in the corpus.",
        "However, our accuracy falls way short of the figure of 82% reported by Widdows and Dorow (2002).",
        "We believe this is because the classes in (Widdows and Dorow, 2002) are built from carefully selected seed-examples: ours are built from an uncontrolled sample of seed-examples extracted automatically from a corpus.",

        "The LSA similarity between the original (correct) hyponym and each word in the hypernym is computed.",
        "The words of the hypernym are ranked according to these similarities.",
        "2.",
        "The word in the hypernym that has the highest LSA similarity to the original (correct) hyponym is used instead of the entire hypernym for phase-I-style filtering.",
        "This filtering technique, with an LSA-similarity threshhold of 0.15, resulted in the extraction of 35 correct and 25 incorrect relationships.",
        "In contrast, using LSA similarity with the whole expression rather than the most important word resulted in the extraction of 32 correct and 30 incorrect relationships for those hypernyms with multiple words.",
        "On the face of it, selecting only the most important part of the hypernym for comparison enabled us to obtain more correct and fewer incorrect relations, but it is also clear that by this stage in our experiments our sample of seed-relationships had become too small for these results to be statistically significant.",
        "However, the examples we considered did demonstrate another point – that LSA could help to determine which parts of a multiword expression were semantically relevant.",
        "For example, one of the seed-relationships was France C European Community member.",
        "Finding that sim(france, european) > sim(france, community), we could infer that the adjective European was central to the meaning of the hyponym, whereas for the example wallflowers C hardy biennials the opposite conclusion, that hardy is an adjectival modifier which isn’t central to the relationship, could be drawn.",
        "However, these conclusions could also be drawn by using established collocation extraction techniques (Manning and Sch¨utze, 1999, Ch.",
        "5) to find semantically significant multiword expressions."

        "By removing leading adjectives we make potential hypernyms more general, and thus more likely to be a superset of their potential hyponym.",
        "While this removal sometimes makes the learned relationship less useful, it seldom makes it incorrect.",
        "We leave adjectives on hyponyms to make them more specific, and thus more likely to be a subset of their purported hypernym.",

        "The results presented in this paper demonstrate that the application of linguistic information from automatically-learned mathematical models can significantly enhance both the precision and the recall of pattern-based hyponymy extraction techniques.",
        "Using a graph model of noun similarity we were able to obtain an almost fivefold improvement in recall, though the precision of this technique is clearly affected by the correctness of the “seed-relationships” used.",
        "Using LSA filtering we eliminated spurious relations extracted by the original pattern method, reducing errors by 30%.",
        "Such filtering also eliminated spurious relations learned using the graph model that were the result of lexical ambiguity and of seed hyponymy relations inappropriate for the technique, reducing errors by 33%.",
        "This paper suggests many possibilities for future work.",
        "First of all, it would be interesting to apply LSA to a system for building an entire hypernym-labelled ontology in roughly the way described in (Caraballo, 1999), perhaps by using an LSA-weighted voting method to determine which hypernym would be used to label each node.",
        "We are considering how to extend our techniques to such a task.",
        "Also, systematic comparison of the lexicosyntactic patterns used for extraction to determine the relative productiveness and accuracy of each pattern might prove illuminating, as would comparison across different corpora to determine the impact of the topic area and medium/format of documents on the effectiveness of hyponymy extraction.",
        "Ultimately, the ability to predict a priori how well a knowledge-extraction system will work on a previously unseen corpus will be crucial to its usefulness.",
        "Applying the techniques of this paper to a system that used mutual bootstrapping (Riloff and Jones, 1999) to find additional extraction patterns would also be interesting (such an approach is suggested in (Hearst, 1998)).",
        "And of course, further refinement of the mathematical models we use and our methods of learning them, including more sophisticated use of available tools for linguistic pre-processing, such as the identification and indexing of multiword expressions, could further improve the precision and recall of hyponymy extraction techniques."
