        "Early work in natural language processing included ambitious research on the representation and use of information about commonly experienced situations (Schank and Riesbeck, 1981).",
        "The concept of a script was introduced in this research, to explain how people understand these situations and make inferences about them.",
        "A script is a stereotypical sequence of events that occur as part of a larger situation and can be used to infer missing details from a partial description of the larger occurrence, in essence providing a means for extracting information that is not actually present in a text.",
        "Research on scripts includes demonstrations of hand built scripts (Cullingford, 1978) and sketchy scripts (De-Jong,1982) and the adjustment ofhand-built scripts using a genetic algorithm (Mauldin, 1989).",
        "Work on learning schemata under constrained circumstances (Mooney and DeJong, 1985) pursues similar goals.",
        "Our research has indicated that scripts may not explicitly occur in common types of text, such as newspaper stories or incident reports.",
        "Other research also appears to support this conclusion (Clark and Porter, 1995).",
        "Therefore, we are investigating event correlations as a more appropriate and extractable knowledge structure.",
        "In general, it appears that long event sequences do not reliably recur in our data.",
        "We instead look for reliable correlations between a small number of events.",
        "Our goal is to automatically extract correlated events from text, using only a partial parser as outside information.",
        "To support this goal, we need to group clauses from distinct texts into coherent events, handling several sources of variety in descriptions of the same type of occurrence.",
        "Synonymy and abbreviations are two common contributors.",
        "A more important phenomenon is the existence of semantic categories keyed to the events themselves.",
        "A number of different objects may participate in an event, and yet have dissimilarities that place them in different conventional semantic categories.",
        "For example, a tree and a parked vehicle may both be collided with in different aircraft crashes, yet it is difficult to conceive of a reasonably specific semantic category that contains both.",
        "Each is a physical object, yet there are a large number of other physical objects that would not reasonably participate in a crash in the same way (books, hamburgers, and moons are a few examples).",
        "As a result of these phenomena, conventional semantic lexicons, whether hand built or automatically generated, differ from our work in two regards.",
        "First, they group words, not clauses.",
        "Second, they use predefined semantic categories instead of contextual relevance.",
        "Our answer to this problem is a technique that uses textual similarity and context from neighboring events to decide when to group clauses.",
        "The only outside resource we use is a partial parser.",
        "Our technique takes parsed text and partially built event sequences and uses them to group clauses that represent the same event.",
        "In the remainder of this paper, we present a brief overview of the sequence learning system before describing how we create events.",
        "We also evaluate our event formation technique using human judges’ ratings of the cohesiveness of the resulting events.",
        "Finally, we discuss areas of related work before concluding the paper."

        "To understand the event formation process, some background on our larger system is useful.",
        "That system, SPANIEL (Sequence Processing and ANalysis for Inference Enhancement and Learning), attempts to learn ordered correlations between events from a corpus of parsed narratives.1 We assume that the narratives all describe related, but not necessarily identical, situations.",
        "An event is a particular atomic occurrence described by a single clause.",
        "SPANIEL uses a statistical model to identify correlations.",
        "Our overall goal is to capture significant correlations between events.",
        "We provide an overview here, and will discuss the details in a future paper.",
        "Briefly, SPANIEL uses a modified Markov model to capture correlations.",
        "The model attempts to capture a sequence identifying the significant events in a text.",
        "Our modification to Markov chaining captures the fact that events can be conditioned on a prior event that occurs several clauses distant, instead of on direct sequential dependence between events.",
        "After the training data is parsed, SPANIEL creates a graph from individual clauses.",
        "This graph is meant to capture the semantically important information from each clause in the training texts.",
        "The nodes in the graph are created from the actual clauses, with the arcs in the graph indicating which clauses occur together in a text, and in what order.",
        "Events are built from the nodes in the graph, with the arcs providing the starting point for correlations between events.",
        "We convert the parsed text to graph nodes using a frame representation.",
        "Each frame contains four slots.",
        "Three primary slots represent the agent, the action, and the theme of the clause.",
        "The agent and action slot fillers are straightforward: the agent slot takes a noun phrase that was tagged as the clause’s subject by the parser, and the action slot takes the clause’s verb phrase.",
        "The theme slot is more flexible, and can be filled by a noun phrase, prepositional phrase, or adjective phrase that follows the verb.",
        "Noun phrases tagged as the direct object have priority, but the first prepositional or adjective phrase can serve as the filler in the absence of a direct object.2 A fourth slot is only filled if the system identifies a dependent clause through the presence of a clause marker or the absence of a theme (e.g. “She reported she was having control problems.”).",
        "Words are not stemmed, except",
        "in two special cases described later.",
        "The three primary slots are filled by a head and a modifier.",
        "The head is the head word of the appropriate phrase.",
        "Prepositional phrases also concatenate the preposition to the head.",
        "Verb phrases include all verbs from the phrase, along with particles.",
        "The modifier is a concatenation of all adjectives, adverbs, and other nouns.",
        "Two examples of sentences and the resulting frames are given in Figure 1.",
        "We define three functions over the graph.",
        "These functions allow us to both detect correlations between events, and identify when nodes might represent the same event.",
        "First, the cooccurrence of two nodes, C(Ni, Nj ), is the number of narratives in which Ni occurs before Nj, and thus quantifies each arc.",
        "Ni and Nj do not have to be neighbors: any number of other clauses could have separated them.",
        "Cooccurrence is directional: C(Ni, Nj) is not the same as C(Nj, Ni).",
        "Next, two nodes Ni and Nj match, denoted M(Ni, Nj), if their frames are identical.3 Finally, two nodes Ni and Nj are similar, denoted S(Ni, Nj ), if they demonstrate a certain degree of textual similarity.",
        "This function plays an important role in event creation, and we define it in detail in the next section.",
        "Given this graph, SPANIEL uses a beam search to detect correlations of multiple events by incrementally expanding a sequence of events that occur frequently together.",
        "As of this writing, most resulting correlations include only a pair of events, with rare sequences of three events.",
        "Our goal is to find such correlations with minimal domain-specific knowledge.",
        "Thus, SPANIEL must create events from individual nodes as it expands event sequences.",

        "The goal of event formation is to identify nodes that can play the same role within a domain.",

        "This process is unsupervised, so we restrict the search by defining two criteria that nodes must meet to be included in the same event.",
        "First, the Similarity criterion states that each node in an event must be textually similar to at least one other node in the event.",
        "Therefore, a node must be similar to at least one node that is already part of an event in order to be added to the event.",
        "Second, the InSeq criterion states that each node in the event must occur, in the appropriate order, with at least one node in each of the event’s immediate neighbors in the sequence.",
        "Similarity is determined by a function S(Ni, Nj) that indicates whether two nodes share sufficient textual fea",

        "Second, if the stemmed form of a node’s action is “to be”, the action is ignored in determining similarity.",
        "Therefore, the node’s agent and theme must match the other node for the nodes to be similar.",
        "The second criteria for adding nodes to events, InSeq, ensures that all nodes in an event occur in similar contexts.",

        "Neighbors provide contextual information indicating which nodes occur in similar places in narratives.",
        "The InSeq constraint states that for a node to be added to an event, it must cooccur at least once with each of that event’s neighbors in the proper order.",
        "To test for this cooccurrence, we extend the definition of cooccurrence to apply to mixed node and event arguments.",
        "Thus C(N, E) or C(E, N) is the number of times node N cooccurred in the training data with any node from event E. The order in which the arguments are given is the order in which",

        "Both of our criteria play essential roles in the event generation process.",
        "Using similarity alone would combine all clauses that, while similar on the surface, actually are referring to different types of occurrences.",
        "Using context alone would combine all clauses encountered in the same position relative to some other clause.",
        "Either approach allows excessive noise to contaminate the resulting events.",
        "Our event generation technique is an essential part of SPANIEL, our event correlation learning system.",

        "While standardized lexicons have been investigated (Kamprath et al., 1998), their use has not become common.",
        "Therefore, competent event generation is required for success in detecting event correlations.",
        "In addition to their role in event correlations, events could be used as information extraction tools.",
        "Using multiple fillers from different nodes for two primary slots makes the event potentially useful as a pattern for extracting fillers for the third slot from specific documents.",
        "Our results show that this technique for generating events produces encouragingly coherent events and outperforms randomly grouping nodes.",
        "Our technique for exploiting the training texts during event generation is relatively simple.",
        "Possible future work includes testing other algorithms for combining nodes, such as standard clustering techniques.",
        "In summary, we have defined an interesting problem and provided useful insight into its solution, which furthers our research into learning event correlations."
