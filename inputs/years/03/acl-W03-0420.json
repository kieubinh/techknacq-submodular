        "In this paper, we present an approach for extracting the named entities (NE) of natural language inputs which uses the maximum entropy (ME) framework (Berger et al., 1996).",
        "The objective can be described as follows.",
        "Given a natural input sequence we choose the NE tag sequence with the highest probability among all possible tag sequences: system described avoids relying on language-dependent knowledge but instead uses a set of features which are easily obtainable for almost any language.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we outline the ME framework and specify the features that were used for the experiments.",
        "We describe the training and search procedure of our approach.",
        "Section 3 presents experimental details and shows results obtained on the English and German test sets.",
        "Finally, section 4 closes with a summary and an outlook for future work."

        "For our approach, we directly factorize the posterior probability and determine the corresponding NE tag for each word of an input sequence.",
        "We assume that the decisions only depend on a limited window of around the current word and on the two predecessor tags.",
        "Thus, we obtain the following second-order model: The argmax operation denotes the search problem, i.e. the generation of the sequence of named entities.",
        "According to the CoNLL-2003 competition, we concentrate on four types of named entities: persons (PER), locations (LOC), organizations (ORG), and names of miscellaneous entities (MISC) that do not belong to the previous three groups, e.g. [PER Clinton] ’s [ORG Ballybunion] fans invited to [LOC Chicago] .",
        "Additionally, the task requires the processing of two different languages from which only English was specified before the submission deadline.",
        "Therefore, the A well-founded framework for directly modeling the posterior probability is maximum entropy (Berger et al., 1996).",
        "In this framework, we have a set of feature functions .",
        "For each feature function , there exists a model parameter .",
        "The posterior probability can then be modeled as follows: m - Digits and numbers: ASCII digit strings and number expressions activate these features.",
        "- Pre and suffixes: If the prefix (suffix) of equals a given prefix (suffix), these features will fire.",
        "Transition features: Transition features model the dependence on the two predecessor tags:",
        "As for the CoNLL-2003 shared task, the data sets often provide additional information like part-of-speech (POS) tags.",
        "In order to take advantage of these knowledge sources, our system is able to process several input sequences at the same time."
