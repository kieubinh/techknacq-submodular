        "We present a new approach to summary evaluation which combines two novel aspects, namely (a) content comparison between gold standard summary and system summary via factoids, a pseudo-semantic representation based on atomic information units which can be robustly marked in text, and (b) use of a gold standard consensus summary, in our case based on 50 individual summaries of one text.",
        "Even though future work on more than one source text is imperative, our experiments indicate that (1) ranking with regard to a single gold standard summary is insufficient as rankings based on any two randomly chosen summaries are very dissimilar (correlations average p = 0.20), (2) a stable consensus summary can only be expected if a larger number of summaries are collected (in the range of at least 30-40 summaries), and (3) similarity measurement using unigrams shows a similarly low ranking correlation when compared with factoid-based ranking."

        "It is an understatement to say that measuring the quality of summaries is hard.",
        "In fact, there is unanimous consensus in the summarisation community that evaluation of summaries is a monstrously difficult task.",
        "In the past years, there has been quite a lot of summarisation work that has effectively aimed at finding viable evaluation strategies (SpÄarck Jones, 1999; Jing et al., 1998; Donaway et al., 2000).",
        "Large-scale conferences like SUMMAC (Mani et al., 1999) and DUC (2002) have unfortunately shown weak results in that current evaluation measures could not distinguish between automatic summaries – though they are effective enough to distinguish them from human-written summaries.",
        "In principle, the best way to evaluate a summary is to try to perform the task for which the summary was meant in the first place, and measure the quality of the summary on the basis of degree of success in executing the task.",
        "However, such extrinsic evaluations are so time-consuming to set up that they cannot be used for the day-to-day evaluation needed during system development.",
        "So in practice, a method for intrinsic evaluation is needed, where the properties of the summary itself are examined, independent of its application.",
        "We think one of the reasons for the difficulty of an intrinsic evaluation is that summarisation has to call upon at least two hard subtasks: selection of information and production of new text.",
        "Both tasks are known from various NLP fields (e.g. information retrieval and information extraction for selection; generation and machine translation (MT) for production) to be not only hard to execute, but also hard to evaluate.",
        "This is caused for a large part by the fact that in both cases there is no single “best” result, but rather various “good” results.",
        "It is hence no wonder that the evaluation of summarisation, combining these two, is even harder.",
        "The general approach for intrinsic evaluations, then (Mani, 2001), is to separate the evaluation of the form of the text (quality) and its information content (informativeness).",
        "In this paper, we will focus on the latter, the intrinsic evaluation of informativeness, and we will address two aspects: the (in)sufficiency of the single human summary to measure against, and the information unit on which similarity measures are based."

        "In various NLP fields, such as POS tagging, systems are tested by way of comparison against a “gold standard”, a manually produced result which is supposed to be the “correct”, “true” or “best” result.",
        "This presupposes, however, that there is a single “best” result.",
        "In summarisation there appears to be no “one truth”, as is evidenced by a low agreement between humans in producing gold standard summaries by sentence selection (Rath et al., 1961; Jing et al., 1998; Zechner, 1996), and low overlap measures between humans when gold standards summaries are created by reformulation in the summarisers’ own words (e.g. the average overlap for the 542 single document summary pairs in DUC-02 was only about 47%) .",
        "But even though the non-existence of any one gold standard is generally acknowledged in the summarisation community, actual practice nevertheless ignores this.",
        "Comparisons against a single gold standard are widely used, due to the expense of compiling summary gold standards and the lack of composite measures for comparison to more than one gold standard.",
        "In a related field, information retrieval (IR), the problem of subjectivity of relevance judgements is circumvented by extensive sampling: many different queries are collected to level out the difference humans have in suggesting queries and in selecting relevant documents.",
        "While relevance judgements between humans remain different, Voorhees (2000) shows that the relative rankings of systems are nevertheless stable across annotators, which means that meaningful IR measures have been found despite the inherent subjectivity of relevance judgements.",
        "Similarly, in MT, the recent Bleu measure also uses the idea that one gold standard is not enough.",
        "In an experiment, Papineni et al.",
        "(2001) based an evaluation on a collection of four reference translations of 40 general news stories and showed the evaluation to be comparable to human judgement.",
        "Lin and Hovy (2002) examine the use of a multiple gold standard for summarisation evaluation, and conclude “we need more than one model summary although we cannot estimate how many model summaries are required to achieve reliable automated summary evaluation”.",
        "We explore the differences and similarities between various human summaries in order to create a basis for such an estimate, and as a side-effect, also re-examine the degree of difference between the use of a single summary gold standard and the use of a compound gold standard."

      "text": [
        "The second aspect we examine is the similarity measure to be used for gold standard comparison.",
        "In principle, the comparison can be done via co-selection of extracted sentences (Rath et al., 1961; Jing et al., 1998; Zechner, 1996), by string-based surface measures (Lin and Hovy, 2002; Saggion et al., 2002), or by subjective judgements of the amount of information overlap (DUC, 2002).",
        "The rationale for using information overlap judgement as the main evaluation metric for DUC is the wish to measure the meaning of sentences rather than use surface-based similarity such as co-selection (which does not even take identical information expressed in different sentences into account) and string-based measures.",
        "In the DUC competitions, assessors judge the informational overlap between “model units” ( elementary discourse units (EDUs), i.e. clause-like units, taken from the gold standard summary) and “peer units” (sentences taken from the participating summaries) on the basis of the question: “How much of the information in a model unit is contained in a peer unit: all of it, most, some, any, or none.” This overlap judgement is done for each system-produced summary, and weighted recall measures report how much gold standard information is present in the summaries.",
        "However, Lin and Hovy (2002) report low agreement for two tasks: producing the human summaries (around 40%), and assigning information overlap between them.",
        "In those cases where annotators had to judge a pair consisting of a gold standard sentence and a system sentence more than once (because different systems returned the same sentence), they agreed with their own prior judgement in only 82% of the cases.",
        "This relatively low intra-annotator agreement points to the fact that the overlap judgement remains a subjective task where judges will disagree.",
        "Lin and Hovy show the instability of the evaluation, expressed in system rankings.",
        "We propose a gold standard comparison based on factoids, a pseudo-semantic representation of the text, which measures information rather than string similarity, like DUC, but which is more objective than DUC-style information overlap judgement."

        "If we had found, e.g., that there is no summary that mentions only one of FP25 and FP26, those factoids would be combined into one new factoid “FP27 The suspect is a Dutch man”.",

        "For instance, in the case of “FA21 Multiple shots were fired” and “FA22 Six shots were fired”, FA22 implies FA21; any attempt to express the relationship between the factoids in a compositional way would result in awkward factoids.",

        "In the summaries, our subjects often generalised these reactions and produced statements such as Dutch as well as international politicians have expressed their grief and disbelief.",
        "As more than one entity can be reported as saying the same thing, straightforward factoid union is not powerful enough to accurately represent the attribution of opinions, as our notation does not contain variables for discourse referents and quoted statements.",

        "For now, we have taken the pragmatic approach that the classification of factoids into factual and opinion factoids is determined by the actual representation of the information in the summaries (cf. FL51 above, where the first letter “F” stands for factual, the first letter “O” for opinion).",
        "The factoid approach can capture much finer shades of meaning differentiations than DUC-style information overlap does – in an example from Lin and Hovy (2002), an assessor judged some content overlap between “Thousands of people are feared dead” and “3,000 and perhaps ... 5,000 people have been killed.” In our factoid representation, a distinction between “killed” and “feared dead” would be made, and different numbers of people mentioned would have been differentiated."

        "In a similar fashion, we build a consensus unigram list, containing the 103 unigrams that occur in at least 11 summaries, and calculate the F-measure for unigrams.",
        "The two measures are plotted against each other in Figure 4.",
        "Some correlation is present (r = 0.48 and Spear-man’s ranking correlation p = 0.45), but there are clearly profound differences.",
        "If we look at the rankings produced from these two F-measures, 5054, on position 16 on the basis of factoids, drops to position 37 on the basis of unigrams.",
        "S046, on the other hand, climbs from 42nd to 4th place when considered by unigrams instead of factoids.",
        "Apart from these extreme cases, these are also clear differences in the top-5 for the two measurements: 5030, 5028, R001, 5003 and 5023 are the top-5 when measuring with factoids, whereas 5032, R002, 5030, S046 and 5028 are the top-5 when measuring with unigrams.",
        "It would seem that unigrams, though they are much cheaper, are not a viable substitute for factoids."

        "From our experiences so far, it seems that both our innovations, viz. using multiple summaries and measuring with factoids, appear to be worth pursuing further.",
        "We summarise the results for our test text in the following:",
        "• We observe a very wide selection of factoids in the summaries, only few of which are included by all summarisers.",
        "• The number of factoids found if new summaries are considered does not tail off.",
        "• There is a clear importance hierarchy of factoids which allows us to compile a consensus summary.",
        "• If single summaries are used as gold standard, the correlation between rankings based on two such gold standard summaries is low.",
        "• We could not find any large clusters of highly correlated summarisers in our data.",
        "• Stability with respect to the consensus summary can only be expected if a larger number of summaries are collected (in the range of at least 30-40 summaries).",
        "• A unigram-based measurement shows only low",
        "correlation with the factoid-based measurement.",
        "The information that is gained through multiple summaries with factoid-similarity is insufficiently approximated with the currently used substitutes, as the observations above show.",
        "However, what we have described here must clearly be seen as an initial experiment, and there is yet much to be done.",
        "First of all, the notation of the factoid (currently flat atoms) needs to be made more expressive, e.g. by the addition of variables for discourse referents and events, which will make factoids more similar to FOPL expressions, and/or by the use of a typing mechanism to indicate the various forms of inference/implication.",
        "We also need to identify a good weighting scheme to be used in measuring similarity of factoid vectors.",
        "The weighting should correct for the variation between factoids in information content, for their different position along an inference chain, and possibly for their position in the summary.",
        "It should also be able to express some notion of importance of the factoids, e.g. as measured by the number of summaries containing the factoid.",
        "Something else to investigate is the presence and distribution of factoids, types of factoids and relations between factoids in summaries and summary collections.",
        "We have the strong feeling that some of our observations were tightly linked to the type of text we used.",
        "We would like to build a balanced corpus of texts, of various subject areas and lengths, and their summaries, at several different lengths and possibly even multi-document, so that we can study this factor.",
        "An open question is how many summaries we should try to get for each of the texts in the corpus.",
        "It is unlikely we will be able to collect 50 summaries for each new text.",
        "Furthermore, the texts of the corpus should also be summarised by as many machine summarisers as possible, so that we can test ranking these on the basis of factoids, in a realistic framework.",
        "A final line of investigation is searching for ways to reduce the cost of factoid analysis.",
        "The first reason why this analysis is currently expensive is the need for large summary bases for consensus summaries.",
        "There is yet hope that this can be circumvented by using larger numbers of texts, as is the case in IR and in MT, where discrepancies prove to average out when large enough datasets are used.",
        "Papineni et al., e.g., were able to show that the ranking with their Bleu measure of the five evaluated translators (two human and three machine) remained stable if only a single reference translation was used, suggesting that “we may use a big corpus with a single reference translation, provided that the translations are not all from the same translator”.",
        "Possibly a similar averaging effect will occur in the evaluation of summarisation so that smaller summary bases can be used.",
        "The second reason is the need for human annotation of factoids.",
        "Although simple unigram-based methods prove insufficient, we will hopefully be able to come a long way in automating factoid identification on the basis of existing NLP techniques, combined with information gained about factoids in research as described in the previous paragraph.",
        "All in all, the use of consensus summaries and factoid analysis, even though expensive to set up for the moment, provides a promising alternative which could well bring us closer to a solution to several problems in summarisation evaluation."
