        "Our analysis of image captions has revealed various journalistic conventions that we believe make this dataset particularly appealing for a number of applications.",
        "Captions act as concise summaries of events, and we believe we can use them to isolate the most pertinent words for different topics.",
        "We have implemented various clustering methods to explore this idea.",
        "Captions are also tightly tied to the actual content of the image.",
        "The difficulty here on the text side, is in identifying those portions of a caption that refer to tangible objects, physically present in the image.",
        "On the image side, we need to isolate objects of interest and solve the correspondence problem between caption extracts and image regions.",

        "These photographs come from Reuters and the AP, and we collect between 800 and 1500 per day.",
        "To date, we have collected more than 410,000 unique images.",
        "The vast majority of these photos are of people, and the majority of that subset focus on one or two individuals.",
        "Since November, we have also collected more than 75,000 illustrated news articles from the BBC and CNN.",
        "Both CNN and the BBC, along with the majority of all news outlets, make heavy use of news photographs from the AP and Reuters.",
        "In fact, the field is dominated by just three agencies, Reuters, the Associated Press and AFP.",
        "Journalistic writing guidelines emphasize clarity.",
        "This is certainly necessary in caption writing, where an author has an average of 55 words to convey all salient details about an image.",
        "A caption writer’s first responsibility is to identify those portrayed.",
        "A caption will contain the full names of those represented if they are known.",
        "Second, the writer must describe the activity portrayed in the photo.",
        "Finally, with whatever space is left, the author may provide some broader context.",
        "Our collection’s vocabulary reflects this ordering of priorities.",
        "First, there is a heavy bias towards proper names, and thus the number of unique terms in this set is very large (See figure 1).",
        "The vocabulary of other word classes, however, reflect the journalistic emphasis on simplicity.",
        "People hug rather than embrace, talk rather than converse.",
        "Captions are also easy for humans to parse because writers make use of stylized sentence structures.",
        "Just",
        "preponderance ofproper names creates a very large vocabulary of capitalized words whose frequency distribution has heavy tails.",
        "On the other hand, other word classes are somewhat restricted.",
        "In a six month period from July to December, 2002, the corpus had 93,457 distinct terms.",
        "Of these, 60,182 were capitalized and 32,059 uncapitalized (with 1216 numerical entries).",
        "About 1000 terms occur in both forms.",
        "Almost a third of all vocabulary terms occur only once.",
        "On the left we plot term occurrence ordered by frequency for the 1000 most frequent capitalized (solid) and uncapitalized (dotted) terms.",
        "On the right we analyze the heavy tail, flipping the axes to show the number of words that occur between one and twenty times.",
        "Here, capitalized (solid line) words outnumber uncapitalized (dotted line) ones 2-1.",
        "We have used capitalization as a proxy for proper names.",
        "This obviously misrepresents initial words of sentences, but these only represent on average 2 words out of every 50-60 word caption.",
        "The richness of our vocabulary is thus largely due to proper names.",
        "over 50% of the captions in our collection, for instance, begin with a starting noun phrase that describes the central figure of the photograph followed by a present tense verb that describes the action they are performing (or if in the passive voice, having performed upon them).",
        "Textual cues such as “left”,“right” or a jersey number help to clarify any potential correspondence problems between multiple names in the caption and people in the image.",
        "The news photos themselves, like their captions, are also quite stylized with respect to choice of subject, placement within the image, and photographic techniques.",
        "A single individual will generally be centered in the photo.",
        "Two people will be equally offset to the left and right of center.",
        "A basketball player will most likely have the ball in his hands.",
        "Each of these photographs will employ a narrow depth of field to blur the background and emphasize their subjects.",
        "Like the caption writer, the photo journalist must convey a great deal of information in a small amount of space.",
        "These conventions amount to a shared language between photographer and reader that places this single image in a far richer context.",
        "We present example captions and their associated images in figure 2.",
        "The textual and photographic conventions we have illustrated are simply trends we have noticed in our dataset, ones that many individual captions and images in our collection break.",
        "One of the benefits of scale, however, is that we can throw away a great deal of data and still have meaningful sets with which to work.",

        "We say a pair of coefficients match if both are within a given threshold of each other.",

        "Unfortunately, the model was still overwhelmed by common words, and the maximum likelihood configuration invariably driven to make every topic equally likely and every topic distribution almost exactly the same.",
        "We therefore were forced to additionally remove very common words, namely the 2000 most frequent words from the web at large.1 This heuristic almost certainly removes some words strongly associated with specific topics (e.g. “ball” with sports).",

        "With aggressive pruning of questionable outputs from the name and face finders, we believe we can generate an effectively supervised dataset of faces for thousands of Figure 6: Not every person named in a caption appears in a picture.",

        "By lookingfor items where the picture has a single, large face detector response – so there is only one face present – and analysis of the caption produces a single name, we produce a directory of news personalities that is quite accurate.",
        "The top row shows some entries from this directory: there are relatively few instances of each face, because our tests are quite restrictive, but the faces corresponding to each name are correct and are seen from a variety of angles, meaning we may be able to build a non parametric face model for some individuals by a completely automatic analysis.",
        "The next three rows show some possible failure modes of our approach: First, our analysis of the caption could yield more than one name.",
        "Second, there may be more than one large face in the image, with only the wrong face producing a face detector response.",
        "Third, the syntax may occasionally follow a syntactic pattern our algorithm does not handle.",
        "We are able to extract proper names from 68,496 of 146,870 captions, with an estimated 85% of these actually naming a person in the image.",
        "Restricting ourselves solely to large face responses, we are able to produce a gazetteer of 452 distinct names (621 images total), containing only 60 incorrectly filed images.",
        "individuals, many of whom will have hundreds or even thousands of distinct face images.",
        "From these we hope to build a non parametric model of faces.",
        "The next interesting task will be to investigate whether we can then return to the textual side, using our face models to learn more about linguistic structures of the captions.",
