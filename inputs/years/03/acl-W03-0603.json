        "We present a study of how people describe objects in visual scenes of the kind shown in Figure 1.",
        "Based on this study, we propose a computational model of visually-grounded language understanding.",
        "A typical referring expression for Figure 1 might be, ”the far back purple cone that’s behind a row of green ones”.",
        "In such tasks, speakers construct expressions to guide listeners’ attention to intended objects.",
        "Such referring expressions succeed in communication because speakers and listeners find similar features of the visual scene to be salient, and share an understanding of how language is grounded in terms of these features.",
        "This work is a step towards our longer term goals to develop a conversational robot (Roy et al., forthcoming 2003) that can fluidly connect language to perception and action.",
        "To study the characteristics of descriptive spatial language, we collected several hundred referring expressions based on scenes similar to Figure 1.",
        "We analysed the descriptions by cataloguing the visual features that they referred to within a scene, and the range of linguistic devices (words or grammatical patterns) that they used to refer to those features.",
        "The combination of a visual feature and corresponding linguistic device is referred to as a descriptive strategy.",
        "referring expressions (if this figure has been reproduced in black and white, the light cones are green in colour, the dark cones are purple) We propose a set of computational mechanisms that correspond to the most commonly used descriptive strategies from our study.",
        "The resulting model has been implemented as a set of visual feature extraction algorithms, a lexicon that is grounded in terms of these visual features, a robust parser to capture the syntax of spoken utterances, and a compositional engine driven by the parser that combines visual groundings of lexical units.",
        "We use the term grounded semantic composition to highlight that both the semantics of individual words and the word composition process itself are visually-grounded.",
        "We propose processes that combine the visual models of words, governed by rules of syntax.",
        "In designing our system, we made several simplifying assumptions.",
        "We assumed that word meanings are independent of the visual scene, and that semantic composition is a purely incremental process.",
        "As we will show, neither of these assumptions holds in all of our data, but our system still understands most utterances correctly.",
        "To evaluate the system, we collected a set of spoken utterances from three speakers.",
        "The model was able to correctly understand the visual referents of 59% of the expressions (chance performance was 1/30Pi0=1 1/i = 13%).",
        "The system was able to resolve a range of linguistic phenomena that made use of relatively complex compositions of spatial semantics.",
        "We provide an analysis of the sources of failure in this evaluation, based on which we propose a number of improvements that are required to achieve human level performance.",

        "The application of the ordering composer is denoted as O.x.min(NP) in the chart, indicating that this is an ordering composer ordering along the x axis and selecting the minimum along this axis.",
        "On combining with “purple one”, the same composer selects all the purple objects on the left (Figure 6, bottom right).",
        "Finally on “the purple one”, it produces the same set of objects as “purple one”, but marks the concept as unambiguously picking out a single object.",
        "Note that the parser attempts to use the second interpretation of“left” (the one containing a spatial composer) but fails because this composer expects two arguments that are not provided by the grammatical structure of the sentence."

      "text": [
        "In Table 1 we present overall accuracy results, indicating for which percentage of different groups of examples our N:left ADJ:left system picked the same referent as the person describing the object.",
        "The first line in the table shows performance relative to the total set of utterances collected.",
        "The second one shows the percentage of utterances our system understood correctly excluding those marked as using a descriptive strategy that was not listed in Section 4, and thus not expected to be understood by Bishop.",
        "The final line in Table 1 shows the percentage of utterances for which our system picked the correct referent relative to the clean development and testing sets.",
        "Although there is obviously room for improvement, these results are significant given that chance performance on this task is only 13.3% and linguistic input was transcripts of unconstrained speech.",
        "Colour Due to the simple nature of colour naming in the Bishop task, the probabilistic composers responsible for selecting objects based on colour made no errors.",
        "Spatial Extrema Our ordering composers correctly identify 100% of the cases in which a participant uses only colour and a single spatial extremum in his or her description.",
        "Participants also favour this descriptive strategy, using it with colour alone in 38% of the clean data.",
        "In the clean training data, Bishop understands 86.8% of all utterances employing spatial extrema.",
        "Participants composed one or more spatial region or extrema references in 30% of the clean data.",
        "Our ordering composers correctly interpret 85% of these cases, for example that in Figure 2 in Section 2.2.2.",
        "The mistakes our composers make are usually due to overcommitment and faulty ordering.",
        "Spatial Regions Description by spatial region occurs alone in only 5% of the clean data, and together with other strategies in 15% of the clean data.",
        "Almost all the examples of this strategy occurring alone use words like “middle” or “centre”.",
        "The top image in Figure 8 exemplifies the use of “middle” that our ordering semantic composer models.",
        "The object referred to is the one closest to the centre of the board.",
        "The bottom image in Figure 8 shows a different interpretation of middle: the object in the middle of a (linguistically not mentioned) group of objects.",
        "Note that within the group there are two candidate centre objects, and that the one in the front is preferred.",
        "There are also further meanings of middle that we expand on in (Gorniak and Roy, 2003).",
        "In summary, we can catalogue a number of different meanings for the word “middle” in our data that are linguistically indistinguishable, but depend on visual and historical context to be correctly understood.",
        "“the green one in the middle”",
        "Grouping Our composers implementing the grouping strategies used by participants are the most simplistic of all composers we implemented, compared to the depth of the actual phenomenon of visual grouping.",
        "As a result, Bishop only understands 29% of utterances that employ grouping in the clean training data.",
        "More sophisticated grouping algorithms have been proposed, such as Shi and Malik’s (2000).",
        "Spatial Relations The AVS measure divided by distance between objects corresponds very well to human spatial relation judgements in this task.",
        "All the errors that occur in utterances that contain spatial relations are due to the possible landmarks or targets not being correctly identified (grouping or region composers might fail to provide the correct referents).",
        "Our spatial relation composer picks the correct referent in all those cases where landmarks and targets are the correct ones.",
        "Bishop understands 64.3% of all utterances that employ spatial relations in the clean training data.",
        "There are types of spatial relations such as relations based purely on distance and combined relations (“to the left and behind”) that we decided not to cover in this implementation, but that occur in the data and should be covered in future efforts.",
        "Anaphora Our solution to the use of anaphora in the Bishop task performs perfectly (100% of utterances employing anaphora) in understanding reference back to a single object in the clean development data.",
        "However, there are more complex variants of anaphora that we do not currently cover, for example reference back to groups of objects."

        "Every one of our semantic composers attempts to solve a separate hard problem, some of which (e.g. grouping and spatial relations) have seen long lines of work dedicated to more sophisticated solutions than ours.",
        "The individual problems were not the emphasis of this paper, and the solutions presented here can be improved.",
        "If a parse does not produce a single referent, backtracking would provide an opportunity to revise the decisions made at various stages of interpretation until a referent is produced.",
        "Yet backtracking only solves problems in which the system knows that it has either failed to obtain a good answer.",
        "We demonstrated cases of selection of word meanings by visual context in our data.",
        "Here, a good candidate solution according to one word meaning may still produce the wrong referent due to a specific visual context.",
        "A future system should take into account local and global visual context during composition to account for these human selection strategies.",
        "By constructing the parse charts we obtain a rich set of partial and full syntactic and semantic fragments offering explanations for parts of the utterance.",
        "In the future, we plan to use this information to engage in clarification dialogue with the human speaker.",
        "Machine learning algorithms may be used to learn many of the parameter settings that were set by hand in this work, including on-line learning to adapt parameters during verbal interaction.",
        "Furthermore, learning new types of composers and appropriate corresponding grammatical constructs poses a difficult challenge for the future."

        "We have presented a model of visually-grounded language understanding.",
        "At the heart of the model is a set of lexical items, each grounded in terms of visual features and grouping properties when applied to objects in a scene.",
        "A robust parsing algorithm finds chunks of syntactically coherent words from an input utterance.",
        "To determine the semantics of phrases, the parser activates semantic composers that combine words to determine their joint reference.",
        "The robust parser is able to process grammatically ill-formed transcripts of natural spoken utterances.",
        "In evaluations, the system selected correct objects in response to utterances for 76.5% of the development set data, and for 58.7% of the test set data.",
        "On clean data sets with various speech and processing errors held out, performance was higher yet.",
        "We suggested several avenues for improving performance of the system including better methods for spatial grouping, semantically guided backtracking during sentence processing, the use of machine learning to replace hand construction of models, and the use of interactive dialogue to resolve ambiguities.",
        "In the near future, we plan to transplant Bishop into an interactive conversational robot (Roy et al., forthcoming 2003), vastly improving the robot’s ability to comprehend spatial language in situated spoken dialogue."
