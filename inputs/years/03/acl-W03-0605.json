        "words and non-linguistic semantic domain fragments.",
        "In particular, we are interested in using the context of the word’s introduction to limit possible interpretations.",
        "Assuming linguistic inputs are syntactic multiword utterances (e.g. phrases and sentences), this context includes the semantic and syntactic relationship of the new word to other words in the linguistic input.",
        "In a multimodal learning environment, the context also includes input observed in the non-linguistic domain.",
        "Our system is designed to coordinate all of these contextual clues in order to restrict the set of possible interpretations of the new word.",

        "The semantic principle of compositionality states that the meaning of any expression (such as a phrase) is a function of the meaning of its sub-expressions, where the particular function is determined by the method of composition.",
        "For example, the expression “The quick fox jumped over the log” can be considered a composition of the sub-expressions “The quick",

        "Intuitively, then, we can approach our bootstrapping problem by structural alignment (Gentner and Markman, 1997).",
        "Structural alignment is a process in which corresponding elements in two structured representations are identified by matching.",

        "Effectively learning the meanings of words from nonlinguistic input requires the development of representations and algorithms to determine correspondences between the linguistic and non-linguistic domains.",
        "Through this research, our contributions to this goal include: • We propose a general architecture, based on structural alignment, for employing linguistic and nonlinguistic context in word learning.",
        "The system bootstraps itself by using acquired words to learn new words.",
        "We define the necessary properties of semantic representations used in such a system.",
        "We also define the modules this system will require.",
        "• We outline a system which implements this architecture for the specific semantic domain of vision.",
        "We identify LCS structures as an appropriate semantic representation, and we demonstrate techniques for extracting LCS from video.",
        "We also show a bidirectional approach to the parsing and alignment problem.",
        "We currently have the components described in our implementation functional in isolation.",
        "The true merit of the system will be determined as we bring together all the pieces; thus our final contribution is the actual implementation of the systems described herein.",
        "It is our hope that our research will act as a springboard for the development of model refinement algorithms which have the advantage of support from semantic alignment systems such as ours."
