      "text": [
        "While traditional, top-down research fields such as natural language processing (NLP), computational linguistics, and speech recognition and synthesis have made great progress in allowing computers to process natural language, they typically do not address perceptual understanding.",
        "In these fields, meaning and context for a given word are based solely on other words and the logical relationships among them.",
        "To make this clearer, consider the following Web-ster’s definition of apple: “The fleshy usually rounded and red or yellow edible pome fruit of a tree of the rose family.” (Webster’s 1989) Using traditional approaches, a computer might be able to determine from such a definition that an apple is “edible,” that it is a “fruit,” and that it is usually “rounded and red or yellow.” But what does is mean to be “rounded and red”?",
        "People understand these words because their conceptual representations are grounded in their perceptual experiences.",
        "As for more abstract words, many have perceptual analogs or can be defined in terms of grounded words.",
        "Although it is unlikely that any two people share identical representations of a given word, there are generally enough similarities for that word to convey meaning.",
        "If computers can be enabled to ground language in perception, ultimately communication between man and machine may be facilitated.",
        "Abstract This paper introduces an open computational framework for visual perception and grounded language acquisition called Experience-Based Language Acquisition (EBLA).",
        "EBLA can “watch” a series of short videos and acquire a simple language of nouns and verbs corresponding to the objects and object-object relations in those videos.",
        "Upon acquiring this protolanguage, EBLA can perform basic scene analysis to generate descriptions of novel videos.",
        "The performance of EBLA has been evaluated based on accuracy and speed of protolanguage acquisition as well as on accuracy of generated scene descriptions.",
        "For a test set of simple animations, EBLA had average acquisition success rates as high as 100% and average description success rates as high as 96.7%.",
        "For a larger set of real videos, EBLA had average acquisition success rates as high as 95.8% and average description success rates as high as 65.3%.",
        "The lower description success rate for the videos is attributed to the wide variance in the appearance of objects across the test set.",
        "While there have been several systems capable of learning object or event labels for videos, EBLA is the first known system to This paper details a new software framework, Experience-Based Language Acquisition (EBLA), that acquires a childlike language known as protolanguage in a bottom-up fashion based on visually perceived experiences.",
        "EBLA uses an integrated computer vision system to watch short videos and to generate internal representations of both the objects and the object-object relations in those videos.",
        "It then performs language acquisition by resolving these internal representations to the individual words in protolanguage descriptions of each video.",
        "Upon acquiring this grounded protolanguage, EBLA can perform basic scene analysis to generate simplistic descriptions of what it “sees.” EBLA operates in three primary stages: vision processing, entity extraction, and lexical resolution.",
        "In the vision processing stage, EBLA is presented with experiences in the form of short videos, each containing a simple event such as a hand picking up a ball.",
        "EBLA processes the individual frames in the videos to identify and store information about significant objects.",
        "In the entity extraction stage, EBLA aggregates the information from the video processing stage into internal representations called entities.",
        "Entities are defined for both the significant objects in each experience and for the relationships among those objects.",
        "Finally, in the lexical acquisition stage, EBLA attempts to acquire language for the entities extracted in the second stage using protolanguage descriptions of each event.",
        "It extracts the individual lexemes (words) from each description and then attempts to generate entity-lexeme mappings using an inference technique called cross-situational learning.",
        "EBLA is not primed with a base lexicon, so it faces the task of bootstrapping its lexicon from scratch.",
        "While, to date, EBLA has only been evaluated using short descriptions comprised of nouns and verbs, one of the primary goals of this research has been to develop an open system that can potentially learn any perceptually grounded lexeme using a unified approach.",
        "The entities recognized EBLA are generic in nature and are comprised of clusters of perceptual attributes linked in a database system.",
        "Although only twelve basic attributes have been programmed into the current system, both the EBLA software and database support the addition of other attributes.",
        "There are even mechanisms in the database to support dynamic loading/unloading of custom attribute calculators."

        "Basically, this means that the system resolves mappings only after being presented with multiple utterance/symbolic concept sets representing multiple situations.",

        "After about seventy-five experiences had been processed, this average dropped to about five experiences, and after about 150 experiences, the average fell below one.",
        "To evaluate the descriptive accuracy of EBLA, 157 of the 167 best videos were randomly processed in acquisition mode and the remaining ten were processed in description mode.",
        "This scenario was run ten times for each of the same nineteen 6min values used to evaluate acquisition success.",
        "The results are shown in table 2.",
        "It is important to note that for a given 6min value, EBLA often returned multiple “matching” lexemes.",
        "When this happened, both the correct and incorrect lexemes were scored pro-rata.",
        "For the lower values of 6min, there were very few incorrect descriptions, but many entities did not map to a known lexeme.",
        "As 6min was increased, the situation reversed with almost every entity mapping to some lexeme, but many to the wrong lexeme.",
        "The most accurate descriptions were produced for a 6min value of 15% where just over 65% of the entities were described correctly.",
        "These are reasonably good results considering the amount that any given entity varied from video to video, especially the object-object relation entities.",
        "For a full discussion of both the animation and video results for EBLA see chapter 6 of Pangburn (2002)."

      "text": [
        "While there have been several systems capable of learning object or event labels for videos, EBLA is the first known system to acquire both nouns and verbs using a grounded computer vision system.",
        "In addition, because EBLA operates in an online fashion, it does not require an explicit training phase.",
        "EBLA performed very well on the entity-lexeme mapping task for both the animations and the videos, achieving success rates as high as 100% and 95.8% respectively.",
        "EBLA was also able to generate descriptions for the animations and videos with average accuracies as high as 96.7% and 65.3%.",
        "The 65.3% is still quite good when compared to the approximately 15% average success rate obtained by generating three word descriptions at random from the pool of nineteen lexemes processed by EBLA.",
        "While the initial results from the EBLA system are encouraging, much development and evaluation remains to be done.",
        "Adding new attribute calculators along with a mechanism for dropping extraneous attributes would likely make EBLA’s entity definitions more robust and facilitate the acquisition of additional nouns and verbs as well as other parts of speech.",
        "Since there is nothing in the design of EBLA that prevents it from processing videos with more than three entities/lexemes, it should be thoroughly tested using more complex experiences and/or descriptions As mentioned in the introduction, one of the primary goals of EBLA has been to develop an open system that would be relatively easy for others to use and extend.",
        "To that end, EBLA was written entirely in Java with a PostgreSQL relational database for storage of all experience parameters, intermediate results, attribute definitions and values, lexemes, entity definitions, and entity-lexeme mappings.",
        "EBLA has been released on SourceForge at http://sourceforge.net/projects/ebla/.",
