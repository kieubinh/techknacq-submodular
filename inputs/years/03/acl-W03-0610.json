        "Language enables people to talk about the world, past, present, and future, real and imagined.",
        "For a robot to do the same, it must ground language in its world as mediated by its perceptual, motor, and cognitive capacities.",
        "Many words that refer to entities in the world can be grounded through sensory-motor associations.",
        "For instance, the meaning of ball includes perceptual associations that encode how balls look and predictive models of how balls behave.",
        "The representation of touch must include procedural associations that encode how to perform the action, and perceptual encodings to recognize the action in others.",
        "In this view, words serve as labels for perceptual or action concepts.",
        "When a word is uttered, the underlying concept is communicated since the speaker and listener maintain similar associations.",
        "This basic approach underlies most work to date in building machines that ground language (Bailey, 1997; Narayanan, 1997; Regier and Carlson, 2001; Roy and Pentland, 2002; Siskind, 2001; Lammens, 1994; Steels, 2001).",
        "Not all words, however, can be grounded in terms of perceptual and procedural representations, even when used in concrete situations.",
        "In fact, in even the simplest conversations about everyday objects, events, and relations, we run into problems.",
        "Consider a person and a robot sitting across a table from each other, engaged in coordinated activity involving manipulation of objects.",
        "After some interaction, the person says to the robot: Touch the heavy blue thing that was on my left.",
        "To understand and act on this command in context, consider the range of knowledge representations that the robot must bind words of this utterance to.",
        "Touch can be grounded in a visually-guided motor program that enables the robot to move towards and touch objects.",
        "This is an example of a procedural association which also critically depends on perception to guide the action.",
        "Heavy specifies a property of objects which involves affordances that intertwine procedural representations with perceptual expectations (Gibson, 1979).",
        "Blue and left specify visual properties.",
        "Thing must be grounded in terms of both perception and affordances (one can see an object, and expect to reach out and touch it).",
        "Was triggers a reference to the past.",
        "My triggers a shift of perspective in space.",
        "We have developed an architecture in which a physical robot is coupled with a physical simulator to provide the basis for grounding each of these classes of lexical semantics1.",

        "Ripley’s visual and proprioceptive systems drive a physical simulator that keeps a constructed version of the world (that includes Ripley’s own physical body) in synchronization with Ripley’s noisy perceptual input.",
        "An object permanence module determines when to instantiate and destroy objects in the model based on perceptual evidence.",
        "Once instantiated, perception can continue to influence the properties of an object in the model, but knowledge of physical world dynamics is built into the simulator and counteracts ’unreasonable’ percepts.",
        "Language is grounded in terms of associations with elements of this perceptually driven world model, as well as direct groundings in terms of sensory and motor representations.",
        "Although the world model directly reflects reality, the state of the model is the result of an interpretation process that compiles perceptual input into a stable registration of the environment.",
        "As opposed to direct perception, the world model affords the ability to assume arbitrary points of view through the use of synthetic vision which operates within the physical model, enabling a limited form of “out of body experience”.",
        "This ability is essential to successfully differentiate the semantics of my left versus your left.",
        "Non-linguistic cues such as the visual location of the communication partners can be integrated with linguistic input to context-appropriate perspective shifts.",
        "Shifts of perspective in time and space may be thought of as semantic modulation functions.",
        "Although the meaning of “left” in one sense remains constant across usages, the words “my” and “your” modulate the meaning by swapping frames of reference.",
        "We suspect that successful use of language requires constant modulations of meanings of this and related kinds.",
        "We describe the robot and simulator, and mechanisms for real-time coupling.",
        "We then discuss mechanisms within this architecture designed for the purposes of grounding the semantics of situated, natural spoken conversation.",

        "The accumulated forces are returned by the function.",
        "This weighing procedure provides the basis for",
        "Similar to GetColorModel(), GetWeight() would first check if the weight of x is already known, and if not, then it would optionally call Weigh() to determine the weight.",
        "To define “the”, “my”, and “was”, it is useful to introduce a data structure that encodes contextual factors that are salient during language use: structure Context { Point-of-view Working memory } The point of view encodes the assumed perspective for interpreting spatial language.",
        "The contents of working memory would include, by default, objects currently in the workspace and thus instantiated in Ripley’s mental model of the workspace.",
        "However, past tense markers such as “was” can serve as triggers for loading salient elements of Ripley’s event-based memory into the working model.",
        "To highlight its effect on the context data structure, Was() is defined as a context-shift function: context-shift Was(context) { Working memory + – Salient events from mental model history } “Was” triggers a request from memory (Section 4.3) for objects which are added to working memory, making them accessible to other processes.",
        "The determiner “the” indicates the selection of a single referent from working memory: determiner The(context) { Select most salient element from working memory } In the example, the semantics of “my” can be grounded in the synthetic visual perspective shift operation described in Section 4.2:",
        "Where GetPointO fView(speaker) obtains the spatial position and orientation of the speaker’s visual input.",
        "“Left” is also grounded in a visual property model which computes a geometric spatial function (Section 3.3) relative to the assumed point of view:",
        "return fleft(trajector, context.point – of – view) } GetPosition(), like GetColorModel () would use the least effortful means for obtaining the position of x.",
        "The function fleft evaluates how well the position of x fits a spatial model relative to the point of view determined from context.",
        "“Thing” can be grounded as:",
        "This grounding makes explicit use of two affordances of a thing, that it be touchable and viewable.",
        "Touchability would be grounded using Touch() and viewability based on whether x has appeared in the mental model (which is constructed based on visual perception).",
        "The final step in interpreting the utterance is to compose the semantics of the individual words in order to derive the semantics of the whole utterance.",
        "We address the problem of grounded semantic composition in detail elsewhere (Gorniak and Roy, protectforthcoming 2003).",
        "For current purposes, we assume that a syntactic parser is able to parse the utterance and translate it into a nested set of function calls:",
        "The innermost argument, context, includes the assumed point of view and contents of working memory.",
        "Each nested function modifies the contents of context by either shifting points of view, loading new contents into working memory, or sorting / highlighting contents of working memory.",
        "The Touch() procedure finally acts on the specified argument.",
        "This concludes our sketch of how we envision the implemented robotic architecture would be used to ground the semantics of the sample sentence.",
        "Clearly many important details have been left out of the discussion.",
        "Our intent here is to convey only an overall gist of how language would be coupled to Ripley.",
        "Our current work is focused on the realization of this approach using spoken language input."
