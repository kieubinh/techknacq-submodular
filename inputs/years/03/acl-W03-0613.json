        "The lexicon-learning aspects in (Duygulu et al., 2002) study a set of fixed words applied to an image database and use a method similar to EM (expectation-maximization) to discover where in the image the terms (nouns) appear.",

        "Regier has studied the visual grounding of spatial terms across languages, finding subtle effects that depend on the relative shape, size, and orientation of objects (Regier, 1996).",

        "We refer to a word as “grounded” if we are able to determine reliable perceptual or procedural associations of the word that agree with normal usage.",
        "However, encoding single terms in isolation is only a first step in sensory-motor grounding.",
        "Lexicographers have traditionally studied lexical semantics in terms of lexical relations such as opposition, hyponymy, and meronymy (Cruse, 1986).",
        "We have made initial investigations into the perceptual grounding of lexical relations.",

        "We would like to propose that the set of responses from each of our new ‘semantic experts’ (weight matrices to determine parameter values) define the most expressive semantic representation possible for music.",
        "By studying the residual variances of Isomap as in Figure 4, we can see that Isomap finds inherent dimensionality for our top grounded parameter spaces.",
        "But for ‘ungrounded’ parameters or non-antonymial spaces, there is less of a clear ‘elbow’ in the variances indicating a natural embedding.",
        "For example, we see from Figure 4 that the “male - female” parameter (which we construe as gender of artist or vocalist) has a lower inherent dimensionality than the more complex “low - high” parameter and is lower yet than the ungroundable (in audio) “alive - dead.” These results allow us to evaluate our parameter discovery system (in which we show that groundable terms have clearer elbows) but also provide an interesting window into the nature of descriptions of perception."

        "We show that we can derive the most semantically significant description spaces automatically, and also form them into a knob for future classification, retrieval and even synthesis.",
        "Our next steps involve user studies of music description, an attempt to discover if the meaning derived by community metadata matches up with individual description, and a way to extract a user model from language to specify results based on prior experience.",
        "We are also currently working on new automatic lexical relation discovery techniques.",
        "For example, from the set of audio observations, we can infer antonymial relations without the use of an expert by finding optimally statistically separable observations.",
        "As well, meronymy, hyponymy and synonymy can be inferred by studying artificial combinations of observation (the mixture of ‘loud’ and ‘peaceful’ might not resolve but the mixture of ‘sexy’ and ‘romantic’ might.)",
        "From the perspective of computational linguistics, we see a rich area of future exploration at the boundary of perceptual computing and lexical semantics.",
        "We have drawn upon WordNet to strengthen our perceptual representations, but we believe the converse is also true.",
        "These experiments are a step towards grounding WordNet in machine perception."
