        "Language resources are bodies of electronic language data used to support research and applications in the area of natural language processing.",
        "Typically, such data are enhanced (annotated) with linguistic information such as morpho-syntactic categories, syntactic or discourse structure, co-reference information, etc.",
        "; or two or more bodies may be aligned for correspondences (e.g., parallel translations, speech signal and transcription).",
        "Over the past 15-20 years, increasingly large bodies of language resources have been created and annotated by the language engineering community.",
        "Certain fundamental representation principles have been widely adopted, such as the use of stand-off annotation, use of XML, etc., and several attempts to provide generalized annotation mechanisms and formats have been developed (e.g., XCES, annotation graphs).",
        "However, it remains the case that annotation formats often vary considerably from resource to resource, often to satisfy constraints imposed by particular processing software.",
        "The language processing community has recognized that commonality and interoperability are increasingly imperative to enable sharing, merging, and comparison of language resources.",
        "To provide an infrastructure and framework for language resource development and use, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has formed a subcommittee (SC4) under Technical Committee 37 (TC37, Terminology and Other Language Resources) devoted to Language Resource Management.",
        "The objective of ISO/TC 37/SC 4 is to prepare international standards and guidelines for effective language resource management in applications in the multilingual information society.",
        "To this end, the committee is developing principles and methods for creating, coding, processing and managing language resources, such as written corpora, lexical corpora, speech corpora, dictionary compiling and classification schemes.",
        "The focus of the work is on data modeling, markup, data exchange and the evaluation of language resources other than terminologies (which have already been treated in ISO/TC 37).",
        "The worldwide use of ISO/TC 37/SC 4 standards should improve information management within industrial, technical and scientific environments, and increase efficiency in computer-supported language communication.",
        "At present, language professionals and standardization experts are not sufficiently aware of the standardization efforts being undertaken by ISO/TC 37/SC 4.",
        "Promoting awareness of future activities and rising problems, therefore, is crucial for the success of the committee, and will be required to ensure widespread adoption of the standards it develops.",
        "An even more critical factor for the success of the committee's work is to involve, from the outset, as many and as broad a range of potential users of the standards as possible.",
        "Within ISO/TC 37/SC 4, a working group (WG1-1) has been established to develop a Linguistic Annotation Framework (LAF) that can serve as a basis for harmonizing existing language resources as well as developing new ones.",
        "In order to ensure that the framework is developed based on the input and consensus of the research community, a group of experts1 was convened on November 21-22, 2002, at Pont-ˆ-Mousson, France, to lay out the overall structure of the framework.",
        ".In this paper, we outline the conclusions from this meeting, and solicit the input of other members of the community to inform its further development."

      "heading": "2 Background and rationale",
      "text": [
        "The standardization of principles and methods for the collection, processing and presentation of language resources requires a distinct type of activity.",
        "Basic standards must be produced with wide-ranging applications in view.",
        "In the area of language resources, these standards should provide various technical committees of ISO, IEC and other standardizing bodies with the groundwork for building more precise standards for language resource management.",
        "The need for harmonization of representation formats for different kinds of linguistic information is critical, as resources and information are more and more frequently merged, compared, or otherwise utilized in common systems.",
        "This is perhaps most obvious for processing multi-modal information, which must support the fusion of multimodal inputs and represent the combined and integrated contributions of different types of input (e.g., a spoken utterance combined with gesture and facial expression), and enable multimodal output (see, for example, Bunt and Romary, 2002).",
        "However, language processing applications of any kind require the integration of varieties of linguistic information, which, in today’s environment, come from potentially diverse sources.",
        "We can therefore expect use and integration of, for example, syntactic, morphological, discourse, etc.",
        "information for multiple languages, as well as information structures like domain models and ontologies.",
        "We are aware that standardization is a difficult business, and that many members of the targeted communities are skeptical about imposing any sort of standards at all.",
        "There are two major arguments against the idea of standardization for language resources.",
        "First, the diversity of theoretical approaches to, in particular, the an",
        "notation of various linguistic phenomena suggests that standardization is at least impractical, if not impossible.",
        "Second, it is feared that vast amounts of existing data and processing software, which may have taken years of effort and considerable funding to develop, will be rendered obsolete by the acceptance of new standards by the community.",
        "Recognizing the validity of both of these concerns, WG1-1 does not seek to establish a single, definitive annotation scheme or format.",
        "Rather, the goal is to provide a framework for linguistic annotation of language resources that can serve as a reference or pivot for different annotation schemes, and which will enable their merging and/or comparison.",
        "To this end, the work of WG1-1 includes the following: o analysis of the full range of annotation types and existing schemes, to identify the fundamental structural principles and content categories; o instantiation of an abstract format capable of capturing the structure and content of linguistic annotations, based on the analysis in (1); o establishment of a mechanism for formal definition of a set of reference content categories which can be used “off the shelf” or serve as a point of departure for precise definition of new or modified categories.",
        "o provision of both a set of guidelines and principles for developing new annotation schemes and concrete mechanisms for their implementation, for those who wish to use them.",
        "By situating all of the standards development squarely in the framework of XML and related standards such as RDF, DAML+OIL, etc., we hope to ensure not only that the standards developed by the committee provide for compatibility with established and widely accepted web-based technologies, but also that transduction from legacy formats into XML formats conformant to the new standards is feasible."

        "The following general requirements for a linguistic annotation framework were identified by the group of experts at Pont-ˆ-Mousson: Expressive adequacy The framework must provide means to represent all varieties of linguistic information (and possibly also other types of information).",
        "This includes representing the full range of information from the very general to information at the finest level of granularity.",
        "Media independence The framework must handle all potential media types, including text, audio, video, image, etc.",
        "and should, in principle, provide common mechanisms for handling all of them.",
        "The framework will rely on existing or developing standards for representing multimedia.",
        "Semantic adequacy",
        "• Representation structures must have a formal semantics, including definitions of logical operations • There must exist a centralized way of sharing descriptors and information categories",
        "• The framework must provide support for various stages of input interpretation and output generation.",
        "• The framework must provide for the representation of partial/under-specified results and ambiguities, alternatives, etc.",
        "and their merging and comparison.",
        "Representations must utilize same “building blocks” and the same methods for combining them.",
        "The framework must not dictate representations dependent on a single linguistic theory.",
        "The framework must provide ways to declare and interchange extensions to the centralized data category registry.",
        "Representations must be human readable, at least for creation and editing.",
        "Information in an annotation scheme must be explicit – that is, the burden of interpretation should not be left to the processing software.",
        "Different mechanisms should not be used to indicate the same type of information.",
        "To fulfill these requirements, it is necessary to identify a consistent underlying data model for data and its annotations.",
        "A data model is a formalized description of the data objects (in terms of composition, attributes, class membership, applicable procedures, etc.)",
        "and relations among them, independent of their instantiation in any particular form.",
        "A data model capable of capturing the structure and relations in diverse types of data and annotations is a prerequisite for developing a common corpus-handling environment: it impacts the design of annotation schema, encoding formats and data architectures, and tool architectures.",
        "As a starting assumption, we can conceive of an annotation as a one or two-way link between an annotation object and a point (or a list/set of points) or span (or a list/set of spans) within a base data set.",
        "Links may or may not have a semantics--i.e., a type--associated with them.",
        "Points and spans in the base data may themselves be objects, or sets or lists of objects.",
        "We make several observations concerning this assumption:",
        "• the model assumes a fundamental linearity of objects in the base,2 e.g., as a time line (speech); a s e-quence of characters, words, sentences, etc.",
        "; or pixel data representing images; • the granularity of the data representation and encoding is critical: it must be possible to uniquely point to the smallest possible component (e.g., character, phonetic component, pitch signal, morpheme, word, etc.",
        "); • an annotation scheme must be mappable to the structures defined for annotation objects in the model; • an encoding scheme must be able to capture the object structure and relations expressed in the model, including class membership and inheritance, therefore requiring a sophisticated means to specify linkage within and between documents; • it is necessary to consider the logistics of identifying spans by enclosing them in start and end tags (thus enabling hierarchical grouping of objects in the data itself), vs. explicit addressing of start and end points, which is required for read-only data; • it must be possible to represent objects and relations in some (fairly straightforward) form that prevents information loss; • ideally, it should be possible to represent the objects and relations in a variety of formats suitable to different tools and applications.",
        "ISO TC37/SC 4’s goal is to develop a framework for the design and implementation of linguistic resource formats and processes in order to facilitate the exchange of information between language processing modules.",
        "A well-defined representational framework for linguistic information will also provide for the specification and comparison of existing application-specific representations and the definition of new ones, while ensuring a level of interoperability between them.",
        "The framework should allow for variation in annotation schemes while 2 Note that this observation applies to the fundamental structure of stored data.",
        "Because the targets of a relation may be either individual objects, or sets or lists of objects, information with more than one dimension is accommodated.",
        "at the same time enabling comparison and evaluation, merging of different annotations, and development of common tools for creating and using annotated data.",
        "For this purpose we envisage a common “pivot” format based on a data model capable of capturing all types of information in linguistic annotations, into and out of which site-specific representation formats can be trans-duced.",
        "This strategy is similar to that adopted in the design of languages intended to be reusable across platforms, such as Java.",
        "The pivot format must support the communication among all modules in the system, and be adequate for representing not only the end result of interpretation, but also intermediate results."

        "Including • continuous segments (appear contiguously in the primary data) • super and sub-segments, where groups of segments will comprise the parts of a larger segment (e.g., a contiguous word segments typically comprise a sentence segment) • discontinuous segments (linking continuous segments) • landmarks (e.g time stamps) that note a point in the primary data",

        "Note that the identification of a segment as a word, sentence, noun phrase, etc.",
        "also constitutes linguistic annotation.",
        "In current practice, when it is possible to do so, segmentation and identification of the linguistic role or properties of that segment are often combined (e.g., syntactic bracketing, or delimiting each word in the document with an XML tag that identifies the segment as a word, sentence, etc.).",

        "The following set of practices will guide the implementation of the LAF:",
        "• The data model is essentially a feature structure graph with a moderate admixture of algebra (e.g. disjunction, sets), grounded in n-dimensional regions of primary data and literals.",
        "• The dump format is isomorphic to the data model.",
        "• Semantic coherence is provided by a registry of features in an XML-compatible format (e.g., RDF), which can be used directly in the user-defined formats and is always used with the dump format.",
        "• Resources will be available to support the design and specification of document forms, for example: - XML Schemas in several normal forms based on type definitions and abstract elements that can be exploited via type derivation and/or substitution group; - XPointer design-patterns with standoff semantics; - Schema annotations specifying mapping between document form and data model; - Meta-stylesheet for mapping from annotated XML Schema to mapping stylesheets; - Data-binding stylesheets with language-specific bindings (e.g. Java).",

        "• The producer is responsible for documenting the mapping from the user format to the data model.",

        "The framework outlined in the previous section provides for the use of any annotation format consistent with the feature structure-based data model that will be used to define the pivot format.",
        "This suggests a future scenario in which annotators may create and edit annotations in a proprietary format, transduce the annotations using available tools to the pivot format for interchange and/or processing, and if desired, transduce the pivot form of the annotations (and/or additional annotation introduced by processing) back into the proprietary format.",
        "We anticipate the future development of annotation tools that provide a user-oriented interface for specifying annotation information, and which then generate annotations in the pivot format directly.",
        "Thus the pivot format is intended to function in the same way as, for example, Java byte code functions for programmers, as a universal “machine language” that is interpreted by processing software into an internal representation suited to its particular requirements.",
        "As with Java byte code, users need never see or manipulate the pivot format; it is solely for machine consumption.",
        "Information units or data categories provide the semantics of an annotation.",
        "Data categories are the most theory and application-specific part of an annotation scheme.",
        "Therefore, LAF includes a Data Category Registry to provide a means to formally define data categories for reference and use in annotation.",
        "To make them maximally interoperable and consistent with existing standards, RDF schemas can be used to formalize the properties and relations associated with each data category.",
        "The RDF schema ensures that each instantiation of the described objects is recognized as a subclass of more general classes and inherits the appropriate properties.",
        "Annotations will reference the data categories via a URL identifying their instantiations in the Data Category Registry itself.",
        "The class and subclass mechanisms provided in RDFS and its extensions in OWL will also enable creation of an ontology of annotation classes and types.",
        "A formally defined set of categories will have several functions: (1) it will provide a precise semantics for annotation categories that can be either used “off the shelf” by annotators or modified to serve specific needs; (2) it will provide a set of reference categories onto which scheme-specific names can be mapped; and (3) it will provide a point of departure for definition of variant or more precise categories.",
        "Thus the overall goal of the Data Category Registry is not to impose a specific set of categories, but rather to ensure that the semantics of data categories included in annotations (whether they exist in the Registry or not) are well-defined and understood.",
        "The data model that will define the pivot format must be capable of representing all of the information contained in diverse annotation types.",
        "The model we assume is a feature structure graph for annotation information, capable of referencing n-dimensional regions of primary data as well as other annotations.",
        "The choice of this model is indicated by its almost universal use in defining general-purpose annotation formats, including the Generic Modeling Tool (GMT) (Ide & Romary, 2001, 2002) and Annotation Graphs (Bird & Liberman, 2001).",
        "The XML-based GMT could serve as a starting point for defining the pivot format; its applicability to diverse annotation types, including terminology, dictionaries and other lexical data (Ide, et al., 2000), morphological annotation (Ide & Romary, 2001a; 2003) and syntactic annotation (Ide & Romary, 2001b) demonstrates its generality.",
        "As specified by the LAF architecture, the GMT implements a feature structure graph, and exploits the hierarchical structure of XML elements and XML’s powerful inter-and intra-document pointing and linkage mechanisms for referencing both “raw” and XML-tagged primary data and its annotations.",
        "The provision of development resources, including schemas, design patterns, and stylesheets, will enable annotators and software developers to immediately adapt to LAF.",
