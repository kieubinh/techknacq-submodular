        "InfoXtract is a domain independent, but portable information extraction engine that has been designed for information discovery applications.",
        "The last decade has seen great advances in the area of IE.",
        "In the US, MUC [Chinchor & Marsh 1998] has been the driving force for developing this technology.",
        "The most successful IE task thus far has been Named Entity (NE) tagging.",
        "The state-of-the-art exemplified by systems such as NetOwl [Krupka & Hausman 1998], IdentiFinder [Miller et al. 1998] and InfoXtract [Srihari et al. 2000] has reached near human performance, with 90% or above F-measure.",
        "On the other hand, the deep level MUC IE task Scenario Template (ST) is designed to extract detailed information for predefined event scenarios of interest.",
        "It involves filling the slots of complicated templates.",
        "It is generally felt that this task is too ambitious for commercial application at present.",
        "Information Discovery (ID) is a term which has traditionally been used to describe efforts in data mining [Han 1999].",
        "The goal is to extract novel patterns of transactions which may reveal interesting trends.",
        "The key assumption is that the data is already in a structured form.",
        "ID in this paper is defined within the context of unstructured text documents; it is the ability to extract, normalize/disambiguate, merge and link entities, relationships, and events which provides significant support for ID applications.",
        "Furthermore, there is a need to accumulate information across documents about entities and events.",
        "Due to rapidly changing events in the real world, what is of no interest one day, may be especially interesting the following day.",
        "Thus, information discovery applications demand breadth and depth in IE technology.",
        "A variety of IE engines, reflecting various goals in terms of extraction as well as architectures are now available.",
        "Among these, the most widely used are the GATE system from the University of Sheffield [Cunningham et al. 2003], the IE components from Clearforest (www.clearforest.com), SIFT from BBN [Miller et al. 1998], REES from SRA [Aone & Ramon-Santacruz 1998] and various tools provided by Inxight (www.inxight.com).",
        "Of these, the GATE system most closely resembles InfoXtract in terms of its goals as well as the architecture and customization tools.",
        "Cymfony differentiates itself by using a hybrid",
        "model that efficiently combines statistical and grammar-based approaches, as well as by using an internal data structure known as a token-list that can represent hierarchical linguistic structures and IE results for multiple modules to work on.",
        "The research presented here focuses on a new intermediate level of information extraction which supports information discovery.",
        "Specifically, it defines new IE tasks such as Entity Profile (EP) extraction, which is designed to accumulate interesting information about an entity across documents as well as within a discourse.",
        "Furthermore, Concept-based General Event (CGE) is defined as a domain-independent, representation of event information but more feasible than MUC ST. InfoXtract represents a hybrid model for extracting both shallow and intermediate level IE: it exploits both statistical and grammar-based paradigms.",
        "A key feature is the ability to rapidly customize the IE engine for a specific domain and application.",
        "Information discovery applications are required to process an enormous volume of documents, and hence any IE engine must be able to scale up in terms of processing speed and robustness; the design and architecture of InfoXtract reflect this need.",
        "In the remaining text, Section 2 defines the new intermediate level IE tasks.",
        "Section 3 presents extensions to InfoXtract to support cross-document IE.",

        "A description of the increasingly sophisticated IE outputs from the InfoXtract engine is given below:",
        "• NE: Named Entity objects represent key items such as proper names of person, organization, product, location, target, contact information such as address, email, phone number, URL, time and numerical expressions such as date, year and various measurements weight, money, percentage, etc.",
        "• CE: Correlated Entity objects capture relation",
        "ship mentions between entities such as the affiliation relationship between a person and his employer.",
        "The results will be consolidated into the information object Entity Profile (EP) based on co-reference and alias support.",
        "• EP: Entity Profiles are complex rich information",
        "objects that collect entity-centric information, in particular, all the CE relationships that a given entity is involved in and all the events this entity is involved in.",
        "This is achieved through document-internal fusion and cross-document fusion of related information based on support from co-reference, including alias association.",
        "Work is in progress to enhance the fusion by correlating the extracted information with information in a user-provided existing database.",
        "• GE: General Events are verb-centric information objects representing ‘who did what to whom when and where’ at the logical level.",
        "Concept-based GE (CGE) further requires that participants of events be filled by EPs instead of NEs and that other values of the GE slots (the action, time and location) be disambiguated and normalized.",
        "• PE: Predefined Events are domain specific or",
        "user-defined events of a specific event type, such as Product Launch and Company Acquisition in the business domain.",
        "They represent a simplified version of MUC ST. InfoXtract provides a toolkit that allows users to define and write their own PEs based on automatically generated PE rule templates.",
        "The InfoXtract engine has been deployed both internally to support Cymfony’s Brand DashboardFm product and externally to a third-party integrator for building IE applications in the intelligence domain."

      "text": [
        "InfoXtract represents a hybrid model for IE since it combines both grammar formalisms as well as machine learning.",
        "Achieving the right balance of these two paradigms is a major design objective of InfoXtract.",
        "The core of the parsing and information extraction process in InfoXtract is organized very simply as a pipeline of processing modules.",
        "All modules operate on a single in-memory data structure, called a token list.",
        "A token list is essentially a sequence of tree structures, overlaid with a graph whose edges define relations that may be either grammatical or informational in nature.",
        "The nodes of these trees are called tokens.",
        "InfoXtract’s typical mode of processing is to skim along the roots of the trees in the token list, building up structure “strip-wise”.",
        "So even non-terminal nodes behave, in the typical case, as complex tokens.",
        "Representing a marked up text using trees explicitly, rather than implicitly as an interpretation of paired bracket symbols, has several advantages.",
        "For example, it allows a somewhat richer organization of the information contained “between the brackets,” allowing us to construct direct links from a root node to its semantic head, for example.",
        "The processing modules that act on token lists can range from lexical lookup to the application of hand written grammars to statistical analysis based on machine learning all the way to arbitrary procedures written in C++.",
        "The configuration of the InfoXtract processing pipeline is controlled by a configuration file, which handles pre-loading required resources as well as ordering the application of modules.",
        "Despite the variety of implementation strategies available, InfoXtract Natural Language Processing (NLP) modules are restricted in what they can do to the token list to actions of the following three types :",
        "1.",
        "Assertion and erasure of token properties (features, normal forms, etc.)",
        "2.",
        "Grouping token sequences into higher level constituent tokens.",
        "3.",
        "Linking token pairs with a relational link.",
        "Grammatical analysis of the input text makes use of a combination of phrase structure and relational approaches to grammar.",
        "Basically, early modules build up structure to a certain level (including relatively simple noun phrases, verb groups and prepositional phrases), after which further grammatical structure is represented by asserting relational links between tokens.",
        "This mix of phrase structural and relational approaches is very similar to the approach of Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) [Kaplan & Bresnan 1982], much scaled down.",
        "Our grammars are written in a formalism developed for our own use, and also in a modified formalism developed for outside users, based on our in-house experiences.",
        "In both cases, the formalism mixes regular expressions with boolean expressions.",
        "Actions affecting the token list are implemented as side effects of pattern matching.",
        "So although our processing modules are in the technical sense token list transducers, they do not resemble Finite State Transducers (FSTs) so much as the regular expression based pattern-action rules used in Awk or Lex.",
        "Grammars can contain (non-recursive) macros, with parameters.",
        "This means that some long-distance dependencies, which are very awkward to represent directly in finite state automata can be represented very compactly in macro form.",
        "While this has the advantage of decreasing grammar sizes, it does increase the size of the resulting automata.",
        "Grammars are compiled to a special type of finite state automata.",
        "These token list automata can be thought of as an extension of tree walking automata [Mönnich et al. 2001, Aho & Ullman 1971, Engelfriet et al. 1999].",
        "These are linear automata (as opposed to standard finite state tree automata [Gécseg & Steinby 1997], which are more naturally thought of as parallel) which run over trees.",
        "The problem with linear automata on trees is that there can be a number of “next” nodes to move the read head to: right sister, left sister, parent, first child, etc.",
        "So the vocabulary of the automaton is increased to include not only symbols that might appear in the text (test instructions) but also symbols that indicate where to move the read head (directive instructions).",
        "We have extended the basic tree walking formalism in several directions.",
        "First we extend the power of test instructions to allow them to check features of the current node and to perform string matching against the semantic head of the current node (so that a syntactically complex constituent can be matched against a single word).",
        "Second, we include symbols for action instructions, to implement side effects.",
        "Finally, we allow movement not only along the root sequence (string-automaton style) and branches of a tree (tree-walking style) but also along the the terminal frontier of the tree and along relational links.",
        "These extensions to standard tree walking automata extend the power of that formalism tremendously, and could pose problems.",
        "However, the grammar formalisms that compile into these token list walking automata are restrictive, in the sense that there exist many token list transductions that are implementable as automata that are not implementable as grammars.",
        "Also the nature of the shallow parsing task itself is such that we only need to dip into the reserves of power that this representation affords us on relatively rare occasions.",
        "As a result, the automata that we actually plug into the InfoXtract NLP pipeline generally run very fast.",
        "Recently, we have developed an extended finite state formalism named Expert Lexicon, following the general trend of lexicalist approaches to NLP.",
        "An expert lexicon rule consists of both grammatical components as well as proximity-based keyword matching.",
        "All Expert Lexicon entries are indexed, similar to the case for the finite state tool in INTEX [Silberztein 2000].",
        "The pattern matching time is therefore reduced dramatically compared to a sequential finite state device.",
        "Some unique features of this formalism include: (i) the flexibility of inserting any number of Expert Lexicons at any level of the process; (ii) the capability of proximity checking within a window size as rule constraints in addition to pattern matching using an FST call, so that the rule writer can exploit the combined advantages of both; and (iii) support for the propagation of semantic tagging results, to accommodate principles like one sense per discourse.",
        "Expert lexicons are used in customization of lexicons, named entity glossaries, and alias lists, as well as concept tagging.",
        "Both supervised machine learning and unsupervised learning are used in InfoXtract.",
        "Supervised learning is used in hybrid modules such as NE [Srihari et al. 2000], NE Normalization [Li et al. 2002] and Co-reference.",
        "It is also used in the preprocessing module for orthographic case restoration of case insensitive input [Niu et al. 2003].",
        "Unsupervised learning involves acquisition of lexical knowledge and rules from a raw corpus.",
        "The former includes word clustering, automatic name glossary acquisition and thesaurus construction.",
        "The latter involves bootstrapped learning of NE and CE rules, similar to the techniques used in [Riloff 1996].",

        "Brand Dashboard is a commercial application for marketing and public relations organizations to measure and assess media perception of consumer brands.",
        "The InfoXtract engine is used to analyze several thousand electronic sources of information provided by various content aggregators (Factiva, LexisNexis, etc.).",
        "The engine is focused on tagging and generating brand profiles that also capture salient information such as the descriptive phrases used in describing brands (e.g. cost-saving, non-habit forming) as well as user-configurable specific messages that companies are trying to promote and track (safe and reliable, industry leader, etc.).",
        "The output from the engine is fed into a database-driven web application which then produces report cards for brands containing quantitative metrics pertaining to brand perception, as well as qualitative information describing characteristics.",
        "A sample screenshot from Brand Dashboard is presented in Figure 5.",
        "It depicts a report card for a particular brand, highlighting brand strength as well as highlighting metrics that have changed the most in the last time period.",
        "The “buzz box” on the right hand side illustrates companies/brands, people, analysts, and messages most frequently associated with the brand in question."
