        "To a great extent, the successful operation of such a system depends on the high-quality domain representations exchanged between individual modules.",
        "Ontologies have traditionally been used to represent domain knowledge and are employed for various linguistic tasks, e. g., semantic interpretation, anaphora, or metonymy resolution.",
        "We propose an additional way of employing ontologies, i. e., to use the knowledge modeled therein as the basis for defining the semantics and the content of the information exchanged between the modules of LT systems.",
        "In language technology systems, modules typically exchange messages, e. g., a parser of a dialogue system might get word lattices as input and produce corresponding semantic representations for later processing modules, such as a discourse manager.",
        "The increasing employment of XML-based interfaces for agent-based or other multi-blackboard communication systems sets a de facto standard for syntax and expressive capabilities of the information that is exchanged amongst modules.",
        "The content and structure of the information to be",
        "represented is typically defined in corresponding XML schemata (XMLS) or Document Type Definitions (DTD).",
        "Employing the approach introduced below, XMLS and DTDs are created such that they: stay logically consistent, as the logical consistency of ontologies can be checked with the help of available tools, are easy to manage, enable a straightforward mapping back to the respective knowledge representation for inference, allow the handling of language processing tasks immediately on the basis of XMLS.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we will give an overview of the approaches to knowledge storage as employed in LT systems.",
        "Section 3 outlines the task that we address, highlights the problems which arise when mapping knowledge structures from ontologies to XMLS and how these have been solved in our implementation.",
        "Section 4 discusses how the approach has been deployed in a real-life dialogue system as well as some of the additional advantages resulting from its application.",

        "Efforts originating in various W3C and Semantic Web projects brought about several knowledge modeling standards: Resource Description Framework (RDF), DARPA Agent Mark-up Language (DAML), Ontology Interchange Language (OIL), Web Ontology Language (OWL).2 As for intra-agent or intra-module communication languages, either XMLS or DTDs have become standards for interface specifications, due to the fact that instance documents can be automatically validated during runtime and software has been developed for parsing and marshaling information represented in these formats.3",
        "Current systems often feature both XMLS- or DTD-based communication languages as well as DAML- or RDF-based knowledge stores.",

        "Attempts to hand-craft XMLS or DTDs for defining communication between various processing modules show that several problems grow roughly linear to the complexity of the domains to be defined by means of the individual representations.",
        "These problems are: inconsistencies in modeling choices, e.g. elements versus attributes, inconsistencies in the hierarchy, e.g. flatness versus depth of individual branches, readability and understandability of the schemata.",
        "In a system involving multiple domains it becomes pretty much impossible to manually define suitable XML schemata for the modules that exchange information about the multitude of possible utterances.",
        "The ensuing inadequacies of the representations constitute a substantial obstacle for system development and its functionality.",
        "Processing modules operating on such schemata can also not apply inferencing algorithms directly on these structures, as they do not represent enough knowledge.",
        "This has the effect that individual knowledge stores have to be hand-crafted for specific components, causing the heterogeneity between the communicated and the modeled objects to increase further.",

        "The instance documents would become ambiguous, if some non-abstract types (i.e. types that can be instantiated, e.g.",
        "Agent) have derived types (e.g.",
        "Person).",

        "Type final is used when elements are given a type.",
