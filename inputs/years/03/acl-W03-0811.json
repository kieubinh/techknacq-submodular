        "One central element of research in the field of intelligent user interfaces is the construction of advanced natural language and multimodal dialog systems that demonstrate the high potential for more natural and much more powerful human-computer interaction.",
        "Although language technology already found its way into fundamental software products – as exemplified by the Microsoft Speech SDK (software development kit) for Windows and the Java Speech API (application programming in-terface) – the development of novel research prototypes still constitutes a demanding challenge.",
        "State-of-the-art dialog systems combine practical results from various research areas and tend to be rather complex software systems which can not simply be realized as a monolithic desktop computer application.",
        "More elaborate software designs are required in order to assemble heterogeneous components into an integrated and fully operational system (Kl¨uter et al., 2000).",
        "A typical research project involves several or even many work groups from different partners, leading to a broad spectrum of practices and preferences that govern the development of software components.",
        "In particular, a common software platform for the construction of an integrated dialog system often needs to support different programming languages and operating systems so that already existing software can be reused and extended.",
        "Taking into account the potential costs it is usually not feasible to start an implementation from scratch.",
        "Another important aspect is the use of rapid prototyping for accelerated progress which leads to frequent changes in design and implementation as the project unfolds.",
        "Over the last ten years we have been concerned with the realization of various complex distributed dialog systems.",
        "A practical result of our long-term work as a dedicated system integration group is the so-called MULTIPLATFORM testbed' (Multiple Language Target Integration Platform for Modules) which provides a powerful and complete integration platform.",
        "In this contribution, we will report on the experience gained in the construction of integrated large-scale research prototypes.",
        "The results obtained so far will be presented and the underlying principles of our approach will be discussed."

        "A distributed system constitutes the natural choice to realize an open, flexible and scalable software architecture, able to integrate heterogeneous software modules implemented in diverse programming languages and running on different operating systems.",
        "In our project work, for example, we encountered modules for Sun Solaris, GNU Linux, and Microsoft Windows written in Prolog and Lisp, as classical AI languages, as well as in common conventional programming languages like C, C++, and Java.",
        "The testbed framework is based on a component architecture (Hopkins, 2000) and our approach assumes a modularization of the dialog system into distinct and independent software modules to allow maximum decoupling.",
        "These large-grained components – ranging from more basic modules that encapsulate access to specific hardware devices to complex components which may include entire application-specific subsystems – constitute self-contained applications which are executed as separate processes, or even process groups.",
        "The principle behind this view is to consider software architecture on a higher-level of abstraction as modularization is not concerned with decomposition on the level of component libraries in a specific programming language.",
        "Continuous evolution is one of the driving forces behind the development of novel dialog systems.",
        "The creation of a com-ponentized system makes the integrated system easier to maintain.",
        "In a well-designed system, the changes will be localized, and such changes can be made with little or no effect on the remaining components.",
        "Component integration and deployment are independent of the component development life cycle, and there is no need to recompile or relink the entire application when updating with a new implementation of a component.",
        "The term middleware (Emmerich, 2000) denotes the specific software infrastructure that facilitates the interaction among distributed software modules, i.e. the software layer between the operating system – including the basic communication protocols – and the distributed components that interact via the network.",
        "The testbed as a component platform enables interprocess communication and provides means for configuring and deploying the individual parts of the complete dialog system.",
        "Our middleware solution does not exclude to connect additional components during system execution.",
        "So far, however, the testbed does not offer specific support for dynamic system reconfiguration at runtime.",
        "In our experience, it is acceptable and even beneficial to assume a stable, i.e. a static but configurable, architecture of the user interface components within a specific system instantiation.",
        "It is obvious that ad hoc activation and invocation of services constitutes an important issue in many application scenarios, in particular Internet-based applications.",
        "We propose to hide such dynamic aspects within the application-specific parts of the complete system so that they do not affect the basic configuration of the dialog system itself.",
        "The details of the specific component architecture of different dialog systems vary significantly and an agreed-upon standard architecture which defines a definite modularization simply does not exist.",
        "Nevertheless, we found it helpful to use a well-defined naming scheme and distinguish the following categories of dialog system components when designing a concrete system architecture: Recognizer: Modality-specific components that process input data on the signal level.",
        "Examples include speech recognition, determination of prosodic information, or gesture recognition.",
        "Analyzer: Modules that further process recognized user input or intermediary results on a semantic level.",
        "Such components include in particular modality-specific analyzers and media fusion.",
        "Modeller: Active knowledge sources that provide explicit models of relevant aspects of the dialog system, like for example discourse memory, lexicon, or a suitable model of the underlying application functionality.",
        "Generator: Knowledge-based components which determine and control the reactions of the dialog system through the transformation of representation structures.",
        "This includes the planning of dialog contributions and application-centric activities as well as fission of multiple modalities and media-specific generators, e.g., for text and graphics.",
        "Synthesizer: Media-specific realization components that transform generated structures into perceivable output.",
        "A typical example is a speech synthesis component.",
        "Device: Connector modules that encapsulate access to a hardware component like, for example, microphone and sound card for audio input or a camera system that observes the user in order to identify facial expressions.",
        "Service: Connector components that provide a well-defined link to some application-specific functionality.",

        "As illustrated by a hybrid technology like SOAP, the simple object access protocol, where remote calls of object methods are encoded in XML messages, the borderline between a procedural and a declarative approach is rather difficult to draw in general.",
        "Our own data-oriented interface specifications will be discussed in more detail in section 3.",
        "For message-based communication, two main schemes can be distinguished: Basic point-to-point messaging employs unicast routing and realizes the notion of a direct connection between message sender and a known receiver.",

        "The more general publish/subscribe approach is based on multicast addressing.",

        "A DTD basically defines for each allowed element all allowed attributes and possibly the acceptable attribute values as well as the nesting and occurrences of each element.",

        "Compared with the older DTD mechanism, a schema definition (XSD) offers two main advantages: The schema itself is also specified in XML notation and the formalism is far more expressive as it enables more detailed restrictions on valid data structures.",
        "This includes in particular the description of element contents and not only the element structure.",
        "As a schema specification can provide a well-organized type structure it also helps to better document the details of the data format definition.",

        "It should be noted that the design of an XML language for the external representation of complex data constitutes a non-trivial task.",
        "Our experience is that design decisions have to be made carefully.",
        "For example, it is better to minimize the use of attributes.",
        "They are limited to unstructured data and may occur at most once within a single element.",

        "RAGS (Cahill et al., 2000) does not address the entire architecture of dialog systems and multimodal interaction.",
        "The RAGS approach, which stands for Reference Architecture for Generation Systems, focuses instead on natural language generation systems and aims to produce an architectural specification and model for the development of new applications in this area.",
        "RAGS is based on the well-known three-stage pipeline model for natural language generation which distinguishes between content determination, sentence planning, and linguistic realization.",
        "The main component of the RAGS architecture is a data model, in the form of a set of declarative linguistic representations which cover the various levels of representation that have to be taken into account within the generation process.",
        "XML-based notations for the data model can be used in order to exchange RAGS representations between distributed components.",
        "The reference architecture is open regarding the technical interconnection of the different components of a generation system.",
        "One specifically supported solution is the use of a single centralized data repository."

        "MULTIPLATFORM provides a practical framework for large-scale software integration that results from the realization of various natural language and multimodal dialog systems.",
        "The MULTIPLATFORM testbed is based on an open component architecture which employs message-passing to interconnect distributed software modules.",
        "We propose to operationalize interface specifications in the form of an XML language as a viable approach to assemble knowledge-based as well as conventional components into an integrated dialog system.",
        "The testbed software is currently being refactored and we are planning to make it publicly available as open source software.",
        "More than one hundred modules have already been used within the MULTIPLATFORM testbed.",
        "So far, however, these dialog system components are not freely available for public distribution.",
        "The availability of prefabricated modules as part of the testbed software would also enable third parties to develop complete dialog system applications through the reuse of provided standard components.",
        "In addition to the software infrastructure, the practical organization of the project constitutes a key factor for the successful realization of an integrated multimodal dialog system.",
        "Stepwise improvement and implementation of the design of architecture details and interfaces necessitates an intensive discussion process that has to include all participants who are involved in the realization of system components in order to reach a common understanding of the intended system behavior.",
        "Independent integration experts that focus on the overall dialog system have proven to be helpful for the coordination of this kind of activities."
