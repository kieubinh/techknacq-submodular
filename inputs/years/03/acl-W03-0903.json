        "The ways in which knowledge has been represented in multi-modal dialogue systems (MMDS) show that individual representations with different semantics and heterogeneously structured content can be found in various formats within single natural language processing (NLP) systems and applications.",
        "For example, a typical NLP system, such as TRAINS (Allen et al., 1996), employs different knowledge representations for parsing, action planning and generation, despite the fact that what is being represented is common to all those representations, e. g., the parser representation for going from A to B has no similarity to the action plannerâ€™s representation thereof (Ferguson et al., 1996).",
        "Also central concepts, for example city, are represented in multiple ways throughout the system.",
        "The origin for this state of affairs is that the respective knowledge stores are hand-crafted individually for each task.",
        "Sometimes they are compiled into code and cease to be externally available.",
        "Where an explicit knowledge representation is used, we find a multitude of formats and inference engines, which often cause both performance and tractability problems.",
        "In this paper we introduce the results of an effort to employ a single knowledge representation, i. e., an ontology, throughout a complete multi-modal dialogue system.",
        "Therefore, we will describe the underlying modeling principles and the benefits of such a rigorously crafted knowledge store for the actual and future MMDS.",
        "In Section 2 we will introduce the representational formats pertinent to our ontology, followed by a description of our dialogue system in Section 3.",
        "In Section 4 we discuss the modeling principles underlying the ontology.",
        "Section 5 presents some examples of the various ways in which the common ontology is employed throughout the system.",

        "In the work reported here, we used an ontology defined in the OIL-RDFS syntax.",
        "A detailed characterization of the formal properties of the OIL language can be found in Fensel et al.",
        "(2001).",
        "The FACT2 system can be used as a reasoning engine for OIL ontologies, providing some automated reasoning capabilities, such as class consistency or subsumption checking.",
        "Graphical ontology engineering front-ends and visualization tools are available for editing, maintaining, and visualizing the ontology.",
        "The semantics of OIL is based on description logic extended with concrete datatypes.",
        "The language employs a combination of frame and description logic.",
        "It provides most of the modeling primitives commonly used in the frame-based knowledge representation systems.",
        "Frames are used to represent concepts.",
        "These frames consist of a collection of classes along with a list of slots and at",
        "tributes.",
        "Under the term class or class expression a class name, or an enumeration, or a property-restriction, or a boolean combination of class expressions is to be understood.",
        "Slots are interpreted as a collection of properties.",
        "They are divided into those that relate classes to other classes (so called object properties) and those that relate classes to datatype values (so called datatype properties).",
        "Slots can be filled by: class names, names of the atomic elements, collection of the above (conjunctive sets - and, disjunctive sets - or, or negation - not), concrete datatypes (integers and strings).",
        "Then, domain and range restrictions of the slots can be defined.",
        "Domain restriction asserts that the property only applies to the instances of particular class expressions.",
        "Range restriction specifies that a property only assumes values that are instances of the respective class expressions.",
        "Slot fillers can have several types of further constraints, also called facets.",
        "These include value-type restrictions (all fillers must be of a particular class), has-value restrictions (there must be at least one filler of a particular class).",
        "The value-type restriction corresponds to the universal quantifier of the predicate logic.",
        "The has-value restriction is analogous to the existential quantifier.",
        "Another constraint on the slot fillers is cardinality, which limits the number of possible fillers of the given class.",
        "Atomic elements or individuals can also be associated with a class definition via slot constraints.",
        "The decision to restrict ourselves to schemes based on the description logic is due to the fact that it allows to represent enough knowledge for the effective operation of envisaged NLP applications, e. g., those described in Section 5.",
        "We used the OIL language in particular as a whole range of software is freely available to support ontology construction as mentioned above.",

        "The most important modeling decisions will be discussed in Section 4.",

        "The meaning of ontology constructs relies on a translation to some logic.",
        "This way, the inference implications of statements, e.g. whether a class can be related to another class via a subclass or some other relation, can be determined from the formal specification of the semantics of the ontology language.",
        "However, this does not make any claims about the syntactic appearance of the representations exchanged, e.g. an ordering of the properties of a class.",
        "An interface specification framework, such as XMLS or DTD, constitutes a suitable means for defining constraints on the syntax and structure of XML documents.",
        "Ideally, the definition of the content communicated between the components of a complex dialogue system should relate both the syntax and the semantics of the XML documents exchanged.",
        "Those can then be seen as instances of the ontology represented as XMLS-based XML documents.",
        "However, this requires that the knowledge, originally encoded in the ontology, is represented in the XMLS syntax."

      "text": [
        "The solution proposed states that the knowledge representations to be expressed in XMLS are first modeled in OIL-RDFS or DAML+OIL as ontology proper, using the advantages of ontology engineering systems available, and then transformed into a communication interface automatically with the help of the software developed for that purpose.6 Employing this approach, XMLS and DTDs are created such that they: stay logically consistent, are easy to manage, enable a straightforward mapping back to the respective knowledge representation for inference, allow the handling of a range of NLP tasks immediately on the basis of XMLS.7 The resulting schemata capture the hierarchical structure and a significant part of the semantics of the ontology.",
        "We, therefore, provide a standard mechanism for defining XMLS-based interface specifications, which are knowledge rich, and thus can be used as a suitable representation of domain and discourse knowledge by NLP components.",
        "Since the software that has been developed completely automates the transformation process, the resulting XMLS are congruent with the XML schema specifications.",
        "Furthermore, the ontology can be reused in multiple systems as a single ontology can be used to generate application-specific communication interfaces.",
        "However, the main advantage of our approach is that it combines the power of ontological knowledge representation with the strengths of XMLS as an interface specification framework in a single and consistent representation.",
        "Our experience shows, this would not have been possible for a complex dialogue system, if XML schemata were defined from scratch or hand-crafted, and constitutes a step towards building robust and reusable NLP components."

      "text": [
        "In this paper, we presented an ontology which can be used as a single knowledge representation in a multi-modal and multi-domain dialogue system.",
        "We described the major modeling principles and the design choices made.",
        "Furthermore, we sketched some examples of the ontology application within the system.",
        "Together these examples suffice to demonstrate the benefits of using a single knowledge representation throughout a dialogue system as opposed to using multiple knowledge representations and formats.",
        "An additional advantage of such a homogeneous world model",
        "7E.g., the discourse module described in the previous subsection operates on the XML schema obtained via ontology transformation.",
        "that defines the processing interfaces as well as the systemâ€™s world knowledge is that no costly mappings between them are any more necessary.",
        "This means that modules receive only messages whose content is congruent to the terminological and structural distinctions defined in the ontology.",
        "Our additional concern while designing the ontology was the re-usability of this component within our MMDS as well as other NLP systems.",
        "So far, the top-level ontology proved stable.",
        "We found the extensions on the lower levels of the ontology to be comparatively cheap.",
        "This single knowledge base was successfully tested and applied to multiple NLP problems, e.g., resolving bridging expressions in texts as well as for the resolution of metonymical and polysemous utterances next to defining communication interfaces for NLP components of the system, scoring of speech recognition hypotheses and overlay mechanism described above."
