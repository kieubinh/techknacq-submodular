        "Modern Question Answering (QA) systems aim at providing answers to natural language questions in an open-domain context.",
        "This task is usually achieved by combining information retrieval (IR) with information extraction (IE) techniques, modified to be applicable to unrestricted texts.",
        "Although semantics-poor techniques, such as surface pattern matching (Soubbotin, 2002; Ravichan-dran and Hovy, 2002) or statistical methods (Ittycheriah et al., 2002), have been successful in answering factoid questions, more complex tasks require a consideration of text meaning.",
        "This requirement has motivated work on QA systems to incorporate knowledge processing components such as semantic representation, ontologies, reasoning and inference engines, e.g., (Moldovan et al., 2003), (Hovy et al., 2002), (Chu-Carroll et al., 2003).",
        "Since world knowledge databases for open-domain tasks are unavailable, alternative approaches for meaning representation must be adopted.",
        "In this paper, we present our preliminary approach to semantics-based answer detection in the JAVELIN QA system (Nyberg et al., 2003).",
        "In contrast to other QA systems, we are trying to realize a formal model for a lightweight semantics-based open-domain question answering.",

        "framework based on semantic similarities and weighted relations between words.",
        "We obtain a lightweight roboust mechanism to match questions with answer candidates.",
        "The organization of the paper is as follows: Section 2 briefly presents system components; Section 3 discusses syntactic processing strategies; Sections 4 and 5 describe our preliminary semantic representation and the unification framework which assigns confidence values to answer candidates.",

        "Due to the lack of publicly available parsers which have suitable coverage of question forms, we have manually developed a set of grammars to achieve these goals.",
        "On the other hand, the limited coverage and ambiguity in these grammars made adopting the same approach for passage analysis inefficient.",

        "), WordNet (Fell-baum, 1998) (for semantic categorization), and the KANTOO Lexifier (Nyberg and Mitamura, 2000) (to access a syntactic lexicon for verb valence information).",

        "The representation uses the following main constructs:2",
        "• formula is a conjunction of literals and represents the meaning of the entire sentence (or question); • literal is a predicate relation over two terms; in particular, we distinguish two types of literals: extrinsic literal, a literal which relates a label to a label, and intrinsic literal, a literal which relates a label to a word;",
        "• predicate is used to capture relations between terms; • term is either a label, a variable which refers to a",

        "Unlike in (Moldovan et al., 2003), names of predicates belong to a fixed vocabulary, which provides a more sound basis for a formal interpretation.",

        "questions such as What is the definition of hazmat?, specialized (dedicated) grammars are used, which allows us to more easily arrive at an appropriate representation of meaning.",
