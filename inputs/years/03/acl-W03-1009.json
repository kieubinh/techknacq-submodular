        "In many natural language processing applications, such as parsing or language modeling, sentences are treated as natural self-contained units.",
        "Yet it is well-known that for interpreting the sentences the discourse context is often very important.",
        "The later sentences in the discourse contain references to the entities in the preceding sentences, and this fact is often useful, e.g., in caching for language modeling (Goodman, 2001).",
        "The indirect influence of the context, however, can be observed even when a sentence is taken as a standalone unit, i.e., without its context.",
        "It is possible to distinguish between a set of earlier sentences and a set of later sentences without any direct comparison by computing certain local statistics of individual sentences, such as their entropy (Genzel and Charniak, 2002).",
        "In this work we provide additional evidence for this hypothesis and investigate other sentence statistics."

        "Entropy, as a measure of information, is often used in the communication theory.",
        "If humans have evolved to communicate in the most efficient way (some evidence for that is provided by Plotkin and Nowak (2000)), then they would communicate in such a way that the entropy rate would be constant, namely, equal to the channel capacity (Shannon, 1948).",
        "In our previous work (Genzel and Charniak, 2002) we propose that entropy rate is indeed constant in human communications.",
        "When read in context, each sentence would appear to contain roughly the same amount of information, per word, whether it is the first sentence or the tenth one.",
        "Thus the tenth sentence, when taken out of context, must appear significantly more informative (and therefore harder to process), since it implicitly assumes that the reader already knows all the information in the preceding nine sentences.",
        "Indeed, the greater the sentence number, the harder to process the sentence must appear, though for large sentence numbers this would be very difficult to detect.",
        "This makes intuitive sense: out-of-context sentences are harder to understand than in-context ones, and first sentences can never be out of context.",
        "It is also demonstrated empirically through estimating entropy rate of various sentences.",
        "In the first part of the present paper (Sections 2 and 3) we extend and further verify these results.",
        "In the second part (Section 4), we investigate the potential reasons underlying this variation in complexity by looking at the parse trees of the sentences.",
