        "Co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998) is a weakly supervised paradigm that learns a task from a small set of labeled data and a large pool of unlabeled data using separate, but redundant views of the data (i.e. using disjoint feature subsets to represent the data).",
        "To ensure provable performance guarantees, the co-training algorithm assumes as input a set of views that satisfies two fairly strict conditions.",
        "First, each view must be sufficient for learning the target concept.",
        "Second, the views must be conditionally independent of each other given the class.",

        "Indeed, although the algorithm has been applied successfully to natural language processing (NLP) tasks that have a natural view factorization (e.g. web page classification (Blum and Mitchell, 1998) and named entity classification (Collins and Singer, 1999)), there has been little success, and a number of reported problems, when applying co-training to NLP data sets for which no natural feature split has been found (e.g. anaphora resolution (Mueller et al., 2002)).",

        "Despite their similarities, the principles underlying the Goldman and Zhou and Steedman et al.",
        "co-training algorithms are fundamentally different.",

        "In related work (Ng and Cardie, 2003), we compare the performance of the Blum and Mitchell co-training algorithm with that of two existing single-view bootstrapping algorithms – self-training with bagging (Banko and Brill, 2001) and EM (Nigam et al., 2000) – on coreference resolution, and show that single-view weakly supervised learners are a viable alternative to co-training for the task.",
        "This paper instead focuses on developing a single-view algorithm that combines aspects of each of the Goldman and Zhou and Steedman et al.",
        "algorithms.",
        "Second, we investigate a new method that, inspired by Steedman et al.",
        "(2003a), ranks unlabeled instances to be added to the labeled data in an attempt to alleviate a problem commonly observed in bootstrapping experiments – performance deterioration due to the degradation in the quality of the labeled data as bootstrapping progresses (Pierce and Cardie, 2001; Riloff and Jones, 1999).",
        "In a set of baseline experiments, we first demonstrate that multi-view co-training fails to boost the performance of the coreference system under various parameter settings.",
        "We then show that our single-view weakly supervised algorithm successfully bootstraps the coreference classifiers, boosting the F-measure score by 9-12% on two standard coreference data sets.",
        "Finally, we present experimental results that suggest that our method for ranking instances is more resistant to performance deterioration in the bootstrapping process than Blum and Mitchell’s “rank-by-confidence” method."

        "We have proposed a single-view, multi-learner bootstrapping algorithm for coreference resolution and shown empirically that the algorithm is a better alternative to the Blum and Mitchell co-training algorithm for this task for which no natural feature split has been found.",
        "In addition, we have investigated an example ranking method for bootstrapping that, unlike Blum and Mitchell’s rank-by-confidence method, can potentially alleviate the problem of performance deterioration due to the pollution of the labeled data in the course of bootstrapping."
