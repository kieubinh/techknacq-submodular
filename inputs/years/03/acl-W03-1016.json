        "CONTENT SELECTION is the task of choosing the right information to communicate in the output of a Natural Language Generation (NLG) system, given semantic input and a communicative goal.",
        "In general, Content Selection is a highly domain dependent task; new rules must be developed for each new domain, and typically this is done manually.",
        "Morevoer, it has been argued (Sripada et al., 2001) that Content Selection is the most important task from a user’s standpoint (i.e., users may tolerate errors in wording, as long as the information being sought is present in the text).",
        "Designing content selection rules manually is a tedious task.",
        "A realistic knowledge base contains a large amount of information that could potentially be included in a text and a designer must examine a sizable number of texts, produced in different situations, to determine the specific constraints for the selection of each piece of information.",
        "Our goal is to develop a system that can automatically acquire constraints for the content selection task.",
        "Our algorithm uses the information we learned from a corpus of desired outputs for the system (i.e., human-produced text) aligned against related semantic data (i.e., the type of data the system will use as input).",
        "It produces constraints on every piece of the input where constraints dictate if it should appear in the output at all and if so, under what conditions.",
        "This process provides a filter on the information to be included in a text, identifying all information that is potentially relevant (previously termed globalfocus (McKeown, 1985) or viewpoints (Acker and Porter, 1994)).",
        "The resulting information can be later either further filtered, ordered and augmented by later stages in the generation pipeline (e.g., see the spreading activation algorithm used in ILEX (Cox et al., 1999)).",
        "We focus on descriptive texts which realize a single, purely informative, communicative goal, as opposed to cases where more knowledge about speaker intentions are needed.",
        "In particular, we present experiments on biographical descriptions, where the planned system will generate short paragraph length texts summarizing important facts about famous people.",
        "The kind of text that we aim to generate is shown in Figure 1.",
        "The rules that we aim to acquire will specify the kind of information that is typically included in any biography.",
        "In some cases, whether",
        "the information is included or not may be conditioned on the particular values of known facts (e.g., the occupation of the person being described – we may need different content selection rules for artists than politicians).",
        "To proceed with the experiments described here, we acquired a set of semantic information and related biographies from the Internet and used this corpus to learn Content Selection rules.",
        "Our main contribution is to analyze how variations in the data influence changes in the text.",
        "We perform such analysis by splitting the semantic input into clusters and then comparing the language models of the associated clusters induced in the text side (given the alignment between semantics and text in the corpus).",
        "By doing so, we gain insights on the relative importance of the different pieces of data and, thus, find out which data to include in the generated text.",
        "The rest of this paper is divided as follows: in the next section, we present the biographical domain we are working with, together with the corpus we have gathered to perform the described experiments.",
        "Section 3 describes our algorithm in detail.",
        "The experiments we perform to validate it, together with their results, are discussed in Section 4.",

        "Our methodology shows that data currently available on the Internet, for various domains, is readily useable for this purpose.",
        "Using our corpora, we have performed experimentation with three methods (exact matching, statistical selection and rule induction) to infer rules from indirect observations from the data.",
        "Given the importance of content selection for the acceptance of generated text by the final user, it is clear that leaving out required information is an error that should be avoided.",
        "Thus, in evaluation, high recall is preferable to high precision.",
        "In that respect, our class-based statistically selected rules perform well.",
        "They achieve 94% recall in the best case, while filtering out half of the data in the input knowledge base.",
        "This significant reduction in data makes the task of developing further rules for content selection a more feasible task.",
        "It will aid the practitioner of NLG in the Content Selection task by reducing the set of data that will need to be examined manually (e.g., discussed with domains experts).",
        "We find the results for ripper disappointing and think more experimentation is needed before discounting this approach.",
        "It seems to us ripper may be overwhelmed by too many features.",
        "Or, this may be the best possible result without incorporating domain knowledge explicitly.",
        "We would like to investigate the impact of additional sources of knowledge.",
        "These alternatives are discussed below.",
        "In order to improve the rule induction results, we may use spreading activation starting from the particular frame to be considered for content selection and include the semantic information in the local context of the frame.",
        "For example, to content select birth date year , only values from frames birth date and birth would be considered (e.g., relative will be completely disregarded).",
        "Another improvement may come from more intertwining between the exact match and statistical selector techniques.",
        "Even if some data path appears to be copied verbatim most of the time, we can run our statistical selector for it and use held out data to decide which performs better.",
