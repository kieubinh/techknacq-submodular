        "Lexical semantic information is useful in many natural language processing and information retrieval applications, particularly tasks that require complex inferences involving world knowledge, such as question answering or the identification of co-referential entities (Paşca and Harabagiu, 2001; Pustejovsky et al., 2002).",
        "However, even large lexical databases such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) do not include all of the words encountered in broad-coverage NLP applications.",

        "In terms of the WordNet lexical database, one would like to automatically assign unknown words a position in the synset hierarchy, introducing new synsets and extending the synset hierarchy where appropriate.",
        "Doing this accurately is a difficult problem, and in this paper we address a simpler problem: automatically determining the broad semantic class, or supersense, to which unknown words belong.",
        "Systems for thesaurus extension (Hearst, 1992; Roark and Charniak, 1998), information extraction (Riloff and Jones, 1999) or named-entity recognition (Collins and Singer, 1999) each partially address this problem in different ways.",
        "The goal in these tasks is automatically tagging words with semantic labels such as “vehicle”, “organization”, “person”, etc.",
        "In this paper we extend the named-entity recognition approach to the classification of common nouns into 26 different supersenses.",
        "Rather than define these ourselves, we adopted the 26 “lexicographer class” labels used in WordNet, which include labels such as person, location, event, quantity, etc.",
        "We believe our general approach should generalize to other definitions of supersenses.",
        "Using the WordNet lexicographer classes as supersenses has a number of practical advantages.",
        "First, we show how information contained in the dictionary can be used as additional training data that improves the system’s accuracy.",
        "Secondly, it is possible to use a very natural evaluation procedure.",
        "A system can be trained on an earlier release of WordNet and tested on the words added in a later release,",
        "since these labels are constant across different releases.",
        "This new evaluation defines a realistic lexical acquisition task which is well defined, well motivated and easily standardizable.",
        "The heart of our system is a multiclass perceptron classifier (Crammer and Singer, 2002).",
        "The features used are the standard ones used in word-sense classification and named-entity extraction tasks, i.e., collocation, spelling and syntactic context features.",
        "The experiments presented below show that when the classifier also uses the data contained in the dictionary its accuracy improves over that of a traditionally trained classifier.",
        "Finally, we show that there are both similarities and differences in the results obtained with the new evaluation and standard cross-validation.",
        "This might suggest that in fact that the new evaluation defines a more realistic task.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we discuss the problem of unknown words and the task of semantic classification.",
        "In Section 3 we describe the WordNet lexicographer classes, how to extract training data from WordNet, the new evaluation method and the relation of this task to named-entity classification.",

        "Language processing systems make use of “dictionaries”, i.e., lists that associate words with useful information such as the word’s frequency or syntactic category.",
        "In tasks that also involve inferences about world knowledge, it is useful to know something about the meaning of the word.",
        "This lexical semantic information is often modeled on what is found in normal dictionaries, e.g., that “irises” are flowers or that “exane” is a solvent.",
        "This information can be crucial in tasks such as question answering - e.g., to answer a question such as “What kind of flowers did Van Gogh paint?” (Paşca and Harabagiu, 2001) - or the individuation of co-referential expressions, as in the passage “... the prerun can be performed with ... this can be considered ...” (Pustejovsky et al., 2002).",
        "Lexical semantic information can be extracted from existing dictionaries such as WordNet.",
        "However, these resources are incomplete and systems that rely on them often encounter unknown words, even if the dictionary is large.",
        "As an example, in the Bllip corpus (a very large corpus of Wall Street Journal text) the relative frequency of common nouns that are unknown to WordNet 1.6 is approximately 0.0054; an unknown noun occurs, on average, every eight sentences.",
        "WordNet 1.6 lists 95,000 noun types.",
        "For this reason the importance of issues such as automatically building, extending or customizing lexical resources has been recognized for some time in computational linguistics (Zernik, 1991).",
        "Solutions to this problem were first proposed in AI in the context of story understanding, cf. (Granger, 1977).",
        "The goal is to label words using a set of semantic labels specified by the dictionary.",
        "Several studies have addressed the problem of expanding one semantic category at a time, such as “vehicle” or “organization”, that are relevant to a particular task (Hearst, 1992; Roark and Charniak, 1998; Riloff and Jones, 1999).",
        "In named-entity classification a large set of named entities (proper nouns) are classified using a comprehensive set of semantic labels such as “organization”, “person”, “location” or “other” (Collins and Singer, 1999).",
        "This latter approach assigns all named entities in the data set a semantic label.",

        "We presented a new framework for word sense classification, based on the WordNet lexicographer classes, that extends named-entity classification.",

        "Directions for future research include the following topics: disambiguation of the training data, e.g. during training as in co-training; learning unknown ambiguous nouns, e.g., studying the distribution of the labels the classifier guessed for the individual tokens of the new word."
