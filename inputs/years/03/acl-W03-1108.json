        "Moreover, non-aligned comparable corpora have been given a special interest in bilingual terminology acquisition and lexical resources enrichment (Dagan and Itai, 1994; Dejean et al., 2002; Diab and Finch, 2000; Fung, 2000; Koehn and Knight, 2002; Nakagawa, 2000; Peters and Picchi, 1995; Rapp, 1999; Shahzad and al., 1999; Tanaka and Iwasaki, 1996).",
        "Unlike parallel corpora, comparable corpora are collections of texts from pairs or multiples of languages, which can be contrasted because of their common features, in the topic, the domain, the authors or the time period.",
        "This property made comparable corpora more abundant, less expensive and more accessible through the World Wide Web.",
        "In the present paper, we are concerned by exploiting scarce resources for bilingual terminology acquisition, then evaluations on Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR).",

        "Our proposed approach to bilingual terminology acquisition from comparable corpora (Sadat et al., 2003; Sadat et al., 2003) is based on the assumption of similar collocation, i.e., If two words are mutual translations, then their most frequent collocates are likely to be mutual translations as well.",
        "Moreover, we apply this assumption in both directions of the corpora, i.e., find translations of the source term in the target language corpus but also translations of the target terms in the source language corpus.",
        "The proposed two-stages approach for the acquisition, disambiguation and selection of bilingual terminology is described as follows:",
        "• Bilingual terminology acquisition from source language to target language to yield a first translation model, represented by similarity 5IMS,T.",
        "• Bilingual terminology acquisition from target language to source language to yield a second translation model, represented by similarity 5IMT,S.",
        "• Merge the first and second models to yield a two-stages translation model, based on bidirectional comparable corpora and repre",
        "sented by similarity 5IMS,,T.",
        "We follow strategies of previous researches (Dejean et al., 2002; Fung, 2000; Rapp, 1999) for the first and second translation models and propose a merging strategy for the two-stages translation model (Sadat et al., 2003).",
        "First, word frequencies, context word frequencies in surrounding positions (here three-words window) are computed following a statistics-based metrics, the log-likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993).",
        "Context vectors for each source term and each target term are constructed.",
        "Next, context vectors of the target words are translated using a preliminary bilingual dictionary.",
        "We consider all translation candidates, keeping the same context frequency value as the source term.",
        "This step requires a seed lexicon, to expand using the proposed bootstrapping approach of this paper.",
        "Similarity vectors are constructed for each pair of source term and target term using the cosine metric (Salton and McGill, 1983).",
        "Therefore, similarity vectors 5IMS,T and 5IMT,S for the first and second models are constructed and merged for a bidirectional acquisition of bilingual terminology from source language to target language.",
        "The merging process will keep common pairs of source term and target translation (s,t) which appear in 5IMS,T as pairs of (s,t) but also in 5IMT,S as pairs of (t,s), to result in combined similarity vectors 5IMS,,T for each pair (s,t).The product of similarity values of both similarity vectors 5IMS,T for pairs (s,t) and 5IMT,S for pairs (t,s) will result in similarity values in vectors 5IMS,,T.",
