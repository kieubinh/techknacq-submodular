        "Information retrieval aims to match the information need expressed by the searcher in the query with concepts expressed in documents.",
        "This matching process is complicated by the variety of different ways - different terms - available to express these concepts and information needs.",
        "In addition, this matching process is dramatically complicated in cross-language and spoken document retrieval by the need to match expressions across languages and typically using error-prone processes such as translation and automatic speech recognition transcription.",
        "To compensate for this variation in expression of underlying concepts, researchers have developed the technique of pseudo-relevance feedback whereby the information representation - query or document - is enriched with highly selective, topically related terms from a large collection of comparable documents.",
        "Such expansion techniques have proved useful across the range of information retrieval applications from monolingual to multilingual, from text to speech, and from queries to documents.",
        "Expansion in the context of cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) is particularly interesting as it presents multiple opportunities for improving retrieval effectiveness.",
        "The pseudo-relevance feedback process can be applied, depending on the retrieval architecture, before translating the query, after translating the query, before translating the document, after translating the document, or at some subset of these points, though not all combinations are reasonable.",
        "While pre and post-translation expansion have been well-studied for a query translation architecture in European languages, as we describe in more detail below, these effects are less well-understood on the document side, especially for Asian languages.",
        "In this paper, we compare the effects of pre-translation, post-translation, and combined pre-and post-translation document expansion for cross-language retrieval using English queries to retrieve spoken documents in Mandarin Chinese.",
        "We identify not only significant enhancements to retrieval effectiveness for post-translation document expansion, but also key contrasts with prior work on query translation and expansion, caused by certain characteristics of Mandarin Chinese, shared by many Asian languages, including issues of segmentation and orthography."

        "In pre-translation query expansion, the goal is both that of monolingual query expansion - providing additional terms to refine the query and to enhance the probability of matching the terminology chosen by the authors of the document - and to provide additional terms to limit the possibility of failing to translate a concept in the query simply because the particular term is not present in the translation lexicon.",

        "From those five documents, we extracted the most selective terms and used them to enrich the original translations of the stories.",

        "For the Chinese newswire text, segmentation was performed by the NMSU segmenter ( (Jin, 1998)).",
        "The expansion factor chosen here followed Singhal et al’s original proposal.",
        "A proportional expansion factor is more desirable than some constant additive number of words or some selectivity threshold, as it provides a more consistent effect on documents of varying lengths; an IDF-based threshold, for example, adds disproportionately more new terms to short original documents than long ones, outweighing the original content.",
        "Prior experiments indicate little sensitivity to the exact expansion factor chosen, as long as it is proportional.",
        "This process thus relatively increased the weight of terms that occurred rarely in the document collection as a whole but frequently in related documents.",
        "The resulting augmented documents were then indexed by InQuery in the usual way.This expanded document collection formed the basis for retrieval using the translated exemplar queries.",
        "The intuition behind document expansion is that terms that are correctly transcribed will tend to be topically coherent, while mistranscription will introduce spurious terms that lack topical coherence.",
        "In other words, although some “noise” terms are randomly introduced, some “signal” terms will survive.",
        "The introduction of spurious terms degrades ranked retrieval somewhat, but the adverse effect is limited by the design of ranking algorithms that give high scores to documents that contain many query terms.",
        "Because topically related terms are far more likely to appear together in documents than are spurious terms, the correctly transcribed terms will have a disproportionately large impact on the ranking process.",
        "The highest ranked documents are thus likely to be related to the correctly transcribed terms, and to contain additional related terms.",
        "For example, a system might fail to accurately transcribe the name “Yeltsin” in the context of the (former) “Russian Prime Minister”.",
        "However, in a large contemporaneous text corpus, the correct form of the name will appear in such document contexts, and relatively rarely outside of such contexts.",

        "These results clearly demonstrate the significant utility of post-translation document expansion for English-Mandarin CLIR with Mandarin spoken documents, in contrast to pre-translation expansion.",
        "Not only do these results extend our understanding of the interactions of translation and expansion, but they contrast dramatically with prior work on translation",
        "Two main factors contribute to this contrast: first, differences between languages, and second, differences between documents and queries.",
        "The characteristics of the document and query languages play a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of pre-and post-translation document expansion.",
        "In particular, the orthography of Mandarin Chinese and the difference in writing systems between the English queries and Mandarin documents affect the expansion process.",
        "If one examines the terms contributed by post-translation expansion, one can quickly observe the utility of the enriching terms.",
        "For instance in a document about the Iraqi oil embargo, one finds the names of Tariq Aziz and Saddam; in an article about the former Soviet republic of Georgia, one finds the name of former president Zviad Gam-sakhurdia.",
        "These and many of the other useful expansion terms do not appear anywhere in the translation resource.",
        "Even if these terms were proposed by pre-translation expansion or existed in the original document, they would not be available in the translated result.",
        "These named entities are highly useful in many information retrieval activities but are notoriously absent from translation resources.",
        "For languages with different orthographies, these terms can not match as cognates but must be explicitly translated or transliterated.",
        "Thus, these terms are only useful for enrichment when the translation barrier has already been passed.",
        "In contrast, the majority of the query translation experiments that demonstrate the utility of pre-translation expansion have been performed on European language pairs that share a common alphabet, making names found at any stage of expansion available for matching as cognates in retrieval even when no explicit translation is available.",
        "Recent side experiments on pre-and post-translation query expansion on the English-Chinese pair show a similar pattern of effectiveness for post-translation expansion over pre-translation expansion (Levow et al., Under Review).",
        "A further complication is caused by the fact that Mandarin Chinese is written without white space separating words.",
        "As a result, some segmentation process must be performed to identify words for translation, even though indexing and retrieval can be performed effectively on gram units (Meng et al., 2001).",
        "This segmentation process typically relies on a list of terms that may appear in legal segmentations.",
        "Just as in the case of translation, these term lists often lack good coverage of proper names.",
        "Thus, these terms may not be identified for translation, expansion, or even transcription by an automatic speech recognition system that also depends on word lists as models.",
        "These constraints limit the effectiveness of pre-translation expansion.",
        "In post-translation expansion, however, these problems are much less significant.",
        "In English, white-space delimited terms are available and largely sufficient for retrieval (especially after stemming).",
        "Even with multi-word concepts as in the name examples above, the cooccurrence of these terms in expansion documents makes it likely that they will cooccur in the list of enriching terms as well, though perhaps not in the same order.",
        "In Chinese or other typically unsegmented languages, overlapping grams can be used as indexing or expansion units, to bypass segmentation issues, once translation has been completed.",
        "Finally, (McNamee and Mayfield, 2002) observe that pre-translation query expansion plays a crucial role in ensuring that some terms are translatable, and post-translation expansion would having nothing to operate on if no query terms translated.",
        "This is certainly true, but this problem is much more likely to arise in the case of short queries, where only a single term may represent a topic and there are few terms in the query.",
        "As documents are typically much longer, there is often more redundancy of representation.",
        "This is analogous to the observation (Krovetz, 1993) that stemming has less of an impact as documents become longer because a wider variety of surface forms are likely to appear.",
        "Thus it is more likely that some translatable form of a concept is likely to appear in a long document, even without expansion and even with a poor translation resource.",

        "We have identified a key role for post-translation expansion in CLIR language pairs where trivial cognate matching is not possible, but explicit translation or transliteration is required.",
