        "However, the principal challenges to applying LSI to large data collections are the cost of computing and storing SVD.",
        "Local analysis of the information in a set of top-ranked documents for the query is one promising way to solve the computationally demanding IR task for a large collection.",
        "To solve the computational complexity of LSI, David Hull introduced one interesting method, local LSI, for routing problems(Hull, 1994).",
        "The basic idea is: apply the SVD to a set of documents known to be relevant to the query; then all the documents in the collection can be folded into the reduced space of those relevant documents.",
        "By concentrating on the local space around the query results, we may be able to compute using flexible and efficient LSI algorithms.",
        "In this paper we put much emphasis on local dimensionality analysis of the local query regions filled with relevant documents.",
        "In ideal experimental cases, local LSI involves only the documents known to be relevant to the query.",
        "To our surprise, in most of our experiments, local LSI obtains its best IR performance using just one or two SVD dimensions.",
        "These interesting results moved us to try performing local LSI with one or two SVD dimensions on the top return sets of VSM in ad-hoc IR experiments.",
        "We found that this worked surprisingly well.",
        "In a practical setting, local LSI may be regarded as a variation of pseudo relevance feedback (RF).",
        "Therefore, the comparative results with local RF are provided in this paper as well.",
        "The experiments show that local LSI with one or two SVD dimensions can contribute to expanding the query information in a manner different from traditional local RF.",

        "Latent semantic indexing (Berry et al., 1999) is one kind of vector-based query-expansion methods that use neither terms nor documents as the orthogonal basis of a semantic space.",
        "Instead, it computes the most significant orthogonal dimensions in the term-document matrix of the corpus, via SVD, and projects documents into the low rank subspace thus found.",
        "LSI then computes semantic similarity based on the proximity among projected vectors.",
        "LSI uses SVD to factor the term-document training matrix A into three factors: A = UEVT = Udiag(�1, Q2, • • • , Qn)VT Where U = (u1, u2, ... , um) E Rm×m and V = (v1, v2, • , vn) E Rn×n are unitary matrices (i.e. UT U = I, VT V = I), whose columns are the left and the right singular vectors of A respectively, E E Rm×n is a diagonal matrix whose diagonal elements are non-negative and arranged in descending order (�1 > Q2 > • • • > Uk), and p = min (m, n).",
        "The values �1, Q2, • • • , up are known as the singular values of A, and are the square roots of the eigenvalues of AAT and AT A.Suppose the rank of A is r, then r < p and only �1 > Q2 > • • • > Qr are positive, while the remaining (p-r), if r<p, singular values are zero.",
        "In LSI retrieval, researchers are only concerned with the first r singular values of A. LSI uses the structure from SVD to obtain the reduced-dimension form of the training matrix A as its “latent semantic space.” Notation for k < r, defines the reduced-dimension form of A to be A = UEVT = Udiag(�1, Q2, • • • , Qk, 0, • • • , 0)VT .",
        "That is, Ak is obtained by discarding the r-k least significant singular values and the corresponding left and right singular vectors of A (since they are now multiplied by zeros).",
        "Then, the first k columns of U that correspond to the k largest singular values of A together constitute the projection matrix for LSI: Sim(�d, �q) = (ATk �d) • (ATk�q).",
        "Analogous to VSM, the vector representation of a document is the weighted sum of the vector representation of its constituent terms.",
        "For document vector di and query vector qi, ATk d� and AT K�q are now the LSI vector representations of that document and query, respectively, in the reduced-dimension vector space.",
        "This process is known as “folding in” documents (or queries) into the training space.",
        "Actually, LSI assumes that the semantic associations among terms can be found through this one-step analysis of their statistical usage in the collection, and they are implicitly stored in the singular vectors computed by SVD."
