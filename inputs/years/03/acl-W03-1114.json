        "The time complexity for the algorithm is O(kn), where k is bucket size and n is the number of documents.",

        "The reason of using bi-gram instead of N-gram is that our experiment mainly deals with Chinese (Big5) news.",

        "Using bi-gram, moreover, would be a more effective approach when handling other two-byte code like Japanese and Korean languages (Lee, Cho and Park, 1999).",
        "Using bi-grams instead of N-grams can reduce system resources.",
        "Since hundreds of documents are handled each time, using N-gram would be impractical.",
        "For instance, using N-grams approach for a document with M Chinese characters would extract (M-1) + (M-2)+...+[M- (N-1)] terms.",
        "This would require more time for comparison than only M-1 terms for bi-grams.",
        "We suggest using NewsML (http://www.newsml.org) in our project.",

        "The keywords, which could highly reflect the main concept of the document, would usually be given by the author of the document and stored in the <KeywordLine> tag under NewsML.",

        "We used NewsML tagged keywords for comparison.",

        "A given keyword, however, may exist in more than two Chinese characters.",
        "But in order to make easy and accurate comparison, we extracted the keywords in two Chinese characters each and compare them with the terms extracted by the bi-gram algorithm.",
        "These keywords would be more representative than those extracted by bi-gram.",
        "Thus, they would be very useful for identifying the news content.",
        "We therefore applied higher weighting to these terms.",
        "In view of this, we assign the weighting of NewsML tagged keywords ten times more than those extracted using bi-grams.",
