        "Document clustering is an aggregation of documents by discriminating the relevant documents from the irrelevant documents.",
        "The relevance determination criteria of any two documents is a similarity measure and the representatives of the documents [1,2,3,4].",
        "There are some similarity measures such as Dice coefficient, Jaccard’s coefficient, and cosine measure.",
        "These similarity measures require that the documents are represented in document vectors and the similarity of two documents is calculated from the operation of document vectors.",
        "In general, the representatives of a document or a cluster are document vectors that consist of <term, weight> pairs and the document similarities are determined by the terms and their weighting values that are extracted from the document [7,9].",
        "In the previous studies on the document clustering, we focused on the clustering algorithm, but the document",
        "representation methodology was not the important issue.",
        "Document vectors are simply constructed from the term frequency (TF) and the inverted document frequency (IDF).",
        "This representation of term weighting method starts from the precondition that terms or keywords representing the document are calculated by TF-IDF.",
        "Term weighting method by TF-IDF is generally used to construct a document vector, but we cannot say that it is the best way of representing a document.",
        "So, we suppose that there is a limitation to improve the accuracy of the clustering system only by improving the clustering algorithm without changing the document/cluster representation method.",
        "Also, document clustering requires a large amount of memory spaces to keep the representatives of documents/clusters and the similarity measures [6, 8, 10].",
        "Given N documents to be clustered, N x N similarity matrix is needed to store document similarity measures.",
        "Also, the recursive iteration of similarity calculation and reconstructing the representative of the clusters need a huge number of computations.",
        "In this paper, we propose a new clustering method that is based on the keyword weighting approach.",
        "The clustering algorithm starts from the seed documents and the cluster is expanded by the keyword relationship.",
        "The evolution of the cluster stops when no more documents are added to the cluster and irrelevant documents are removed from the cluster candidates."

        "In general, the construction of a document vector depends on the term frequency and document frequency.",
        "If keywords are determined by frequency information of the document, we are apt to generate an error that nouns are often used regardless of substance of the document and the words of a high frequency are extracted.",
        "The clustering method, which is focused on similarity calculation considers the whole words except stopwords as the representative of the document, and constitutes a document vector that is calculated by the weight value from the term frequency and document frequency.",
        "It is common that terms and their weight values represent a document and <term, weight> pairs are the unique elements of the document vector.",
        "When we construct a document vector, term frequency and document frequency are the most important features to calculate the weight of a term.",
        "As for the terms and their weight values, the weight value of a term means a ranking score just as an importance factor to the document.",
        "So, the term weighting can be seen as an evaluation of the term as a keyword or a stopword to the document.",
        "The weighting function w(t) from a term to its weight is described in expression (1).",
        "For the weighting scheme of terms, there are two points of views as the representation of a document:",

        "characterizes the document from others; (2) an importance measure as a keyword or a stopword.",
        "Frequency-based term weighting (FBW) is a statistical measure of terms in an inter-document relationship.",
        "This weighting scheme is a very efficient method for distinguishing and characterizing a document from others, and it performs well for the applications of document classification or clustering in the information retrieval system.",
        "The only evaluation measure to characterize a document in frequency-based weighting scheme is a frequency statistics, but term frequencies are not the best measures to characterize the document by terms.",
        "Another weighting scheme is a keyword-based term weighting (KBW) method that is based on the keyword importance factors in a document.",
        "It is an analytic approach that analyses the contents of a document to get a keyword list from the document.",
        "The weight value of a word is calculated by the importance factors as a keyword in a document.",
        "The weight value of a word is a combination value of keyword-weighting factors and the terms are ordered by the keyword ranking score.",
        "The ranking scores in this weighting scheme are calculated from the analysis results of the document.",
        "Keyword-based term weighting will be a good solution to overcome the limitation of the frequency-based weighting scheme.",
        "Keywords in a text are the terms that represent a document and the candidate keywords are extracted from the analysis results of the document.",
        "Keyword ranking method depends on several factors of a term such as the type of a document, the location and the role of words in a sentence or a paragraph [5].",
        "Thematic words of a document are representative terms for the document.",
        "Thematic words are extracted from a text by analysing the contents of the text, but keyword extraction depends on the type of text.",

        "Also, newspaper article contains a keyword in the title or the first part of the text.",
        "There are some clues of determining a keyword and we may classify them as word level, sentence level, paragraph level, and text level features.",

        "The part-of-speech of Korean noun is divided into common noun, compound noun, proper noun, and numeral.",
        "Syntactic or sentence-level features are the type of a phrase or a clause, sentence location, and sentence type.",
        "From the rhetoric word in a sentence, the importance of the sentence is computed and the terms in a sentence are affected by the type of a sentence.",
        "Also, the weighting scheme of a term in the subjective clause is not the equal to the same term that appeared in an auxiliary clause or in a modifying clause.",
        "Basic term weight is assigned by the type of a term and recomputed by the features that it accompanies in the text.",
