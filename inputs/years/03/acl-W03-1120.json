        "With the popularity of the Internet, more and more languages are becoming to be used for Web documents, and it is now much easier to access documents written in foreign languages.",
        "However, existing Web search engines only support the retrieval of documents which are written in the same language as the query, so the monolingual users are not able to retrieve documents written in non-native languages efficiently.",
        "Also, there might be cases, depending on the user’s demand, where information written in a language other than the user’s native language is rich.",
        "Needs for retrieving such information must be large.",
        "In order to satisfy such needs on a usual monolingual retrieval system, the user him-/herself has to manually translate the query by using a dictionary, etc.",
        "This process not only imposes a burden to the user but also might choose incorrect translations for the query, especially for languages that are unfamiliar to the user.",
        "To fulfill such needs, researches on Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR), a technique to retrieve documents written in a certain language using a query written in another language, have been active in recent years.",
        "A variety of methods, including employing corpus statistics for the translation of terms and the disambiguation of translated terms, are studied and a certain results has been obtained.",
        "However, corpus-based disambiguation methods are heavily affected by the domain of the training corpus, so the retrieval effectiveness for other domains might drop significantly.",
        "Besides, since the Web consists of documents in various domains or genres, the method for CLIR of Web documents should be independent of a particular domain.",
        "In this paper, we propose a CLIR method which employs Web directories provided in multiple language versions (such as Yahoo!).",
        "Our system uses two or more language versions of a Web directory.",
        "One version is the query language, and others are the target languages.",
        "From these language versions, category correspondences between languages are estimated in advance.",
        "First, feature terms are extracted from Web documents for each category in the source and the target languages.",
        "Then, one or more corresponding categories in another language are determined beforehand by comparing similarities between categories across languages.",

        "Approaches to CLIR can be classified into three categories; document translation, query translation, and the use of interlingual representation.",
        "The approach based on translation of target documents has the advantage of utilizing existing machine translation systems, in which more content information can be used for disambiguation.",
        "Thus, in general, it achieves a better retrieval effectiveness than those based on query translation(Sakai, 2000).",
        "However, since it is impractical to translate a huge document collection beforehand and it is difficult to extend this method to new languages, this approach is not suitable for multilingual, large-scale, and frequently-updated collection of the Web.",
        "The second approach transfers both documents and queries into an interlingual representation, such as bilingual thesaurus classes or a language-independent vector space.",
        "The latter approach requires a training phase using a bilingual (parallel or comparable) corpus as a training data.",
        "The major problem in the approach based on the translation and disambiguation of queries is that the queries submitted from ordinary users of Web search engines tend to be very short (approximately two words on average (Jansen et al., 2000)) and usually consist of just an enumeration of keywords (i.e. no context).",
        "However, this approach has an advantage that the translated queries can simply be fed into existing monolingual search engines.",
        "In this approach, a source language query is first translated into target language using a bilingual dictionary, and translated query is disambiguated.",
        "Our method falls into this category.",
        "It is pointed out that corpus-based disambiguation methods are heavily affected by the difference in domain between query and corpus.",
        "Hull suggests that the difference between query and corpus may cause bad influence on retrieval effectiveness in the methods that use parallel or comparable corpora (Hull, 1997).",
        "Lin et al.",
        "conducted comparative experiments among three monolingual corpora that have different domains and sizes, and has concluded that large-scale and domain-consistent corpus is needed for obtaining useful co-occurrence data (Lin et al., 1999).",
        "On the Web retrieval, which is the target of our research, the system has to cope with queries in many different kinds of topics.",
        "However, it is impractical to prepare corpora that cover any possible domains.",
        "In our previous paper(Kimura et al., 2003), we proposed a CLIR method which uses documents in a Web directory that has several language versions (such as Yahoo!",
        "), instead of using existing corpora, in order to improve the retrieval effectiveness.",
        "In this paper, we propose an extension of our method which takes account of the hierarchical structure of Web directories.",
        "Dumais et al.",
        "(Dumais and Chen, 2000) suggests that the precision of Web document classification could be improved to a certain extent by limiting the target categories to compare by using the hierarchical structure of a Web directory.",
        "In this paper, we try to improve our proposed method by incorporating the hierarchical structure of a Web directory for merging categories."

        "From these language versions, category correspondences between languages are estimated in advance.",
        "The preprocessing consists of the following four steps: 1) term extraction from Web documents in each category, 2) feature term extraction, 3) translation of feature terms, and 4) estimation of category correspondences between different languages.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates the flow of the preprocessing.",
        "This example shows a case that category a in language A corresponds to a category in language B.",
        "First, the system extracts terms from Web documents which belong to category a (1).",

        "Lastly, the system compares the translated feature term set of category a with feature term sets of all categories in language B, and estimates the corresponding category of category a from language B These category pairs are used on retrieval.",

        "The feature of each category is represented by its feature term set.",
        "Feature term set is a set of terms that seem to distinguish the category.",

        "In this time, system also collect term frequency of each word in each category and normalize these frequency for each category.",
        "Second, the system calculates the weights of the extracted terms using TF•ICF (term frequency • inverse category frequency).",

        "Therefore, in case that no translation candidate for a feature term exists in the feature term set of the target category, the feature term itself is checked whether it exists in the feature term set of the target category.",
        "If it exists, the feature term itself is treated as the translation of the feature term in the target category.",
