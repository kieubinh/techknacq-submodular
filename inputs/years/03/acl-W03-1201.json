        "Many researchers have used lexical networks and ontologies to mitigate synonymy and polysemy problems in Question Answering (QA), systems coupled with taggers, query classifiers, and answer extractors in complex and ad-hoc ways.",
        "We seek to make QA systems reproducible with shared and modest human effort, carefully separating knowledge from algorithms.",
        "To this end, we propose an aesthetically “clean” Bayesian inference scheme for exploiting lexical relations for passage-scoring for QA .",
        "The factors which contribute to the efficacy of Bayesian Inferencing on lexical relations are soft word sense disambiguation, parameter smoothing which ameliorates the data sparsity problem and estimation of joint probability over words which overcomes the deficiency of naive-bayes-like approaches.",
        "Our system is superior to vector-space ranking techniques from IR, and its accuracy approaches that of the top contenders at the TREC QA tasks in recent years."

        "This paper describes an approach to probabilistic inference using lexical relations, such as expressed by a WordNet, an ontology, or a combination, with applications to passage-scoring for open-domain question answering (QA).",
        "The use of lexical resources in Information Retrieval (IR) is not new; for almost a decade, the IR community has considered the use of natural language processing techniques (Lewis and Jones, 1996) to circumvent synonymy, polysemy, and other barriers to purely string-matching search engines.",
        "In particular, a number of researchers have attempted to use the English WordNet to “bridge the gap” between query and response.",
        "Interestingly, the results have mostly been inconclusive or negative (Fell-baum, 1998a).",
        "A number of explanations have been offered for this lack of success, some of which are presence of unnecessary links and absence of necessary links in the WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998b), hurdle of Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) (Sanderson, 1994) ad-hocness in the distance and scoring functions (Abe et al., 1996)."

        "Unlike IR systems which return a list of documents in response to a query, from which the user must extract the answer manually, the goal of QA is to extract from the corpus direct answers to questions posed in a natural language.",
        "An important step before answer extraction is to identify and rate candidate passages from documents which might contain the answer.",
        "The notion of a passage is somewhat arbitrary: various notions of a passage have emerged (Vorhees, 2000); For our purposes, a passage comprises consecutive sentences, or consecutive words.",
        "In contrast to IR, where linguistic resources have not been found very useful, QA has always depended on a mixture of stock lexical networks and custom ontologies (language-independent conceptual hierarchies) crafted through human understanding of the task at hand (Harabagiu et al., 2000; Clarke et al., 2001).",
        "Ontologies, hand-crafted and customized, sometimes from the WordNet itself, are employed for question type classification, relationships between places, measures, etc.",
        "The scoring (and thereby, ranking) of passages through lexical networks or ontologies is more successful in QA than in classic IR because of the nature of the QA task.",
        "Passage-scoring in QA benefits from indirect matches through an ontology.",

        "For the former task, most systems use traditional IR engines coupled with ad-hoc query expansion based on WordNet.",
        "Handcrafted knowledge bases, question/answer type classifiers and a variety of heuristics are used for the latter task.",
        "Success in QA comes at the cost of great effort in custom-designed wordnets and ontologies, and expansion, matching and scoring heuristics which need to be upgraded as the knowledge bases are enhanced.",

        "Thus we attempt to overcome the usual bottleneck of assumption of independence of words as in the naive Bayes model.",
        "The relations of question words between themselves and with words in the answer is what precisely helps in giving a joint probability that is different from a naive product of marginals.",
        "This will be illustrated in section 5.5.",

        "This problem could be at-Case 1: This example shows that the passage in figure 10 contains the correct answer to the question in figure 9 and was given rank .The interesting observation is that the words kind and type are related correctly through the WordNet to give high marginal probability to the word kind (0.557435) in the question, even though it does not occur in the answer.",

        "The reason for this is that the word dog that occurs in the answer passage is related to the word corgie in the question through WordNet as shown in figure 13.",
