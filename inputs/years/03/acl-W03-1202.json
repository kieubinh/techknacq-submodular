        "To do so, a researcher often relies on generated summaries that reflect the contents of the original document.",
        "We explore the problem of single sentence summarisation, the primary focus of this paper.",
        "Instead of identifying and extracting the most important sentence, we generate a new sentence from scratch.",
        "The resulting sentence summary may not occur verbatim in the source document but may instead be a paraphrase combining key words and phrases from the text.",
        "As a precursor to single sentence summarisation, we first explore the particular case of headline generation in the news domain, specifically English news.",
        "Although headlines are often constructed to be sensationalist, we regard headline generation as an approximation to single sentence summarisation, given that a corpus of single sentence summaries does not exist.",
        "Our system reuses words from the news article to generate a single sentence summary that resembles a headline.",
        "This is done by selecting and then appending words from the source article.",
        "This approach has been explored by a number of researchers (eg.",
        "see Witbrock and Mittal, 1999; Jin and Hauptmann, 2002) and we will describe their work further in the next section.",
        "In existing approaches, a word is selected on the basis of two criteria: how well it acts as a summary word, and how grammatical it will be given the preceding summary words that have already been chosen.",
        "The purpose of this paper is to present work which investigates the use of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) as a means of determining if a word is a good candidate for inclusion in the headline.",
        "To introduce the notion of using SVD for single sentence summarisation in this paper, we examine the simplest summarisation scenario.",
        "Thus, presently we are only concerned with single document summarisation.",
        "In addition, we limit the focus of our discussion to the generation of generic summaries.",
        "In the remainder of this paper, we describe our motivation for using SVD by describing difficulties in generating headlines in Section 2.",

        "Example 1.",
        "An example of different propositions presented in two sentences which use the same words.",
        "However, we believe that the veracity of the generated sentence, with respect to the original document, is affected by a more basic problem than variation in word order.",
        "Because words from any part of a source document can be combined probabilistically, there is a possibility that words can be used together out of context.",
        "We refer to this as Out-of-Context error.",
        "Figure 1 presents an example of a generated headline in which the adverb wrongly reports stock price movement.",
        "It also presents the actual context in which that adverb was used.",
        "Generated headline “singapore stocks shares rebound”” Actual headline: “Singapore shares fall, seen higher after holidays.” Original context of use of ‘rebound’: “Singapore shares closed down below the 2,200 level on Tuesday but were expected to rebound immediately after Chinese Lunar New Year and Muslim Eid Al-Fitr holidays, dealers said.”",
        "Out-of-Context errors arise due to limitations in the two criteria for selecting words mentioned in Section 1.",
        "While, for selection purposes, a word is scored according to its goodness as candidate summary word, word order is determined by a notion of grammaticality, modelled probabilistically using ngrams of lexemes.",
        "However, the semantic relationship implied by probabilistically placing two words next to each other, for example an adjective and a noun, might be suspect.",
        "As the name “Out-of-Context” suggests, this is especially true if the words were originally used in non-contiguous and unrelated contexts.",

        "This analysis includes a grouping of sentences based on similar word distributions, which correspond to what we will refer to here as the main themes of the document.1 By incorporating this information into the word selection criteria, the generated sentence will \"gravitate\" towards a single theme.",

        "In the analysis matrices of U, S and V, the redundant dimensions corresponding to these highly similar words might be removed, resulting in a reduced number of dimensions, r, required to represent the sentences.",
        "Of the resulting matrices, V is an indication of how each sentence relates to each theme, indicated by a score.",
        "Thus, following Gong and Liu (2001), a plausible candidate for the most important sentence is found by taking the first column vector of V (which has s elements), and finding the element with the highest value.",

        "1.",
        "Whilst using the Combined probability did lead to a significantly improved result, this increase in recall was only small.",
        "Indeed, the analysis of the agreement between the Conditional strategy and the SVD strategy indicates that the current method of combining the two probabilities is not optimal and that there is still considerable margin for improvement.",
        "2.",
        "Even though the recall of the SVD strategy was poorer by a only a few percent, the lack of improvement in recall is perplexing, given that we expected the thematic information to ensure words were used in correct contexts.",
        "There are several possible explanations, each warranting further investigation.",
        "It may be the case that the themes identified by the SVD analysis were quite narrow, each encompassing only small number of sentences.",
        "If this is the case, certain words occurring in sentences outside the theme would be given a lower probability even if they were good headline word candidates.",
        "Further investigation is necessary to determine if this is a shortcoming of our SVD strategy or an artefact of the domain.",
        "For example, it might be the case that the sentences of news articles are already thematically quite dissimilar.",
        "3.",
        "One might also question our experimental design.",
        "Perhaps the kind of improvement brought about when using the SVD probability cannot be measured by simply counting recall.",
        "Instead, it may be the case that an evaluation involving a panel of judges is required to determine if the generated text is qualitatively better in terms of how faithful the summary is to the information in the source document.",
        "For example, a summary that is more accurate may not necessarily result in better recall.",
        "Finally, it is conceivable that the SVD strategy might be more sensitive to preprocessing stages such as sentence delimitation and stopword lists, which are not necessary when using the Conditional strategy.",
        "Despite these outstanding questions, there are pragmatic benefits when using SVD.",
        "The conditional strategy requires a paired training set of summaries and source documents.",
        "In our case, this was easily obtained by using headlines in lieu of single sentence summaries.",
        "However, in cases where a paired corpus is not available for training, the SVD strategy might be more appropriate, given that the performance does not differ considerably.",
        "In such a situation, a collection of documents is only necessary for collecting bigram statistics."

        "Combining both the SVD probability and Conditional probability marginally improves recall, lending support to the intuition that thematic information may help generate better single sentence summaries.",
        "However, there are still many unanswered questions.",
        "In future work, we intend to investigate these techniques in a domain other than news text so that we can draw conclusions as to how well these strategies generalise to other genres.",
        "We also intend to conduct user evaluations to gauge the quality of the generated summaries for both the Conditional and the SVD strategies.",
        "Indeed, a user-based evaluation would be extremely helpful in determining if the thematic information provided by the SVD strategy does help improve the veracity of the generated summaries."
