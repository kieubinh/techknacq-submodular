        "HITIQA is an interactive question answering technology designed to allow intelligence analysts and other users of information systems to pose questions in natural language and obtain relevant answers, or the assistance they require in order to perform their tasks.",
        "Our objective in HITIQA is to allow the user to submit exploratory, analytical, non-factual questions, such as “What has been Russia’s reaction to U.S. bombing of Kosovo?” The distinguishing property of such questions is that one cannot generally anticipate what might constitute the answer.",
        "While certain types of things may be expected (e.g., diplomatic statements), the answer is heavily conditioned by what information is in fact available on the topic.",
        "From a practical viewpoint, analytical questions are often underspecified, thus casting a broad net on a space of possible answers.",
        "Therefore, clarification dialogue is often needed to negotiate with the user the exact scope and intent of the question."

      "text": [
        "The objective in HITIQA is to allow the user to submit and obtain answers to exploratory, analytical, non-factual questions.",
        "There are very significant differences between factual, or fact-finding, and analytical question answering.",
        "A factual question seeks pieces of information that would make a corresponding statement true (i.e., they become facts): “How many states are in the U.S.?” / “There are X states in the U.S.” In this sense, a factual question usually has just one correct answer that can generally, be judged for its truthfulness.",
        "By contrast, an analytical question is when the “truth” of the answer is more a matter of opinion and may depend upon the context in which the question is asked.",
        "Answers to analytical questions are rarely unilateral, indeed, a mere “correct” answer may have limited value, and in some cases may not even be determinate (“Which college is the best?”, “How do I stop my baby’s crying?”).",
        "Instead, answers to analytical questions are often judged as helpful, or useful, or satisfactory, etc.",
        "“Technically correct” answers (e.g., “feed the baby milk”) may be considered as irrelevant or at best unresponsive.",
        "The distinction between factual and analytical questions depends primarily on the intention of the person who is asking, however, the form of a question is often indicative of which of the two classes it is more likely to belong to.",
        "Factual questions can be classified into a number of syntactic formats (“question typology”) that aids in automatic processing.",
        "Factual questions display a fairly distinctive “answer type”, which is the type of the information piece needed to fulfill the statement.",
        "Recent automated systems for answering factual questions deduct this expected answer type from the form of the question and a finite list of possible answer types.",
        "For example, “Who was the first man in space” expects a “person” as the answer, while “How long was the Titanic?” expects some length measure as an answer, probably in yards and feet, or meters.",
        "This is generally a very good strategy, that has been exploited successfully in a number of automated QA systems that appeared in recent years, especially in the context of TREC QA1 evaluations (Harabagiu et al., 2000; Hovy et al., 2000; Prager at al., 2001).",
        "This process is not easily applied to analytical questions.",
        "This is because the type of an answer for analytical questions cannot always be anticipated due to their inherently exploratory character.",
        "In contrast to a factual question, an analytical question has an unlimited variety of syntactic forms with only a loose connection between their syntax and the expected answer.",
        "Given the unlimited potential of the formation of analytical questions, it would be counter-productive to restrict them to a limited number of question/answer types.",
        "Even finding a non-strictly factual answer to an otherwise simple question about Titanic length (e.g., “two football fields”) would push the limits of the answer-typing approach.",
        "Therefore, the formation of an answer should instead be guided by the topics the user is interested in, as recognized in the query and/or through the interactive dialogue, rather than by a single type as inferred from the query in a factual system.",
        "This paper argues that the semantics of an analytical question is more likely to be deduced from the information that is considered relevant to the question than through a detailed analysis of their particular form.",
        "While this may sound circular, it needs not be.",
        "Determining “relevant” information is not the same as finding an answer; indeed we can use relatively simple information retrieval methods (keyword matching, etc.)",
        "to obtain perhaps 50 or 100 “relevant” documents from a database.",
        "This gives us an initial answer space to work on in order to determine the scope and complexity of the answer.",
        "In our project, we use structured templates, which we call frames to map out the content of pre-retrieved documents, and subsequently to delineate the possible meaning of the question (Section 6)."

        "Again, given the available resources, this is the best the system can do under the circumstances.",
        "Therefore, we may as well consider this collection of retrieved texts (the Retrieved Set) as the meaning of the question as understood by the system.",
        "This is a fair assessment: the better our search capabilities, the closer this set would be to what the user may accept as an answer to the question.",
        "We can do better, however.",
        "We can perform automatic analysis of the retrieved set, attempting to uncover if it is a fairly homogenous bunch (i.e., all texts have very similar content), or whether there are a number of diverse topics represented there, somehow tied together by a common thread.",

        "We can do better still.",
        "We can measure how well each of the topical groups within the retrieved set is “matching up” against the question.",
        "This is accomplished through a framing process described later in this paper.",
        "The outcome of the framing process is twofold: firstly, the alternative interpretations of the question are ranked within 3 broad categories: on-target, near-misses and outliers.",
        "Secondly, salient concepts and attributes for each topical group are extracted into topic frames.",

        "Typically three to six clusters are generated out of the top 50 documents, which may yield as many as 1000 passages.",

        "A list of topic labels is assigned to each cluster.",

        "If a match with the key phrases from the question cannot be obtained, Wordnet is consulted to see if a common ancestor can be found.",

      "text": [
        "In HITIQA we use a text framing technique to delineate the gap between the meaning of the user’s question and the system “understanding” of this question.",
        "The framing is an attempt to impose a partial structure on the text that would allow the system to systematically compare different text pieces against each other and against the question, and also to communicate with the user about this.",
        "In particular, the framing process may uncover topics and themes within the retrieved set which the user has not explicitly asked for, and thus may be unaware of their existence.",
        "Nonetheless these may carry important information – the NEAR-MISSES in Figure 2.",
        "In the current version of the system, frames are fairly generic templates, consisting of a small number of attributes, such as LOCATION, PERSON, COUNTRY, ORGANIZATION, etc.",
        "Future versions of HITIQA will add domain specialized frames, for example, we are currently constructing frames for the Weapons Non-proliferation Domain.",
        "Most of the frame attributes are defined in advance, how",
        "ever, dynamic frame expansion is also possible.",
        "Each of the attributes in a frame is equipped with an extractor function which specializes in locating and extracting instances of this attribute in the running text.",
        "The extractors are implemented using information extraction utilities which form the kernel of Sheffield’s GATE2 system.",
        "We have modified GATE to separate organizations into companies and other organizations, and we have also expanded by adding new concepts such as industries.",
        "Therefore, the framing process resembles strongly the template filling task in information extraction (cf. MUC3 evaluations), with one significant exception: while the MUC task was to fill in a template using potentially any amount of source text (Humphreys et al., 1998), the framing is essentially an inverse process.",
        "In framing, potentially multiple frames can be associated with a small chunk of text (a passage or a short paragraph).",
        "Furthermore, this chunk of text is part of a cluster of very similar text chunks that further reinforce some of the most salient features of these texts.",
        "This makes the frame filling a significantly less error-prone task – our experience has been far more positive than the MUC evaluation results may indicate.",
        "This is because, rather than trying to find the most appropriate values for attributes from among many potential candidates, we in essence fit the frames over small passages4.",
        "Therefore, data frames are built from the retrieved data, after clustering it into several topical groups.",
        "Since clusters are built out of small text passages, we associate a frame with each passage that serves as a seed of a cluster.",
        "We subsequently merge passages, and their associated frames whenever anaphoric and other cohesive links are detected.",
        "A very similar process is applied to the user’s question, resulting in a Goal Frame which can be subsequently compared to the data frames obtained from retrieved data.",
        "For example, the Goal Frame generated from the question, “How has pollution in the Black Sea affected the fishing industry, and",
        "The data frames are then compared to the Goal Frame.",
        "We pay particular attention to matching the topic attributes, before any other attributes are considered.",
        "If there is an exact match between a Goal Frame topic and the text being used to build the data frame, then this becomes the data frame’s topic as well.",
        "If more than one match is found, the subsequent matches become the subtopics of the data frame.",
        "On the other hand, if no match is possible against the Goal Frame topic, we choose the topic from the list of the Wordnet generated hy-pernyms.",
        "An example data frame generated from the text retrieved in response to the query about the Black Sea is shown in Figure 4.",

        "The clarification dialogue is when the user and the system negotiate the task that needs to be performed.",
        "We can call this a “triaging stage”, as opposed to the actual problem solving stage (point 3 above).",
        "In practice, these two stages are not necessarily separated and may be overlapping throughout the entire interaction.",
        "Nonetheless, these two have decidedly distinct character and require different dialogue strategies on the part of the system.",
        "Our approach to dialogue in HITIQA is modeled to some degree upon the mixed-initiative dialogue management adopted in the AMITIES project (Hardy et al., 2002b).",
        "The main advantage of the AMITIES model is its reliance on data-driven semantics which allows for spontaneous and mixed initiative dialogue to occur.",
        "By contrast, the major approaches to implementation of dialogue systems to date rely on systems of functional transitions that make the resulting system much less flexible.",
        "In the grammar-based approach, which is prevalent in commercial systems, such as in various telephony products, as well as in practically oriented research prototypes5, (e.g., DARPA, 2002; Seneff and Polifoni, 2000; Ferguson and Allen, 1998) a complete dialogue transition graph is designed to guide the conversation and predict user responses, which is suitable for closed domains only.",
        "In the statistical variation of this approach, a transition graph is derived from a large body of annotated conversations (e.g., Walker, 2000; Litman and Pan, 2002).",
        "This latter approach is facilitated through a dialogue annotation process, e.g., using Dialogue Act Markup in Several Layers (DAMSL) (Allen and Core, 1997), which is a system of functional dialogue acts.",
        "Nonetheless, an efficient, spontaneous dialogue cannot be designed on a purely functional layer.",
        "Therefore, here we are primarily interested in the semantic layer, that is, the information exchange and information building effects of a conversation.",

        "Currently, the frames are not topically specialized, and this appears the most logical next refinement, i.e., develop several (10- 30) types of frames covering different classes of events, from politics to medicine to science to international economics, etc.",
        "This is expected to increase the accuracy of the dialogue as is the interactive visualization which is also under development.",
        "Answer generation will involve fusion of information on the frame level, and is currently in an initial phase of implementation."
