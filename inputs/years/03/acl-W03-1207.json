        "There are four manner relations in this text: (1) together is a manner adverb that modifies the verb work, (2) creating jobs is an adverbial phrase attached through a manner relation to the verb work, (3) by investing in technology is a prepositional phrase that expresses manner and attaches to the verb create, and (4) in growth and opportunity is a manner prepositional phrase that modifies the verb lead.",
