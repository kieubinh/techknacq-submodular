        "The definition of ODQA tasks at the TREC QA-Track has been revised and extended year after year.",
        "At first, ODQA followed the Passage Retrieval method as used at TREC-8.",
        "That is, the ODQA task was to answer a question in the form of strings of 50 bytes or 250 bytes excerpted from a large set of news wires.",
        "Recently, however, the ODQA task is considered to be a task of extracting exact answers to a question.",
        "For instance, if a QA system is given the question “When was Queen Victoria born?”, it should answer “1832”.",
        "Typically, QA systems have the following components for achieving ODQA: Question analysis analyzes a given question and determines the question type and keywords.",
        "Text retrieval finds the top paragraphs or documents that match the result of the question analysis component.",
        "Answer candidate extraction extracts answer candidates of the given question from the documents retrieved by the text retrieval component, based on the results of the question types.",
        "Answer selection selects the most plausible answer(s) to the given question from among the answer candidates extracted by the answer candidate extraction component.",
        "One of the most important processes of those listed above is identifying the target of intention in a given question to determine the type of sought-after answer.",
        "This process of determining the question type for a given question is usually called question classification.",
        "Without a question type, that is, the result of question classification, it would be much more difficult or even nearly infeasible to select correct answers from among the possible answer candidates, which would necessarily be all of the noun phrases or named entities in the texts.",
        "Question classification provides the benefit of a powerful restriction that reduces to a practical number of the answer candidates that should be evaluated in the answer selection process.",
        "This work develops a machine learning approach to question classification (Harabagiu et al., 2000; Hermjakob, 2001; Li and Roth, 2002).",
        "We use the Hierarchical Directed Acyclic Graph (HDAG) Kernel (Suzuki et al., 2003), which is suited to handle structured natural language data.",
        "It can handle structures within texts as the features of texts without converting the structures to the explicit representation of numerical feature vectors.",
        "This framework is useful for question classification because the works of (Li and Roth, 2002; Suzuki et al., 2002a) showed that richer information, such as structural and semantical information inside a given question, improves the question classification performance over using the information of just simple key terms.",

        "The result of the question classification, that is, the labels of the question types, can reduce the number of answer candidates.",
