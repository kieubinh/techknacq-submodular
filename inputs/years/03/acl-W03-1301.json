        "We used resources available in the FlyBase model organism database; these resources include a curated lists of genes and the articles from which the entries were drawn, together a synonym lexicon.",
        "We applied simple pattern matching to identify gene names in the associated abstracts and filtered these entities using the list of curated entries for the article.",
        "This process created a data set that could be used to train a simple Hidden Markov Model (HMM) entity tagger.",
        "The results from the HMM tagger were comparable to those reported by other groups (F-measure of 0.75).",

        "A wide range of biological databases exist, including model organism databases (e.g., for mouse3 and yeast4) as well as various protein databases (e.g., Protein Information Resource5 (PIR) or SWISS-PROT6 and interaction databases such as the Biomolecular Interaction Network Database7 (BIND).",

        "There are two approaches to entity extraction.",
        "The first requires manual or heuristic creation of rules to identify the names mentioned in text; the second uses machine learning to create the rules that drive the entity tagging.",
        "Heuristic systems require expert developers to create the rules, and these rules must be manually changed to handle new domains.",
        "Machine-learning based systems are dependent on large quantities of tagged data, consisting of both positive and negative examples.8 Figure 2 shows results from the IdentiFinder system [Bikel99] illustrating that performance increases roughly with the log of quantity of training data.",
        "Given the expense of manual annotation of large quantities of data, the challenge for the machine learning approach is to find ways of creating sufficient quantities of training data cheaply.",
        "Overall, hand-crafted systems seem to outperform learning-based systems for biology.",
        "However, it is clear that the quantities of training have been small, relative to the results reported for entity extraction in e.g., newswire [Hirschman03].",
        "There are several published sets of performance results for automatic named biological entity extraction systems.",

        "The PASTA system [Gaizauskas03] uses a combination of heuristic and machine-learned rules to achieve a higher F-measure over a larger number of classes: F-measure of 0.83 for the task of identifying 12 classes of entities involved in the description of roles of residues in protein molecules.",
        "Because they used heuristic rules, they were able to get these results with a relatively small training corpus of 52 MEDLINE abstracts (roughly 12,000 words).",
        "These results suggest that machine learning methods will not be able to compete with heuristic rules until there is a way to generate large quantities of annotated training data.",
        "Biology has the advantage that there are rich resources available, such as lexicons, ontologies and hand-curated databases.",

        "First, we believe that we can improve the quality of the underlying automatically generated data, and with this, the quality of the entity tagging.",
        "There are several things that could be improved.",
        "A morphological analyzer trained for biological text would eliminate some of the tokenization errors and perhaps capture some of the underlying regularities, such as addition of Greek letters or numbers (with or without preceding hyphen) to specify subtypes within a gene family.",
        "There can also be considerable semantic content in gene names and their formatting.",
        "For example, many Drosophila genes are differentiated from the genes of other organisms by prepending a \"d\" or \"D\", such as \"dToll\".",
        "Gene names can also be explicit descriptions of their chromosomal location or even function (e.g. Dopamine receptor).",
        "The problem of matching abbreviations has been tackled by a number of researchers [e.g. Puste-jovsky02 and Liu03].",
        "As was mentioned above, it seems that ambiguity for \"short forms\" of gene names could be partially resolved by detecting local definitions for abbreviations.",
        "It should also be possible to apply part of speech tagging and corpus statistics to avoid mis-tagging of common words, such as “to” or “and”.",
        "In the longer term, this methodology provides an opportunity to go beyond gene name tagging for Drosophila.",
        "It can be extended to other domains that have comparable resources (e.g. other model organism genome databases, other biological entities), and entity tagging itself provides the foundation for more complex tasks, such as relation extraction (e.g. using the BIND database) or attribute extraction (e.g. using FlyBase to identify attributes such as RNA transcript length, associated with protein coding genes).",
        "Second, the existence of a synonym lexicon with unique identifiers provides data for term normalization, a task of potentially greater utility to biologists than the tagging of every mention in an article.",
        "There are currently few corpora with annotated term normalization; using the methodology outlined here makes it possible to produce large quantities of normalized data.",
        "The identification and characterization of abbreviations and other transformations would be particularly important in normalization.",
        "By exploiting the rich set of biological resources that already exist, it should be possible to generate many kinds of corpora useful for training high-quality information extraction and text mining components."
