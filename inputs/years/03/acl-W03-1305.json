        "Using SVMs for named entity recognition, we are often confronted with the multi-class problem.",
        "Larger as the number of classes is, more severe the multi-class problem is.",
        "Especially, one-vs-rest method is apt to drop the performance by generating severe unbalanced class distribution.",
        "In this study, to tackle the problem, we take a two-phase named entity recognition method based on SVMs and dictionary; at the first phase, we try to identify each entity by a SVM classifier and post-process the identified entities by a simple dictionary look-up; at the second phase, we try to classify the semantic class of the identified entity by SVMs.",
        "By dividing the task into two subtasks, i.e. the entity identification and the semantic classification, the unbalanced class distribution problem can be alleviated.",
        "Furthermore, we can select the features relevant to each task and take an alternative classification method according to the task.",
        "The experimental results on the GENIA corpus show that the proposed method is effective not only in the reduction of training cost but also in performance improvement: the identification performance is about 79.9(Fo = 1), the semantic classification accuracy is about 66.5(Fo = 1).",
        "Knowledge discovery in the rapidly growing area of biomedicine is very important.",
        "While most knowledge are provided in a vast amount of texts, it is impossible to grasp all of the huge amount of knowledge provided in the form of natural language.",
        "Recently, computational text analysis techniques based on NLP have received a spotlight in bioinformat-ics.",
        "Recognizing the named entities such as proteins, DNAs, RNAs, cells etc.",
        "has become one of the most fundamental tasks in the biomedical knowledge discovery.",
        "Conceptually, named entity recognition consists of two tasks: identification, which finds the boundaries of a named entity in a text, and classification, which determines the semantic class of that named entity.",
        "Many machine learning approaches have been applied to biomedical named entity recognition(Nobata, 1999)(Hatzivalssiloglou, 2001)(Kazama, 2002).",
        "However, no work has achieved sufficient recognition accuracy.",
        "One reason is the lack of annotated corpora.",
        "This is somewhat appeased with announcement of the GENIA corpus v3.0(GENIA, 2003).",
        "Another reason is that it is difficult to recognize biomedical named entities by using general features compared with the named entities in newswire articles.",
        "In addition, since nonentity words are much more than entity words in biomedical documents, class distribution in the class representation combining a B/I/O tag with a semantic class C is so severely unbalanced that it costs too much time and huge resources, especially in SVMs training(Hsu, 2001).",
        "Therefore, Kazama and his colleagues tackled the problems by tuning SVMs(Kazama, 2002).",
        "They splitted the class with unbalanced class distribution into several subclasses to reduce the training cost.",
        "In order to solve the data sparseness problem, they explored various features such as word cache features and HMM state features.",
        "According to their report, the word cache and HMM state features made a positive effect on the performance improvement.",
        "But, not separating the identification task from the semantic classification, they tried to classify the named entities in the integrated process.",
        "By the way, the features for identifying the biomedical entity are different from those for semantically classifying the entity.",
        "For example, while orthographical characteristics and a part-of-speech tag sequence of an entity are strongly related to the identification, those are weakly related to the semantic classification.",
        "On the other hand, context words seem to provide useful clues to the semantic classification of a given entity.",
        "Therefore, we will separate the identification task from the semantic classification task.",
        "We try to select different features according to the task.",
        "This approach enables us to solve the unbalanced class distribution problem which often occurs in a single complicated approach.",
        "Besides, to improve the performance, we will post-process the results of SVM classifiers by utilizing the dictionary.",
        "That is, we adopt a simple dictionary lookup method to correct the errors by SVMs in the identification phase.",
        "Through some experiments, we will show how separating the entity recognition task into two subtasks contributes to improving the performance of biomedical named entity recognition.",
        "And we will show the effect the hybrid approach of the SVMs and the dictionary-lookup."

        "We divide the named entity recognition into two subtasks, the identification task which finds the regions of the named entities in a text and the semantic classification which determines the semantic classes of them.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates the proposed method, which is called two-phase named entity recognition method.",
        "The identification task is formulated as classification of each word into one of two classes, T or O that represent region information.",
        "The region information is encoded by using simple T/O representation: T means that current word is a part of a named entity, and O means that the word is not in a named entity.",
        "With the representation, we need only one binary SVM classifier of two classes, T, O.",
        "The semantic classification task is to assign one of semantic classes to the identified entity.",

        "The classes needed to be classified are just only the N semantic classes.",
        "Note that the number of total classes, N + 1 is remarkably small compared with the number, 2N + 1 required in the complicated recognition approaches in which a class is represented by combining a region information B/I/O with a semantic class C. It can considerably reduce workload in the named entity recognition.",
        "Especially when using SVMs, the number of classes is very critical to the training in the aspect of training time and required resources.",

        "In contrast, the proposed approach requires (N x O(Lentities)) + O(Lwords).",
        "Here, O(Lwords) stands for the number of words in a training corpus and O(Lentities) for the number of entities.",
        "It is a considerable reduction in the training cost.",
        "Ultimately, it affects the performance of the entity recognizer.",
        "To achieve a high performance of the defined tasks, we use SVM(Joachims, 2002) as a machine learning approach which has showed the best performance in various NLP tasks.",
        "And we post-process the classification results of SVMs by utilizing a dictionary.",
        "Figure 2 outlines the proposed two-phase named entity recognition system.",
        "At each phase, each classifier with SVMs outputs the class of the best score.",
        "For classifying multi-classes based on a binary classifier SVM, we use the one-vs-rest classification method and the linear kernel in both tasks.",
        "Furthermore, for correcting the errors by SVMs, the entity-word dictionary constructed from a training corpus is utilized in the identification phase.",
        "The dictionary is searched to check whether the boundary words of an identified entity were excluded or not because the boundary words of an entity might be excluded during the entity identification.",
