        "5) Out of our expectation, the use of Fsvt decreases both precision and recall, which may be explained as the present and past participles of some special verbs often play the adjective-like roles inside biomedical NEs, such as IL10-inhibited lymphocytes.",
        "From Table 8, it can be found that the abbreviation recognition method slightly improves the performance by 0.5 F-measure.",
        "The probable reason is that the recognition of abbreviation relies too much on the recognition of its full form.",
        "Once the full form is wrongly classified, the abbreviation and the forthcoming ones throughout the document are wrong altogether.",
        "In the near future, the predefined abbreviation dictionary may be incorporated to enhance the decision of NE class.",
