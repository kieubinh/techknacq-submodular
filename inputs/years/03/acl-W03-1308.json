        "With the rapid growth in the number of published papers in the scientific fields such as medicine there has been growing interest in the application of Information Extraction (IE), (Thomas et al., 1999) (Craven and Kumlien, 1999), to help solve some of the problems that are associated with information overload.",
        "IE can benefit the medical sciences by enabling the automatic extraction of facts related to prototypical events such as those contained in patient records or research articles regarding molecular processes and their affect on human health.",
        "These facts can then be used to populate databases, aid in searching or document summarization and a variety of tasks which require the computer to have an intelligent understanding of the contents inside a document.",
        "Our aim here is to show a state of the art method for identifying and classifying technical terminology.",
        "This task is an extension of the named entity task defined by the DARPA-sponsored Message Understanding Conferences (MUCs) (MUC, 1995) and is aimed at acquiring the shallow semantic building blocks that contribute to a high level understanding of the text.",
        "Although our study here looks at shallow semantics that can be captured using IE our basic goal is to join this with deep semantic representations so that computers can obtain a full understanding of the facts in a text using logical inference and reasoning.",
        "The scenario is that human experts will create taxonomies and axioms (ontologies) and by providing a small set of annotated examples, machine learning can take over the role of instance capturing though information extraction technology.",
        "Recent studies into the use of supervised learning-based models for the named entity task have shown that models based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) (Bikel et al., 1997), and decision trees (Sekine et al., 1998), and maximum entropy (Borth-wick et al., 1998) are much more generalisable and adaptable to new classes of words than systems based on hand-built patterns (including wrappers) and domain specific heuristic rules such as (Herzig and Johns, 1997).",
        "The method we use is based on support vector machines (SVMs)(Vapnik, 1995), a state of the art model that has achieved new levels of performance in many classification tasks.",
        "In previous work we have shown SVMs to be superior to several other commonly used machine learning methods for named entity in previous experiments such as HMMs and C4.5 (citations omitted).",
        "This paper explores the underlying SVM model and shows through detailed empirical analysis the key features and parameter settings.",
        "To show the application of SVMs to term extraction in unstructured texts related to the medical sciences we are using a collection of abstracts from PubMed’s MEDLINE (MEDLINE, 1999).",
        "The MEDLINE database is an online collection of abstracts for published journal articles in biology and medicine and contains more than nine million articles.",
        "The collection we use in our tests is a controlled subset of MEDLINE obtained using three search keywords in the domain of molecular biology.",
        "From the retrieved abstracts 100 were randomly chosen for annotation by a human expert according to classes in a small top-level ontology.",
        "In the remainder of this paper in Section (2) we outline the background to the task and the data set we are using; in Section (3) we described the basic advantages of SVMs and the formal model we are using as well as implementation specific issues such as the choice of feature set and report experimental results.",

        "The names that we are trying to extract fall into a number of categories that are outside the definitions used for the traditional named-entity task used in MUC.",
        "For this reason we consider the task of term identification and classification to be an extended named entity task (NE+) in which the goal is to find types as well as individuals and where the term classes belong to an explicitly defined ontology.",
        "The use of an ontology allows us to associate human-readable terms in the domain with a set of computer-readable classes, relations, properties and axioms (Gruber, 1993).",
        "The particular difficulties with identifying and classifying terms in scientific and technical domains are the size of the vocabulary (Lindberg et al., 1993), an open growing vocabulary (Lovis et al., 1995), irregular naming conventions as well as extensive crossover in vocabulary between named entity classes.",
        "The irregular naming arises in part because of the number of researchers and practitioners from different fields who are working on the same knowledge discovery area as well as the large number of entities that need to be named.",
        "Despite the best efforts of major journals to standardize the terminology, there is also a significant problem with synonymy so that often an entity has more than one name that is widely used.",
        "In molecular biology for example class crossover of terms may arise because many DNA and RNA are named after the protein with which they transcribe.",
        "This semantic ambiguity which is dependent on often complex contextual conditions is one of the main reasons why we need learnable models and why it is difficult to reuse existing term lists and vocabularies such as MeSH(NLM, 1997), UMLS (Lindberg et al., 1993) or those found in databases such as Swis-sProt (Bairoch and Apweiler, 1997).",
        "An additional obstacle to reuse is that the classification scheme used within an existing thesaurus or database may not be the same as the one in the users’ ontology which may change from time to time as the consensus view of the structure of knowledge is refined.",
        "Our work has focussed on identifying names belonging to the classes shown in Table 1 which are all taken from the domain of molecular biology.",
        "Example sentences from a marked up abstract are given in Figure 1.",
        "The ontology (Tateishi et al., 2000) that underlies this classification scheme describes a simple top-level model which is almost flat except for the source class which shows places where genetic activity occurs and has a number of subtypes.",
        "Further discussion of our use of deep semantic structures in the ontology is given elsewhere1 and we will now focus our attention on the machine learning model used to capture low level semantics.",
        "The training set we used in our experiments called Bio1 consists of 100 MEDLINE abstracts, marked up in XML by a doctoral-qualified domain expert",
        "families, complexes and substructures.",
        "DNA 358 DNAs, DNA groups, regions and genes RNA 30 RNAs, RNA groups, regions and genes SOURCE.cl 93 cell line SOURCE.ct 417 cell type",
        "for the name classes given in Table 1.",
        "The number of named entities that were marked up by class are also given in Table 1 and the total number of words in the corpus is 29940.",

        "The kernel function k requires the evaluation of a dot product",
        "Clearly the complexity of data being classified determines which particular kernel should be used and of course more complex kernels require longer training times.",

        "where b E R is the bias and the Lagrange parameters ai (ai > 0) are estimated using quadratic optimization to maximize the following function",
        "for i = 1, ... , m. C is a constant that controls the ratio between the complexity of the function and the number of misclassified training examples.",
        "The number of parameters to be estimated in a therefore never exceeds the number of examples.",
        "The influence of ai basically means that training examples with ai > 0 define the decision function (the support vectors) and those examples with ai = 0 have no influence, making the final model very compact and testing (but not training) very fast.",
        "The point x is classified as positive (or negative) if f (x) > 0 (or f (x) < 0).",
        "The kernel function we explored in our experiments was the polynomial function k(xi,xj) = (xi • xj + 1)d for d = 2 which was found to be the best by (Takeuchi and Collier, 2002).",
        "Once input vectors have been mapped to the feature space the linear discrimination function which is found is the one which gives the maximum the geometric margin between the two classes in the feature space.",
        "Besides efficiency of representation, SVMs are known to maximize their generalizability, making them an ideal model for the NE+ task.",
        "Generalizability in SVMs is based on statistical learning theory and the observation that it is useful sometimes to misclassify some of the training data so that the margin between other training points is maximized.",
        "This is particularly useful for real world data sets that often contain inseparable data points.",
        "We implemented our method using the Tiny SVM package from NAIST2 which is an implementation of Vladimir Vapnik’s SVM combined with an optimization algorithm (Joachims, 1999).",
