        "It appears that the class of clinical modifiers consists primarily of adjectives that provide specific information regarding condition and are distributed on a scale.",

        "The expected outcome of this study is to obtain a better characterization of adjectival modification in biomedical phrases of various origins, in order to fully take advantage of this phenomenon in applications such as the automatic construction of terminology and ontology resources and the retrieval of clinical documents."

      "text": [
        "Adjectival modification as well as lexical semantics of adjectives has been studied extensively in the linguistic and NLP literature.",
        "Most approaches have been directed at creating adjective taxonomies and other ways of classifying and representing adjectives according to their properties and function.",
        "Raskin and Niernburg (1995) provide a comprehensive overview of the various approaches that have been taken to description, classification and representation of adjectives.",
        "From the NLP standpoint, Fellbaum (1993) partitions adjectives in WordNet® 1 into two large classes: descriptive and relational.",
        "Descriptive adjectives “ascribe a value of an attribute to a noun” (p.27) (i.e., big child) while relational adjectives are usually derived from and are somehow associated with a noun (i.e., musical child).",
        "Another prominent distinction has to do with whether an adjective can express continuous (scalar) or discrete (non-scalar) values.",
        "Raskin and Niernburg (1996) point out that for text meaning representation for computational semantics, the most important distinction to make is between scalar and non-scalar.",
        "They also present a method for incorporating the semantics of the modifier adjective into the semantics of the modified noun by representing nouns as frames with elements such as ATTRIBUTE _SIZE than can be filled in by the semantic content of the modifying adjectives.",
        "The major contribution of this study is to explore adjectival modification across two genres in the biomedical domain.",
        "Our approach is essentially practical and oriented towards applied perspectives."

        "Figure 1 illustrates the sequence of methods used for extracting adjectives from the original noun phrases.",
        "It also presents the number of phrases present before and after each of the four steps detailed below.",
        "Step 1.",
        "Syntactic analysis The phrases in our bibliographic and clinical samples were then submitted to an underspecified syntactic analysis described by Rindflesch et al.",
        "(2000) that draws on a stochastic tagger (see (Cutting et al., 1992) for details) as well as the SPECIALIST Lexicon5, a large syntactic lexicon of both general and medical English that is distributed with the UMLS.",
        "Although not perfect, this combination of resources effectively addresses the phenomenon of part-of-speech ambiguity in English.",
        "The resulting syntactic structure identifies the head and modifiers for the noun phrase analyzed.",
        "Each modifier is also labeled as being adjectival, adverbial, or nominal.",
        "Although all types of modification in the simple English noun phrase were labeled, only adjectives and nouns were selected for further analysis in this study.",
        "For example, the phrase abnormal esophageal motility study was analyzed as: [[mod([abnormal,adj]), mod([esophageal,adj]), mod([motility,noun]), head([study,noun])]] The result of the syntactic analysis was used to select the noun phrases suitable for studying the adjectival modification phenomenon, i.e., phrases having the following structure: (adj+, noun*, head).",
        "The phrase is required to start with an adjectival modifier, possibly followed by other adjectives and end with a head noun, possibly preceded by other nouns.",
        "This specification excludes both simple phrases (e.g., one isolated noun) and complex phrases, not suitable for our analysis.",
        "Step 2.",
        "Normalizing the head noun In order to compare phrases across corpora, we normalized the head noun for inflectional variation in each noun phrase.",
        "As a result, the two noun phrases cerebrovascular accident (in MAYO) and cerebrovascular accidents (in MEDLINE) are considered equivalent.",
        "When both the singular and the plural form of a phrase appear in the same corpus, only the singular form is considered for further processing.",
        "In practice, to normalize head nouns, we used the program lvg6, developed at NLM and distributed with the UMLS.",
        "When adjectives are identified in a phrase O, a set of demodified phrases {T1, T2,...,Tn} is created by removing from phrase O any combinations of adjectival modifiers found in it.",
        "While the structure of the demodified phrases remains syntactically correct, the semantics of some phrases may be anomalous, especially when adjectives other than the leftmost are removed.",
        "Since most of them are semantically valid, we found it convenient to keep all demodified phrases for further analysis.",
        "De-modified phrases with incorrect semantics will be filtered out later in the experiment, since they will appear with a lower frequency.",
        "The number of demodified phrases derived from a given phrase is 2m – 1, m being the number of adjectives in the phrase.",
        "For example, the phrase acute respiratory infection syndrome starts with the two adjectival modifiers acute and respiratory, so that the following three demodified phrases are generated respiratory infection syndrome, acute infection syndrome, and infection syndrome.",

        "These represent a significant subdomain of clinical medicine, yet are small enough to be able to perform at least a somewhat detailed analysis.",
        "All phrases, original and demodified, were mapped to the UMLS Metathesaurus by first attempting an exact match between phrases and Metathesaurus concepts.",
        "If an exact match failed, normalization was then attempted.",
        "This process makes the input and target terms potentially compatible by eliminating such inessential differences as inflection, case and hyphen variation, as well as word order variation.",
        "From the phrases mapping to some concept in the UMLS, we selected those for which the semantic category of the concept mapped to corresponded to the subdomains of interest.",
        "In practice, for a phrase to be considered a procedure, it had to map to a UMLS concept and the semantic type of this concept had to belong to the semantic group Procedures.",
        "The same principle was used for selecting disorders, using the semantic group Disorders.",
        "For example, the demodified phrase arthroscopic surgery (derived from decom-pressive arthroscopic surgery) is considered a procedure because it maps, as a synonym, to the concept Surgical Procedures, Arthroscopic, whose semantic group is Procedures.",
