        "If being ‘man’ presupposes being ‘human being’, then what (ex.1) means is that all objects falling under the category (or the set) of ‘man’ also fall under ‘human being’, so (ex.1) must be true a priori.",
        "In the same way, (ex.2) means that all objects falling under ‘man’ also fall under ‘wolf’, and this must be false, a contradictory expression.",
        "But we can easily imagine some situations where (ex.2) would be meaningful.",
        "EXAMPLE: Sue went to a party.",
        "Her friend, Pam introduced Ian to her because she knew Sue had broken up recently, and she had a belief that Sue should have a new partner.",
        "Sue enjoyed the conversation with him and found him very attractive.",
        "Ian appeared to feel the same way.",
        "When Sue took her leave, Ian offered a lift for her.",
        "Pam, who was watching out for them, winked and said ‘Sue, “man is a wolf’’, you know’.",
        "In this example, Pam’s uttering ‘man is a wolf’ does not seem contradictory.",
        "It is very natural and looks meaningful even though it may admit several interpretations.",
        "Therefore, this kind of sentence can be meaningful in our everyday usage.",
        "But uttering a contradictory expression is a deviation from our general understanding about language use.",
        "The utterer’s intentions as to why such a deviation is made, its intended effects and the conditions to materialize the intended effects: these have been the objective of the study of metaphor in the tradition of rhetoric.",
        "Metaphor has been regarded as a part of rhetoric.",
        "But if we focus on the fact that it uses ‘utterer’ and ‘use’ as its items, it may be natural to regard rhetoric as a part in pragmatics in the trichotomy of syntax, semantics and pragmatics in the late 20th century linguistic paradigm.",
        "In the first section, I will examine the pragmatic approach, Aristotle and Davidson, and make clear that these are not enough to present what metaphor means, and we need to choose a semantic approach.",
        "Richards, who opened the new path to semantics, introduced the idea of ‘tension’.",
        "In the tradition of rhetoric, metaphor had been thought to have ‘two thoughts in a sentence’2 (Richards).",
        "Richards explained the special property that metaphorical expression has and normal expression does not, is in the tension, which is born between these two thoughts in one expression.",
        "What Richards calls ‘tension’ is the interaction of meanings between literal meaning and metaphorical meaning in an expression.",
        "This ‘tension’, which cannot be explained by a pragmatic approach, is the foundation of the semantic approach lead by Richards and Black.",
        "However, even semantic approach had failed to explain ‘tension’ completely.",
        "It is because major semantics based on the Tarskian truth definition state the meaning of a sentence is only one.",
        "‘Tension’ needs to have more than two meanings in a sentence by definition.",
        "Existing GTS uses mainly zero-sum games.",
        "The equilibrium is corresponded to the meaning of a sentence, so each sentence has one meaning.",
        "This does not meet the condition of meaning that we demand for the semantics of metaphor in the line of Richards’ idea.",
        "The coordination problem game is a type of game which Lewis analyses as a part of this theory of convention (Lewis, 1961).",
        "There must be at least more than two equilibria in the game by definition.",
        "If we apply this game as a model of meaning in GTS, those equilibria can correspond to the plural meanings in a metaphorical expression.",
        "This conclusion promises us a simple model of the complex state of meanings in figurative language."
