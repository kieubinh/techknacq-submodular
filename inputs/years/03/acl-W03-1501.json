        "In the past, named entity extraction mainly focuses on general domains and is employed to various applications such as information retrieval (Chen, Ding and Tsai, 1998), question-answering (Lin, et al., 2001), and so on.",

        "In Lin and Chen’s approach, both Chinese name and English candidates will be transformed into a canonical form in terms of International Phonetic Alphabets.",
        "Similarity computation among Chinese query term and English candidates are done on phoneme level.",
        "That is an expensive operation.",
        "Hopefully, the type of Chinese named entity will help to narrow down the number of candidate."

        "This paper proposes corpus-based approaches to extract the formulation rules and the translation/ transliteration rules among multilingual named entities.",

        "The modified tf×idf scheme deals with the issues of abbreviation and compound keyword at a distance.",
        "Since the corpora are already phrase-aligned, the mined rules cover at least a significant number of instances.",
        "That is, they seem to be significant, but further evaluation is needed.",
        "Two types of evaluation are being conducted, i.e., direct and indirect approaches.",
        "In the former, we will partition the corpora into two parts, one for training and the other one for testing.",
        "In the latter, we are integrating our method in a cross language information retrieval system.",
        "Given a query consisting of Chinese named entity, the Chinese formulation rules will tell us its type and lexical structures.",
        "The transformation rules show which parts should be translated and transliterated.",
        "Our previous works on phoneme transliteration is integrated.",
        "The transformation result may be submitted to an information retrieval system to access documents in another language.",
        "In the ongoing evaluation, the test bed is supported by CLEF (2003).",
        "The result will be reported in CLEF2003 after evaluation by CLEF organizer.",
        "Further applications will be explored in the future and the methodology will be extended to other types of named entities."
