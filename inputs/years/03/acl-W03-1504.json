        "There is a wide consensus about that Named Entity Recognition and Classification (NERC) are Natural Language Processing tasks which may improve the performance of many applications, such as Information Extraction, Machine Translation, Question Answering, Topic Detection and Tracking, etc.",
        "Thus, interest on detecting and classifying those units in a text has kept on growing during the last years.",
        "Previous work in this topic is mainly framed in the Message Understanding Conferences (MUC), devoted to Information Extraction, which included a NERC competition task.",
        "More recent approaches can be found in the proceedings of the shared task at the 2002 and 2003 editions of the Conference on Natural Language Learning (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002; Tjong Kim Sang and De Meulder, 2003), where several machine–learning (ML) systems were compared at the NERC task for several languages.",
        "One remarkable aspect of most widely used ML algorithms is that they are supervised, that is, they require a set of labelled data to be trained on.",
        "This may cause a severe bottleneck when such data is not available or is expensive to obtain, which is usually the case for minority languages with few pre– existing linguistic resources and/or limited funding possibilities.",
        "This is one of the main causes for the recent growing interest on developing language– independent NERC systems, which may be trained from small training sets by taking advantage of unlabelled examples (Collins and Singer, 1999; Abney, 2002), and which are easy to adapt to changing domains (being all these aspects closely related).",
        "This work focuses on exploring the construction of a low–cost Named Entity classification (NEC) module for Catalan without making use of large/expensive resources of the language.",
        "In doing so, the paper first explores the training of classification models by using only Catalan resources and then proposes a training scheme, in which a Catalan/Spanish bilingual classifier is trained directly from a training set including examples of the two languages.",
        "In both cases, the bootstrapping of the resulting classifiers is also explored by using a large unannotated Catalan corpus.",
        "The strategy used for training the bilingual NE classification models has been also applied with good results to NE recognition in (Carreras et al., 2003), a work that can be considered complementary to this one.",
        "When considering the training of bilingual models, we take advantage of the facts that Spanish and Catalan are two Romance languages with similar syntactic structure, and that – since Spanish and Catalan social and cultural environments greatly overlap – many Named Entities appear in both languages corpora.",
        "Relying on this structural and content similarity, we will build our Catalan NE classifier on the following assumptions: (a) Named Entities appear in the same contexts in both languages, and (b) Named Entities are composed by similar patterns in both languages.",
        "The paper presents an extensive experimental evaluation, giving strong evidence about the advantage of using multilingual models for training on a language with scarce resources.",
        "Additionally, the Catalan NEC models resulting from the bilingual training are easier to improve by bootstrapping on unlabelled data.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the Catalan and Spanish resources available and the feature codification of examples.",
        "Section 3 briefly describes the learning algorithms used to train the classifiers.",
        "Section 4 is devoted to the learning of NEC modules using only Catalan resources, while section 5 presents and evaluates the bilingual approach.",
        "Finally, the main conclusions of the work are summarized in section 6."

        "The atomic rules are just mappings of a single feature into a class (e.g., if suffix “lez” then PER).",
        "When learning, the atomic rule that maximally reduces the disagreement on unlabelled data between both classifiers is added to one of the classifiers, and the process is repeated alternating the classifiers.",
        "See (Abney, 2002) for a formal proof that this algorithm tends to gradually reduce the classification error given the adequate seed rules.",

        "Third, how the algorithm, presented in (Abney, 2002) for binary classification, can be extended to a multiclass problem.",
        "In order to answer these questions and gain some knowledge on how the algorithm works empirically, we performed initial experiments on the big labelled portion of the Spanish data.",
        "When it comes to view selection, we tried two alternatives.",
        "The first, suggested in (Collins and Singer, 1999; Abney, 2002), divides into one view capturing internal features of the NE, and the other capturing features of its left-right contexts (hereafter referred to as Greedy Agreement pure, or GA ).",
        "Since the contextual view turned out to be quite limited in performance, we interchanged some feature groups between the views.",

        "The latter, containing redundant and conditionally dependent features, yielded slightly better results in terms of precision–coverage trade–off.",
        "As for seed rules selection, we have tried two different strategies.",
        "On the one hand, blindly choosing as many atomic rules as possible that decide at least in 98% of the cases for a class in a small validation set of labelled data, and on the other, manually selecting from these atomic rules only those that might be valid still for a bigger data set.",
        "This second approach proved empirically better, as it provided a much higher starting point in the test set (in terms of precision), whereas a just slightly lower coverage value, presenting a better learning curve.",
        "Finally, we have approached the multiclass setting by a one–vs–all binarization, that is, dividing the classification problem into four binary decisions (one per class), and combining the resultant rules.",
        "Several techniques to combine them have been tested, from making a prediction only when one classifier assigns positive for the given instance and all other classifiers assign negative (very high precision, low coverage), to much unrestrictive approaches, such as combining all votes from each classifier (lower precision, higher coverage).",
        "Results proved that the best approach is to sum all votes from all non-abstaining binary classifiers, where a vote of a concrete classifier for the negative class is converted to one vote for each of the other classes.",
