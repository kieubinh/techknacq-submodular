        "With 4 person-days of effort, and with no previous knowledge of which language would be involved, no knowledge of the language in question once it was announced, and no training data available, we adapted the ANNIE system for Cebuano and achieved an F-measure of 77.5%."

        "The TIDES Surprise Language Exercise is a collaborative effort between a number of sites to develop resources and tools for various language engineering tasks on a surprise language.",
        "Within a month of the language being announced, resources must be collected and tools developed for tasks such as Information Extraction (IE), Machine Translation (MT), Summarisation and Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR).",
        "The aim is to establish how quickly the NLP community could build such tools in the event of a national emergency such as a terrorist attack.",
        "A dry run for the exercise took place for 10 days during March 2003, in order to see how feasible such tasks would be, how quickly the necessary data could be collected, and to test out the best working practices for communication and collaboration between participating sites.",
        "The language chosen for the dry run was Cebuano, which is spoken by 24% of the population in the Philippines, and is the lingua franca of the South Philippines.",
        "Twenty four hours before the language was announced, a bomb had exploded in Davao City (the second largest city in the Philippines), and the event classified by the President of the Philippines as a terrorist attack."

        "The Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC) at the University of Pennsylvania had previously conducted a survey of the largest 300 languages (by population), in order to establish what resources were available for each language and which languages would be potentially feasible.",
        "Their categorisation' includes factors such as whether they could find dictionaries, newspaper texts, a copy of the Bible, etc.",
        "on the Internet, and whether the language has its words separated in writing, simple punctuation, orthography and morphology, and so on.",
        "According to this categorisation, Cebuano was classed as a language which would be of medium difficulty to process - the main problems being that no large-scale translation dictionaries, parallel corpora or morphological analyser could be found.",
        "However, the language has a Latin script, is written with spaces between words, and has capitalisation similar to Western languages, all of which make processing a much easier task than for, say, Chinese or Arabic.",
        "The important points are therefore that little work has been done on the language, and few resources exist, but that the language is not intrinsically hard to process."

        "We concentrated our efforts on the task of resource development for named entity recognition, since correct entity recognition is a vital precursor to many other applications such as Machine Translation and CLIR.",
        "Robust tools for multilingual information extraction are becoming increasingly sought after now that we",
        "have capabilities for processing texts in different languages and scripts (for example, in GATE which is fully Unicode-compliant).",
        "Following previous efforts to adapt the ANNIE information extraction system (the default IE system that comes with the GATE architecture) to different languages and applications (e.g. (Maynard and Cunningham, 2003; Maynard et al., 2002), we decided to investigate whether we could adapt ANNIE to an unknown language within a very limited period of time.",
        "There are two particularly important points to note about our proposed approach.",
        "First, ANNIE is a rule-based system, which means that it does not require large amounts of training data, unlike most NE systems which rely at least partially on machine learning algorithms, such as (Bikel et al., 1999).",
        "This is a benefit since we were not likely to find suitable preexisting training data.",
        "Second, we could not guarantee that we would have a native speaker available to help us develop rules for the system.",
        "This appears initially to counteract the benefit of using a rule-based system, since how could we expect to develop rules for a language of which we had no knowledge, if we had no training data?",
        "Perhaps surprisingly, this turned out not to be a major problem, as will be explained in more detail in the following sections."

        "The rules for English (derived from training on the Wall Street Journal) would clearly not be applicable for Cebuano, so we used an empty ruleset, but we decided that many of the default heuristics might still be appropriate.",
        "The heuristics are essentially as follows:",
        "1. look up the word in the lexicon 2. if no lexicon entry found: • if capitalised return NNP • if word containes \"-\" return JJ • if word contains a digit return CD • if word ends in \"ed\" ,\"us\" ,\"ic\" ,\"ble\" , \"ive\", \"ish\", \"ary\", \"ful\", \"ical\", \"less\" return JJ • if word ends in \"s\" return NNS • if word ends in \"ly\" return RB • if word ends in \"ing\" return VBG • if none of the above matched return NN",
        "3. apply the trained rules to make changes to the assigned categories based on the context These rules make sense for Cebuano because it is unusual for Cebuano words to have endings such as \"ic\",\"ly\", \"ing\" etc.",

        "Adapting the tagger did have a number of problems, mostly associated with the fact that while the English lexicon (used for the tagger) consists only of single-word entries, the Cebuano lexicon contained many multi-word entries (such as mahitungod sa honi (musical), as shown in Figure 2).",
        "The tagger expects lexicon entries to have a single word entry per line, followed by one or more POS tags, each separated by a single space.",
        "We therefore modified the lexicon so that the delimiter between the lexical entry and the POS tag(s) was a \"#\" rather than a space, and adapted the tagging mechanism to recognise this.",
        "This enabled us to use multi-word lexical entries.",
        "As shown in Figure 2, there was also the problem that Cebuano synonyms were placed all on one line, rather than as separate entries, and that, conversely, where a Cebuano entry had more than one POS category associated with it, these had been included as separate entries.",
        "This, along with reordering the entries, adjusting the format to fit with the English lexicon and converting the POS tags to Penn Treebank-style tags, was a fairly trivial problem fixed automatically using a series of scripts."

        "Many of the Cebuano lexical entries are multi-word, and therefore multi-token (since the tokeniser delimits tokens according to white space), and therefore the entries would not match tokens found in the text and tags could not be correctly assigned.",
        "To solve this, we used a similar mechanism to that used for the English tokeniser in GATE (as opposed to the default Unicode tokeniser), which incorporates an extra processing component that joins together various tokens into one in order to deal with the problem of tagging the possessive \"'s\" as a single unit rather than as two separate ones.",
        "This is detailed in the GATE User Guide (Cunningham et al., 2002).",
        "We therefore created two additional Cebuano-specific processing resources to complement the default Unicode tokeniser, in the form of a gazetteer list and JAPE (Java Annotations Pattern Language) grammar.",
        "The gazetteer list consisted of all the multi-word entries from the Cebuano lexicon.",
        "The JAPE grammar was used to match any of these multi-word entries found in the text and combine the Token annotations (created by the tokeniser) into a single annotation in each case.",
        "This was run before the POS tagger, so that the tagger would then have as input one Token annotation per lexical entry, and would be able to generate a single POS tag as a feature on each entry.",
        "We currently have no means of evaluating the POS tagger, but initial results based on the manual annotation of Named Entities look promising (for example, proper nouns are correctly tagged).",
        "The creation of the tagger took approximately 2 person-days, and we were able to make it available to other sites within 4 days of the language being announced (we did not start work on it on day 1).",

        "For example, one site were planning some annotation projection experiments to develop taggers, and wanted output from our tagger to provide a useful reference point.",
        "Another site working on date/time tagging needed POS annotations to help them identify numbers, while those working on Machine Translation (MT) and Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) could also clearly benefit from such information.",
        "The POS tagger can only be used within GATE (which currently has thousands of users at hundreds of sites worldwide), but we were also able to offer a tagging service to the other program participants, whereby they could email us a set of texts and we would return the results of tagging as XML or HTML files within a matter of minutes - either as inline annotations or as TIPSTER-compliant standoff markup (the default GATE method), according to their preference.",

        "It is interesting to compare this work with that of (Palmer and Day, 1997), who demonstrated the large differences in languages for the NE task, but who also concluded that much of the NE recognition task can be performed with a very simple analysis of NE strings and Clearly the choice of the Cebuano language brought some important benefits for our system.",
        "We needed to make only very small changes to the tokeniser and NE grammar, and needed no modifications at all to the sentence splitter and orthomatcher components.",
        "We did not make use of any morphological analysis or parsing components.",
        "A language with a different script and/or significantly different morphology or word order would have necessitated many more modifications to the system, and clearly we would have struggled to produce such a system within the time limits without a native speaker.",
