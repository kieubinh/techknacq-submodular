        "The NER task was first introduced as Message Understanding Conference (MUC) subtask in 1995 (MUC-6).",
        "Named Entities were defined as entity names (organizations, persons and locations), temporal expressions (dates and times) and number expressions (monetary values and percentages).",
        "Compared with the entity name recognition, the recognition of temporal and number expressions is simpler.",
        "So, our research focuses on the recognition of person, location and organization names.",
        "The Multilingual NE task first started in 1995(MET-1), including Chinese, Japanese, and Spanish in that year, and continued for Chinese, Japanese in 1998(MET-2).",
        "Compared with English NER, Chinese NER is more difficult.",
        "We think the main differences between Chinese NER and English NER lie in: First, unlike English, Chinese lacks the capitalization information that plays an important role in signaling named entities.",
        "Second, there is no space between words in Chinese, and we have to segment the text before NER.",
        "However, the errors in word segmentation will affect the result of NER.",
        "Third, Different types of named entities have different structures, especially for abbreviative entities.",
        "Therefore, a single unified model can’t capture all the types of entities.",
        "Typical structures of Chinese person name (CN), location name (LN) and organization name (ON) are as follows: CN--><surname> <given name> LN--><name part>* <a salient word> ON-->{[person name] [organization name] [place name] [kernel name] } * [organization type] <a salient word> Here <>* means repeating one or several times.",
        "{} * means selecting at least one of items.",
        "Fourth, there are few openly available resources for Chinese NER.",
        "Thus we have to resort to the algorithm that doesn’t rely on large NER-tagged text corpus.",
        "Based on the above analysis, we present a hybrid algorithm that incorporating various types of human knowledge into a statistical model.",
        "The innovative points of our paper are as follows.",
        "First, the hybrid algorithm can make the best use of existing limited resources to develop an effective NER system.",
        "These resources include one-month’s Chinese People’s Daily tagged with NER tags by Peking University (which contains about two-million Chinese characters) and various types of human knowledge.",
        "Second, in order to compensate for the lack of labeled corpus, we use several types of human knowledge, such as /TONG YI CI CI LIN [Mei.J.J, et al.",
        "1983], a general location names list, the list of the salient words in location name, the list of the salient words in organization names, a Chinese surnames list, the list of Chinese characters that could be included in transliterated person names, and so on.",
        "Third, we emphasize that human knowledge and statistical information should be combined very well.",
        "For example, a general LN list and a general famous ON list are used in our system.",
        "However, we only accept words in the lists as entity candidates with a probability.",
        "Whether it is a LN or ON depends on the context.",
        "This is different from other systems which accept them as a LN or ON once the system meets them.",
        "More details refer to section 4.",
        "This paper will be organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 is the background of NER.",
        "Section 3 describes the class-based statistical baseline Chinese NER model.",
        "Section 4 describes different types of human knowledge for different named entities recognitions and how to combine them with a statistical model organically in details.",
