        "Given that, it turns out to be important to devise an effective way of facilitating manual correction and a standardized scheme for representing and storing paraphrase patterns as shared resources.",

        "Provided that the morpho-syntactic stratum be an optimal level of abstraction for representing paraphrasing/transfer patterns, one must recall that semantic-transfer approaches such as those cited above were motivated mainly by the need for reducing the complexity of transfer knowledge, which could be unmanageable in morpho-syntactic transfer.",
        "Our approach to this problem is to (a) leave the description of each transfer pattern underspecied and (b) implement the knowledge about linguistic constraints that are independent of a particular transfer pattern separately from the transfer knowledge.",
        "There are a wide range of such transfer-independent linguistic constraints.",
        "Constraints on morpheme connectivity, verb conjugation, word collocation, and tense and aspect forms in relative clauses are typical examples of such constraints.",

        "• The next frequent error type was related to the difference of meaning between near synonyms.",
        "However, this type of errors could often be detected by a model that could detect errors of verb valency and selectional restriction.",
        "Based on these observations, we concluded that the detection of incorrect verb valences and verb-complement cooccurrence was one of the most serious problems that should have preference as a research topic.",
        "We are now conducting experiments on empirical methods for detecting this type of errors (Fujita et al., 2003)."

        "This paper reported on the present results of our ongoing research on text simplification for reading assistance targeting congenitally deaf people.",
        "We raised four interrelated issues that we needed address to realize this application and presented our previous activities focuing on three of them: readability assessment, paraphrase representation and post-transfer error detection.",
        "Regarding readability assessment, we proposed a novel approach in which we conducted questionnaire surveys to collect readability assessment data and took a corpus-based empirical method to obtain a readability ranking model.",
        "The results of the surveys show the potential impact of text simplification on reading assistance.",
        "We conducted experiments on the task of comparing the readability of a given paraphrase pair and obtained promising results by SVM-based classifier induction (95% precision with 89% recall).",
        "Our approach should be equally applicable to other population segments such as aphasic readers and second-language learners.",
        "Our next steps includes the investigation of the drawbacks of the present bag-of-features modeling approach.",
        "We also need to consider a method to introduce the notion of user classes (e.g. beginner, intermediate and advanced).",
        "Textual aspects of readability will also need to be considered, as discussed in (Inui and Nogami, 2001; Siddahrthan, 2003).",
        "Regarding paraphrase representation, we presented our revision-based lexico-structural paraphrasing engine.",
        "It provides a fully expressible scheme for representating paraphrases, while preserving the easiness of handcraft paraphrasing rules by providing an extended natural language as a means of pattern editting.",
        "We have handcrafted over a thousand transfer rules that implement a broad range of lexical and structural paraphrasing.",
        "The problem of error detection is also critical.",
        "When we find a effective solution to it, we will be ready to integrate the technologies into an application system of text simplification and conduct user-and task-oriented evaluations."
