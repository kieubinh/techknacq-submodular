        "While type (1) can be dealt with using a resource such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), type (2) needs effective parsing and mapping of syntactic structures into a common deeper structure, possibly using a repository of nominalisations like NOMLEX (Meyers et al., 1998).",

        "The approach taken by QA systems is to allow a user to ask a query (formulated in natural language) and have the system search a background collection of documents in order to locate an answer.",
        "The field of Question Answering has flourished in recent years 2, in part, due to the QA track of the TREC competitions (Voorhees and Harman, 2001).",
        "These competitions evaluate systems over a common data set allowing developers to benchmark performance in relation to other competitors.",

        "Abbreviations and acronyms are another common source of inconsistencies.",
        "In such cases the parser might either fail to identify the compound as a phrase and consequently fail to parse the sentence including such items.",
        "Alternatively the parser might attempt to ‘guess’ their lexical category (in the set of open class categories), leading to an exponential growth of the number of possible syntactic parses.",
        "Not only the internal structure of the compound can be multi-way ambiguous, even the boundaries of the compounds might be difficult to detect and the parsers might try odd combinations of the tokens belonging to the compounds with neighbouring tokens.",
        "The Paraphrase Problem resides in the imperfect knowledge of users of the systems, who cannot be expected to be completely familiar with the domain terminology.",
        "Even experienced users, who know very well the domain, might not remember the exact wording of a compound and use a paraphrase to refer to the underlying domain concept.",
        "Besides even in the manual itself, unless the editors have been forced to use some strict terminology control system, various paraphrases of the same compound will appear, and they need to be identified as co-referent.",
        "However, it is not enough to identify all paraphrases within the manual, novel paraphrases might be created by the users each time they query the system.",
        "In the rest of this paper we describe first our Question Answering System (in Section 2) and briefly show how we solved the first of the two problems described above.",
        "Then, in Section 3 we show in detail how the system is capable of coping with the Paraphrase Problem.",

        "Over the past few years our research group has developed an Answer Extraction system (ExtrAns) that works by transforming documents and queries into a semantic representation called Minimal Logical Form (MLF) (Moll�a et al., 2000a) and derives the answers by logical proof from the documents.",
        "A full linguistic (syntactic and semantic) analysis, complete with lexical alternations (synonyms and hyponyms) is performed.",
        "While documents are processed in an off-line stage, the query is processed on-line.",
        "Two real world applications have so far been implemented with the same underlying technology.",
        "The original ExtrAns system (Moll�a et al., 2000b) is used",
        "to extract answers to arbitrary user queries over the Unix documentation files ( “man pages”).",
        "A set of 500+ unedited man pages has been used for this application.",
        "An on-line demo of ExtrAns can be found at the project web page.3 More recently we tackled a different domain, the Airplane Maintenance Manuals (AMM) of the Airbus A320 (Rinaldi et al., 2002b), which offered the additional challenges of an SGML-based format and a much larger size (120MB).4 Despite being developed initially for a specific domain, ExtrAns has demonstrated a high level of domain independence.",
        "As we work on relatively small volumes of data we can afford to process (in an off-line stage) all the documents in our collection rather than just a few selected paragraphs (see Figure 2).",
        "Clearly in some situations (e.g. processing incoming news) such an approach might not be feasible and paragraph indexing techniques would need to be used.",
        "Our current approach is particularly targeted to small and medium sized collections.",
        "In an initial phase all multi-word expressions from the domain are collected and structured in an external resource, which we will refer to as the TermBase (Rinaldi et al., 2003; Dowdall et al., 2003).",
        "The document sentences (and user queries) are syntactically processed with the Link Grammar (LG) parser (Sleator and Temperley, 1993) which uses a",
        "grammar with a wide coverage of English and has a robust treatment of ungrammatical sentences and unknown words.",
        "The multi-word terms from the thesaurus are identified and passed to the parser as single tokens.",
        "This prevents (futile) analysis of the internal structure of terms (see Figure 1), simplifying parsing by 46%.",
        "This solves the first of the problems that we have identified in the introduction ( “The Parsing Problem”).",
        "In later stages of processing, a corpus-based approach (Brill and Resnik, 1994) is used to deal with ambiguities that cannot be solved with syntactic information only, in particular attachments of prepositional phrases, gerunds and infinitive constructions.",
        "ExtrAns adopts an anaphora resolution algorithm (Moll�a et al., 2003) that is based on Lappin and Le-ass’ approach (Lappin and Leass, 1994).",
        "The original algorithm, which was applied to the syntactic structures generated by McCord’s Slot Grammar (McCord et al., 1992), has been ported to the output of Link Grammar.",
        "So far the resolution is restricted to sentence-internal pronouns but the same algorithm can be applied to sentence-external pronouns too.",
        "A lexicon of nominalisations based on NOMLEX (Meyers et al., 1998) is used for the most important cases.",
        "The main problem here is that the semantic relationship between the base words (mostly, but not exclusively, verbs) and the derived words (mostly, but not exclusively, nouns) is not sufficiently systematic to allow a derivation lexicon to be compiled automatically.",
        "Only in relatively rare cases is the relationship as simple as with to edit <a text> H editor of <a text> / <text> editor, as the effort that went into building resources such as NOMLEX also shows.",
        "User queries are processed on-line and converted into MLFs (possibly expanded by synonyms) and proved by refutation over the document knowledge base (see Figure 3).",
        "Pointers to the original text attached to the retrieved logical forms allow the system to identify and highlight those words in the retrieved sentence that contribute most to that particular answer.",
        "When the user clicks on one of the answers provided, the corresponding document will be displayed with the relevant passages highlighted.",
        "The meaning of the documents and of the queries produced by ExtrAns is expressed by means of Minimal Logical Forms (MLFs).",
        "The MLFs are designed so that they can be found for any sentence (using robust approaches to treat very complex or ungrammatical sentences), and they are optimized for NLP tasks that involve the semantic comparison of sentences, such as Answer Extraction.",
        "The expressivity of the MLFs is minimal in the sense that the main syntactic dependencies between the words are used to express verb-argument relations, and modifier and adjunct relations.",
        "However, complex quantification, tense and aspect, temporal relations, plurality, and modality are not expressed.",
        "One of the effects of this kind of underspecification is that several natural language queries, although slightly different in meaning, produce the same logical form.",
        "The main feature of the MLFs is the use of reifi-cation (the expression of abstract concepts as concrete objects) to achieve flat expressions (Moll�a et al., 2000b).",
        "The MLFs are expressed as conjunctions of predicates with all the variables existentially bound with wide scope.",
        "For example, the MLF of the sentence “cp will quickly copy the files” is:",
        "In other words, there is an entity x1 which represents an object of type cp and of type command, there is an entity x6 (a file), there is an entity e4, which represents a copying event where the first argument is x1 and the second argument is x6, there is an entity p3 which states that e4 is done quickly, and the event e4, that is, the copying, holds.",
        "The entities o1, o2, o3, e4, and p3 are the result of reifi-cation.",
        "The reification of the event, e4, has been used to express that the event is done quickly.",
        "The other entities are not used in this MLF, but other more complex sentences may need to refer to the reification of properties (adjective-modifying adverbs) or object predicates (non-intersective adjectives such as the alleged suspect).",
        "ExtrAns finds the answers to the questions by forming the MLFs of the questions and then running Prolog’s default resolution mechanism to find those MLFs that can prove the question.",
        "When no direct proof for the user query is found, the system is capable of relaxing the proof criteria in a stepwise manner.",
        "First, hyponyms of the query terms will be added as disjunctions in the logical form of the question, thus making it more general but still logically correct.",
        "If that fails, the system will attempt approximate matching, in which the sentence (or sentences) with the highest overlap of predicates with the query is retrieved.",
        "The (partially) matching sentences are scored and the best fits are returned.",
        "In the case that this method finds too many answers because the overlap is too low, the system will attempt keyword matching, in which syntactic criteria are abandoned and only information about word classes is used.",
        "This last step corresponds approximately to a traditional passage-retrieval methodology with consideration of the POS tags."
