        "Our general research aim is to extract the actual intentions of persons when they respond to open-ended questionnaires.",
        "These intentions include the desire to make requests, complaints, expressions of resignation and so forth, but here we focus on extracting the intention to make a request.",
        "To do so, we first have to judge whether their responses contain the intent to make a request.",
        "Therefore, as a first step, we have developed a criterion for judging the existence of request intentions in responses.",
        "This criterion, which is based on paraphrasing, is described in detail in this paper.",
        "Our assumption is that a response with request intentions can be paraphrased into a typical request expression, e.g., “I would like to ...”, while responses without request are not paraphrasable.",
        "The criterion is evaluated in terms of objectivity, reproducibility and effectiveness.",
        "Objectivity is demonstrated by showing that machine learning methods can learn the criterion from a set of intention-tagged data, while reproducibility, that the judgments of three annotators are reasonably consistent, and effectiveness, that judgments based not on the criterion but on intuition do not agree.",
        "This means the criterion is necessary to achieve reproducibility.",
        "These experiments indicate that the criterion can be used to judge the existence of request intentions in responses reliably."

        "In every aspect of society, it is necessary for us to “know what the request is.” This is because knowing what the request is plays an important role in allowing us to identify and solve problems to achieve improvements.",
        "In recent years, the spread of electronic devices such as personal computers and the Internet has allowed us to save most requests in machine-readable texts.",
        "On the basis of these texts, research and development have been conducted “to know what the request is” as an element technology in natural language processing.",
        "For example, the research includes text mining (Nasukawa, 2001) and information extraction (Tateno, 2003) for customer claims and inquiries, development of an FAQ generation support system to a call center (Yanase et al., 2002; Matsuzawa, 2002), an FAQ navigation system using Q&A stored a call center (Matsui, 2002), and the development of requirement capturing methods for extracting requests made in meetings for software development (Doi, 2003).",
        "However, “to know what the request is” means to know the intention of various people in society such as residents, users, customers and patients, and it is inadequate to extract only request expressions expressed literally in texts.",
        "For this reason, previous works are not sufficient to understand intentions.",
        "Against this background, (Inui et al., 1998; Inui et al., 2001; Inui and Isahara, 2002) have been studying how to extract and classify request intentions of respondents from responses of open-ended questionnaires (OEQs) which are accumulated requests.",

        "Response texts of OEQs are the focus of attention as data for text mining.",
        "Researchers have tried to extract various types of information from those texts (Lebart et al., 1998; Li and Yamanishi, 2001; Osumi and Lebart, 2000; Takahashi, 2000).",
        "However, they have mainly used only keywords (mostly nouns) as the basic units of extraction.",
        "If only the characteristic key words are analyzed with regard to sentences such as “Company A’s beer tastes good,” “Company A’s beer does not seem to taste good,” and “Company B’s beer tastes better than company A’s,” the attention is directed toward “company A/company B/beer/tastes/good,” and it is not possible to differentiate the meaning of the passages.",
        "Because of this, as (Toyoda, 2002) points out, text mining in the future needs to treat modality, which often changes the meaning of the sentences completely.",
        "Two separate studies (Inui et al., 1998; Morohashi et al., 1998) have tried to process texts using words like auxiliary verbs and auxiliary verb equivalents as modality information.",
        "The modality information focused on in both studies, however, is grammatical expressions that have been accepted in a previous Japanese language study.",
        "Therefore, it is not possible to mechanically interpret requests and questions displayed by respondents, speakers and writers if they don’t contain an auxiliary verb or an auxiliary verb equivalent.",
        "In Japanese language syntax, modality is defined as the intention of the writer that is represented by grammatical expressions expressed grammatically (Nitta and Masuoka ed., 1989) and typically appears in the form of particles and auxiliary verbs in the sentence structure.",
        "Although previous text mining has focused on these expressions, modality does not always appear in the forms of grammatical expressions, and other expressions are more frequently used in real world texts.",
        "Thus, processing only those grammatical expressions listed so far is not sufficient for extracting intentions, and it is necessary to have a wide coverage of modality that expresses intentions."

        "Surveyors try to know request intentions on the respondents through questionnaires, and respondents try to convey their request intentions to surveyors by responding to questionnaires.",
        "Therefore, it is important to establish a method that can extract the request intentions of the respondents based on the expressions given in the response texts.",
        "In this section, we propose a criterion to judge the existence of request intentions.",
        "First, we will analyze the request expressions deductively.",
        "Native Japanese speakers can recognize expressions such as te-hoshii (would like you to), te-moraitai (would like you to), te-kudasai (please do) and te-kure (do) as request.",
        "These are linguistically called direct request expressions",
        "(NIJLA, 1960) and able to indicate request intentions.",
        "Especially, te-hoshii is a typical request expression.",
        "In other words, these direct request expressions are a clue to understand that there is a request intended.",
        "This recognition process is equivalent to the first judgment in Fig.1, that is, “whether a response can be judged to be a request by linguistic intuition or not.” We regarded this as the first level criterion to judge request intentions.",
        "It corresponds to the first level in Fig.2, the intent of which is equal to judge whether the response includes a direct request expression or not.",
        "Second, we consider the case that a response does not contain a direct request expression.",
        "In this case, non-requests in Fig.1 may be judged as requests.",
        "For example, based on the relation with surveyors, respondents and the situation, “Guardrails should be built along sidewalks of heavily congested roads” and “Building eco-friendly roads is important” can be interpreted as “We want guardrails along the sidewalks” and “We want you to think about the environment.” However, the interpretation is due to “some” implicit criterion as shown in the second judgment in Fig. 1.",
        "As the implicit criterion depends on the judges, it is possible that the judgments differ1.",
        "This means that the results of the judgment, namely request ② in Fig. 1, are not recreated consistently.",
        "Therefore, the second judge in Fig.1 is not reproducible.",
        "Consequently we attempted to manifest the implicit criterion as an explicit criterion to judge the existence of request intentions.",
        "This manifestation is the criterion “whether a response can be paraphrased into a sentence containing te-hoshii as a typical request expression or not” as the second judge in Fig. 2.",
        "As this criterion is explicit, the judgment of the criterion does not depend on the judges and agree consistently.",
        "Therefore, the second judge in Fig.2, namely the proposed criterion is reproducible and the results of the judgment, namely the expression of request intentions in Fig.2 is recreated consistently2.",
