        "The richness of human language allows people to express the same idea in many different ways; they may use different words to refer to the same entity or employ different phrases to describe the same concept.",
        "Acquisition of paraphrases, or alternative ways to convey the same information, is critical to many natural language applications.",
        "For example, an effective question answering system must be equipped to handle these variations, because it should be able to respond to differently phrased natural language questions.",
        "While there are many resources that help systems deal with single-word synonyms, e.g., Word-Net, there are few resources for multiple-word or domain-specific paraphrases.",
        "Because manually collecting paraphrases is time-consuming and impractical for large-scale applications, attention has recently focused on techniques for automatically acquiring paraphrases.",
        "We present an unsupervised method for acquiring structural paraphrases, or fragments of syntactic trees that are roughly semantically equivalent, from aligned monolingual corpora.",
        "The structural paraphrases produced by our algorithm are similar to the S-rules advocated by Katz and Levin for question answering (1988), except that our paraphrases are automatically generated.",
        "Because there is disagreement regarding the exact definition of paraphrases (Dras, 1999), we employ that operating definition that structural paraphrases are roughly interchangeable within the specific configuration of syntactic structures that they specify.",
        "Our approach is a synthesis of techniques developed by Barzilay and McKeown (2001) and Lin and Pantel (2001), designed to overcome the limitations of both.",

        "There has been a rich body of research on automatically deriving paraphrases, including equating morphological and syntactic variants of technical terms (Jacquemin et al., 1997), and identifying equivalent adjective-noun phrases (Lapata, 2001).",
        "Unfortunately, both are limited in types of paraphrases that they can extract.",
        "Other researchers have explored distributional clustering of similar words (Pereira et al., 1993; Lin, 1998), but it is unclear to what extent such techniques produce paraphrases .1 Most relevant to this paper is the work of Barzi-lay and McKeown and the work of Lin and Pantel.",
        "Barzilay and McKeown (2001) extracted both single and multiple-word paraphrases from a sentence-aligned corpus for use in multi-document summarization.",
        "They constructed an aligned corpus from multiple translations of foreign novels.",
        "From this, they co-trained a classifier that decided whether or not two phrases were paraphrases of each other based on their surrounding context.",
        "Barzilay and McKeown collected 9483 paraphrases with an average precision of 85.5%.",
        "However, 70.8% of the paraphrases were single words.",
        "In addition, the paraphrases were required to be contiguous.",
        "Lin and Pantel (2001) used a general text corpus to extract what they called inference rules, which we can take to be paraphrases.",
        "In their algorithm, rules are represented as dependency tree paths between two words.",
        "The words at the ends of a path are considered to be features of that path.",
        "For each path, they recorded the different features (words) that were associated with the path and their respective frequencies.",
        "Lin and Pantel calculated the similarity of two paths by looking at the similarity of their features.",
        "This method allowed them to extract inference rules of moderate length from general corpora.",
        "However, the technique is computationally expensive, and furthermore can give misleading results, i.e., paths having the opposite meaning often share similar features."

      "heading": "3 Approach",
      "text": [
        "Our approach, like Barzilay and McKeown’s, is built on the application of sentence-alignment techniques used in machine translation to generate paraphrases.",
        "The insight is simple: if we have pairs of sentences with the same semantic content, then the difference in lexical content can be attributed to variations in the surface form.",
        "By generalizing these differences we can automatically derive paraphrases.",
        "Barzilay and McKeown perform this learning process by only considering the local context of words and their frequencies; as a result, paraphrases must be contiguous, and in the majority of cases, are only one word long.",
        "We believe that disregarding the rich syntactic structure of language is an oversimplification, and that structural paraphrases offer several distinct advantages over lexical paraphrases.",
        "Long distance relations can be captured by syntactic trees, so that words in the paraphrases do not need to be contiguous.",
        "Use of syntactic trees also buffers against morphological variants (e.g., different inflections) and some syntactic variants (e.g., active vs. passive).",
        "Finally, because paraphrases are context-dependent, we believe that syntactic structures can encapsulate a richer context than lexical phrases.",
        "Based on aligned monolingual corpora, our technique for extracting paraphrases builds on Lin and Pantel’s insight of using dependency paths (derived from parsing) as the fundamental unit of learning and using parts of those paths as features.",
        "Based on the hypothesis that paths between identical words in aligned sentences are semantically equivalent, we can extract paraphrases by scoring the path frequency and context.",
        "Our approach addresses the limitations of both Barzilay and McKeown’s and Lin and Pantel’s work: using syntactic structures allows us to generate structural paraphrases, and using aligned corpora renders the process more computationally tractable.",

        "For each pair of anchors, a breadth-first search is used to find the shortest path between the anchor words.",
        "The search algorithm explicitly rejects paths that contain conjunctions and punctuation.",
        "If valid paths are found between anchor pairs in both of the aligned sentences, the resulting paths are considered candidate paraphrases, with a default score of one (subjected to penalties imposed by imperfect anchor matching).",
        "Scores of candidate paraphrases take into account two factors: the frequency of anchors with respect to a particular candidate paraphrase and the variety of different anchors from which the paraphrase was produced.",
        "The initial default score of any paraphrase is one (assuming perfect anchor matches), but for each additional occurrence the score is incremented by 2 n, where n is the number of times the current set of anchors has been seen.",
        "Therefore, the effect of seeing new sets of anchors has a big initial impact on the score, but the additional increase in score is subjected to diminishing returns as more occurrences of the same anchor are encountered."

        "However, future work will most likely include a comparison of different parsers.",
        "Examination of our results show that a better notion of constituency would increase the accuracy of our results.",
        "Our algorithm occasionally generates nonsensical paraphrases that cross constituent boundaries, for example, including the verb of a subordinate clause with elements from the matrix clause.",
        "Other problems arise because our current algorithm has no notion of verb phrases; it often generates near misses such as fail ⇐⇒ succeed, neglecting to include not as part of the paraphrase.",
        "However, there are problems inherent in paraphrase generation that simple knowledge of constituency alone cannot solve.",
        "Consider the following two sentences: John made out gold at the bottom of the well.",
        "John discovered gold near the bottom of the well.",
        "Which structural paraphrases should we be able to extract?",
        "Arguably, all three paraphrases are valid, although opinions vary more regarding the last paraphrase.",
        "What is the optimal level of structure for paraphrases?",
        "Obviously, this represents a tradeoff between specificity and accuracy, but the ability of structural paraphrases to capture long-distance relationships across large numbers of lexical items complicates the problem.",
        "Due to the sparseness of our data, our algorithm cannot make a good decision on what constituents to generalize as variables; naturally, greater amounts of data would alleviate this problem.",
        "This current inability to decide on a good “scope” for paraphrasing was a primary reason why we were unable to perform a strict evaluation of recall.",
        "Our initial attempts at generating a gold standard for estimating recall failed because human judges could not agree on the boundaries of paraphrases.",
        "The accuracy of our structural paraphrases is highly dependent on the corpus size.",
        "As can be seen from the numbers in Table 1, paraphrases are rather sparse – nearly 93% of them are unique.",
        "Without adequate statistical evidence, validating candidate paraphrases can be very difficult.",
        "Although our data spareness problem can be alleviated simply by gathering a larger corpus, the type of parallel text our algorithm requires is rather hard to obtain, i.e., there are only so many translations of so many foreign novels.",
        "Furthermore, since our paraphrases are arguably genre-specific, different applications may require different training corpora.",
        "Similar to the work of Barzilay and Lee (2003), who have applied paraphrase generation techniques to comparable corpora consisting of different newspaper articles about the same event, we are currently attempting to solve the data sparseness problem by extending our approach to non-parallel corpora.",

        "The ultimate goal of our work on paraphrases is to enable the development of high-precision question answering system (cf. (Katz and Levin, 1988; Soubbotin and Soubbotin, 2001; Hermjakob et al., 2002)).",
        "We believe that a knowledge base of paraphrases is the key to overcoming challenges presented by the expressiveness of natural languages.",
        "Because the same semantic content can be expressed in many different ways, a question answering system must be able to cope with a variety of alternative phrasings.",
        "In particular, an answer stated in a form that differs from the form of the question presents significant problems: When did Colorado become a state?",
        "(1a) Colorado became a state in 1876.",
        "(1b) Colorado was admitted to the Union in 1876. Who killed Abraham Lincoln?",
        "(2a) John Wilkes Booth killed Abraham Lincoln.",
        "(2b) John Wilkes Booth ended Abraham Lincoln’s life with a bullet.",
        "In the above examples, question answering systems have little difficulty extracting answers if the answers are stated in a form directly derived from the question, e.g., (1a) and (2a); simple keyword matching techniques with primitive named-entity detection technology will suffice.",
        "However, question answering systems will have a much harder time extracting answers from sentences where they are not obviously stated, e.g., (1b) and (2b).",
        "To relate question to answers in those examples, a system would need access to rules like the following: X became a state in Y ⇐⇒ X was admitted to the Union in Y X killed Y⇐⇒ X ended Y’s life We believe that such rules are best formulated at the syntactic level: structural paraphrases represent a good level of generality and provide much more accurate results than keyword-based approaches.",
        "The simplest approach to overcoming the “paraphrase problem” in question answering is via keyword query expansion when searching for candidate answers:",
        "The major drawback of such techniques is over-generation of bogus answer candidates.",
        "For example, it is a well-known result that query expansion based on synonymy, hyponymy, etc.",
        "may actually degrade performance if done in an uncontrolled manner (Voorhees, 1994).",
        "Typically, keyword-based query expansion techniques sacrifice significant amounts of precision for little (if any) increase in recall.",
        "The problems associated with keyword query expansion techniques stem from the fundamental deficiencies of “bag-of-words” approaches; in short, they simply cannot accurately model the semantic content of text, as illustrated by the following pairs of sentences and phrases that have the same word content, but dramatically different meaning:",
        "The above examples are nearly indistinguishable in terms of lexical content, yet their meanings are vastly different.",
        "Naturally, because one text fragment might be an appropriate answer to a question while the other fragment may not be, a question answering system seeking to achieve high precision must provide mechanisms for differentiating the semantic content of the pairs.",
        "While paraphrase techniques at the keyword-level vastly overgenerate, paraphrase techniques at the phrase-level undergenerate, that is, they are often too specific.",
        "Although paraphrase rules can easily be formulated at the string-level, e.g., using regular expression matching and substitution techniques (Soubbotin and Soubbotin, 2001; Hermjakob et al., 2002), such a treatment fails to capture important linguistic generalizations.",
        "For example, the addition of an adverb typically does not alter the validity of a paraphrase; thus, a phrase-level rule “X killed Y” ,#=� “X ended Y’s life” would not be able to match an answer like “John Wilkes Booth suddenly ended Abraham Lincoln’s life with a bullet”.",
        "String-level paraphrases are also unable to handle syntactic phenomenona like passivization, which are easily captured at the syntactic level.",
        "We believe that answering questions at level of syntactic relations, that is, matching parsed representations of questions with parsed representations of candidates, addresses the issues presented above.",
        "Syntactic relations, basically simplified versions of dependency structures derived from the Link Parser, can capture significant portions of the meaning present in text documents, while providing a flexible foundation on which to build machinery for paraphrases.",

        "We have begun to experiment with relations indexing and matching techniques described above using an electronic encyclopedia as the test corpus.",
