        "We are trying to obtain paraphrases which can be used for Information Extraction (IE) systems.",
        "IE systems scan articles and retrieve specific information which is required for a certain domain defined in advance.",
        "Currently, many IE tasks are performed by pattern matching.",
        "For example, if the system receives a sentence “Two more people have died in Hong Kong from SARS,” and the system has a pattern “NUMBER people die in LOCATION” in its inventory, then the system can apply the pattern to the sentence and fill the slots, and obtain information such as “NUMBER = two more, LOCATION = Hong Kong”.",
        "In most IE systems, the performance of the system is dependent on these well-designed patterns.",
        "In natural language sentences, a single event can be expressed in many different ways.",
        "So we need to prepare patterns for various kinds of expressions used in articles.",
        "We are interested in clustering IE patterns which capture the same information.",
        "For example, a pattern such as “LOCATION reports NUMBER deaths” can be used for the same purpose as the previous one, since this pattern could also capture the casualties occurring in a certain location.",
        "Prior work to relate two IE patterns was reported by (Shinyama et al., 2002).",
        "However, in this attempt only limited forms of expressions could be obtained.",
        "Furthermore, the obtained paraphrases were limited to existing IE patterns only.",
        "We are interested in collecting various kinds of clues, including similar IE patterns themselves, to connect two patterns.",
        "In this paper, we tried to obtain more varied paraphrases.",
        "Although our current method is intended for use in Information Extraction, we think the same approach can be applied to obtain paraphrases for other purposes, such as machine translation or text summarization.",
        "There have been several attempts to obtain paraphrases.",
        "(Barzilay and McKeown, 2001) applied text alignment to parallel translations of a single text and used a part-of-speech tagger to obtain paraphrases.",
        "(Lin and Pantel, 2001) used mutual information of word distribution to calculate the similarity of expressions.",
        "(Pang et al., 2003) also used text alignment and obtained a finite state automaton which generates paraphrases.",
        "(Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002) used pairs of questions and answers to obtain varied patterns which give the same answer.",
        "Our approach is different from these works in that we used comparable news articles as a source of paraphrases and used Named Entity tagging and dependency analysis to extract corresponding expressions."

        "Our main goal is to obtain pattern clusters for IE, which consist of sets of equivalent patterns capturing the same information.",
        "So we tried to discover paraphrases contained in Japanese news articles for a specific domain.",
        "Our basic idea is to search news articles from the same day.",
        "We focused on the fact that various newspapers describe a single event in different ways.",
        "So if we can discover an event which is reported in more then one newspaper, we can hope these articles can be used as the source of paraphrases.",
        "For example, the following articles appeared in “Health” sections in different newspapers on Apr.",
        "11:",
        "1.",
        "“The government has announced that two more people have died in Hong Kong after contracting the SARS virus and 61 new cases of the illness have been detected.” (Reuters, Apr.",
        "11) 2.",
        "“Hong Kong reported two more deaths and 61 fresh cases of SARS Friday as governments across the world took tough steps to stop the killer virus at their borders.” (Channel News Asia, Apr.",
        "11)",
        "In these articles, we can find several corresponding parts, such as “NUMBER people have died in LOCATION” and “LOCATION reported NUMBER deaths”.",
        "Although their syntactic structures are different, they still convey the same single fact.",
        "Here it is worth noting that even if a different expression is used, some noun phrases such as “Hong Kong” or “two more” are preserved across the two articles.",
        "We found that these words shared by the two sentences provide firm anchors for two different expressions.",
        "In particular, Named Entities (NEs) such as names, locations, dates or numbers can be the firmest anchors since they are indispensable to report an event and difficult to paraphrase.",
        "We tried to obtain paraphrases by using this property.",
        "First we collect a set of comparable articles which reports the same event, and pull appropriate portions out of the sentences which share the same anchors.",
        "If we carefully choose appropriate portions of the sentences, the extracted expressions will convey the same information; i.e. they are paraphrases.",
        "After corresponding portions are obtained, we generalize the expressions to templates of paraphrases which can be used in future.",

      "heading": "3 Handling Problems in Real Texts",
      "text": [
        "In the previous section we described our method for obtaining paraphrases in principle.",
        "However there are several issues in actual texts which pose difficulties for our method.",
        "The first one is in finding anchors which refer to the same entity.",
        "In actual articles, names are sometime referred to in a slightly different form.",
        "For example, “President Bush” can also be referred to as “Mr.",
        "Bush”.",
        "Additionally, sometime it is referred to by a pronoun, such as “he”.",
        "Since our method relies on the fact that those anchors are preserved across articles, anchors which appear in these varied forms may reduce the actual number of obtained paraphrases.",
        "To handle this problem, we extended the notion of anchors to include not just Extended Named Entities, but also pronouns and common nouns such as “the president”.",
        "We used a simple corefer-ence resolver after Extended Named Entity tagging.",
        "Currently this is done by simply assigning the most recent antecedent to pronouns and finding a longest common subsequence (LCS) between two noun groups.",
        "Since it is possible to form a compound noun such as “President-Bush” in Japanese, we computed LCS for each character in the two noun groups.",
        "We used the following condition to decide whether two noun groups s1 and s2 are coref-erential:",
        "• if 2 G_ min(Is1I, Is2I) G_ ILCS(s1, s2)I, then s1 and s2 are considered coreferential.",
        "Here IsI denotes the length of noun group s and LCS(s1, s2) is the LCS of two noun groups s1 and s2.",
        "The second problem is to extract appropriate portions as paraphrase expressions.",
        "Since we use a tree structure to represent the expressions, finding common subtrees may take an exponential number of steps.",
        "For example, if a dependency tree in one article has one single predicate which has n arguments, the number of possible subtrees which can be obtained from the tree is 2n.",
        "So the matching process between arbitrary combinations of subtrees may grow exponentially with the length of the sentences.",
        "Even worse, it can generate many combinations of sentence portions which don’t make sense as paraphrases.",
        "For example, from the expression “two more people have died in Hong Kong” and “Hong Kong reported two more deaths”, we could extract expressions “in Hong Kong” and “Hong Kong reported”.",
        "Although both of them share one anchor, this is not a correct paraphrase.",
        "To avoid this sort of error, we need to put some additional restrictions on the expressions.",
        "(Shinyama et al., 2002) used the frequency of expressions to filter these incorrect pairs of expressions.",
        "First the system obtained a set of IE patterns from corpora (Sudo and Sekine, 2001), and then calculated the score for each candidate paraphrase by counting how many times that expression appears as an IE pattern in the whole corpus.",
        "However, with this method, obtainable expressions are limited to existing IE patterns only.",
        "Since we wanted to obtain a broader range of expressions not limited to IE patterns themselves, we tried to use other restrictions which can be acquired independently of the IE system.",
        "We partly solve this problem by calculating the plausibility of each tree structure.",
        "In Japanese sentences, the case of each argument which modifies a predicate is represented by a case marker (post-position or joshi) which follows a noun phrase, just like prepositions in English but in the opposite order.",
        "These arguments include subjects and objects that are elucidated syntactically in English sentences.",
        "We collected frequent cases occurring with a specific predicate in advance.",
        "We applied this restriction when generating subtrees from a dependency tree by calculating a score for each predicate as follows: Let an instance of predicate p have cases C = {c1, c2, ..., cn} and a function Np(I) be the number of instances of p in the corpus whose cases are I = {c1, c2, ..., cm}.",
        "We compute the score Sp (C)of the instance: Using this metric, a predicate which doesn’t have cases that it should usually have is given a lower score.",
        "A subtree which includes a predicate whose score is less than a certain threshold is filtered out.",
        "This way we can filter out expressions such as “Hong Kong reported” in Japanese since it would lack an object case which normally the verb “report” should have.",
        "Moreover, this greatly reduces the number of possible combinations of subtrees."
