        "Evaluating natural language processing applications’ output is important both for users and developers.",
        "Tasks such as sentential parsing, morphological analysis and named entity recognition are easy to evaluate automatically because the “right answer” can be defined deterministically under a specific grammar or assumed criterion.",
        "The evaluation of machine translation is not so straightforward since there are infinite ways to output similar meanings and one can not enumerate the right answers exhaustively.",
        "In spite of that, automatic translation evaluation is practically important because the evaluation is laborious work for humans and evaluation by humans tends to be arbitrary.",
        "Automatic evaluation is more reliable than human evaluation because of its consistency for the same translations.",
        "BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002b) is one of the methods for automatic evaluation of translation quality.",
        "It uses the ratio of co-occurring n-grams between a translation and single or multiple reference sentences.",
        "High correlation is reported between the BLEU score and human evaluations for translations from Arabic, Chinese, French, and Spanish to English (Papineni et al., 2002a).",
        "This paper investigates how to apply BLEU to the evaluation of English-to-Japanese translation.",
        "The main goal of this paper is to design a reliable method of evaluation for translations from another language to Japanese (henceforth we call this Japanese translation evaluation).",
        "There are some difficulties in adjusting BLEU for Japanese: BLEU uses n-grams of words, so words in a sentence are assumed to be separated by spaces, while Japanese does not use spaces between words.",
        "Moreover, Japanese has more variation in writing styles than English.",
        "A major difference in these languages is that Japanese has polite forms expressed by inflections or auxiliary verbs.",
        "If the style of the translations is not the same as that of the reference sentences, the evaluation score becomes low even though the translations are accurate in their meanings and grammar.",
        "To solve these problems, we apply paraphrasing rules to the reference sentences so that the differences in writing styles do not affect the evaluation score.",
        "Another goal is derived from this application of paraphrasing: to define a “good paraphrase”.",
        "Here paraphrasing means rewriting sentences without changing their semantics.",
        "Several methods of paraphrasing have been studied.",
        "Some of them aim at the preprocessing of machine translation (Mita-mura and Nyberg, 2001; Takahashi et al., 2001).",
        "They use paraphrasing to transform the input sentences so that the language-transferring routines can handle them easily.",
        "Another application of paraphrasing is to canonicalize many expressions that have the same semantics, supporting information retrieval or question answering (Zukerman and Raskutti, 2002; Torisawa, 2002).",
        "Paraphrasing techniques in these studies are considered to be useful, but they are difficult to evaluate.",
        "Machine translation evaluation requires methods to judge whether two sentences have the same meaning even when they are syntactically different.",
        "Therefore if a set of paraphrasing rules contributes to more reliable translation evaluation, it can be said to be “good” paraphrasing.",
        "Thus the study in this paper also presents a new paradigm for evaluating paraphrases.",
        "Section 2 overviews the BLEU metric.",
        "Section 3 presents the proposed method of Japanese translation evaluation, and its performance is evaluated in Section 4.",
        "Based on the experimental results, Section 5 discusses qualitative and quantitative features of paraphrasing."

        "Many English words can be used as various parts-of-speech (POSs), but BLEU doesn’t distinguish between the words with the same surface form in terms of their POSs, since the sentences are not processed by a tagger, so the system can’t handle POSs.",
        "This doesn’t cause a problem because most of the multi-POS words have conceptually similar meanings, as exemplified by the adverb ‘fast’ and the adjective ‘fast’ which have the same basic concept, so matching them between the candidate and references reasonably reflects the quality of the translation.",
        "On the other hand, Japanese homonyms tend to be completely different if their POSs are different.",

        "That is, if the corpus has multiple reference sentences translated by different translators, multiple writing styles will tend to be included, and if the corpus is very large, such inconsistencies of writing style are statistically not a problem.",
        "In Japanese translation evaluation, however, this problem can not be resolved using such a quantitative solution because the influence of the differences in writing styles are too large.",
        "For example, whether or not the translation is given in the polite form depends on the translation system2, so the evaluation score is strongly affected by the degree of matching of the writing styles between the translation system and the reference sentences.",
