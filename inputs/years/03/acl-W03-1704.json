        "Currently the mainstream approach is statistic-based.",
        "In general, there are two kinds of statistic-based measures for estimating the soundness of an extracted item being a word/phrase: One is the internal measure, which estimates the soundness by the internal associative strength between constituents of the item.",
        "Nine widely adopted internal measures are listed in (Schone et al.",
        "2001), including Frequency, Mutual Information, Selectional Association, Symmetric Conditional Probability, Dice Formula, Log-likelihood, Chi-squared, Z-score, Student’s t-score.",
        "The other kind is the contextual measure, which estimates the soundness by the dependency of the item on its context, such as the left/right entropy (Sornlertlamvanich et al.",
        "2000), and the left/right context dependency (Chien 1999).",
        "This paper firstly analyzes nine internal measures mentioned above, tests and compares their word extraction performance on individual basis, then tries to improve the performance by properly combining these measures.",
        "Furthermore, the contextual measure is integrated with internal measures to acquire more improvement.",
        "Throughout the experiments, genetic algorithm is explored to adjust weights of combination and thresholds automatically.",
