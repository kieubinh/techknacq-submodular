        "For unknown words with more regular morphological structures, such as personal names, morphological rules are commonly used for improving the performance by restricting the structures of extracted words (Chen et.",

        "A limitation of this method is that it restricts at most one unknown word occurs in the detected region, so that it could not deal with occurrences of consecutive unknown words within a sentence.",
        "Chen & Ma (2002) adopt another strategy: After an initial segmentation process, each monosyllable is decided whether it is a common word or a morpheme of unknown word by a set of syntactic discriminators.",
        "The syntactic discriminators are a set of syntactic patterns containing monosyllabic, words which are learned from a large word segmented corpus, to discriminate between monosyllabic words and morphemes of unknown words.",
        "Then more deep analysis can be carried out at the detected unknown word morphemes to extract unknown words.",
        "In this paper, in order to avoid extractions of superfluous character strings with high frequencies, we proposed to use a set of general rules, which is formulated as a context free grammar rules of composing detected morphemes and their adjacent tokens, to match all kinds of unknown words, for instance which includes the rule of (UW 4 UW UW).",
        "To avoid too much superfluous extractions caused by the over general rules, rules are appended with linguistic or statistical constraints.",
        "To disambiguate between rule applications and reduce the complexity of the rule matching, a bottom-up merging algorithm for extraction is proposed, which merges possible morphemes recursively by consulting above general rules and dynamically decides which rule should be applied first according to the priorities of the rules.",
