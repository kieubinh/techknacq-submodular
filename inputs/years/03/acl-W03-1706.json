        "Syntactic research indicates that prosodic features, including stress, rhythm, intonation, and others, have an impact on syntactic structure.",
        "For example, normally in a coordination construction like “A and B”, A and B are interchangeable, that is to say, you can say “B and A” and the change of word order does not change the meaning.",
        "However, sometimes A and B are not interchangeable.",
        "Quirk et al.",
        "(1985) gives the following examples: man and woman * woman and man ladies and gentleman *gentleman and ladies Obviously, the examples above cannot be explained by gender preference.",
        "A reasonable explanation is that the length of the words (perhaps in syllables) is playing a role; the first constituent tends to be shorter than the second constituent.",
        "This feature of the length in syllables of a constituent plays an even more important role in Chinese syntax than in English (Feng, 2000).",
        "For example, in the verb-object construction in Chinese, there is a preference for the object to be equal to or longer than the verb.",
        "Thus while both “f+”(plant) and “f+W”(plant) are verbs and have the same meaning, “ f+ /plant 01 /tree” is grammatical while “ f+W /plant 01 /tree” is ungrammatical.",
        "However, both verbs allow bisyllabic nouns as objects (e.g., “ A01”(fruit tree), “�rE”(cotton) etc.).",
        "The noun phrases formed by “noun + verb” give us another example in which rhythm feature places constraints on syntax, as indicated in the following examples (ungrammatical with *): �rE/cotton f+W/planting *�rE/cotton f+/planting *rE/flower f+W/planting *rE/flower f+/planting “�r/cotton f+�/planting” is grammatical but “�r/cotton f+/planting” , “r/flower f+� /planting” and “r/flower f+/planting” are all ungrammatical, although “�r/cotton” and “r /flour” , “f+�/planting” and “f+/planting” have the same POS and the same or similar meaning.",
        "The only difference lies in that they have different number of syllables or different length.",
        "This paper systematically surveys the effect of rhythm on Chinese syntax from the statistical data from a shallow tree bank.",
        "Based on the observation that rhythm places constraints on syntax in Chinese, we try to deploy a feature based on rhythm to improve disambiguation in a probabilistic parser by mixing the rhythm feature into a statistical parsing model.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: we present specific statistical analyses of rhythm feature in Chinese syntax in Section 2.",

        "(1) A content word sequence is a content chunk.",

        "(2) A content word sequence is not a content chunk.",
        "For example, in “rP Q/China M/AUX N� /economy R )P- /develop V /AUX TR /very � /fast”(‘China’s economy develops very fast.’), “N 'f� /economy R R /develop” is a content word sequence, but it’s not a phrase in the sentence.",
        "(3) A part of a content word sequence is a content chunk.",
        "For example, in “ fA 9 /private N � /economy � � /develop M /AUX * � /trend TR /very 0 /good”(‘The developmental trend of private economy is very good.’), “ fA�/private N 'f� /economy R R /develop” is a content word sequence, but it’s not a phrase; only “ fA�/private N�/economy” in it is a phrase.",
        "The purpose of content chunk parsing is to recognize phrases in a sequence of content words.",
        "Specifically speaking, the content chunking contains two subtasks: (1) to recognize the maximum phrase in a sequence of content words; (2) to analyze the hierarchical structure within the phrase down to words.",
        "Like baseNP chunking(Church, 1988; Ramshaw & Marcus 1995), content chunk parsing is also a kind of shallow parsing.",
        "Content chunk parsing is deeper than baseNP chunking in two aspects: (1) a content chunk may contain verb phrases and other phrases even a full sentence as long as the all the components are content words; (2) it may contain recursive NPs.",
        "Thus the content chunk can supply more structural information than a baseNP.",
        "The motives for content chunk parsing are twofold: (1) Like other shallow parsing tasks, it can simplify the parsing task.",
        "This can be explained in two aspects.",
        "First, it can avoid the ambiguities brought up by functional words.",
        "In Chinese, the most salient syntactic ambiguities are prepositional phrases and the “DE” construction.",
        "For prepositional phrases, the difficulty lies in how to determine the right boundary, because almost any constituent can be the object of a preposition.",
        "For “DE” constructions, the problem is how to determine its left boundary, since almost any constituent can be followed by “DE” to form a “DE” construction.",
        "Second, content chunk parsing can simplify the structure of a sentence.",
        "When a content chunk is acquired, it can be replaced by its head word, thus reducing the length of the original sentence.",
        "If we get a parse from the reduced sentence with a full parser, then we can get a parse for the original sentence by replacing the headword nodes with the content chunks from which the headwords are extracted.",
        "(2) The content chunk parsing may be useful for applications like information extraction and question answering.",
        "When using template matching, a content chunk Under this PCFG+PF model, the goal of a parser is to choose a parse that maximizes the following score: may be just the correct level of shallow structure for matching with an element in a template.",
        "In the experiment we propose a statistical model integrating probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) model with a simple probabilistic features (PF) model.",
