        "Linguistically interpreted corpora are instrumental in supervised machine learning paradigms of natural language processing.",
        "The information encoded in the corpora to a large extent determines what can be learned by supervised machine learning systems.",
        "Therefore, it is crucial to encode the desired level of information for its automatic acquisition.",
        "The creation of the Penn English Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), a syntactically interpreted corpus, played a crucial role in the advances in natural language parsing technology (Collins, 1997; Collins, 2000; Char-niak, 2000) for English.",
        "The creation of the Penn Chinese Treebank (Xia et al., 2000) is also beginning to help advance technologies in Chinese syntactic analysis (Chiang, 2000; Bikel and Chiang, 2000).",
        "Since the treebanks are generally syntactically oriented (cf. Sinica Treebank (Chen et al., to appear)), the information encoded there is ”shallow”.",
        "Important information useful for natural language applications is missing.",
        "Most notably, significant regularities in the predicate-argument structure of lexical items are not captured.",
        "Recent effort in semantic annotation, the creation of the Penn Proposition Bank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) on top of the Penn English Treebank is beginning to address this issue for English.",
        "In this new layer of annotation, the regularities of the predicates, mostly verbs, are captured in the predicate-argument structure.",
        "For example, in the sentences “The Congress passed the bill” and “The bill passed”, it is intuitively clear that “the bill” plays the same role in the two occurrences of the verb “pass”.",
        "Similar regularities also exist in Chinese.",
        "For example, in “ /this /CL /bill /pass /AS” and “ /Congress /pass /AS /this /CL /bill”, “ /bill” also plays the same role for the verb “ /pass” even though it occurs in different syntactic positions (subject and object respectively).",
        "Capturing such lexical regularities requires a ”deeper” level of annotation than generally provided in a typical syntactically oriented treebank.",
        "It also requires making sense distinctions at the appropriate granularity.",
        "For example, the regularities demonstrated for “pass” does not exist in other senses of this verb.",
        "For example, in “He passed the exam” and “He passed”, the object “the exam” of the transitive use of “pass” does not play the same role as the subject “he” of the intransitive use.",
        "In fact, the subject plays the same role in both sentences.",
        "However, how deep the annotation can go is constrained by two important factors: how consistently human annotators can implement this type of annotation (the consistency issue) and whether the annotated information is learnable by machine (the learnability issue).",
        "Making fine-grained sense distinctions, in particular, has been known to be difficult for human annotators as well as machine-learning systems (Palmer et al., submitted).",
        "It seems generally true that structural information is more learnable than non-structural information, as evidenced by the higher parsing accuracy and relatively poor fine-grained WSD accuracy.",
        "With this in mind, we will propose a level of semantic annotation that still can be captured in structural terms and add this level of annotation to the Penn Chinese Treebank.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we will discuss the annotation model in detail and describe our representation scheme.",
        "We will discuss some complications in Section 3 and some implementation issues in Section 4.",
        "Possible applications of this resource are discussed in Section 5.",
        "We will conclude in Section 6."

      "text": [
        "In this section we describe a model that annotates the predicate-argument structure of Chinese predicates.",
        "This model captures the lexical regularities by assuming that different instances of a predicate, usually a verb, have the same predicate argument structure if they have the same sense.",
        "Defining sense has been one of the most thorny issues in natural language research (Ide and Vronis, 1998), and the term ”sense” has been used to mean different things, ranging from part-of-speech and homophones, which are easier to define, to slippery fine-grained semantic distinctions that are hard to make consistently.",
        "Determining the ”right” level of sense distinction for natural language applications is ultimately an empirical issue, with the best level of sense distinction being the level with the least granularity and yet sufficient for a natural language application in question.",
        "Without gearing towards one particular application, our strategy is to use the structural regularities demonstrated in Section 1 to define sense.",
        "Finer sense distinctions without clear structural indications are avoided.",
        "All instances of a predicate that realize the same set of semantic roles are assumed to have one sense, with the understanding that not all of the semantic roles for this verb sense have to be realized in a given verb instance, and that the same semantic role may be realized in different syntactic positions.",
        "All the possible syntactic realizations of the same set of semantic roles for a verb sense are then alternations of one another.",
        "This state of affairs has been characterized as diathesis alternation and used to establish cross-predicate generalizations and classifications (Levin, 1993).",
        "It has been hypothesized and demonstrated that verbs sharing the same disthesis alternation patterns also have similar meaning postulates.",
        "It is equally plausible to assume then that verb instances having different diathesis alternation patterns also have different semantic properties and thus different senses.",
        "Using diathesis alternation patterns as a diagnostic test, we can identify the different senses for a verb.",
        "Alternating syntactic frames for a particular verb sense realizing the same set of semantic roles (we call this roleset) form a frameset and share similar semantic properties.",
        "It is easy to see that each frameset, a set of syntactic frames for a verb, corresponds with one roleset and vice versa.",
        "From now on, we use the term frameset instead of sense for clarity.",
        "Each frameset consists of one or more syntactic frames and each syntactic frame realizes one or more semantic roles.",
        "One frame differs from another in the number and type of arguments its predicate actually takes, and one frameset differs from another in the total number and type of arguments its predicate CAN take.",
        "This is illustrated graphically in Figure 1.",
        "Annotating the predicate-argument structure involves mapping the frameset identification information for a predicate to an actual predicate instance in the corpus and assign the semantic roles to its arguments based on the syntactic frame of that predicate instance.",
        "It is hoped that since framesets are defined through diathesis alternation of syntactic frames, the distinctions made are still structural in nature and thus are machine-learnable and can be consistently annotated by human annotators.",
        "So far our discussion has focused on semantic ar",
        "guments, which play a central role in determining the syntactic frames and framesets.",
        "There are other elements in a proposition: semantic adjuncts.",
        "Compared with semantic arguments, semantic adjuncts do not play a role in defining the syntactic frames or framesets because they occur in a wide variety of predicates and as a result are not as discriminative as semantic arguments.",
        "On the other hand, since they can co-occur with a wide variety of predicates, they are more generalizable and classifiable than semantic arguments.",
        "In the next section, we will describe a representation scheme that captures this dichotomy."

        "This phenomenon surfaces in several different constructions.",
        "One such construction involves “possessor raising”, where the possessor (in a broad sense) raises to a higher position.",
        "Examples 1a and 1b illustrate this.",
        "In 1a, the possessor originates from the subject position and raises to the topic1 position, while in 1b, the possessor originates from the object position and raises 1 In Chinese, it is possible to have a topic in addition to the subject.",

        "Another case of“split arguments” involves the coordinated noun phrases.",
        "In 2a, for example, the coordinated structure as a whole is an argument to the verb “ /sign”.",

        "The problem is that for coordinated noun phrases, there can be arbitrarily many coordinated",
        "constituents.",
        "So we adopt the alternative approach of representing the entire constituent as one argument.",
        "When the pieces are separate constituents, they will receive the same argument label, with different secondary tags indicating they are parts of a larger constituent.",
        "For example, in 1, when possessor raising occurs, the possessor and possessee receive the same argument label with different secondary tags psr and pse.",

        "Such mapping will not be as straightforward if it is between surface syntactic entities such as the subject and IE templates.",
        "This level of abstraction can also provide a platform where lexical transfer can take place.",
        "It opens up the possibility of linking a frameset of a predicate in one language with that of another, rather than using bilingual (or multilingual) dictionaries where one word is translated into one or more words in a different language.",
        "This type of lexical transfer has several advantages.",
        "One is that the transfer is made more precise, in the sense that there will be more cases where one-to-one mapping is possible.",
        "Even in cases where one-to-one mapping is still not possible, the identification of the framesets of a predicate will narrow down the possible lexical choices.",
        "For example, sign.02 in the English Proposition Bank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) will be linked to “ .01/enter into an agreement”.",
        "This type of linking rules out “ ” as a possible translation for sign.",
        "02, even though it is a translation for other framesets of the word sign.",
        "The transfer will also be more precise in another sense, that is, the predicate-argument structure of a word instance will be preserved during the transfer process.",
        "Knowing the arguments of a predicate instance can further constrain the lexical choices and rule out translation candidates whose predicate-argument structures are incompatible.",
        "For example, if the realized arguments of “sign.01” of the English Proposition Bank in a given sentence are the signer, the document, and the signature, among the translation candidates “ , ” (“ .01/enter into an agreement” is ruled out as a possibility for this frameset), only “ ” is possible, because “ ” can only take two arguments, namely, the signer and the document.",
        "The “document” argument of “ ” can only be realized as a prepositional phrase in Chinese while in English it can only be realized the direct object of “sign”.",
        "If the syntactic subcategorization frame is used to constrain the lexical choices for “sign”, “ ” will be incorrectly ruled out as a possible translation.",

        "So compared with the surface syntactic frames, the predicate-argument structure constrains the lexical choices without incorrectly ruling out legitimate translation candidates.",

        "/he /at /this /CL /document /LC /sign /he /sign /this /CL /document “He signed this document.” Annotating the predicate-argument structure as described in previous sections will not reduce the lexical choices to one-to-one mappings in call cases.",

        "This is essentially a trade-off: either one can conduct deep analysis of the source language, resolve all sense ambiguities on the source side and have a more straightforward mapping, or one takes the one-to-many mappings and select the correct translation on the target language side.",
        "Hopefully, the annotation of the predicate-argument provides just the right level of abstraction and the resource described here, with each predicate annotated with its arguments and adjuncts in context, enables the automatic acquisition of the predicate-argument structure."
