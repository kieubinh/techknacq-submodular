        "1996; Bai et al. 1998; Zhou et al. 1999; Rosenfeld 2000; Gao et al. 2002).",
        "Although ngram modeling is simple in nature and easy to use, it has obvious deficiencies.",
        "For instance, ngram modeling can only capture the short distance context dependency within an N-word window where currently the largest practical N for natural language is three.",
        "In the meantime, it is found that there always exist many preferred relationships between words.",
        "Two highly associated word pairs are 4,-�/AR (“not only/but also”) and X t / TP ± (“doctor/nurse”).",
        "Psychological experiments in Meyer et al.",
        "(1975) indicated that the human’s reaction to a highly associated word pair was stronger and faster than that to a poorly associated word pair.",
        "Such preference information is very useful for natural language processing (Church et al.",
        "1990; Hiddle et al.",
        "1993; Rosenfeld 1994; Zhou et al.1998; Zhou et al. 1999).",
        "Obviously, the preference relationships between words can expand from a short to long distance.",
        "While we can use traditional ngram modeling to capture the short distance context dependency, the long distance context dependency should also be exploited properly.",
        "The purpose of this paper is to propose a new MI-Ngram modeling approach to capture the context dependency over both a short distance and a long distance.",
        "Experimentation shows that this new MI-Ngram modeling approach can significantly decrease the perplexity of the new MI-Ngram model compared with traditional ngram model.",
        "In the meantime, evaluation on Chinese word segmentation shows that this new approach can significantly reduce the error rate.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "In section 2, we describe the traditional ngram modeling approach and discuss its main property.",
        "In section 3, we propose the new MI-Ngram modeling approach to capture context dependency over both a short distance and a long distance.",
        "In section 4, we measure the MI-Ngram modeling approach and evaluate its application in Chinese word segmentation.",

        "1), we have the log probability of the word string log P(S) : (2.2) So, the classical task of statistical language modeling becomes how to effectively and efficiently predict the next word, given the previous words, that is to say, to estimate expressions of the form P(w; |w;−1) .",
        "For convenience, P(w; |w;−1 ) is often written as P(w; |h) , where h = w;−1 , is called history.",

        "That is to say, (2.3) For example, in bigram model (n=2), the probability of a word is assumed to depend only on the previous word: And the probability P(w; |w;−1) can be estimated by using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) principle: (2.5) Where C(•) represents the number of times the sequence occurs in the training data.",
        "In practice, due to the data sparseness problem, some smoothing techniques, such as linear interpolation (Jelinek 1989; Chen and Goodman 1999) and back-off modeling (Katz 1987), are applied.",
        "Obviously, an ngram model assumes that the probability of the next word w; is independent of word string w;−n in the history.",
        "The difference between bigram, trigram and other ngram models is the value of N. The parameters of an ngram are thus the probabilities: For all w1,w, , w∈ V. Given S = w1w2 ... wm , an ngram model estimates the log probability of the word string by rewriting equation (2.2): (2.6) Where m is the string length, w; is the i -th word in string S .",
        "From equation (2.3) , we have:",
        "where MI (w1−1, wi, d =1) = log (i−1iis P(w1 )P(wi) the mutual information between the word string pair and is the mutual information between the word string pair .",
        "d is the distance of two word strings in the word string pair and is equal to 1 when the two word strings are adjacent.",
        "For a word string pair (A, B) over a distance where A and B are word strings, mutual information MI (A, B, d) reflects the degree of preference relationship between the two strings over a distanced.",
        "Several properties of mutual information are apparent:",
        "reflects the change of the information content when the word strings A and are correlated.",
        "That is to say, the higher the value of MI (A, B, d) , the stronger affinity A and have.",
        "Therefore, we can use mutual information to measure the preference relationship degree between a word string pair.",
        "From the view of mutual information, an ngram model assumes the mutual information independency between (w1i−n,wi) .",
        "Using an alternative view of equivalence, an ngram model is one that partitions the data into equivalence classes based on the last n-1 words in the history.",
        "As trigram model is most widely used in current research, we will mainly consider the trigram-based model.",
        "By rewriting equation (2.6), the trigram model estimates the log probability of the string as:",
        "Here we assume where H = w;-' , X = w2' and i > N. That is to say, the mutual information of the next word with the history is assumed equal to the summation of that of the next word with the first word in the history and that of the next word with the rest word string in the history.",
        "Obviously, the first item in equation (3.7) contributes to the log probability of ngram within an N-word window while the second item is the summation of mutual information which contributes to the long distance context dependency of the next word wi with the individual previous word wj (1 ≤ j ≤ i − N, i > N) over the long distance outside the N-word window.",
        "By using equation (3.7), equation (2.2) can be rewritten as: In equation (3.8), the first three items are the values computed by the trigram model as shown in equation (2.9) and the forth item contributes to summation of the mutual information of the next word with the words over the long distance outside the N-word window.",
        "That is, the new model as shown in equation (3.8) consists of two components: an ngram model and an MI model.",
        "Therefore, we call equation (3.8) as an MI-Ngram model and equation (3.8) can be rewritten as: As a special case N=3, the MI-Trigram model estimate the log probability of the string as follows: (3.10) Compared with traditional ngram modeling, MI-Ngram modeling incorporates the long distance context dependency by computing mutual information of the long distance dependent word",
        "pairs.",
        "Since the number of possible long distance dependent word pairs may be very huge, it is impossible for MI-Ngram modeling to incorporate all of them.",
        "Therefore, for MI-Ngram modeling to be practically useful, how to select a reasonable number of word pairs becomes very important.",
        "Here two approaches are used (Zhou et al. 1998 and 1999).",
        "One is to restrict the window size of possible word pairs by computing and comparing the perplexities1 (Shannon C.E.",
        "1951) of various long distance bigram models for different distances.",
        "It is found that the bigram perplexities for different distances outside the 10-word window become stable.",
        "Therefore, we only consider MI-Ngram modeling with a window size of 10 words.",
        "Another is to adapt average mutual information to select a reasonable number of long distance dependent word pairs.",
        "Given distance d and two words A and B, its average mutual information is computed as: (3.11) Compared with mutual information, average mutual information takes joint probabilities into consideration.",
        "In this way, average mutual information prefers frequently occurred word pairs.",
        "In our paper, different numbers of long distance dependent word pairs will be considered in MI-Ngram modeling within a window size of 10 words to evaluate the effect of different MI model size.",
        "1 Perplexity is a measure of the average number of possible choices there are for a random variable.",
        "The perplexity PP of a random variable X with entropy is defined as: Entropy is a measure of uncertainty about a random variable.",

        "use the relation 0log2 0 = 0 when computing entropy.",
        "The units of entropy are bits of information.",
