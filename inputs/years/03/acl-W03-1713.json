        "With more and more information flowing into our life, it is very important to lead people to gain more important information in time as short as possible.",
        "Keywords are a good solution, which give a brief summary of a document’s content.",
        "With keywords, people can quickly find what they are most interested in and read them carefully.",
        "That will save us a lot of time.",
        "In addition, keywords are also useful to the research of information retrieval, text clustering, and topic search [Frank 1999].",
        "Manually indexing keywords will cost highly.",
        "Thus, automatically indexing keywords from text is of great interests.",
        "News is always the main domain that people pay a large amount of attention to.",
        "Unfortunately, only a small fraction of documents in this field have keywords.",
        "However, compared to unrestricted text, news articles are relatively easy to extract keywords from, because they have the following characteristics.",
        "Firstly, a news document is always short in length, and usually, only important words or phrases repeat.",
        "Secondly, as a rule, the purpose of news articles is to illustrate an event or a thing for readers.",
        "Then this kind of articles usually place more emphasis on some name entities such as persons, places, organizations and so on.",
        "Lastly, important content often occurs the first time in the title, or in the anterior part of the whole text, especially the first paragraph or the first sentence in every paragraph.",
        "These characteristics will help us in keywords indexing.",
        "Several methods have been proposed for extracting English keywords from text.",
        "For example, Witten[1999] adopted Naïve Bayes techniques, and Turney[ 1999] combined decision trees and genetic algorithm in his system.",
        "These systems achieved satisfying results.",
        "However, they need a large amount of training documents with keywords, which are just what we are in need of now.",
        "For the Chinese language, some researchers adopt the structure of PAT tree and make use of mutual information to obtain keywords [Chien 1997, Yang 2002].",
        "Unfortunately, the construction of PAT tree will cost a lot of space and time.",
        "In this paper, aiming at the characteristics of news-oriented articles, resources and techniques of current situation, we will introduce a simple procedure to index keywords from text.",
        "Section 2 will describe the architecture of the whole system.",
        "In section 3, we will introduce every module in detail, including how to obtain candidate keywords, how to filter out the meaningless items, and how to score possible keyword candidates according to their feature values.",
        "In section 4, experimental results will be given and analyzed.",
        "At last, we will end with the conclusion."

        "Aiming at the task of keywords indexing, our system is designed and composed of three modules.",
        "As in figure 1, the first module is to recognize some Chinese character strings according to their frequency, and pick out those named entities in the text as the candidate keywords.",
        "The second module is a filter to remove all the meaningless character strings from the set of candidates.",

        "It can be seen that one document is composed of a set of character strings.",

        "So, we take them out as keyword candidates.",
        "In addition, named entities, such as person names, place names, organizations, translation terms, titles of person and so on, are usually very important for the document without reference to their frequency.",
        "They will also be picked out from the text by named entities recognizer and input into the filter module with other character strings.",
        "Unlike English, there are no explicit word boundaries in Chinese sentences, which makes it especially difficult to tell whether a character string is composed of one word or more than one word.",
        "Due to this characteristic, we don’t use a dictionary, but get those character strings only according to their frequency statistics.",
        "We set a threshold value as 2 for the Chinese character strings considering the length of news documents.",
        "Suppose that a character string is c1c2 ... cn, and f(c1c2 ... cn) represents its frequency, then we extract c1c2...cn from text only if f(c1c2 ... cn) equals to or is more than 2.",
        "That is, only a character string occurs two or more than two times, it can be selected as a candidate keyword.",

        "We need to filter out those meaningless items.",
        "As in figure 1, we adopt four kinds of filters in filter module.",
        "They work as follows.",
        "(1) Filter of Overlapped and Dependent Items For two character strings S 1 and S2, with S 1 as a substring of S2, and the frequency of S 1 is equal to that of S2, then S 1 is overlapped by S2.",
        "In fact, we can set a threshold td for f(S1)-f(S2), where the function f(.)",

        "If the value of f(S1)-f(S2) is less than td, then the string S1 is dependent on S2.",
        "Here, the overlapped and dependent substring will be removed from the candidate set.",
        "(2) Filter of Items with Punctuations and Function words",
        "The recognizer module treats equally all symbols in the text, such as Chinese characters and punctuations, etc.",
        "Thus when conducting the process of frequency statistics, for a character string, there might exist some punctuations and function words such as ‘。 ’, ‘、’, ‘了’, ‘着’, etc.",
        "These punctuations and function words usually occur in the head or tail of a character string.",
        "It’s evident that such character strings can’t serve as character strings can’t serve as keywords of an article, and they should be deleted from the candidate set.",
        "(3) Segmentation Filter",
        "We find the first occurrence position of every candidate keyword and get the sentence at the position.",
        "Then the sentence is segmented.",
        "According to the segmented result, we can verify whether the character string is meaningful.",
        "First of all, we get the segmentation result of the character string in the segmented sentence.",
        "Suppose the character string ci...cj in the original text with the sentence c1c2...ci-1ci...cjcj+1...cn as its context, if the segmentation tool segments ci-1ci or cjcj+1 into one word, then ci...cj will not be regarded as an integrated unit.",
        "That is, this item will be seen as meaningless and filtered out from the set of candidate keywords.",
        "Here we don’t adopt the method of conducting frequency statistics of words after segmentation, but use segmentation tool after frequency statistics of character strings.",
        "There are some reasons.",
        "Above all, although the segmentation technique is relatively mature, its precision is still not high enough.",
        "Then, for the same character string, its segmentation results often differ in different sentences.",
        "Thus, it’s difficult to compute the frequency of a character string precisely.",

        "At the same time, verb phrases, adjective phrases, preposition phrases are also excluded from the candidate set.",
