        "We first conduct SCNE recognition within a framework of improved source-channel models, which is applied to Chinese word segmentation.",

        "Examples are",
        "Chinese NER is achieved within the framework.",
        "To make our later discussion on SCNE clear, we introduce the model briefly.",
        "We are given Chinese sentence S, which is a character string.",
        "For all possible word segmentations W, we will choose the one which achieves the highest conditional probability W* = argmax w P(W |S).",
        "According to Bayes’ law and dropping the constant denominator, we acquire the following equation:",
        "Following our Chinese word definition, we define word class C as follows: (1) each lexicon word is defined as a class; (2) each morphologically derived word is defined as a class; (3) each type of named entities is defined as a class, e.g. all person names belong to a class PN, and (4) each type of factoids is defined as a class, e.g. all time expressions belong to a class TIME.",
        "We therefore convert the word segmentation W into a word class sequence C. Eq.",
        "1 can then be rewritten as:",
        "Eq.",
        "2 is the basic form of the source-channel models for Chinese word segmentation.",
        "The models assume that a Chinese sentence S is generated as follows: First, a person chooses a sequence of concepts (i.e., word classes C) to output, according to the probability distribution P(C); then the person attempts to express each concept by choosing a sequence of characters, according to the probability distribution P(S |C).",
        "We use different types of channel models for different types of Chinese words.",
        "This brings several advantages.",
        "First, different linguistic constraints can be easily added to corresponding channel models (see Figure 1).",
        "These constraints can be dynamic linguistic knowledge acquired through statistics or intuitive rules compiled by linguists.",
        "Second, this framework is data-driven, which makes it easy to adapt to other languages.",
        "We have three channel models for PN, LN and ON respectively.",
        "(see Figure 1) However, although Eq.",
        "2 suggests that channel model probability and source model probability can be combined through simple multiplication, in practice some weighting is desirable.",
        "There are two reasons.",
        "First, some channel models are poorly estimated, owing to the suboptimal assumptions we make for simplicity and the insufficiency of the training corpus.",
        "Combining the channel model probability with poorly estimated source model probabilities according to Eq.",
        "2 would give the context model too little weight.",
        "Second, as seen in Figure 1, the channel models of different word classes are constructed in different ways (e.g. name entity models are n-gram models trained on corpora, and factoid models are compiled using linguistic knowledge).",
        "Therefore, the quantities of channel model probabilities are likely to have vastly different dynamic ranges among different word classes.",
        "One way to balance these probability quantities is to add several channel model weight CW, each for one word class, to adjust the channel model probability P(S|C) to P(S|C)CW.",
        "In our experiments, these weights are determined empirically on a development set.",
        "Given the source-channel models, the procedure of word segmentation involves two steps: first, given an input string S, all word candidates are generated (and stored in a lattice).",
        "Each candidate is tagged with its class and the probability P(S’|C), where S’ is any substring of S. Second, Viterbi search is used to select (from the lattice) the most probable word segmentation (i.e. word class sequence C*) according to Eq.",
