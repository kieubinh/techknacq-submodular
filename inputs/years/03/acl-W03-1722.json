        "On behalf of the Institute of Computational Linguistics, Peking University, we would like to thank ACL-SIGHAN for sponsoring the First International Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff, which provides us an opportunity to present our achievement of the past decade.",
        "We know for sure that it is very difficult to settle on a scientific and appropriate method of evaluation, and it might be even more difficult than word segmentation itself.",
        "We are also clear that each step in Chinese information processing requires great efforts, and a satisfactory result in word segmentation, though critical, does not necessarily guarantee good results in the following steps.",
        "From the test results of this evaluation, we are very gratified to see that we have done a good job both as a test corpus provider and as a participant.",
        "According to the rule, we did not test on the corpus we provided, but it is quite encouraging that our supply tops the test corpus list to be elected by other participants.",
        "Section 2 and Section 3 describes our work in the Bakeoff as the test corpus provider and the participant respectively."

        "We provided the latest version of our specification, which has been published in the Journal of Chinese Information Processing.",
        "Based on our experience of large-scale corpus processing in recent years, the current version gave us different perspectives in a consistent way, and we hope it will also help others in this field know better of our segmented and POS-tagged corpus."

        "Our research on word segmentation has been focusing on People’s Daily.",
        "As we are one of the two providers of Chinese corpora in GB code in this Bakeoff, we had to test on the Penn Chinese treebank.",
        "Not all the training and test corpus we got came from the Mainland China.",
        "Some were GB data converted from BIG5 texts of Taiwan.",
        "It is commonly known that in the Mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwai, the Chinese langauge is used diversely not only in the sense of different coding systems, but in respect of different wordings as well.",
        "While training our segmenter, we studied the guidelines and training corpus of Penn Chinese treebank, tracing the differences and working on them.",
        "The main difference between the work of U. Penn and that of ours is notion of “word”.",
        "For instance:",
        "These are different combinations in regard of words which follow certain patterns, and can therefore be handled easily by applying rules to the grogram.",
        "The real difficulty for us, however, is the following items:",
        "The Open Track allows us to use our own recourses, so we had to find the lexical correspondence to reduce the negtive effect caused by the difference between Penn Chinese treebank and our own corpus.",
        "However, as the training corpus is small, we could not remove all the negative effect, and the untackled problems remained to affect our test result.",
        "Further, as we have been working on language data from the Mainland China, the lexicon of our segmenter does not contain words used in Taiwan.",
        "Such being the case, we added into our lexicon the entries that were not known (i.e., not found in the training set) and could not be handled by the rule-based makeshift either.",
        "But because we are not very familiar with the Chinese language used in Taiwan, we could not make a complete patch due to the limit of time."

        "Word segmentation is the first step yet a key step in Chinese information processing, but we have not found a perfect solution up till now.",
        "From an engineering perspective, we think there is no need for a unique result of segmentation.",
        "All roads lead to Rome.",
        "The approach you take, technical or non-technical, will be a good one if the expected result is achieved.",
        "And it would be more desirable if the processing program in each step can tolerate or even correct the errors made in the previous step.",
        "We learn from our experience that the computer processing of natural language is a complex issue, which requires a solid fundamental research (on the language itself) to ensure a higher accuracy of automation.",
        "It is definitely hard to achieve an increase of one percent or even less in the accuracy of word segmentation, but we are still confident and will keep working in this respect.",
        "Finally, we would like to thank Dr. Li Baoli and Dr. Bing SWEN for their great efforts on the maintenance of our segmentation program."
