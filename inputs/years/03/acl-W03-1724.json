        "After about two decades of studies of Chinese word segmentation, ICWSB-1 (henceforth, the bakeoff) is the first effort to put different approaches and systems to the test and comparison on common datasets.",
        "We participated in the bakeoff with a segmentation system that is designed to integrate a general-purpose ngram model for probabilistic segmentation and a case or example-based learning approach (Kit et al., 2002) for disambiguation.",
        "The ngram model, with words extracted from training corpora, is trained with the EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977) using unsegmented training corpora.",
        "Originally it was developed to enhance word segmentation accuracy so as to facilitate Chinese-English word alignment for our ongoing EBMT project, where only unsegmented texts are available for training.",
        "It is expected to be robust enough to handle novel texts, independent of any segmented texts for training.",
        "To simplify the EM training, we used the uni-gram model for the bakeoff and relied on the Viterbi algorithm (Viterbi, 1967) for the most probable segmentation, instead of attempting to exhaust all possible segmentations of each sentence for a complicated full version of EM training.",
        "The case-based learning works in a straightforward way.",
        "It first extracts case-based knowledge, as a set of context-dependent transformation rules, from the segmented training corpus, and then applies them to ambiguous strings in a test corpus in terms of the similarity of their contexts.",
        "The similarity is empirically computed in terms of the length of relevant common affixes of context strings.",
        "The effectiveness of this integrated approach is verified by its outstanding performance on IV word identification.",
        "Its IV recall rate, ranging from 96% to 98%, stands at the top or the next to the top in all closed tests in which we have participated.",
        "Unfortunately, its overall performance is not sustainable at the same level, due to the lack of a module for OOV word detection.",
        "This paper is intended to present the implementation of the system and analyze its performance and problems, aiming at exploration of directions for further improvement.",
        "The remaining sections are organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 presents the ngram model and its training with the EM algorithm, and Section 3 presents the case-based learning for disambiguation.",
        "The overall architecture of our system is given in Section 4, and its performance and problems are analyzed in Section 5.",
        "Section 6 concludes the paper and previews future work."

        "An ngram model can be utilized to find the most probable segmentation of a sentence.",
        "Given a Chinese sentence s = c1c2 • • • cm (also denoted as cn1), its probabilistic segmentation into a word sequence w1w2 • • • wk (also denoted as wk1) with the aid of an ngram model can be formulated as",
        "where o denotes string concatenation, wi – 1 i – n+1 the context (or history) of wi, and n is the order of the ngram model in use.",
        "We have opted for uni-gram for the sake of simplicity.",
        "Accordingly, p(wi|wi – n+1) in (1) becomes p(wi), which is commonly estimated as follows, given a corpus C for training.",
        "In order to estimate a reliable p(wi), the ngram model needs to be trained with the EM algorithm using the available training corpus.",
        "Each EM iteration aims at approaching to a more reliable f (w) for estimating p(w), as follows:",
        "where k denotes the current iteration, S(s) the set of all possible segmentations for s, and f k(w E s') the occurrences of w in a particular segmentation s'.",
        "However, assuming that every sentence always has a segmentation, the following equation holds:",
        "Accordingly, we can adjust (3) as (5) with a normalization factor a = �s'ES(s) pk(s'), to avoid favoring words in shorter sentences too much.",
        "In general, shorter sentences have higher probabilities.",
        "pk(s') f k(w E s') (5) a Following the conventional idea to speed up the EM training, we turned to the Viterbi algorithm.",
        "The underlying philosophy is to distribute more probability to more probable events.",
        "The Viterbi segmentation, by utilizing dynamic programming techniques to go through the word trellis of a sentence efficiently, finds the most probable segmentation under the current parameter estimation of the language model, fulfilling (1)).",
        "Accordingly, (6) becomes",
        "where the normalization factor is skipped, for only the Viterbi segmentation is used for EM re-estimation.",
        "Equation (7) makes the EM training with the Viterbi algorithm very simple for the uni-gram model: iterate word segmentation, as (1), and word count updating, via (7), sentence by sentence through the training corpus until there is a convergence.",
        "Since the EM algorithm converges to a local maxima only, it is critical to start the training with an initial f 0 (w) for each word not too far away from its “true” value.",
        "Our strategy for initializing f 0(w) is to assume all possible words in the training corpus as equiprobable and count each of them as 1; and then p0(w) is derived using (2).",
        "This strategy is supposed to have a weaker bias to favor longer words than maximal matching segmentation.",
        "For the bakeoff, the ngram model is trained with the unsegmented training corpora together with the test sets.",
        "It is a kind of unsupervised training.",
        "Adding the test set to the training data is reasonable, to allow the model to have necessary adaptation towards the test sets.",
        "Experiments show that the training converges very fast, and the segmentation performance improves significantly from iteration to iteration.",
        "For the bakeoff experiments, we carried out the training in 6 iterations, because more iterations than this have not been observed to bring any significant improvement on segmentation accuracy to the training sets."

        "For the bakeoff, we have based our approach to ambiguity detection and disambiguation rule extraction on the assumption that only ambiguous strings cause mistakes: we detect the discrepancies of our probabilistic segmentation and the standard segmentation of the training corpus, and turn them into transformation rules.",
        "An advantage of this approach is that the rules so derived carry out not only disambiguation but also error correction.",

        "This side-effect is most likely to occur when there is inadequate context information to decide which rules to apply.",
        "There are two strategies to remedy, or at least alleviate, this side-effect: (1) retrain probabilistic segmentation – a conservative strategy; or, (2) incorporate Brill’s error-driven learning with several rounds of transformation rule extraction and application, allowing mistakes caused by some rules in previous rounds to be corrected by other rules in later rounds.",
        "However, even worse than the above side-effect is a bug in our disambiguation module: it always applies the first available rule, leading to many unexpected errors, each of which may result in more than one erroneous word.",
