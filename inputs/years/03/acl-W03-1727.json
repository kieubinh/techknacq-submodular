        "In most cases, the use of the parser results in better segmentation, but the parser can also mislead us.",

        "Fortunately, most of the words whose segmentation is controversial are built dynamically in our system with their internal structures preserved.",

        "To solve this problem, we used the training data to automatically identify all such cases, create a word-internal structure for each of them, and store the word tree in their lexical entries .4 This made it possible for the parameter values to apply to both the lexicalized and non-lexicalized words.",
        "This process can be fairly automatic if the annotation of the training data is completely consistent.",
