        "Inflexional orthographic variants gathering together inflexional variants that are predictable such as conservations de produit (product preservations) or unpredictable such as conservation de produits (product preservation).",
        "Shallow syntactic The shallow syntactic variations modify the function words of the base-terms.",

        "S-2 Coordinational variants: head or expansion coordination of base term structures and enumeration: analyse de particules “particule analysis” analyse et le tri de particules “particle sort and analysis” alimentation humaine “human feeding” alimentation animale et humaine “human and animal feeding”.",
        "Morphosyntactic The Morphosyntactic variations modify the internal structure of the base-terms and its components are liable to morphological modification (including derivation).",
        "M-1 Morphology : the preposition inside a candidate term of Noun1 Prep Noun2 structure is equivalent to a prefix applying on Noun2: pourrissement apr`es r´ecolte (rot after harvest) pourrissement post-r´ecolte (post-harvesting rot); M-2 Derivational morphology: a derivational variation that keeps the synonymy of the base term implies a relational adjective: acidit´e du sang (acidity ofthe blood) acidit´e sanguine (blood acidity).",

        "The lexical function that captures hyperonymic relationships is the function Spec introduced by (Grimes, 1990): Spec (contraction isom´etrique “isometric contraction”) = contraction musculaire isom´etrique “isometric muscular contraction” Spec (agent bact´erien “bacterial agent”) = agent infectieux bact´erien “bacterial infectious agent” Antonymy: if it is an adverb of negation that modifies the base term of N1 Adj structure, an antonymic relationship occurs between the base term and the modified one.",
        "This relationship of opposition is described with the function Anti: Anti(levure floculante “flocculating yeast”)= levure non floculante “non-flocculating yeast” Morphosyntactic Semantic distinctions appear with base terms that are morphologically related to other base terms.",

        "Antonymy: the prefixes ir, d´e, non(-) applying either on the head or expansion element on a base term whatever is its structure characterize an antonymic relationship.",
        "Examples are: Anti (solubilisation micellaire “micellar solubilization”) = insolubilisation micellaire “micellar insolubilisation” Anti (ph´enol polym´eris´e “polymerized phenol”) = ph´enol non -polym´eris´e “unpolymerized phenol” Set of: the suffixes age, ade applying on the head noun of base term attest of a “set of” relationship expressed with the function Mult: Mult (plume de canard “duck feather”) = plumage de canards “duck feather” The two base-terms share the same pattern.",
        "Result: A “result” relationship is expressed with the function N applying on nouns.",

        "– or by the suffixes age, ade, erie, ment, tion, ure associated with an inversion.",
        "We distinguish two cases: if this morphological link involves a N Adj structure, the function N applies: N (conservation des aliments “food preservation”) = aliment conserv´e “preserved food”; if the morphological link involves a N a` Vinf structure, we face a nonstandard function where the term of N a` Vinf structure expresses the state before the process.",
        "Thus, we introduce the new function N : N (conservation des aliments “food preservation”) = aliment a` conserver “food to preserve”; Actor: the suffixe eur applying on the head noun of a base term builds its actant expressed with the function S : S (transport routier “road transport” = transporteur routier “road haulier”.",
        "The two base-terms share the same pattern.",
        "Other semantic relationships involving two base-terms with the same pattern are induced by prefixes.",
        "For those, we have to introduce new functions as: “again” relationship with the prefixes re, r´e: AGAIN(est´erication enzymatique “enzymatic esterification”) = r´eest´erification enzymatique “enzymatic reesterification” ; “before” relationship with the prefixe pr´e(-): BEFORE(traitement enzymatique “enzymatic treatment”) = pr´etraiement enzymatique “enzymatic pretreatment”."
