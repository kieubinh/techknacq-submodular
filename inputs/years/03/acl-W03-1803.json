        "Multiword expressions are problematic in machine translation (MT) due to the idiomaticity and overgen-eration problems (Sag et al., 2002).",
        "Idiomaticity is the problem of compositional semantic unpredictability and/or syntactic markedness, as seen in expressions such as kick the bucket (= die ) and by and large, respectively.",
        "Overgeneration occurs as a result of a system failing to capture idiosyncratic lexical affinities between words, such as the blocking of seemingly equivalent word combinations (e.g. many thanks vs. *several thanks).",
        "In this paper, we target the particular task of the Japanese English machine translation of noun-noun compounds to outline the various techniques that have been proposed to tackle idiomaticity and overgeneration, and carry out detailed analysis of their viability over naturally-occurring data.",
        "Noun-noun (NN) compounds (e.g. web server, car park) characteristically occur with high frequency and high lexical and semantic variability.",
        "A summary examination of the 90m-word written component of the British National Corpus (BNC, Burnard (2000)) unearthed over 400,000 NN compound types, with a combined token frequency of 1.3m;1 that is, over 1% of words in the BNC are NN compounds.",
        "Moreover, if we plot the relative token coverage of the most frequently-occurring NN compound types, we find that the low-frequency types account for a significant proportion of the type count (see Figure 12).",
        "To achieve 50% token coverage, e.g., we require coverage of the top 5% most-frequent NN compounds, amounting to roughly 70,000 types with a minimum token frequency of 10.",
        "NN compounds are especially prevalent in technical domains, often with idiosyncratic semantics: Tanaka and Matsuo (1999) found that NN compounds accounted for almost 20% of entries in a Japanese-English financial terminological dictionary.",
        "Various claims have been made about the level of processing complexity required to translate NN compounds, and proposed translation methods range over a broad spectrum of processing complexity.",
        "There is a clear division between the proposed methods based on whether they attempt to interpret the semantics of the NN compound (i.e. use deep processing), or simply use the source language word forms to carry out the translation task (i.e. use shallow processing).",
        "It is not hard to find examples of semantic mismatch in NN compounds to motivate deep translation methods: the Japanese idobata kaigi “(lit.)",
        "well-side meeting”,3 e.g., translates most naturally into English as “idle gossip”, which a shallow method would be hard put to predict.",
        "Our interest is in the relative occurrence of such NN compounds and their impact on the performance of shallow translation methods.",
        "In particular, we seek to determine what proportion of NN compounds shallow translation translation methods can reasonably translate and answer the question: do shallow methods perform well enough to preclude the need for deep processing?",
        "The answer to this question takes the form of an estimation of the upper bound on translation performance for shallow translation methods.",
        "In order to answer this question, we have selected the language pair of English and Japanese, due to the high linguistic disparity between the two languages.",
        "We consider the tasks of both English-to-Japanese (EJ) and Japanese-to-English (JE) NN compound translation over fixed datasets of NN compounds, and apply representative shallow MT methods to the data.",
        "While stating that English and Japanese are highly linguistically differentiated, we recognise that there are strong syntactic parallels between the two languages with respect to the compound noun construction.",
        "At the same time, there are large volumes of subtle lexical and expressional divergences between the two languages, as evidenced between jiteNsha seNshu “(lit.)",
        "bicycle athelete” and its translation competitive cyclist.",
        "In this sense, we claim that English and Japanese are representative of the inherent difficulty of NN compound translation.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.",
        "In 2, we outline the basic MT strategies that exist for translating NN compounds, and in 3 we describe the method by which we evaluate each method.",
        "We then present the results in 4, and analyse the results and suggest an extension to the basic method in 5.",

      "heading": "2.1 Memory-based machine translation",
      "text": [
        "Memory-based machine translation (MBMT) is a simple and commonly-used method for translating NN compounds, whereby translation pairs are stored in a static translation database indexed by their source language strings.",
        "MBMT has the ability to produce consistent, high-quality translations (conditioned on the quality of the original bilingual dictionary) and is therefore suited to translating compounds in closed domains.",
        "Its most obvious drawback is that the method can translate only those source language strings contained in the translation database.",
        "There are a number of ways to populate the translation database used in MBMT, the easiest of which is to take translation pairs directly from a bilingual dictionary (dictionary-driven MBMT or MBMTDICT).",
        "MBMTDICT offers an extremist solution to the idiomaticity problem, in treating all NN compounds as being fully lexicalised.",
        "Overgeneration is not an issue, as all translations are manually determined.",
        "As an alternative to a precompiled bilingual dictionary, translation pairs can be extracted from a parallel corpus (Fung, 1995; Smadja et al., 1996; Ohmori and Higashida, 1999), that is a bilingual document set that is translation-equivalent at the sentence or paragraph level; we term this MT configuration alignment-driven MBMT (or MBMTALIGN).",
        "While this method alleviates the problem of limited scalability, it relies on the existence of a parallel corpus in the desired domain, which is often an unreasonable requirement.",
        "Whereas a parallel corpus assumes translation equivalence, a comparable corpus is simply a crosslingual pairing of corpora from the same domain (Fung and McKeown, 1997; Rapp, 1999; Tanaka and Matsuo, 1999; Tanaka, 2002).",
        "It is possible to extract translation pairs from a comparable corpus by way of the following process (Cao and Li, 2002):",
        "1. extract NN compounds from the source language corpus by searching for NN bigrams (e.g. kikai hoNyaku “machine translation”) 2. compositionally generate translation candidates for each NN compound by accessing translations for each component word and slotting these into translation templates; example JE translation templates for source Japanese string [N N ]J are [N N ]E and [N ofN ]E, where the numeric subscripts indicate word coindexation between Japanese and English (resulting in, e.g., machine translation and translation of machine) 3. use empirical evidence from the target language corpus to select the most plausible translation candidate",
        "We term this process word-to-word compositional MBMT (or MBMTCOMP).",
        "While the coverage of MBMTCOMP is potentially higher than MBMTALIGN due to the greater accessibility of corpus data, it is limited to some degree by the coverage of the simplex translation dictionary used in Step 2 of the translation process.",
        "That is, only those NN compounds whose component nouns occur in the bilingual dictionary can be translated.",
        "Note that both MBMTALIGN and MBMTCOMP lead to a static translation database.",
        "MBMTCOMP is also subject to overgeneration as a result of dynamically generating translation candidates."

        "Dynamic machine translation (DMT) is geared towards translating arbitrary NN compounds.",
        "In this paper, we consider two methods of dynamic translation: word-to-word compositional DMT and interpretation-driven DMT.",
        "Word-to-word compositional DMT (or DMTCOMP) differs from MBMTCOMP only in that the source NN compounds are fed directly into the system rather than extracted out of a source language corpus.",
        "That is, it applies Steps 2 and 3 of the method for MBMTCOMP to an arbitrary source language string.",
        "Interpretation-driven DMT (or DMTINTERP) offers the means to deal with NN compounds where strict word-to-word alignment does not hold.",
        "It generally does this in two stages:",
        "1. use semantics and/or pragmatics to carry out deep analysis of the source NN compound, and map it into some intermediate (i.e. interlingual) semantic representation (Copestake and Lascarides, 1997; Barker and Szpakowicz, 1998; Rosario and Hearst, 2001) 2. generate the translation directly from the semantic representation",
        "DMTINTERP removes any direct source/target language interdependence, and hence solves the problem of overgeneration due to crosslingual bias.",
        "At the same time, it is forced into tackling idiomaticity head-on, by way of interpreting each individual NN compound.",
        "As for DMTCOMP, DMTINTERP suffers from undergeneration.",
        "With DMTINTERP, context must often be called upon in interpreting NN compounds (e.g. apple juice seat (Levi, 1978; Bauer, 1979)), and minimal pairs with sharply-differentiated semantics such as colour/group photograph illustrate the fine-grained distinctions that must be made.",
        "It is interesting to note that, while these examples are difficult to interpret, in an MT context, they can all be translated word-to-word compositionally into Japanese.",
        "That is, apple juice seat translates most naturally as appurujuusu no seki “apple juice seat”,4 which retains the same scope for interpretation as its English counterpart; similarly, colour photograph translates trivially as karaa shashiN “colour photograph” and group photograph as daNtai shashiN “group photograph”.",
        "In these cases, therefore, DMTINTERP offers no advantage over DMTCOMP, while incurring a sizeable cost in producing a full semantic interpretation."

        "The BNC had been tagged and chunked using fnTBL (Ngai and Florian, 2001), and lemmatised using morph (Minnen et al., 2001), while the Mainichi Shimbun had been segmented and tagged using ALT-JAWS.5 For both English and Japanese, we took only those NN bigrams adjoined by non-nouns to ensure that they were not part of a larger compound nominal.",
        "In the case of English, we additionally measured the entropy of the left and right contexts for each NN type, and filtered out all compounds where either entropy value was .6 This was done in an attempt to, once again, exclude NNs which were embedded in larger MWEs, such as service department in social service department.",
        "We next extracted out the 250 most common NN compounds from the English and Japanese data, and from the remaining data, randomly selected a further 250 NN compounds of frequency 10 or greater (out of 20,748 English and 169,899 Japanese NN compounds).",

        "The only difference is that the translation is not a single word so there is at least the potential for word-to-word compositionality to hold:",
        "(e) Concept focus mismatch (C1-2,D2) The source NN compound and translation express the same concept differently due to a shift in semantic focus: (e1) shuushoku katsudou “(lit.)",
        "activity for getting new employment” job hunting.",
        "Here, the mismatch is between the level of directed participation in the process of finding a job.",
        "In Japanese, katsudou “activity” describes simple involvement, whereas hunting signifies a more goal-oriented process.",
        "(f) Lexical gaps (C3,D2) Members of this class cannot be translated compositionally as they are either non-compositional expressions or, more commonly, there is no conventionalised way of expressing the denoted concept in the target language: (f1) zoku giiN “legistors championing the causes of selected industries” These translation pairs pose an insurmountable obstacle for DMTCOMP.",
        "Of these types, (a), (b) and (c) are the most realistically achievable for DMTCOMP, which combined account for about 20% of coverage, suggesting that it would be worthwhile investing effort into resolving them."

        "Here, we propose synonym-based substitution as a means of dealing with synonym pairs from class (c).",
        "The basic model of word substitution can be extending simply by inserting synonym translations as well as direct word translations into the translation",

        "We test-run this extended method for the JE translation task, using the Nihongo Goi-taikei thesaurus (Ikehara et al., 1997) as the source of source language synonyms, and ALTDIC as our translation dictionary.",
        "The Nihongo Goi-taikei thesaurus classifies the contents of ALTDIC into 2,700 semantic classes.",
        "We consider words occurring in the same class to be synonyms, and add in the translations for each.",
        "Note that we test this configuration over only C1-type compounds due to the huge fanout in translation candidates generated by the extended method (although performance is evaluated over the full dataset, with results for non-C1 compounds remaining constant throughout).",
        "One significant disadvantage of synonym-based substitution is that it leads to an exponential increase in the number of translation candidates.",
        "If we analyse the complexity of simple word-based substitution to be where is the average number of translations per word, the complexity of synonym based substitution becomes where is the average number of synonyms per class.",
        "Table 5 shows the translation performance and also translation fanout (average number of translation candidates) for DMTCOMP with and without synonym-based substitution ( sim) over the top 6 and 13 translation templates (TTs).",
        "As baselines, we also present the results for MBMTDICT (MBMTDICT (orig)) and DMTCOMP (DMTCOMP (orig)) in their original configurations (over the full 23 templates and without synonym-substitution for DMTCOMP).",
        "From this, the exponential translation fanout for synonym-based substitution is immediately evident, but accuracy can also be seen to increase by over 4 percentage points through the advent of synonym substitution.",
        "Indeed, the accuracy when using synonym-substitution over only the top 6 translation templates is greater than that for the basic DMTCOMP method, although the number of translation candidates is clearly greater.",
        "Note the marked difference in fanout for MBMTDICT vs. the various incarnations of DMTCOMP, and that considerable faith is placed in the ability of translation selection with DMTCOMP.",
        "While the large number of translation candidates produced by synonym-substitution make translation selection appear intractable, most candidates are meaningless word sequences, which can easily be filtered out based on target language corpus evidence.",
        "Indeed, Tanaka (2002) successfully combines synonym-substitution with translation selection and achieves appreciable gains in accuracy."
