        "In the hybrid car example, the result of this process is a set of phrases like that shown in Figure 1. tures or illustrates the key ideas in a set of documents.",

        "In our calculations, we make use of the relationship betweenforeground and background corpora to formalize the notion of informativeness.",
        "The target document set from which representative keyphrases are extracted is called the foreground corpus.",
        "The document set to which this target set is compared is called the background corpus.",
        "For example, a foreground corpus of the current week’s news would be compared to a background corpus of an entire news article archive to determine that certain phrases, like “press conference” are typical of news stories in general and do not capture the particulars of current events in the way that “national museum of antiquities” does.",
        "Other examples of foreground and background corpora include: a web site for a certain company and web data in general; a newsgroup and the whole Usenet archive; and research papers of a certain conference and research papers in general.",
        "In order to get a ranked keyphrase list, we need to combine both phraseness and informativeness into a single score.",
        "A sequence of words can be a good phrase but not an informative one, like the expression “in spite of.” A word sequence can be informative for a particular domain but not a phrase; “toyota, honda, ford” is an example of a non-phrase sequence of informative words in a hybrid car domain.",

        "The basic idea of using BLRT for text analysis is to consider a word sequence as a repeated sequence of binary trials comparing each word in a corpus to a target word, and use the likelihood ratio of two hypotheses that (i) two events, observed times out of total tokens and times out of total tokens respectively, are drawn from different distributions and (ii) from the same distribution.",

        "We would like to have a parameter-free and robust way of combining scores.",
        "Inappropriate symmetry BLRT tests to see if two random variables are independent or not.",
