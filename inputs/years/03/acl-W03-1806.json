        "Multiword units (MWUs) include a large range of linguistic phenomena, such as compound nouns (e.g. interior designer), phrasal verbs (e.g. run through), adverbial locutions (e.g. on purpose), compound determinants (e.g. an amount of), prepositional locutions (e.g. in front of) and institutionalized phrases (e.g. con carne).",
        "MWUs are frequently used in everyday language, usually to precisely express ideas and concepts that cannot be compressed into a single word.",
        "As a consequence, their identification is a crucial issue for applications that require some degree of semantic processing (e.g. machine translation, summarization, information retrieval).",
        "In recent years, there has been a growing awareness in the Natural Language Processing (NLP) community of the problems that MWUs pose and the need for their robust handling.",
        "For that purpose, syntactical (Didier Bourigault, 1993), statistical (Frank Smadja, 1993; Ted Dunning, 1993; Gaël Dias, 2002) and hybrid syntaxico-statistical methodologies (Béatrice Daille, 1996; Jean-Philippe Goldman et al.",
        "2001) have been proposed.",
        "In this paper, we propose an original hybrid system called HELAS1 that extracts MWU candidates from part-of-speech tagged corpora.",
        "Unlike classical hybrid systems that manually predefine local part-of-speech patterns of interest (Béatrice Daille, 1996; Jean-Philippe Goldman et al.",
        "2001), our solution automatically identifies relevant syntactical patterns from the corpus.",
        "Word statistics are then combined with the endogenously acquired linguistic information in order to extract the most relevant sequences of words i.e. MWU candidates.",
        "Technically, we conjugate the Mutual Expectation (ME) association measure with the acquisition process called GenLocalMaxs (Gaël Dias, 2002) in a five step process.",
        "First, the part-of-speech tagged corpus is divided into two sub-corpora: one containing words and one containing part-of-speech tags.",
        "Each sub-corpus is then segmented into a set of positional ngrams i.e. ordered vectors of textual units.",
        "Third, the ME independently evaluates the degree of cohesiveness of each positional ngram i.e. any positional ngram of words and any positional ngram of part-of-speech tags.",
        "A combination of both MEs is then used to evaluate the global degree of cohesiveness of any sequence of words associated with its respective part-of-speech tag sequence.",
        "Finally, the GenLocalMaxs retrieves all the MWU candidates by evidencing local maxima of association measure values thus avoiding the definition of global thresholds.",
        "The overall architecture can be seen in Figure 1.",
        "Compared to existing hybrid systems, the benefits of HELAS are clear.",
        "By avoiding human intervention in the definition of syntactical patterns, it provides total",
        "flexibility of use.",
        "Indeed, the system can be used for any language without any specific tuning.",
        "HELAS also allows the identification of various MWUs like phrasal verbs, adverbial locutions, compound determinants, prepositional locutions and institutionalized phrases.",
        "Finally, it responds to some extent to the affirmation of Benoît Habert and Christian Jacquemin (1993) that claim that “existing hybrid systems do not sufficiently tackle the problem of the interdependency between the filtering stage [the definition of syntactical patterns] and the acquisition process [the scoring and the election of relevant sequences of words] as they propose that these two steps should be independent”.",
        "The article is divided into five main sections: (1) we introduce the related work; (2) we present the text corpus segmentation into positional ngrams; (3) we define the Mutual Expectation and a new combined association measure; (4) we propose the GenLocalMaxs algorithm as the acquisition process; Finally, in (5), we present some results over the Brown Corpus."

        "For the purpose of MWU extraction, syntactical, statistical and hybrid syntaxico-statistical methodologies have been proposed.",
        "On one hand, purely linguistic systems (Didier Bourigault, 1993) propose to extract relevant MWUs by using techniques that analyse specific syntactical structures in the texts.",
        "However, these methodologies suffer from their monolingual basis as the systems require highly specialised linguistic techniques to identify clues that isolate possible MWU candidates.",
        "On the other hand, purely statistical systems (Frank Smadja, 1993; Ted Dunning, 1993; Gaël Dias, 2002) extract discriminating MWUs from text corpora by means of association measure regularities.",
        "As they use plain text corpora and only require the information appearing in texts, such systems are highly flexible and extract relevant units independently from the domain and the language of the input text.",
        "However, these methodologies can only identify textual associations in the context of their usage.",
        "As a consequence, many relevant structures can not be introduced directly into lexical databases as they do not guarantee adequate linguistic structures for that purpose.",
        "Finally, hybrid syntactico- statistical systems (Béatrice Daille, 1996; Jean-Philippe Goldman et al.",
        "2001) define co-occurrences of interest in terms of syntactical patterns and statistical regularities.",
        "Thus, such systems reduce the searching space to groups of words that correspond to a priori defined syntactical patterns (e.g. Adj+Noun, Noun+Prep+Noun) and apply statistical scores to identify the most relevant sequences of words.",
        "One major drawback of such systems is that they do not deal with a great proportion of interesting MWUs (e.g. phrasal verbs, prepositional locutions).",
        "Moreover, they lack flexibility as the syntactical patterns have to be revised whenever the targeted language changes.",
        "In order to overcome these difficulties, we propose an original architecture that combines word statistics with endogenously acquired linguistic information.",
        "We base our study on two assumptions.",
        "On one hand, a great deal of studies in lexicography and terminology assess that most of the MWUs evidence well-known morpho-syntactic structures (Gaston Gross, 1996).",
        "On the other hand, MWUs are recurrent combinations of words.",
        "Indeed, according to Benoît Habert and Christian Jacquemin (1993), the MWUs may represent a fifth of the overall surface of a text.",
        "Consequently, it is reasonable to think that the syntactical patterns embodied by the MWUs may be endogenously identified by using statistical scores over texts of part-of-speech tags exactly in the same manner as word dependencies are identified in corpora of words.",
        "So, the global degree of cohesiveness of any sequence of words may be evaluated by a combination of its degree of cohesiveness of words and the degree of cohesiveness of its associated part-of-speech tag sequence (See Figure 1).",
        "Compared to existing systems, the benefits of our architecture are clear.",
        "By avoiding human intervention in the definition of syntactical patterns, (1) HELAS provides total flexibility of use being independent of the targeted",
        "language and (2) it allows the identification of various MWUs like phrasal verbs, adverbial locutions, compound determinants, prepositional locutions and institutionalized phrases.",

        "In general terms, a MWU can be defined as a specific continuous or discontinuous sequence of words in a (2.F+1)-word size window context (i.e. F words to the left of a pivot word, F words to the right of the same pivot word and the pivot word itself).",

        "As many authors assess (Frank Smadja, 1993; John Justeson and Slava Katz, 1995), deciding whether a sequence of words is a multiword unit or not is a tricky problem.",
        "For that purpose, different definitions of multiword unit have been proposed.",
        "One of the most successful attempts can be attributed to Gaston Gross (1996) that classifies multiword units into six groups and provides techniques to determine their belonging.",
        "As a consequence, we intend as multiword unit any compound noun (e.g. interior designer), compound determinant (e.g. an amount of), verbal locution (e.g. run through), adverbial locution (e.g. on purpose), adjectival locution (e.g. dark blue) or prepositional locution (e.g. in front of).",
        "The analysis of the results has been done intramuros although we are aware that an external independent cross validation would have been more suited.",
        "However, it was not logistically possible to do so and by using Gaston Gross’s classification and methodology, we narrow the human error evaluation as much as possible.",
        "Technically, we have randomly extracted and analysed 200 positional 2grams, 200 positional 3grams and 100 positional 4grams for each value of a.",
        "For the specific case of positional 5grams and 6grams, all the sequences have been analysed.",
        "Precision results of this analysis are given in table 8 and show that word dependencies and part-of-speech tag dependencies may both play an important role in the identification of relevant sequences.",
        "Indeed, values of a between 0.4 and 0.5 seem to lead to optimum results.",
        "Knowing that most extracted sequences are positional 2grams or positional 3grams, the global precision results approximate the results given by 2grams and 3grams.",
        "In these conditions, the best results are for a=0.5 reaching an average precision of 62 %.",
        "This would mean that word dependencies and part-of-speech tags contribute equally to multiword unit identification.",
        "A deeper look at the results evidences interesting regularities as shown in figure 4.",
        "Indeed, the curves for 4grams, 5grams and 6grams are reasonably steady along the X axis evidencing low results.",
        "This means, to some extent, that that our system does not seem to be able to tackle successfully multiword units with more than three words.",
        "In fact, neither a total focus on words or on part-of-speech tags seems to change the extraction results.",
        "However, the importance of these results must be weakened as they represent a small proportion of the extracted structures.",
        "On the other hand, the curves for 2grams and 3grams show different behaviours.",
        "For the 3gram case, it seems that the syntactical structure plays an important role in the identification process.",
        "Indeed, precision falls down drastically when the focus passes to word dependencies.",
        "This is mainly due to the extraction of recurrent sequences of words that do not embody multiword unit syntactical structures like [been able to] or [can still be].",
        "As 2grams are concerned, the situation is different.",
        "In fact, it seems that too much focus on either words or part-of-speech tags leads to unsatisfactory results.",
        "Indeed, optimum results are obtained for a balance between both criteria.",
        "This result can be explained by the fact that there exist many recurrent sequences of two words in a corpus.",
        "However, most of them are not multiword units like [of the] or [can be].",
        "For that reason, only a balanced weight on part-of-speech tag and word dependencies may identify relevant two word sequences.",
        "However, not-so-high precision results show that two-word sequences still remain a tricky problem for our extractor as it is difficult to filter out very frequent patterns that embody meaningless syntactical structures."

      "heading": "7 Conclusion",
      "text": [
        "This paper describes an original hybrid system that extracts multiword unit candidates by endogenously identifying relevant syntactical patterns from the corpus and by combining word statistics with the acquired linguistic information.",
        "As a result, by avoiding human intervention in the definition of syntactical patterns, (1) HELAS provides total flexibility of use being independent of the targeted language and (2) it allows the identification of various MWUs like compound nouns, compound determinants, verbal locutions, adverbial locutions, prepositional locutions and adjectival locutions without defining any threshold or using lists of stop words.",
        "The system has been tested on the Brown Corpus leading to encouraging results evidenced by a precision score of 62 % for the best configuration.",
        "The system will soon be available on http://helas.di.ubi.pt."
