        "Based on POS annotation provided by the CLAWS tagger (Garside and Smith, 1997), USAS assigns a set of semantic tags to each item in running text and then attempts to disambiguate the tags in order to choose the most likely candidate in each context.",
        "Items can be single words or multiword expressions.",
        "The semantic tags indicate semantic fields which group together word senses that are related by virtue of their being connected at some level of generality with the same mental concept.",
        "The groups include not only synonyms and antonyms but also hypernyms and hyponyms.",
        "The initial tagset was loosely based on Tom McArthur's Longman Lexicon of Contemporary English (McArthur, 1981) as this appeared to offer the most appropriate thesaurus type classification of word senses for this kind of analysis.",
        "The tagset has since been considerably revised in the light of practical tagging problems met in the course of the research.",

        "These resources were created manually by extending and expanding dictionaries from the CLAWS tagger with observations from large text corpora.",
        "Generally, only the base form of nouns and verbs are stored in the lexicon and a lemmati-sation procedure is used for lookup.",
        "However, the base form is not sufficient in some cases.",

        "At present, in cases where a word has more than one syntactic tag, it is duplicated (i.e. each syntactic tag is given a separate entry).",
        "The semantic tags for each entry in the lexicon are arranged in approximate rank frequency order to assist in manual post editing, and to allow for gross automatic selection of the common tag, subject to weighting by domain of discourse.",
        "In the multi-word-unit list, each template consists of a pattern of words and part-of-speech tags.",
        "The semantic tags for each template are arranged in rank frequency order in the same way as the lexicon.",

        "However, the second example (ski boot) combines the clothing (B5) and sports (K5.1) fields into one tag.",
        "The pattern on the left of each template consists of a sequence of words joined to POS tags with the underscore character.",
        "The words and POS fields can include the asterisk wild-card character to allow for inflectional variants and to write more powerful templates with wider coverage.",
        "USAS templates can match discontinuous MWUs, and this is illustrated by the first example, which includes optional intervening POS items marked within curly brackets.",

USAS makes use of seven major techniques or sources of information in phase II.",

        "The Meter Corpus chosen as the test data is a collection of court reports from the British Press Association (PA) and some leading British newspapers (Gaizauskas 2001; Clough et al., 2002).",
        "In our experiment, we used the newspaper part of the corpus containing 774 articles with more than 250,000 words.",
        "It provides a homogeneous corpus (in the sense that the reports come from a restricted domain of court events) and is thus a good source from which to extract domain-specific MWEs.",
        "Another reason for choosing this corpus is that it has not been used in training the USAS system.",
        "As an open test, we assume the results of the experiment should reflect true capability of our approach for real-life applications.",
        "The current USAS tagger may assign multiple possible semantic tags for a term when it fails to disambiguate between them.",
        "As mentioned previously, the first one denotes the most likely semantic field of the term.",
        "Therefore, in our experiment we chose the first tag when such situations arose.",
        "A major problem we faced in our experiment is the definition of a MWE.",
        "Although it has been several years since people started to work on MWE extraction, we found that there is, as yet, no available “clear-cut” definition for MWEs.",
        "We noticed various possible definitions have been suggested for MWE/MWU.",
        "For example, Smadja (1993) suggests a basic characteristic of collocations and multiword units is recurrent, domain-dependent and cohesive lexical clusters.",
        "Sag et el.",
        "(2001b) suggest that MWEs can roughly be defined as “idiosyncratic interpretations that cross word boundaries (or spaces)”.",
        "Biber et al.",
        "(2003) describe MWEs as lexical bundles, which they go on to define as combinations of words that can be repeated frequently and tend to be used frequently by many different speakers/writers within a register.",
        "Although it is not difficult to interpret these deifications in theory, things became much more complicated when we undertook our practical checking of the MWE candidates.",
        "Quite often, we experienced disagreement between us about whether or not to accept a MWE candidate as a good one.",
        "In practice, we generally followed Biber et al.’s definition, i.e. accept a candidate MWE as a good one if it can repeatedly co-occur in the corpus.",

        "Because the MWEs in the METER Corpus are not marked-up, we could not automatically calculate the number of MWEs contained in the corpus.",

        "Obviously it is not practical to manually check though the whole corpus within the limited time allowed.",

        "In this section, we analyze the results of the MWE extraction in detail for a full evaluation of our approach to MWE extraction.",
        "Overall, after we processed the test corpus, the USAS tagger extracted 4,195 MWE candidates from the test corpus.",
        "After manually checking through the candidates, we selected 3,792 as good MWEs, resulting in overall precision of 90.39%.",
        "As we explained earlier, due to the difficulty of obtaining the total number of true MWEs in the entire test corpus, we had to estimate recall of the MWE extraction on a sample corpus.",
        "In detail, we first randomly selected fifty texts containing 14,711 words from the test corpus, then manually marked-up good MWEs in the sample texts, finally counted the number of the marked-up MWUs.",
        "As a result, 1,511 good MWEs were found in the sample.",
        "Since the number of automatically extracted good MWEs in the sample is 595, the recall on the sample is calculated as follows: Recall=(595÷1511)× 100%=39.38%.",
        "Considering the homogenous feature of the test data, we assume this local recall is roughly approximate to the global recall of the test corpus.",
        "To analyze the performance of USAS in respect to the different semantic field categories, we divided candidates according to the assigned semantic tag, and calculated the precision for each of them.",
        "Table 1 lists these precisions, sorting the semantic fields by the number of MWE candidates (refer to section 3 for definitions of the twenty-one main semantic field categories).",
        "As shown in this table, the USAS semantic tagger obtained precisions between 91.23% to 100.00% for each semantic field except for the field of “names and grammatical words” denoted by Z.",
        "As Z was the biggest field (containing 45.39% of the total MWEs and 43.12% of the accepted MWEs), we examined these MWEs more closely.",
        "We discovered that numerous pairs of words are tagged as person names (Z1) and geographical names (Z2) by mistake, e.g. Blackfriars crown (tagged as Z1), stabbed Constance (tagged as Z2) etc.",
        "Another possible factor that affects the performance of the USAS tagger is the length of the MWEs.",
        "To observe the performance of our approach from this perspective, we grouped the MWEs by their lengths, and then checked precision for each of the categories.",
        "Table 2 shows the results (once again, they are sorted in descending order by MWE lengths).",
        "As we might expect, the number of MWEs decreases as the length increases.",
        "In fact, bi-grams alone constitute 80.52% and 81.88% of the candidate and accepted MWEs respectively.",
        "The precision also showed a generally increasing trend as the MWE length increases, but with a major divergence of trigrams.",
        "One main type of error occurred on trigrams is that those with the structure of CIW(capital-initial word) + conjunction + CIW tend to be tagged as Z2 (geographical name).",
        "The table shows relatively high precision for longer MWEs, reaching 100% for 6 grams.",
        "Because the longest MWEs extracted have six words, no longer MWEs could be examined.",
        "As discussed earlier, purely statistical algorithms of MWE extraction generally filter out candidates of low frequencies.",
        "However, such low-frequency terms in fact form major part of MWEs in most corpora.",
        "In our study, we attempted to investigate the possibility of extracting low frequency MWEs by using semantic field annotation.",
        "We divided MWEs into different frequency groups, then checked precision for each of the categories.",
        "Table 3 shows the results, which are sorted by the candidate MWE frequencies.",
        "As we expected, 69.46% of the candidate MWEs and 68.22% of the accepted MWEs occur in the corpus only once or twice.",
        "This means that, with a frequency filter of Min(f)=3, a purely statistical algorithm would exclude more than half of the candidates from the process.",
        "tionship between the precisions and the frequencies.",
        "Generally, we would expect better precisions for MWEs of higher frequencies, as higher co-occurrence frequencies are expected to reflect stronger affinity between the words within the MWEs.",
        "By and large, slightly higher precisions were obtained for the latter groups of higher frequencies (5–7, 8-20 and 21-117) than those for the preceding lower frequency groups, i.e. 94.07%-96.64% versus 87.43%-92.67%.",
        "Nevertheless, for the latter three groups of the higher frequencies (5-7, 8-20 and 21–117) the precision did not increase as the frequency increases, as we initially expected.",
        "When we made a closer examination of the error MWEs in this frequency range, we found that some frequent domain-specific terms are misclassified by the USAS tagger.",
        "For example, since the texts in the test corpus are newspaper reports of court stories, many law courts (e.g. Manchester crown court, Norwich crown court) are frequently mentioned throughout the corpus, causing high frequencies of such terms (f=20 and f=31 respectively).",
        "Unfortunately, the templates used in the USAS tagger did not capture them as complete terms.",
        "Rather, fragments were assigned a Z1 person name tag (e.g. Manchester crown).",
        "A solution to this type of problem is to improve the multiword unit templates used in the USAS tagger.",
        "Other possible solutions may include incorporating a statistical algorithm to help detect boundaries of complete MWEs.",
        "When we examined the error distribution within the semantic fields more closely, we found that most errors occurred within the Z and T categories (refer to Table 1).",
        "The errors occurring in these semantic field categories and their subdivisions make up 76.18% of the total errors (403).",
        "Table 4 shows the error distribution across 14 subdivisions (for definitions of these subdivisions, see: website: http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/ucrel/usas).",
        "Notice that the majority of errors are from four semantic sub-categories: Z1, Z2, Z3 and T1.3.",
        "Notice, also, that the first two of these account for 60.55% of the total errors.",
        "This shows that the main cause of the errors in the USAS tool is the algorithm and lexical entries used for identifying names - personal and geographical and, to a lesser extent, the algorithm and lexical entries for identifying periods of time.",
        "If these components of the USAS can be improved, a much higher precision can be expected.",
        "In sum, our evaluation shows that our semantic approach to MWE extraction is efficient in identifying MWEs, in particular those of lower frequencies.",
        "In addition, a reasonably wide lexical coverage is obtained, as indicated by the recall of 39.38%, which is important for terminology building.",
