        "The eventual vision for computational lexicons is to enable universal access to sophisticated linguistic information, which in turn will serve as a central component for content-based information management on the web.",
        "This demands, first of all, some standardized means to represent complex lexical information while retaining the flexibility required to accommodate diverse approaches to lexicon organization and use.",
        "To this end, the ISLE1 ( International Standards for Language Engineering) Computational Lexicons Working Group (CLWG) has designed MILE (Multilingual ISLE Lexical Entry), a general schema for the encoding of multilingual lexical information intended as a meta-entry that can serve as a standardized representational layer for multilingual lexical resources.",
        "MILE consists of an incremental definition of object-oriented layers for lexical description that will enable open and distributed lexicons, with elements possibly residing in different sites of the web.",
        "The defined lexical objects are intended for use by lexicon and application developers to build and target lexical data at high level of abstraction.",
        "The Resource Definition Framework (RDF) and the Ontology Web Language (OWL) recently developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) build upon the XML web infrastructure to enable the creation of a Semantic Web, wherein web objects can be classified according to their properties, and the semantics of their relations (links) to other web objects can be precisely defined.",
        "This in turn will enable powerful inferencing capabilities that can adapt language processing applications to particular contexts.",
        "The MILE lexical entry is an ideal structure for rendering via RDF/OWL.",
        "It consists of a hierarchy of lexical objects that are built up in a layered fashion by combining atomic data categories via clearly defined relations.",
        "The overall architecture is modular and layered, as described in Atkins et al.",
        "(2002) and Calzolari et al.",
        "(2003).",
        "On the horizontal dimension, independent, linked modules target different dimensions of lexical entries.",
        "On the vertical dimension, the layered organization allows for varying degrees of granularity in lexical descriptions, allowing both “shallow” and “deep” lexical representations.",
        "RDF’s class hierarchy mechanism, together with its capacity to specify named relations among objects in the various classes, provide a web-based means to represent this architecture.2 Furthermore, because RDF allows for instantiating objects in any defined class and subsequently referring to them as the target of appropriate relations, lexical objects at any level of specificity can be predefined.",
        "This provides an important mechanism for standardization of lexical elements, since these elements may be pre-defined, organized in class hierarchies with inherited properties, and used “off-the-shelf” as needed.",
        "In this paper we describe the overall model for MILE lexical entries and provide an instantiation of the model in RDF/OWL.",

        "The MLM defines each class by specifying its attributes and the relations among them.",
        "Classes represent notions like syntactic feature, syntactic phrase, predicate, semantic relation, synset, etc.",
        "Instances of MLCs are the MILE Data Categories (MDC).",
        "So for instance, NP and VP are data category instances of the class <Phrase>, and SUBJ and OBJ are data category instances of the class <Function>.",
        "Each MDC is identified by a URI.",
        "MDC can be either user defined or reside in a shared repository.",
        "2. lexical operations: special lexical entities",
        "which allow users to state conditions and perform complex operations over lexical entries.",
        "They will for instance allow lexicographers to establish multilingual conditions, link the slots within two different syntactic frames, link semantic arguments with syntactic slots, etc.",
        "The MLM is described with Entity-Relationship (E-R) diagrams defining the entities of the lexical model and the way they can be combined to design an actual lexical entry.",
        "As such, the MLM does not correspond to a specific lexical entry, but is rather an entry schema corresponding to a lexical meta-entry.",
        "This means that different possible lexical entries can be designed as instances of the schema provided by the MLM.",
        "Instance entries might therefore differ for the type of information they include (e.g. morphological, syntactic, semantic, monolingual or multilingual, etc.",
        "), and for the depth of lexical description.",
