        "In a recently started EU project focusing on the integration of Information Extraction and Data Mining techniques, we aim at avoiding the problem of incompatibility among different tools by defining a Common Annotation Scheme internal to the project.",

        "It is by now widely accepted that some W3C standards (such as XML and RDF) provide a convenient and practical framework for the creation of field-specific markup languages (e.g. MathML, VoiceXML).",
        "However XML provides only a common \"alphabet\" for interchange among tools, the steps that need to be taken before there is any real sharing are still many (just as many human languages share the same alphabets, that does not mean that they can be mutually intelligible).",
        "The necessary step to achieve mutual understanding in Language Resources is to create a common data model.",
        "The existence of a standard brings many other advantages, like the ability to automatically compare the results of different tools which provide the same functionality, from the very basic (e.g. tok-enization) to the most complex (e.g. discourse representation).",
        "Some of the NIST-supported competitive evaluations (e.g. MUC) greatly benefited by the existence of scoring tools, which could automatically compare the results of each participant against a gold standard.",
        "The creation of such tools (and their effectiveness) was possible only because the organizing institute had predefined and \"imposed\" upon the participants the annotation scheme.",
        "However, that sort of \"brute force\" approach might not always produce the best results.",
        "It is important to involve the community in the definition of such standards at an early stage, so that all the possible concerns can be met and a wider acceptance can be achieved.",
        "Another clear benefit of agreed standards is that they will increase interoperability among different tools.",
        "It is not enough to have publicly available APIs to ensure that different tools can be integrated.",
        "In fact, if their representation languages (their \"data vocabulary\") are too divergent, no integration will be possible (or at least it will require a considerable mapping effort).",
        "For all the above reasons we enthusiastically support any concertation work, aimed at establishing common foundations for the field.",
        "In a recently started EU project (\"Parmenides\") focusing on the integration of Information Extraction and Data Mining techniques (for Text Mining) we aim at avoiding the problem of incompatibility among different tools by defining a Common Annotation Scheme internal to the project.",
        "However, when the project was started (Sep 2002) we were unaware of the standardization effort of ISO TC37 SC4, and so we commenced once again trying to define our own schema.",

        "In this paper we will describe the approach followed so far in the definition of the Parmenides Common Annotation Scheme, even if its relation with ISO is still only superficial.",
        "In the forthcoming months our intention is to explore possible synergies between our work and the current initiatives in ISO TC37 SC4, with the aim to get at a Parmenides annotation scheme which is conformant to the approach currently discussed in the standardization committee."
