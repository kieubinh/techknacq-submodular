        "The basic principle of the SOM is that our knowledge organization at higher levels is created during learning by algorithms that promote self-organization in an spatial order (see [5],[6],[7],[8],[9],[10],[11],[12],[28]).",
        "Thus, the architecture form of the SOM network is based on the understanding that the representation of data features might assume the form of a self-organizing feature map that is geometrically organized as a grid or lattice.",
        "In the pure form, the SOM defines an \"elastic net\" of points (parameter, reference, or codebook vectors) that are fitted to the input data space to approximate its density function in an ordered way.",
        "The algorithm takes thus a set of N-dimensional objects as input and maps them onto nodes of a two-dimensional grid, resulting in an orderly feature map [9].",
        "A layer of two-dimensional array of competitive output nodes is used to form the feature map.",
        "The lattice type of array can be defined to be square, rectangular, hexagonal, or even irregular.",
        "Every input is connected to every output node via a variable connection weight.",
        "It is the self-organizing property.",
        "The SOM belongs to the category of the unsupervised competitive learning networks [4],[11],[13].",
        "It is called competitive learning because there is a set of nodes that compete with one another to become active.",
        "To this category belongs also the adaptive resonance theory (ART) model of Grossberg and Carpenter, as well as the self-organizing maps discussed in this paper.",
        "In the SOM, the competitive learning means also that a number of nodes is comparing the same input data with their internal parameters, and the node with the best match (say, \"winner\") is then tuning itself to that input, in addition the best matching node activates its topographical neighbors in the network to take part in tuning to the same input.",
        "More a node is distant from the winning node the learning is weaker.",
        "It is also called unsupervised learning because no information concerning the correct classes is provided to the network during its training.",
        "Like any unsupervised clustering method, the SOM can be used to find classes in the input data, and to identify an unknown data vector with one of the classes.",
        "Moreover, the SOM represents the results of its classing process in an ordered two-dimensional space (R2).",
        "A mapping from a high-dimensional data space Rn onto a two dimensional lattice of nodes is thus defined.",
        "Such a mapping can effectively be used to visualize metric ordering relations of input data.",
        "As Kohonen [9] says: \"The main applications of the SOM are in the visualization of complex data in a two dimensional display, and creation of abstractions like in many classing techniques.\" The SOM algorithm is presented in details in ([2],[9],[12],[13],[19]).",
        "It consists of two basic procedures: (1) selecting a winning node and (2) updating weights of the winning node and its neighboring nodes.",
        "This preliminary learning phase is not straightforward process [9].",
        "It necessitates several different learning steps, single map evaluations, and comparisons between a lot of generated maps in order to find at least a reliable map, at most an optimal one [13],[32].",
        "Let x(t) = {x,(t), x2(t),..., xN(t)} be the input vector selected at time t, and Wk(t) = {Wk,(t), Wk2(t),..., WkN(t)} the weights for node k at time t. The smallest of the Euclidean distances ||x(t) – Wk(t) ||can be made to define the winning node s:",
        "After the winning node s thus selected, the weights of s and the weights of the nodes in a defined neighborhood (for example all nodes within a square or a cycle around the winning node) are adjusted so that similar input patterns are more likely to select this node again.",
        "This is achieved through the following computation:",
        "for 1 < – i < – N where a(t) is a gain term (0 < – a(t) < – 1) that decreases in time and converges to 0, and h(t) is the neighborhood function.",
        "Once the SOM algorithm is achieved, the data can be set to the nodes of the map.",
        "For each input data vector, the winning node is selected according to the algorithm first step presented above, and the data are affected to this selected node.",
        "In the quantitative studies of science, the Kohonen self-organizing maps have been successfully used for mapping scientific journal networks [2], and also author co-citation data [33].",
        "Maps have been also successfully used for several other applications in the general area of data analysis like for classifying meeting output [30], for classing socio-economic data [32] and for documentary database contents mapping and browsing [13],14].",
        "Kaski et al.",
        "have implemented a specific adaptation of SOM, named WEBSOM, for the analysis of important document collections [6].",
        "WEBSOM main characteristic is to include strategies for reducing the dimension of the entry data descriptions by using random projection techniques applied on word histograms extracted from the document contents.",
        "WEBSOM method has been tested for patents abstract analysis [7].",
        "Nevertheless, as this method only manages such an analysis in a global way, it can only provide the analyst with general overview of the topics covered by the patents along with their interactions.",
        "A more exhaustive description of all the SOM applications might be found in [32].",
        "After the map building, the main characteristics of the classes resulting from the topographical classification process have to be highlighted to the analyst in order to provide him an overview (i.e. a global summary) of the analysis results.",
        "This task is difficult because the profiles of the obtained classes are mostly complex weighted combination of indexes extracted from the data.",
        "We have previously observed that single extraction strategy like the one proposed by [17] could cause shortcomings or mistakes in the interpretation of the database contents.",
        "The first set of solutions we proposed for solving this problem, like class labeling and zoning strategies or generalization mechanisms, are presented in [14].",
        "Figure 3 of section 4 presents a map resulting from these processes.",
        "In all the following sections, we will consider that the classification process deals with electronic documents associated with their description in the form of index vectors.",

        "The classical evaluation measures for the quality of a classification are based on the intraclass inertia and the interclass inertia [16][17][25].",
        "Thanks to these two measures, a classification is considered as good if it possesses low intraclass inertia as compared to its interclass inertia.",
        "However, in the case of a Kohonen classification, as well as for many other numerical classification methods, these measures are often strongly biased, mainly because the intrinsic dimensions of the classes profiles (number of non-zero components in the profiles) are not of the same order of magnitude than the intrinsic dimensions of the data profiles2.",
        "It is especially true in the documentary domain where the number of indexes in the documents is extremely low as compared to the dimension of their overall description space.",
        "A promising way we have found in order to more precisely highlight the main characteristics of the classes of the map and to validate the thematic deductions between the maps consists in coupling the MultiSOM model with a symbolic model using Galois lattice conceptual classification of the patents regarding the same viewpoints as the one used for the map building.",
        "This approach is extensively described in [31].",
        "A Galois lattice model could also be considered as a pure natural elementary classifier.",
        "Indeed, it groups the data by directly considering their intrinsic properties (i.e. without any preliminary construction of class profiles).",
        "Hence, one might derive from its behavior news class quality evaluation factors which can be substituted to the measures of inertia for validating the intrinsic properties of the numerical classes.",
        "For the sake of user-orientation, our measures will be based in a parallel way on the recall and precision criteria which are extensively used from evaluating 2 In the SOM method, a second bias is generated by the class construction process that tends to maintain the topographic properties of the map by enhancing the similarities between neighboring classes.",
