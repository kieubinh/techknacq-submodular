        "In the field of information retrieval, there have been held successive evaluation workshops, such as TREC [8], CREF [1], and NTCIR [5], to build and utilize various kinds of test collections.",
        "In the Third NTCIR Workshop (NTCIR-3), which was held from June 2001 to December 2003, a serious effort was first made in the “Patent Retrieval Task” to explore information retrieval targeting patent documents.",
        "The goal of Patent Retrieval Task is to provide test collections for enhancing research on patent information processing, from patent retrieval to patent mining.",
        "Although there exist many commercial patent retrieval systems and services, patent retrieval has not been paid much attention in the research field of information retrieval.",
        "One of the reasons is the lack of test collection on patent.",
        "TREC used patent documents as a part of the document collections, but there was no treatment specially applied to the patent collection.",
        "In SIGIR2000, the first workshop on patent retrieval was held [4] and there were many fruitful discussions on the current status and future directions of patent retrieval.",
        "The workshop convinced us that there was the need of test collections specifically for patents.",
        "We then asked for PATOLIS Co. [7] to provide patent collections for the patent retrieval task.",
        "Consequently, we could release three kinds of patent collections; those were two years’ Japanese full texts, five years’ Japanese abstracts, and five years’ English abstracts.",
        "At the same time, we could fortunately have cooperation with JIPA (Japan Intellectual Property Association) [3] in creating search topics and assessing the relevance.",
        "Since each member of JIPA belongs to the intellectual property division in her/his company, they are all experts in patent searching.",
        "All the above contributions enabled us to kick off the first evaluation workshop designed for patent information processing.",
        "There are various phases and aspects in patent information processing.",
        "For example, various kinds of users (researchers, patent searchers, business managers, and so on) search patents for various purposes (technical survey, finding conflicting applications, buying/selling patents, and so on).",
        "Corresponding to each situation, an appropriate search model should be developed.",
        "The standard of the relevance judgments may also depend on each situation.",
        "In some cases, retrieving relevant patents is not enough but further analysis on the retrieved patents might be necessary.",
        "For example, creating a patent map of a product would clarify the patent relations between the techniques used to make the product.",
        "Cross-lingual patent retrieval is also important when applying patents to foreign countries.",
        "All of these are within scope of our project and this task was the first step toward our goal."

        "In this workshop, we focused on a simple task of technical survey.",
        "End-users we assumed in the task were novice users, for example, business managers.",
        "The major reason of adopting such general task was that we could only use the two years’ full texts that were not enough for trying more patent-oriented task like finding conflicting applications from patents.",
        "To fit the task to a real situation, we used Japanese news articles as the original sources of search topics, so the task was conducting cross-database retrieval, searching patents by news articles.",
        "The task assumed the following situation that is depicted in Figure 1.",
        "When a business manager looks through news articles and is interested in one of them, she/he clips it out and asks a searcher to find related patents to the clipping.",
        "The manager passes the clipping to the searcher along with her/his memorandum, and this clipping with memorandum became the search topic in this task.",
        "The memorandum helps the searcher to have the exact information need the manager has, when the clipping contains non-relevant topics or the clipping has little description on the information need.",
        "Task participants played the role of the searcher and tried to retrieve relevant patents to the clipping.",
        "Since the purpose of the searching was technical survey, the claim part in patent was not treated specifically in assessing the relevance.",
        "Patent documents were treated as if those were technical papers.",
        "Cross-database retrieval itself is so general that techniques investigated in the task can be applied to various combinations of databases.",
        "This is another purpose of the task.",
        "We prepared search topics in four languages, Japanese, English, Korean, and Chinese (both traditional and simplified).",
        "Participants could try cross-lingual patent retrieval by using one of the non-Japanese topics.",
        "Unfortunately, only two groups submitted cross-lingual results and both of them used English topics.",
        "In addition to the technical survey task explained so far, we arranged the optional task, where participants could try anything they want as far as they used the patent collections provided.",
        "One of the purposes of this free-styled task is to explore next official tasks."

        "In this section, we briefly review the characteristics of patent applications (patent documents).",
        "• There are structures, for example, claims, purposes, effects, and embodiments of the invention.",
        "• Although the claim part is the most important in patent, it is written in an unusual style especially for Japanese patent; all the subtopics are written in single sentence.",
        "• To enlarge the scope of invention, vague or general terms are often used in claims.",
        "• Patents include much technical terminology.",
        "Applicants may define and use their original terms not used in other patents.",
        "• There are large variations in length.",
        "The longest patent in our collections contains about 30,000 Japanese words!",
        "The search models would be significantly different between industries, for example, between chemical / pharmaceutical industries and computers / machinery / electric industries.",
        "• Classification exists.",
        "IPC (International Patent Classification) is the most popular one.",
        "• The criterion of evaluation depends on the purpose of searching.",
        "For example, high recall is required for finding conflicting applications.",
        "• In some industries, images are important to",
        "judge the relevance.",
        "Our task focused on few of the above characteristics.",
        "We treated patent documents as technical documents rather than legal statements, so we did not distinguish between the claim part and the oth",
        "•",
        "ers in assessing the relevance.",
        "High recall was not necessary, so we used the standard averaged precision to evaluate the results.",
        "Few groups used structures and classifications.",
