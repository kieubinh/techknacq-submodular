        "The resulting short or poor queries would bring them unsatisfactory results.",
        "However, if a few relevant documents happen to be found by the search, we could automatically or manually extract some useful terms from the documents, and add them to the initial search expression.",
        "It is obviously expected that search effectiveness of the second search using the extended query will be improved significantly.",
        "This is a basic idea of relevance feedback.",
        "Inevitably, for executing automatic relevance feedback, the system has to obtain relevance information, i.e., relevant or irrelevant documents, from the users interactively.",
        "However, some researchers have tried to employ relevance feedback techniques with no relevance information.",
        "The objective is to enhance search performance of retrieval models such as vector space model, probabilistic model and so on, without interaction on relevance information between system and users.",
        "The technique is usually called pseudo relevance feedback, in which a standard feedback method (e.g., the Rocchio method) is applied by assuming that top-ranked documents searched by the initial search are relevant.",
        "The purpose of this paper is to report results of retrieval experiments for examining effectiveness of pseudo relevance feedback in the case of searching a patent collection.",
        "In particular, we attempt to compare search performance of the traditional Rocchio method with that of an alternative method, which is based on Taylor approximation of retrieval function proposed by Kishida[1].",
        "This report is based on two experiments using the NTCIR-1 test collection and the NTCIR-3 patent test collection, respectively.",
        "As to the latter, the results were obtained at the time of NTCIR-3 Workshop held in October 2002 [2].",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, the Rocchio method and an alternative method proposed by Kishida[1] will be introduced.",
        "In Section 3 a preliminary experiment for confirming how well the alternative method works in a normal relevance feedback situation will be described.",
        "The NTCIR-1 test collection with relevance judgment information is used for the preliminary experiment.",

        "We denote a document vector and a query vector by di = (wi1,...,wiM)T and q= (wq1,...,wqM)T , wherewi; is a weight of a term within a document and wq; is a weight of a term within the query (M is the total number of distinct terms in the database, and T indicates transposition).",

        "The most important thing is that both of two well-known formulas for estimating scores to rank documents are able to be represented by a simple form (6).",
        "For making ranked output, documents have to be sorted in the decreasing order of scores, s i (i =1,...,N).",

        "For example, if a user replies a set of scores indicating the degrees of relevance for top-ranked n documents searched by the initial query, the scores allow us to estimate the part of r corresponding to the n documents We denote a set of the top-ranked n documents by X and the part of r corresponding to the set X by rX , which is actually n dimensional vector reconstructed by extracting n elements of the documents from the original vector r. According to (6), we can write that where Both of the matrix and the vector are constructed by the same way with rX .",

        "Before applying pseudo relevance feedback based on the Equation (15) to the patent test collection, we try checking retrieval performance of the Taylor formula based method by using other test collection with relevance judgment information.",

        "for Information Retrieval - 1)1, which consists of about 330,000 bibliographic records of proceedings at conferences held in Japan.",
        "It should be noted that, in the preliminary experiment, relevance judgment information was used (i.e., not pseudo feedback).",
        "Fifty-three topics of NTCIR-1 were employed for the experiment (from No.31 to No.83).",
        "The format of these topics is also very similar with that of TREC, i.e., a record of each topic consists of fields of <title>, <description>, <narrative> and so on.",
        "For realistic situation in which feedback methods are used, it would be more reasonable to assume that original search statements are short.",
        "Thus we employed only <title> and <description> fields for representing each topic.",
        "This means that a kind of ‘short query’ was used for the experiment.",
        "3.2 Procedure and type of runs Procedure of the preliminary experiment is as follows: (a) Initial search: two initial search runs were carried out, i.e., the first is based on vector space model from (2) to (4) and the second is probabilistic model (5).",
        "We denote the initial search runs as ORGVEC and ORGPRB, respectively.",
        "(b) Query modification through relevance feedback: initial queries were modified by using relevance judgment information on top-ranked documents of each initial run.",

        "In the case of vector space model, we can attempt two modification methods, i.e., the Rocchio method (1) (where α = 8 , and γ = 4 ) and the Taylor formula based method (7), (9) and (15).",

        "In the case of runs based on the Taylor formula, TYLVEC and TYLPRB, the linear function (6) was used for matching operation.",
        "Conversion of binary judgment into continuous value One of the advantages of the Taylor formula based method (15) is to allow us for making use of continuous values representing the degree to which each document is relevant.",
        "Unfortunately, in the experiment, such values were not available because only results of binary judgments are officially provided as relevance information.",

        "For the set of relevant documents, we can obtain estimates of A and B by solving equations, It is easy to show that",
        "Similarly, for the set of irrelevant documents, we obtain that Furthermore, we have to determine a priori values of r1._, r1in , r0ax and r°.n ,",
        "(a) For vector space model, it is reasonable",
        "that rmax is assumed to be 1.0 and rO is 0.0 according to cosine function (4).",
        "As for rmlin and r. , it is necessary to set a margin between them, i.e., amount of difference from minimum value for relevant documents to maximum value for irrelevant ones.",
        "If we take the margin as 2.0, it is automatically determined that and r0max = 4.0.",

        "In standard pseudo relevance feedback methods, better terms are usually selected from the set of top-ranked documents according to the term weights.",
        "We can expect that if the term selection process is applied, the performance is improved in the case of the Rocchio method.",
        "However, how can we select better terms in the case of the Taylor formula based method?",
        "The behavior of the Taylor formula based method in the process of term re-weighting is a little complicated.",
        "For example, we assume that there are only 6 distinct terms (from term1 to term6) in a database, and that , which means that all term weights in the initial query vector are equal.",
        "The matrix of weights of terms in top-ranked 4 documents (from doc 1 to doc4) is supposed to be that A row of the matrix represents each document vector, e.g., dT = (2,1,0,0,1,1) Furthermore, it is assumed that a set of numerical values indicating degree of relevance for each document was given by a user, and difference from initial document scores was calculates such that Under these assumptions, relevance feedback by the Taylor formula based method is as follows.",
        "First, by the SVD algorithm, the transpose matrix of the AX can be decomposed as UΛVT, and after simple calculation, we can finally obtain that .",
        "(18) This example represents well characteristics of the Taylor formula based method.",
        "From (17) we understand that scores of doc1 and doc2 have to be increased and those of doc3 and doc4 decreased.",
        "Intuitively, it seems that weights of both term1 and term2 should be augmented because they are only appearing in doc 1 and doc2, neither doc3 nor doc4 at all.",
        "However, a solution by (18) indicates that the weight of term1 is unchanged (only to that of term2, 0.1 is added).",
        "This is a result so as to keep the condition (17), which means that scores of doc1 and doc2 have to be increased by 0.1 and 0.2, respectively, for reaching at an ideal situation.",
        "Actually, we can calculate from (16) such that for doc1 and that for doc2.",
        "The results indicate that the condition (17) is completely satisfied.",
        "As shown in the simple calculation, the Taylor formula based method takes the difference rX − sX into consideration for re-weighting of search terms.",
        "On the other hand, in the case of the Rocchio method, re-weighting of search terms is done by looking into only AX regardless of sX .",
        "We suppose that doc1 and doc2 were judged as relevant documents, and doc3 and doc4 irrelevant.",
        "In the condition, the Rocchio method adds simply (1+2)/2=1.5 to weights of both of term1 and term2, not considering document scores in an initial search.",
        "As shown in above example, in the case of the Taylor formula based method, term re-weighting is dependent on the values of r X .",
