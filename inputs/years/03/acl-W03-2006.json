        "A patent document is written to persuade a techno-legal authority that the patentee should be allowed to manufacture, sell, or deal in an article to the exclusion of other persons.",
        "The article is typically based on an invention that the patentee(s) claim has been theirs.",
        "The term article is important in that it refers to a tangible object and its u sage is to emphasise that ideas, intangibles essentially, cannot be patented.",
        "Patent documents are the repos i-tory of how technology advances and, more importantly, show how language supports the change.",
        "The techno-legal authority requires the patent document to follow a template.",
        "This template is divided broadly into two parts: first, legal te m",
        "plates comprising patentee’s details, jurisdictional scope, and related item; second, technical templates divided into a summary of the patentee’s claims, relation of the article to previously patented articles – the so-called prior art – and the scientific/technical basis of the claim.",
        "The scientific claim is written in a language that is similar to the language ofjournal p apers.",
        "One important task that is slowly emerging is the extent to which the analysis of a patent doc u-ment can be automated particularly to assess the overlap between the claims in the document about the article to be patented with that of related, rel e-vant and even counter-claims about the article.",
        "The related and relevant claims and counter claims may be found in existing patent documents and may, more indirectly, exist in journal papers.",
        "A patent document has to make references to all other relevant/related articles that have been patented prior to the invention of the art icle, which is yet to be patented and is the object of the patent document.",
        "The references are made primarily by citing the name of the prior art patentees and the titles of their patent documents.",
        "A patent doc u-ment also has other linguistic descriptions of prior art; such descriptions are reminiscent of citations of journal papers in a journal paper.",
        "The overlap of a new patent document with a set of existing patent documents may suggest the impact of extant knowledge in patent documents on emerging knowledge in the new patent document.",
        "Such an overlap has been studied by the impact of US semiconductor technology on the rest of the world (Appleyard and Kalsow: 1999): this overlap relies largely on the frequency of citation of a US patent by the name of its author or the author’s place of work.",
        "In computational linguistic (CL) terms this exercise relies on proper noun extra ction.",
        "The patent document relates to an explicit and exclusive right over an intellectual property.",
        "A journal article relates to an implicit and inclusive right over an intellectual property.",
        "The overlap between these two forms of claims is crucial not only in ascertaining the rights of the patentee, or the abuse of the rights of others by the patentee, but also for monitoring the effectiveness of r e-search based on a specialism as a whole or that of its component groups.",
        "The effect of one author or a group of authors working in an institution is indirectly measured by the so-called impact factor.",
        "This factor relates to the frequency of citation of one or more journal papers written by an author or by a group.",
        "The calculation of the impact factor relies mainly on computing the frequency of the authors’ name(s) within a corpus of journal articles.",
        "Such an impact factor type calculation is used typically in bibl i-ometrics (Garfield 1995).",
        "Again, as in intra patent impact studies mentioned above, in CL terms this is an exercise in proper noun identification and extraction.",
        "The analysis of a patent document, together with the analysis of the related corpora of other patent documents and intellectual property doc u-ments, should be based on a framework which provides methods and techniques for analysing the contents of the document and of the corpora.",
        "For us the source of a framework still lies in linguistic and language studies.",
        "Here we are particularly interested in word formation and terminology u sage in highly specialised disciplines particularly those disciplines that deal with intangible articles coupling the word formation and terminology u sage with the citation patterns of proper nouns brings us closer to analysing the contents of a patent document and its siblings distributed over co r-pora.",
        "Information scientists usually use the referen c-ing data of research documents to analyse know ledge evolution in scientific fields as well as to identify the key authors, institutes, and journals in specific domains, using tools such as publication counts, citation analysis, co-citation analysis, and co-term analysis to do so.",
        "In recent years, patent documents have gained considerable attention as a valuable resource that can be use d to analyse technology advances using the same tools.",
        "Gupta and Pangannaya (2000) have applied bibliometric analysis to carbon nanotube patents to measure the growth of activity of carbon nan otube industries and their links with science.",
        "They have also used patents data to study the country wise distribution of patenting activity for the USA, J a-pan, and other countries.",
        "Sector wise performances of industry, academia and government, and the active players of carbon nanotubes were also stu died.",
        "They describe the nature of inventions taking place in this particular field of technology, and the authors claim to have identified the emerging r e-search directions, and the active companies and research groups involved.",
        "Meyer (2001) has used citation analysis and co-word analysis of patent documents and sc i-entific literature to explore the interrelationship between nano science and nano -technology.",
        "Meyer investigated patent citation relations at the orga n-izational levels along with geographical locations and affiliations of inventors and authors.",
        "The term co-occurrence is used by Meyer to find the rel a-tionship between the patent documents and the two scientific literature databases SCI and INSPEC.",
        "He has noticed that ‘...the terms that occur frequently in the document titles of all databases are related to [ ... ] instrumentalities and/or are located in fields that are generally associated with substantial indu s-trial research activity’ (2001:177).",
        "Meyer has a r-gued that ‘Our data suggests that nano technology and nano-science are essentially separate and he t-erogeneous, yet interrelated cumulative stru ctures’ (2001:164).",
        "The study of word formation through n e-ologisms within the special language of science and technology has led some authors to argue that it is the scientists as technologists who attempt to rationalise our experience of the world around us in written language by using new words or forms or by relexicalising the existing stock (see Ahmad 2000 for relevant references).",
        "Some lexicogr a-phers (see for example Quirk et al.",
        "1985) have su g-gested that neologisms can be formed by two processes: First, the addition or combination of elements such as compounding: Resonant Tunne ling Diodes and Scanning tunneling microscopy are examples for this type of neologism (compoundin g as a neologism formation is used extensively in science and technology literature); Second, the r eduction of elements into abbreviated forms.",
        "The abbreviations FET (Field Effect Transistor) and MOSFET (Metallic Oxide Semiconductor FET) are examples of this type.",
        "Neologisms appear to signal the emergence of new concepts or artefacts and the frequency of this new word might indicate the scientific comm u-nity’s acceptance of this new concept or artefact.",
        "Effenberger (1995) has argued that ‘... the faster a subject field is developing, the more novelties are constructed, discovered or created.",
        "And these no v-elties are talked and written about.",
        "In order to make this technical communication as efficient as possible, provision should be made for avoiding misunderstanding.",
        "One crucial point in this process is the vocabulary that is being used’ (1995:131, emphasis added).",
        "In this paper we discuss the idiosyncratic la n-guage used in patent documents.",
        "The language is replete with terms and there are instances within a patent document that suggest that the authors not only use the specialist terms but use a local syntax as well.",
        "We look specifically at the structure of the US Patents and suggest how with existing tec h-niques used in information extraction and NLP, including term extraction and proper noun identif i-cation, one can perform fairly complex tasks in patent analysis – some of which are performed by patent experts by hand currently (Section 2).",
        "This examination suggests to us a model of development in computer and semiconductor technology: an incremental model where each subsequent pa tent helps in the development of ever complex artifacts – starting from devices onto circuits and onto systems.",
        "We will look at one of the key inventions in the field of semiconductors physics – the electron tunneling device.",
        "These devices combine technical elegance, experimental complexity and manufacturing challenge.",
        "Due to its strategic i m-portance, a number of patents have been obtained by the US government and also by a number of US and Japanese companies (Section 3).",
        "Section 4 concludes this paper.",
        "The Structure of US PTO Documents and a Local Grammar for the Doc u-ments The USPTO database is a representative sample of patent documents.",
        "The USPTO has documents r elated to most branches of science and technology.",
        "It includes information about all US patent doc u-ments since the first patent issued in 1970 to the most recent.",
        "The USPTO database allows the user to search the full text of the patent documents for a certain word or a combination of words.",
        "It also provides a field search for specific information such as inventor or assignee.",
        "The search can also be conducted for a specific year or range of years.",
        "The US Patents are written partly as a legal text and partly as a scientific document.",
        "Over the last 50 years or so, it appears that US Patent documents have been structured in terms of layout and have a superficial resemblance to Marvin Minsky’s frame-like knowledge representation schema.",
        "The patent document can be divided into three main parts for the present discussion: The first part comprises the biographical details of the inventors (and their employers) together with the title of the invention and a brief free text abstract, dates when the patent was applied for and when the patent was granted and so on.",
        "The free text is essentially a summary of the claims of the pa t-entee; The second part contains external references of three sorts: the first sort is the specialist domain of the invention – the subject class indicating the superordinate class and instances; thesecond sort are other cited patents organised as a 4 -tuple: (i) patent number, (ii) date of approval, (iii) first i n-ventor and (iv) classification number; and, the third sort is a bibliographic reference to publications that may have contributed to the pa tent; The third part of a current US Patent document comprises ‘claims’ related to the patent and the description of the ‘invention’ (there are diagrams of the invention attached to the document and the diagrams d e-scribed in the text).",
        "Table 1 on the next page shows the template of the current (c. 1980 and a fter) USPTO’s.",
        "The ‘claims’ of the patentees are clearly itemised and initialised by the number of the claim; the first claim is the basis of the patent abstract generally.",
        "The ‘background to the invention’ is written in an idiosyncratic fashion as well – the invention is first contextualised in a broader group of other inventions to date and then the specific nature of the invention is exemplified.",
        "The broader and the specific are usually marked by phrases like ‘The (present) invention relates to’ and the specificity is phrased as ‘(more) specif i-cally.’ or ‘(more) particularly’.",
        "These phrases are followed by one or more noun phrases connected with, for example, conjunctions or qualifiers.",
        "The first noun phrase names the article invented, for instance, a name of a new device, circuit or a fabr i-cating or testing process.",
        "The NP comprises determiners and modal verbs together with (compound) nouns.",
        "The first NP is optionally followed by a qualification that restricts or extends the scope of the disco very – the enlargement or restriction is named and another NP is used for the naming and so on.",
        "This simple grammar can be verified by examining a corpus of patent documents.",
        "To illustrate this point we have looked at a recent randomly selected patent on memory devices – a patent filed by Kabushiki Ka i-sha Toshiba of Japan (or Toshiba for short), and approved by USPTO on 20 th May 2003, on a semiconductor memory device which uses the emergent notion of memory cells (a memory cell is a tiny area within the memory array that actually stores the bit in the form of an electrical charge1).",
        "An analysis of the title and that of the ‘Background of the Invention: Field of Invention’ fields shows the use of this restricted syntax (Table 2).",
        "In much the",
        "same as the ‘claims’ and ‘th e ‘background’, the ‘summary of the invention’ is also phrased in a formulaic manner (see Table 1 for the structure of the patent document).",
        "The analysis of the other slots governed by a simpler grammar yields interesting results and suggests that the name s of assignees and the ma n-ner in which patents are being cited can be easily interrelated (Table 3).",
        "Toshiba’s USPTO 6567330 refers to 8 other patents.",
        "The details of the referenced patents are in a 4 -tuple, which can be unambiguously interpreted.",
        "Each of the referenced patents refers to about 10 patents in turn.",
        "An examination of 82 such patents may help to initiate, perhaps, a discussion of the ‘invention life cycle’ or ‘licensing potential of a patent’ (Mogee 1997), or even a discussion of ‘micro foundations of innovation systems’ (Ande rsen 2000).",
        "A finer grained analysis to show which ‘country’ is more influential can also be performed fairly readily and indicates the extent to which pa tents that are held by assignees domiciled in the USA have over half the cited patents (Table 4).",
        "shiba Japan) shows the major influence of US - based assignees, followed by Japan.",
        "A significant number of patents (8.5%) are held by individuals and not assigned specifically to a country.",
        "A semi-automatic analysis of terms used in the Abstracts and Titles of the patents (Toshiba 6567330 and patents referenced in the Toshiba patents) shows the co citation pattern o f terms.",
        "This may help in the clustering of patents on the basis of terms extracted from the patent documents as well as novel terms (terms not included in the USPTO Patent Classification terminology data base) found in the document.",
        "We show the co - citation of the two key terms memory cell and memory device in the nine patents discussed above.",
        "The use of the two terms individually and as roots and stems of other compounds is also shown.",
        "The more frequent citation is to the newer term memory cell and it is cited in all but one of the 9 related patents.",
        "The related memory devices – newer devices now incorporate memory cells – is less frequently used and it is only found in the abstracts of 5 out of the 9 patents.",
        "Both terms are co cited in 6 out of the 9 patents (see Table 5 for details).",
        "The interrelationship between the different patents can be explored further by examining closely as to what is being patented within the pa tent and what is being patented in the referenced patents.",
        "Again, we use the example of the Toshiba patent No.",
        "6567330 which refers to 8 other patents.",
        "The patent itself relates to the invention of a system.",
        "The referred patents relate to other systems and circuits.",
        "Let us look at the earliest patent cited in Toshiba’s patent: this is US PTO No.",
        "5386388 filed by Intel Corporation (USA) approved in January 1995.",
        "The title of I ntel’s patent is ‘Single cell reference scheme for flash memory sensing and program state verification’.",
        "Flash memory is defined as ‘A nonvolatile programmable semico n-ductor memory product 2.",
        "This patent relates to the invention of a circuit.",
        "Intel’s patent comprises re f-erences to another 15 patents: 5 refer to other sy stems, 8 to circuits, and one each to a device and a software program (see Figure 1 on the next page).",
        "The information whether a patent is r elated to any of the four classes can be gleaned from the Patent Classification Number.",
        "Further analysis of the referenced patents shows a similar pattern – refe r-ences to circuits, devices, systems and software.",
        "This appears to be a basis of the inventions within the semiconductor industry, especially those r elated to the development of computer systems based on these systems, devices and circuits.",
        "This is the basis of our more speculative investigations related to the resonant tunneling systems."

        "We will now focus on how terminology u sage may help in tracking the evolution of resonant tunne ling devices.",
        "These are ultra high-speed devices, which perhaps will be used in the computers of the next decade or so.",
        "In order to study how one can track technology progress we have adopted an i n-tuitive, but realistic, framework.",
        "For us, all co m-plex systems comprise subsystems and subsystems are made up of much smaller (and simpler) devices.",
        "A computer system is made up of integrated circuits and the circuits made up of transistors and transistors come in different types.",
        "One model of growth can be thought of as follows: First, devices are patented, then subsystems, and finally the complex systems (remember only tangible articles can be patented).",
        "So following this intuitive framework we will first see a number of devices being patented then subsystems and finally the systems themselves.",
        "Tunnel diodes are supposed to empower faster switching devices, which in turn have to be incorporated into subsystems with tu n-neling transistors and into complex systems with circuits.",
        "Our hypothesis is that an analysis of a diachronically organized text corpus will show the working of the above mentioned framework.",
        "A corpus was built containing more than 2.2 million words of patent documents.",
        "The co r-pus contains all patent documents that contain the term tunneling in the title.",
        "USPTO search results showed that there are 372 titles, approved from 1975 to 1999 in semiconductor physics.",
        "We have analysed frequency of compound word in the USPTO patent documents published between 1975-1999 (Table 6).",
        "The compound word analysis was co n-ducted using System Quirk and no compounds were pre specified (System Quirk a text analysis system, is available on www.computing.surrey.ac.uk/ai/SystemQ ).",
        "The system extracts compound words based on a si m-ple heuristic: a set of word that does not contain closed class words (i.e. determiners, conjunctions, prepositions, and moderators) or the orthographic signs (including punctuation, numbers, currency and other symbols) is considered by System Quirk to be a compound word (see Ahmad and Rogers, 2001, for details).",
        "The validation of compound words can also be carried out by statistical tests, for instance described by Smajda (1994).",
        "To investigate the progress of resonant tunneling devices and circuits, the multi-word terms were extracted from the USPTO full text corpus using System Quirk.",
        "The extracted terms that relate to resonant tunneling diodes, resonant tunneling transistors and resonant tunneling circuits were arranged in a five year interval starting from the first emergence of the term resonant tunneling in USPTO abstract documents in 1985.",
        "Tracking the frequency usage of the terms associated with resonant tunneling artefacts in the USPTO full text corpus shows a considerable i n",
        "crease of frequency usage interval by interval.",
        "The frequency of the term resonant tunneling diode (and its plural form resonant tunneling diodes, both denoted as the lemma resonant tunneling d i-ode~ subsequently) increased significantly from 45 in 1985-1989 to 446 in 1990-1994 by about a factor of 19 and then in the next time interval 1995 - 1999 the frequency dropped by about half to 240.",
        "The frequency usage of the term resonant tunneling transistor – in the USPTO full text corpus i n-creased from 23 in the period 1985-1989 by about a factor of 10 to 225 in 1990 -1994.",
        "The increase of frequency usage of the term in the time period 1995-1999 increased by a factor of 1.3 to become 293.",
        "The term resonant tunneling circuit~ appears in the USPTO full text corpus 45 times in the time interval 1990-1994.",
        "Frequency usage of resonant tunneling circuits increased by a factor of 1.3 in the next interval (1995 -1999) to 57.",
        "Word formation is not restricted to the i n-flection of a compound word.",

        "The specialization, through prefixation, of the term resonant tunneling diode & transistor over a 10 year period in our patent corpus We note the very productive use of compounding and inflection in our corpus.",
        "Note, however, that the size of the corpus for the three different periods, 1985-89, 90-94 and 95-99, are different: 378272, 771525 and 995894 respectively.",
        "The size of the corpus perhaps for the later two periods is roughly the same but the earlier corpus (85 -89) is three times smaller.",
        "In order to present a better comparison we will look at the relative frequency of the compounds in that we will sum up the frequency of all the extracted compounds related to resonant tunneling diodes, transistors and circuits, as per our intuitive fram ework, and assign relative frequency to each of the three relative to the sum.",
        "Consider the result of analysis of 133 texts of patents published in 1990 -1994 for tunnel diode related patents.",

        "The total containing the lemma resonant tunneling transistor is 225, which is made up of 188 for the lemma on its own and the rest for the two other terms.",
        "The lemma RT circuit also includes hyponyms of the term, e.g. RT oscillator (circuit), RT logic gate (circuit) and RT memory (circuit); note that the term circuit is shown in parentheses as it is ellipsed in the text – the reader of the patents, an expert in the discipline, is expected to know that an oscillator is a circuit.",
        "The two terms occur 24 and 12 times together with 4 other terms that collectively occur 9 times ma king a total of 45.",
        "The three lemmas RT diode, transistor and circuit occur for a total of 490 + 225 + 45 (= 760) times, hence the relative frequency of the three lemmas is 64.4% (490/760), 29.6% (225/760) and 6% (45/760) respectively (Table 8 shows a breakdown of the distributio n).",
