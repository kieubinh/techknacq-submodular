        "In this paper we present a detailed scheme for annotating expressions ofopinions, beliefs, emotions, sentiment, speculation and other private states in newspaper articles.",
        "Private state is a general term that covers mental and emotional states, which cannot be directly observed or verified (Quirk et al., 1985).",
        "For example, we can observe evidence of someone else being happy, but we cannot directly observe their happiness.",
        "In natural language, opinions, emotions and other private states are expressed using subjective language (Banfield, 1982; Wiebe, 1994).",
        "Articles in the news are composed of a mixture of factual and subjective material.",
        "Writers of editorials frequently include facts to support their arguments, and news reports often mix segments presenting objective facts with segments presenting opinions and verbal reactions (van Dijk, 1988).",
        "However, natural language processing applications that retrieve or extract information from or that summarize or answer questions about news and other discourse have focused primarily on factual information and thus could benefit from knowledge of subjective language.",
        "Traditional information extraction and information retrieval systems could learn to concentrate on objectively presented factual information.",
        "Question answering systems could identify when an answer is speculative rather than certain.",
        "In addition, knowledge of how opinions and other private states are realized in text would directly support new tasks, such as opinion-oriented information extraction (Cardie et al., 2003).",
        "The ability to extract opinions when they appear in documents would benefit multi-document summarization systems seeking to summarize different opinions and perspectives, as well as multi-perspective question-answering systems trying to answer opinion-based questions.",
        "The annotation scheme we present in this paper was developed as part of a U.S. government-sponsored project (ARDA AQUAINT NRRC)to investigate multiple perspectives in question answering (Wiebe et al., 2003).",
        "We implemented the scheme in GATE, a General Architecture for Text Engineering (Cunningham et al., 2002).",
        "General instructions for annotating opinions and specific instructions for downloading and using GATE to perform the annotations are available at",
        "'This work was performed in support of the Northeast Regional Research Center (NRRC) which is sponsored by the Advanced Research and Development Activity in Information Technology (ARDA), a U.S. Government entity which sponsors and promotes research of import to the Intelligence Community which includes but is not limited to the CIA, DIA, NSA, NIMA, andNRO.",

        "We are working to resolve copyright issues to make it available to the wider research community.",
        "In developing this annotation scheme, we had two goals.",
        "The first was to develop a representation for opinions and other private states that was built on work in linguistics and literary theory on subjectivity (please see (Banfield, 1982; Fludernik, 1993; Wiebe, 1994; Stein and Wright, 1995) for references).",
        "The study of subjectivity in language focuses on how private states are expressed linguistically in context.",
        "Our second goal was to develop an annotation scheme that would be useful for corpus-based research on subjective language and for the development of applications such as multi-perspective question-answering systems.",
        "The annotation scheme that resulted is more detailed and comprehensive than previous ones for subjective language.",
        "Our study of the annotations produced by the annotation scheme gives two important results.",
        "First, we find that trained annotators can consistently perform detailed opinion annotations with good agreement (0.81 Kappa).",
        "Second, the agreement results are better than in previous sentence-level annotation studies, suggesting that adding detail can help the annotators perform more reliably.",
        "In the sections that follow, we first review how opinions and other private states are expressed in language (section 2) and give a brief overview of previous work in subjectivity tagging (section 3).",
        "We then describe our annotation scheme for private state expressions (section 4) and give the results of an annotation study (section 5).",
        "We conclude with a discussion of our findings from the annotation study and and future work (section ??).",
        "In the appendix, we give sample annotations as well as a snapshot of the annotations in GATE."

        "2.1 Private States, Speech Events, and Expressive Subjective Elements",
        "There are two main ways that private states are expressed in language.",
        "Private states may be explicitly mentioned, or they may be expressed indirectly by the types ofwords and the style oflan-guage that a speaker or writer uses.",
        "An example of an explicitly-mentioned private state is \"frustrated\" in sentence (1).",
        "(1) Western countries were left frustrated and impotent after Robert Mugabe formally declared that he had overwhelmingly won Zimbabwe's presidential election.",
        "Although most often verbs, it is interesting to note that explicit mentions of private states may also be nouns, such as \"concern\" in \"international concern\" and \"will\" in \"will of the people.\"",
        "They may even be adjectives, such as \"fearful\" in \"fearful populace.\"",
        "The second way that private states are generally expressed is indirectly using expressive subjective elements (Banfield, 1982).",
        "For example, the private states in sentences (2) and (3) are expressed entirely by the words and the style of language that is used.",
        "(2) The time has come, gentlemen, for Sharon, the assassin, to realize that injustice cannot last long.",
        "(3) \"We foresaw electoral fraud but not daylight robbery,\" Tsvangirai said.",
        "In (2), although the writer does not explicitly say that he hates Sharon, his choice of words clearly demonstrates a negative attitude.",
        "In sentence (3), describing the election as \"daylight robbery\" clearly reflects the anger being experienced by the speaker, Tsvangirai.",
        "As used in these sentences, the phrases \"The time has come,\" \"gentlemen,\" \"the assassin,\" \"injustice cannot last long,\" \"fraud,\" and \"daylight robbery\" are all expressive subjective elements.",
        "Expressive subjective elements are used by people to express their frustration, anger, wonder, positive sentiment, mirth, etc., without explicitly stating that they are frustrated, angry, etc.",
        "Sarcasm and irony often involve expressive subjective elements.",
        "When looking for opinions and other private states in text, an annotator must consider speech events as well as explicitly-mentioned private states.",
        "In this work, we use speech event to refer to any event of speaking or writing.",
        "However, the mere presence of a speech event does not indicate a private state.",
        "Both sentences (3) above and (4) below contain speech events indicated by \"said.\"",
        "As mentioned previously, sentence (3) is opinionated, while in (4) the information is presented as factual.",
        "(4) Medical Department head Dr Hamid Saeed said the patient's blood had been sent to the Institute for Virology in Johannesburg for analysis.",
        "For speech terms such as \"said,\" \"added,\" \"told,\" \"announce,\" and \"report,\" an annotator determines if there is a private state mainly by looking inside the scope of the speech term for expressive subjective elements.",
        "Occasionally, we also find private states that are expressed by direct physical actions.",
        "We call such actions private state actions.",
        "Examples are booing someone, sighing heavily, shaking ones fist angrily, waving ones hand dismissively, and frowning.",
        "\"Applauding\" in sentence (5) is an example of a positive-evaluative private state action.",
        "(5) As the long line of would-be voters marched in, those near the front of the queue began to spontaneously applaud those who were far behind them.",
        "An important aspect of a private state or speech event is its source.",
        "The source of a speech event is the speaker or writer.",
        "The source of a private state is the experiencer of the private state, i.e., the person whose opinion or emotion is being expressed.",
        "Obviously, the writer of an article is a source, because he wrote the sentences composing the article, but the writer may also write about other people's private states and speech events, leading to multiple sources in a single sentence.",
        "For example, each of the following sentences has two sources: the writer (because he wrote the sentences), and Sue (because she is the source of a speech event in (6) and of private states in (7) and (8), namely thinking and being afraid).",
        "(6) Sue said, \"The election was fair.\"",
        "(7) Sue thinks that the election was fair.",
        "(8) Sue is afraid to go outside.",
        "Note, however, that we don't really know what Sue says, thinks or feels.",
        "All we know is what the writer tells us.",
        "Sentence (6), for example, does not directly present Sue's speech event but rather Sue's speech event according to the writer.",
        "Thus, we have a natural nesting of sources in a sentence.",
        "The nesting of sources may be quite deep and complex.",
        "For example, consider sentence (9).",
        "(9) The Foreign Ministry said Thursday that it was \"surprised, to put it mildly\" by the U.S. State Department's criticism of Russia's human rights record and objected in particular to the \"odious\" section on Chechnya.",
        "There are three sources in this sentence: the writer, the Foreign Ministry, and the U.S. State Department.",
        "The writer is the source of the overall sentence.",
        "The remaining explicitly mentioned private states and speech events in (9) have the following nested sources:",
        "said: (writer, Foreign Ministry) surprised, to put it mildly:",
        "(writer, Foreign Ministry, Foreign Ministry) criticism:",
        "(writer, Foreign Ministry, U.S. State Dept.)",
        "objected: (writer, Foreign Ministry)",
        "Expressive subjective elements may also have nested sources.",
        "In sentence (9), \"to put it mildly\" and \"odious\" are expressive subjective elements, both with nested source (writer, Foreign Ministry).",
        "We might expect that an expressive subjective element always has the same nested source as the immediately dominating private state or speech term.",
        "Although this is the case for \"odious\" in (9) (the nested source of \"odious\" and \"objected\" is the same), it is not the same for \"bigger than Jesus\" in (10):",
        "(10) \"It is heresy,\" said Cao.",
        "\"The 'Shouters' claim they are bigger than Jesus.\"",
        "The nested source of the subjectivity expressed by \"bigger than Jesus\" is Cao, while the nested source of \"claim\" is (writer, Cao, Shouters).",
        "Implicit speech events posed a problem when we developed the annotation scheme.",
        "Implicit speech events are speech events in the discourse for which there is no explicit speech event phrase, and thus no obvious place to attach the annotation.",
        "For example, most of the writer's sentences do not include a phrase such as \"I say.\"",
        "Also, direct quotes are not always accompanied by discourse parentheticals (such as \", she said\").",
        "Our solution was to add the is-implicit attribute to the annotation type for private states and speech events, which may then be used to mark implicit speech event annotations.",
        "Depending on its goals, an application may need to identify all private state and speech event expressions in a document, or it may want to find only those opinions and other private states that are significant and real in the discourse.",
        "By \"significant\", we mean that a significant portion of the contents of the private state or speech event are given within the sentence where the annotation is marked.",
        "By \"real\", we mean that the private state or speech event is presented as an existing event within the domain of discourse, e.g., it is not hypothetical.",
        "We use the term minor for private states and speech events that are not significant or not real.",
        "Annotators mark minor private state and speech event annotations by including the minor attribute.",
        "The following sentences all contain one or more minor private states or speech events (highlighted in bold).",
        "(11) Such wishful thinking risks making the US an accomplice in the destruction of human rights.",
        "(not significant) (12) If the Europeans wish to influence Israel in the political arena... (in a conditional, so not real) (13) \"And we are seeking a declaration that the British government demands that Abbasi should not face trial in a military tribunal with the death penalty.\"",
        "(not real, i.e., the declaration of the demand is just being sought) (14) The official did not say how many prisoners were on the flight.",
        "(not real because the saying event did not occur) (15) No one who has ever studied realist political science will find this surprising.",
        "(not real since a specific \"surprise\" state is not referred to; note that the subject noun phrase is attributive rather than referential (Donnellan, 1966))"

        "This attribute is marked on every private state and speech event annotation.",
        "The onlyfactive attribute is used to indicate whether the source of the private state or speech event is indeed expressing an emotion, opinion or other private state.",

        "On the other hand, neutral speech events (e.g., \"said,\" \"added,\" \"told\") may be either onlyfactive=yes or onlyfac-tive=no, depending on their contents.",
        "For example, the annotation for \"said\" in sentence (3) would be marked onlyfactive=no, but the annotation for \"said\" in sentence (4) would be marked onlyfactive=yes (sentences in section 2).",
        "Note that even if onlyfactive=no, the sentence may express something the nested source believes is factual.",

        "Borderline-onlyfactive expressions on average comprise only 10% of the private state/speech event annotations.",
        "When they are removed, the average pairwise Kappa climbs to 0.89.",
        "In addition to the onlyfactive judgment, using on-strength we can measure if the annotators agree as to whether an explicit private state or speech event phrase by itself expresses a private state.",
        "Specifically, we measure if the annotators agree that an expression is neutral, i.e., does not indicate a private state.",
        "Recall that only-factive=yes annotations are on-strength=neutral.",
        "Implicit annotations are excluded when measuring on-strength agreement.",

        "As with the onlyfactive judgments, there are clearly borderline cases.",
        "We define an expression to be borderline-low if 1) at least one annotator marked the expression onlyfactive=no, and 2) neither annotator characterized an on-strength as being greater than low.",
        "When borderline-low expressions are removed, the pairwise Kappa increases to 0.92.",
        "To compare our results to those of earlier work that evaluated the agreement of sentence-level subjectivity annotations (Wiebe et al., 1999), we define sentence-level classifications in terms of our lower-level annotations as follows.",
        "First, we exclude explicit private state/speech event expressions that the annotators agree are minor.",
        "Then, if an annotator marked one or more onlyfactive=no expressions in the sentence, we consider the annotator to have judged the sentence to be subjective.",
        "Otherwise, we consider the annotator to have judged the sentence to be objective.",
        "The pairwise agreement results for these derived sentence-level annotations are given in Table 9.",
        "The average pairwise Kappa for sentence-level agreement is 0.77, 8 points higher than the sentence-level agreement reported in (Wiebe et al., 1999).",
        "Our new results suggest that adding detail to the annotation task can can help annotators perform more reliably.",
        "Note that the agreement is lower than that for onlyfactive judgments (Table 7) because explicit private-state and speech event expressions upon which the annotators did not agree are now included.",
        "As with the onlyfactive and on-strength neutral judgments, we again test agreement when borderline cases are removed.",

        "This shows that the annotators agree strongly about which are the clear cases of subjectivity.",
        "We have also shown that lower-level subjectivity annotations, such as those presented in this paper, may be used to produce higher-level subjective sentence annotations.",
