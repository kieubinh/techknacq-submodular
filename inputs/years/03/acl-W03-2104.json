        "This criterion balances data fit with model complexity.",

        "After candidate interpretations have been postulated, the MML criterion is applied to select the best interpretation, i.e., the interpretation with the shortest message.",
        "The calculation of the message length takes into account the following factors: (1) the size of an interpretation, and (2) the structural and belief similarity between the interpretation and the argument.",

        "• ML (SysInt) represents the probability of SysInt.",

        "This probability depends on the structural similarity between SysInt and Arg (in terms of the nodes and links that appear in Arg and SysInt), and on the similarity between the beliefs in the nodes in Arg and the corresponding nodes in SysInt (the beliefs in the nodes in SysInt are obtained by performing Bayesian propagation through SysInt; thus, different SysInts may yield different beliefs in the consequents of an argument).",
        "According to this component, interpretations that are more similar to Arg are more probable (i.e., yield a shorter message) than interpretations that are less similar to Arg.",
        "Table 1 summarizes the effect of these factors on the message length for SysIntA and SysInt ß (Figure 5).",
        "SysIntA is simpler than SysIntß, thus yielding a shorter message length for the first component of the message.",

        "In this example, we assume that the belief in [G had Opportunity to Murder B] in SysIntß is stronger than that in SysIntA, and hence closer to the asserted consequent of the argument in Figure 5.",

        "We have modeled the probability that a user will include a proposition in his/her argument as a function of the proposition's presence in the user's focus of attention.",
        "Attentional focus in turn was modeled by means of an activation level which depends on the following factors:",
        "• the type of access of a proposition, e.g., whether the proposition was copied from the menu or seen when exploring the scenario; and",
        "• the passage of time, i.e., the longer the time elapsed since the last access to the proposition, the lower its level of activation.",

        "Nonetheless, the users managed to construct arguments, which ranged in size from 2 propositions to 26, and gave a generally favourable assessment of BIAS' interpretations.",
        "Overall the average score of BIAS' interpretations was 4 before seeing the BN diagram and 4.25 after seeing the diagram.",
