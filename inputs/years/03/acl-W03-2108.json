        "Despite of its popularity, standard chat systems do not allow users to share timing information, which is thought to be necessary for smooth communication.",
        "This often makes chat conversations confusing such as ones with a lot of repetitions and corrections.",
        "To tackle the problem of lack of timing information, we have implemented a system which has the following functions: 1) function of making typing state visible; 2) floor holding function at the start of typing.",
        "To evaluate the effectiveness of the system, the length of utterance and the number of utterances are used as quantitative index for smooth communication.",

        "This is due to the mechanism of standard chat systems.",
        "In standard chat systems, a user sends a message by pressing the return key.",
        "This means that what users know is only complete utterances, without the information on how the utterances are made: In face-to-face conversation, the participants sometimes signal the difficulty of making utterances by inserting fillers and pauses, but in chat conversation, the participants cannot send such kind of information.",
        "The lack of this process information has been known to cause phenomena similar to overlap in face-to-face conversation and interruption [1,2].",

        "MSN messenger [3] shows whether the participants are typing at the bottom of the system window.",
        "Tangible Chat [5] communicates the state of the other user's typing using vibration of the cushions.",
        "When a user starts to type, the other user's chair cushion vibrates, which enables users to share typing information without distracting their attention to the messages.",
        "In UNIX talk program (a little old chat system), users can send a message character by character, which allows them to know what the others are doing.",
        "Alternative Interfaces for Chat realized two prototype systems; Status Client for sharing status information; Flow Client for sharing time sequence information [4].",

        "• When a user presses a key, his or her name in the participants list is highlighted.",

        "- The information the proposed system communicates",
        "Our preliminary experiments confirmed that the information about whether the other participants are writing does not improve easiness of using the system.",
        "Based on this result, we decided to examine two approaches: one is to increase the information to be communicated.",
        "That is, as in the UNIX talk program, the system communicates what the participants write in real time; The other is to focus on the floor holding function.",
        "In face-to-face conversation, the information on how the utterances are made is used for taking or holding the floor.",
        "Thus if the chat system users can take or hold the floor easily, this might contribute to improving easiness of using the system.",
        "With respect to the function of the floor holding, the former function might subsume the latter.",
        "However, this does not mean both functions are the same.",
        "Some users do not want to show the process of utterance making and even think it distracts their attention.",
        "If this is true, and the system can support the floor holding function effectively, then system does not have to communicate what the participants writes character by character, which will be examined in Section four."
