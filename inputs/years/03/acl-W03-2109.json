        "Recently, much research has been done on the robustness and reliability of spoken dialogue systems.",
        "We developed a \"Mt.Fuji sightseeing guidance\" system which uses touch screen input, speech input/output and graphical output, and have improved the sub-modules of a speech recognizer, natural language interpreter, response generator and multi-modal interface (Kai and Nakagawa, 1995; Itoh et al., 1995; Denda et al., 1996; Kogure et al., 1999; Nakagawa et al., 2000).",
        "General speaking, all of these modules except for the speech recognition module depended on a given task or domain.",
        "As speech recognition systems are increasingly being used in practical applications, spoken dialogue systems will also become more widespread.",
        "However, the cost of developing a new spoken dialogue system is enormous.",
        "The systems that have been developed so far can not be transferred to other domains easily, and a highly-portable system that can be easily adapted to another domain or task urgently should be developed.",
        "There are several examples of researches that focused on high portability and expansibility (Kaspar and Hoffmannn, 1998; Brond-sted et al., 1998; Sutton et al., 1998; Sasajima et al., 1999; Abella and Gorin, 1999; Levin et al., 2000).",
        "In (Kaspar and Hoffmannn, 1998), a prototype could be simply constructed even in a complicated speech dialogue system using the PIA system, which was implemented using Visual Basic.",
        "This system placed priority on achieving high robustness of speech recognition and high naturalness of generated dialogue.",

        "• Speech Recognizer: This module recognizes a user utterance via speech input and generates a recognized sentence.",
        "We used SPOJUS (Kai and Nakagawa, 1995) for this.",
        "• Semantic Interpreter: This module understands a user utterance via recognized sentence and generates semantic representation.",
