        "Unlike telephone-based dialogue systems (Estival, 2002), which are mainly created for new commercial applications, dialogue systems for Command and Control applications (Moore et al.",

        "The facility was designed to experiment with innovative technologies to support this goal, and it has now been running for two years.",
        "FOCAL contains a large-screen, semi-immersive virtual reality environment as its primary display, allowing vast quantities of information to be displayed.",
        "Our current VAs can be described as 3-dimensional \"Talking Heads\", i.e. only the head and upper portions of the body are represented.",
        "They can display expression, lip-synchronisation and head movement, along with certain autonomous behaviours such as blinking and gaze (Taplin et al., 2001).",
        "These factors all combine to add lifelikeness to the VAs and create more engaging interaction with users.",
        "Presenting information via a Talking Head has been commercially demonstrated by the virtual newscaster \"Ananova\" (Ananova, 2002).",
        "Embodied characters are also being developed and include the PPP (Andre, Rist and Muller, 1998) and Rea (Cassell, 2000).",
        "PPP is a cartoon style Personalized Plan-based Presenter that combines pointing, head movements and facial expressions to draw the viewer's attention to the information being presented.",
        "Rea is a virtual real-estate agent that takes an active role in conversation, she nods her head to indicate understanding of spoken input, or can raise her hand to indicate a desire to speak.",
        "Several VAs have been implemented for FOCAL, each having a particular role or knowledge expertise.",
        "For example, one adviser may have specialist knowledge relating to legal issues, another may have information relating to the geography of a region.",
        "Each VA has a different facial appearance, voice and mannerisms.",
        "To demonstrate and evaluate the performance of VAs (and of the other FOCAL projects), a fictitious scenario has been developed that incorporates key elements of military planning at the operational level (see section 8).",
        "The VAs provide information rich briefs through the combined use of spoken output via Text-to-Speech (TTS) and multimedia.",

        "As described in (Taplin et al., 2001) the first VA in FOCAL, named Franco, was also an animated 3-dimensional \"Talking Head\" model, intended to either deliver prepared information, such as a briefing or slide show, or to interact conversationally with users.",
        "To demonstrate the conversational functionality (Broughton et al., 2002), it was implemented with a commercial speaker-dependent automated speech recogniser (ASR), Dragon NaturallySpeakingâ„¢.",
        "The Natural Language understanding component was implemented in NatLink (Gould, 2001) and a simple user-driven dialogue management, based on keyword recognition and nesting of dialogue states to provide context, was also implemented in Python.",
        "Franco has been successful in demonstrating the proof-of-concept of a VA in the FOCAL environment.",

        "Although Franco was successful in demonstrating the potential usefulness of a VA in a Command and Control environment for operational planning, it suffers from certain limitations which we are now addressing in a follow-up project.",
        "The first limitation, and the easiest to remedy, was the unnaturalness of the synthetic voice we had given Franco.",
        "For greater effectiveness, we had to provide our VA with a more natural voice and with an Australian accent.",
        "We chose the new Australian TTS voice from Rhetorical, developed by Appen (rVoice, 2002).",
        "This required making some changes, some of them relatively important, to the interface with the talking head model to achieve lip-synchronisation, but that aspect of the work will not be addressed in this paper.",
        "The second limitation was the relative rigidity of the dialogue management strategy we were using.",
        "The alternative approach we have developed is to create Dialogue Agents implemented in ATTITUDE.",
        "This is described in section 6.",
        "The third limitation was due to the speaker-dependent nature of the ASR.",
        "While a speaker-dependent ASR allows greater flexibility in the input to which the VA can respond, we wanted to develop a system which could not only be demonstrated by the few people who have trained the speech recogniser, but where visitors themselves could be participants and could interact with the VA.",
        "Switching to a speaker-independent ASR led us to radically modify our Spoken Language Understanding component, and this is described in section 7.",
        "The new implementation we describe here has allowed us not only to address those three limitations, but also to alter fundamentally the architecture of the system, opening up the dialogue management components to control and interaction by other tools and agents in the FOCAL environment.",
        "The resulting system is now fully modular and provides scalability as well as flexibility.",
        "This new implementation allows us to focus our research into dialogue management issue, to investigate the use of ATTITUDE for dialogue management and to experiment with more natural language input."

      "text": [
        "ATTITUDE is a multi-agent architecture developed at DSTO, capable of representing and reasoning both with uncertainty and about multiple alternative scenarios (Lambert, 1999).",
        "It is a multi-agent extension of the MetaCon reactive planner developed for control of phased array radars on the Swedish Airborne Early Warning aircraft (Lambert and Relbe, 1998).",
        "ATTITUDE has some similarities with Prolog and other logic programming languages as well as with AI research on blackboard and multi-agent architectures.",
        "Because ATTITUDE was designed specifically to support the programming of reactive systems, it possesses powerful facilities for handling interactions of the internal system entities, both with each other and with the external world.",
        "ATTITUDE is very high-level, weakly-typed, and thanks to the agent paradigm, it produces loosely coupled and modularised systems.",
        "For these reasons, and because ATTITUDE implements reasoning about propositional attitudes, it provides a very attractive framework in which to develop and express dialogue management control strategies.",
        "It is worth emphasizing here that ATTITUDE is not merely a notation to represent speech acts or communicative acts between agents, but that it is actually the programming language and environment in which both the agents themselves and the control structure for interaction between the agents are implemented and executed.",
        "Because ATTITUDE has never been used for this purpose before, this is an interesting area of research in itself, and one of the goals of the project has been to see how ATTITUDE needs to be extended to implement dialogue management.",
        "Further, this allows us to investigate how far attitude programming (see section 6.2) can go towards expressing speech acts and communicative act type.",
        "However, we do not claim to employ the full power of propositional attitudes in our implementation yet.",
        "This is another area of research which we are now exploring.",
        "Neither are we yet at the stage where we could perform automatic detection of utterance type (Wright, 1998) or of dialogue act (Carberry and Lambert, 1999; Prasad and Walker, 2002).",
        "The ATTITUDE programming environment is so named because it utilises propositional attitude instructions as programming instructions (this has been dubbed attitude programming).",
        "Propositional attitudes are alleged mental states characterised by propositional attitude expressions, which are the means by which individuals relate their own mental behaviour to others'.",
        "Propositional attitude instructions are of the form shown in (1).",
        "(1) [subject][attitude][propositional expression] In (1):",
        "- [subject] denotes the individual whose mental state is being characterised; - [propositional expression] describes some propositional claim about the world; and - [attitude] expresses the subject's dispositional attitude toward that claim about the world.",
        "When software agent Mary encounters the propositional attitude instruction \"Fred desire [the door is closed]\", Mary will issue a message to software agent Fred instructing Fred to desire that the door be closed.",
        "Similarly, when encountering the propositional attitude instruction \"I believe [the sky is blue]\", Mary herself will attempt to believe that the sky is blue.",
        "An important characteristic of ATTITUDE programming is that each propositional attitude instruction either succeeds or fails, possibly with side effects, depending upon whether the recipient agent is able to satisfy the instructional request.",
        "As each propositional attitude instruction either succeeds or fails, the execution path selected through a network of propositional attitude instructions (routine) is determined by the successes and failures of the propositional attitude instructions attempted along the way.",
        "The control structure is therefore governed by a semantics of success.",
        "Computational routines for a software agent arise by linking together particular choices of propositional attitude instructions.",
        "These networks of propositional attitude instructions then prescribe recipes defining the possible mental behaviour of a software agent.",
        "We have implemented a number of ATTITUDE Dialogue Agents.",
        "The main agent in our Dialogue Management architecture (shown in Figure 1) is the Conductor.",
        "It is the agent responsible for the flow of information between the other agents and it manages multi-modal interactions.",
        "The other agents, also described further in this section, are the Speaker, the NLG (Natural Language Generator), the MMP (Multimedia Presenter) and several IS (Information Source) agents.",
        "In addition to these agents, each dialogue state (see section 8) is also implemented as an ATTITUDE agent, with its own set of routines.",
        "As explained in section 6.2, each ATTITUDE agent's behaviour is programmed as a set of routines",
        "The interaction between the ATTITUDE Dialogue agents is shown in Figure 1, in which the frame around the ATTITUDE agents can be interpreted as representing the CoABS grid.",
        "Speaker Agent",
        "When speech from the user has been detected and recognised, the attribute-value pairs for that utterance (see section 7) are sent to Speaker.",
        "Speaker takes that information and produces a corresponding ATTITUDE expression, which is then forwarded to Conductor.",
        "The linguistic coverage of the system is determined by the grammars which are available at each dialogue state.",
        "For now, the coverage is limited to a set of utterances appropriate for the briefing scenario described in section 8.",
        "These were used to define the Regulus1 grammars from which the Nuance grammars are compiled.",
        "We are now planning to move from Regulus1 to Regulus2, which will allow us to derive dialogue state grammars from a large English grammar using the EBL strategy described in (Rayner et al., 2002b)",

        "Information Source",
        "Multimedia Presenter",
        "Conductor Agent Conductor takes an ATTITUDE expression from Speaker and forwards it on to all the IS agents that have registered with it.",

        "Every response Conductor receives is put into its knowledge base, along with some extra information:",
        "- Sender: which IS agent sent the response.",
        "- In-Reply-To: which previous communicative act this is a response to.",
        "- Strength: whether every expression of the response is 'strong' (the sender believes it is either absolute truth or absolute negation) or if one or more is 'weak' (the sender believes it is neither absolute truth nor absolute negation).",
        "- Bound-State: if there are any free variables in the response, or if it is fully ground.",
        "- Unifiability: whether one or more of the expressions in the response is of the same form as Speaker's initial expression.",
        "The final expression in Conductors knowledge base is as shown in (2).",
        "(2) (response ?in-reply-to ?sender ?strength ?bound_state ?unifiability ?content)",
        "Given the initial expression from Speaker and the replies it receives from the IS agents, Conductor chooses the 'best' response.",
        "For example, a response that is strong, fully ground and unifies with Speaker's expression is deemed to be more relevant and informative than a response that is weak and contains free variables.",
        "Conductor forwards this response to MMP.",
        "Multimedia Presenter (MMP) MMP iterates through the list of expressions sent by Conductor and presents each expression to the user.",
        "MMP recognises classes of expressions and chooses to present them using certain media.",
        "For example, some expressions are instructions to change the VA head model, while others are to be translated into English sentences and spoken by the VA. For the latter function MMP uses NLG (see below).",
        "Other media through which MMP can choose to present the information contained in the expressions include: imagery from a database (e.g.",
        "pictures of military platforms, or of strategic locations), video clips, images from weather or radar information sources, virtual video, 3-dimensional virtual battle space maps, textual information and audio.",
        "Natural Language Generator (NLG)",
        "For now, NLG uses templates to transform ATTITUDE expressions into English.",
        "For example, the instruction in (3) provides two possible responses for the ATTITUDE expression specified:",
        "(3) (property ?asset overview ?value text) whanswer priority 10",
        "When NLG is first requested to generate the English output for the expression in (4.a), intended to be a communicative act of type whanswer, it uses the template given in (4.b), corresponding to \"response 1\" in (3), to produce the English answer given in (4.c).",
        "(4.a) (property mig-29 overview \"Russian multi-role fighter\" text) c. The Mig-29 is a Russian multi-role fighter.",
        "When NLG is requested a second time to generate the output for (3), it uses the template in (5.a), corresponding to \"response 2\" in (3), to produce the English answer given in (5.b).",
        "(5.a) (\"I understand that the \"?asset\" is a \"?value\".\")",
        "b. I understand that the Mig-29 is a Russian multi-role fighter.",
        "Thus NLG cycles through the list of templates for appropriate responses.",
        "Priorities can also be given to templates, enabling NLG to use general templates together with more specific and tailored ones.",
        "It is clear that template-based language generation is too rigid for fully natural dialogues, and we intend to explore more flexible techniques after we implement a wider coverage English grammar; however, it has so far been sufficient for our purposes, namely to demonstrate and investigate agent-based dialogue management.",
        "Information Source Agent (IS)",
        "The IS agents, e.g. a Weather Agent or a Platform Capabilities Agent, can answer users' questions, either by using their own internal knowledge base or by accessing external Information Sources, such as a weather information server, or a database of military assets.",
        "All IS agents register with Conductor, and when an expression is sent by Speaker, all IS agents try to respond to it.",
        "By using the CoABS Grid as the infrastructure and implementing the agent with ATTITUDE, we leave the architecture extremely flexible and scalable (Kahn and Della Torre Cicalese, 2001).",
        "For instance, it is possible to increase the amount of information at the system's disposal during runtime by launching a new IS agent and by adding some templates to NLG.",
        "For now, the dialogue is specified as a finite state machine and is still very much system directed.",
        "In the briefing application (see section 8.1), the VAs first \"push\" the information that needs to be presented, as briefing officers do in a normal briefing.",
        "Some of the information is also presented using visual aids, such as power point slides and maps for specifying location information.",
        "The information to be presented and the media to be used are determined by the agent for that particular dialogue state.",
        "The VA then allows users to ask questions to repeat or clarify particular points, or to gain additional information."

        "We chose to use the Nuance Toolkit (Nuance, 2002) for several reasons: besides its reliability as a speakerindependent ASR for both telephone and microphone speech, Nuance 8.0 provides Australian-New Zealand English, as well as US and UK English, acoustic language models.",
        "Even more importantly for our purposes, Nuance grammars can be compiled from Regulus, a higherlevel language processing component which has already been used to develop several spoken dialogue systems in different domains (Rayner et al., 2001, Rayner and Bouillon, 2002).",

        "However, because the system is primarily agent-based, the dialogue can also evolve dynamically.",
        "For instance, once the system is in a 'question' state, the dialogue flow then allows users to ask a number of questions, until they are satisfied, and the dialogue can move to a different state.",
        "Each of the top level dialogue states also corresponds to an IS agent with its own set of ATTITUDE routines.",
        "These agents register with Conductor and act as experts in their particular fields (e.g., the Legal Issues adviser).",

        "However, unlike systems such as MATCH (Johnston et al., 2002), where the issue is allowing multimodal interaction on portable devices with very small screens, in FOCAL we are concerned with ensuring that users get the full benefit of the very large screen and with allowing several users to interact at a distance from the screen.",
        "It is also worth mentioning that, unlike the interactive system described in (Rickel et al., 2002), which is concerned with training in a military environment, we are not trying to simulate a complete virtual world with embodied agents.",
        "However, we propose to include traditional pointing technologies, such as the standard desktop mouse, through to 3-dimensional tracking systems for gaze, gesture and user tracking.",
        "This will involve integrating more complex language understanding, as information will need to be derived from both the user's utterance and from what is being pointed to.",
        "For example, to interpret an utterance such as (10) uttered while the user points to a location on a map, we need to perform reference resolution on \"this region\", and match that referent to the item being pointed at.",
        "(10) What do we know about this region?",
        "10 Conclusion",
        "We have now implemented in FOCAL the infrastructure needed to perform spoken and multimodal dialogue with several VAs.",
        "This is of interest in itself, as it will allow us to continue our research on spoken language understanding and spoken dialogue systems and also to address issues of language generation which have for now been left aside.",
        "Already we have been able to move from a rigid dialogue control structure, with very constrained input, to a more flexible and scalable control structure allowing real connectivity between agents.",
        "Having moved to a speaker-independent ASR, and taking advantage of the open source nature of Regulus, we intend to pursue research issues regarding robust processing of spoken input, such as using grammar specialisation from a corpus and devising techniques for ignoring parts of the input.",
        "We have implemented a dialogue management architecture based on ATTITUDE agents which communicate with each other using propositional attitude expressions.",
        "Other agents can now be developed to perform additional functions, in particular to launch the display of other types of information and to interpret other types of input.",
        "This will allow us to explore how spoken dialogue with VAs can be combined with other virtual interaction technologies (e.g., gesture, pointing, gaze tracking).",
        "In this respect, the next step in our project is the development of a full fledge MMP agent based on the framework described in (Colineau and Paris, 2003).",
        "However, the work we have reported here must also be seen as part of the larger research programme undertaken within FOCAL.",
        "From this perspective, this work is of interest because it allows other members of the HSI group to pursue research in the usability of new technologies to perform the paradigm shift in command environments.",
        "In particular, this project is providing the support for further research into whether this way of presenting information is helpful in an operational command environment.",
        "It allows us to devise experiments to explore the crucial issue of trust in the information being presented, and how the way the information being presented can affect that trust.",
        "Integrating spoken dialogue with planning tools will also allow us to explore whether VAs can help in military operation planning, and how best to use these tools."
