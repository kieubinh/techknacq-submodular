        "In the field of Question Answering (Q&A), Information extraction (IE) techniques have been used successfully when it comes to handling simple factoid questions, but the Q&A approach has yet not reached the level of sophistication for handling connected dialogue as is present in dialogue systems tailored to background systems with structured data.",
        "Dialogue capabilities allow for more precise formulation of information requests and more natural interaction.",
        "The challenge is to combine the IE techniques and some of the features of Q& approaches with dialogue systems (Burger et al., 2001).",
        "By a successful combination of these techniques, users would be allowed to access information derived from a large set of, initially unstructured, documents, using dialogue functionalities, such as a dialogue history and clarification requests.",
        "We have developed a first version of such a combined system, BirdQuest (Jonsson and Merkel, 2003), which supports dialogue interaction to access textual data in a bird encyclopaedia.",
        "The source data is initially provided as unstructured text but refined with IE techniques to be used within a dialogue system framework.",
        "As a basis for many of the tasks in the system domain knowledge represented in an ontology is utilised.",
        "To assess the approach and get insights into what areas need further improvement an evaluation of the system has been carried out.",

        "A possible way of merging these two in a practical system is to have two components, an information processing component and an interaction component that, as a basis for their tasks, use a set of shared knowledge sources that define the scope of the language and domain.",

        "The corpus consists of more than 250 questions about birds.",
        "It was collected by The Swedish Public Service Television Company on a web site for one of their nature programs, where the public could send in questions, i.e. it is not a dialogue corpus.",

        "The question corpus yielded a user-oriented conceptualisation of the domain, thus providing a non-expert view of the domain useful for the interaction component.",
        "These two conceptualisations were then merged to form a shared domain ontology for all components of the system.",
        "The users' view of the domain as reflected in the questions seemed to correspond to the one found in the reference book, most objects and properties were the same, but there were two aspects that deviated.",
        "The first concerned the classification of birds and the second the granularity of the properties of birds.",
        "users sometimes utilised another way of categorising birds from the biologically oriented taxonomy in the reference book, talking about \"Spring birds\", \"Small birds\", \"Migratory birds\", and \"Birds of prey\" instead of orders, families, kins etc.",
        "In many cases the properties of the birds were more general than the terms used in the book, for example questions about a bird's appearance, e.g. What does a European Robin look like?",
        "which includes plumage, size, body shape, description of beak and feet, etc.",
        "Since the two conceptualisations had many objects and properties in common and these were related in similar ways they could be integrated in the following way (cf. figure 2).",

        "In a similar manner the vague properties were introduced and linked to the existing properties.",

        "Information about summer plumage is missing for Mute swan.",
        "Information about breeding plumage is missing for Mute swan.",
        "The database has many such missing values as very often there was no information in the information source.",
        "It is, thus, not possible to adopt general dialogue strategies, for instance, for clarification requests.",
        "Instead, the domain knowledge base must be consulted to decide on a proper dialogue strategy for each property.",
        "In BirdQuest the unnecessary clarifications can be dealt with through extended cooperation between the dialogue manager and the domain knowledge manager.",
        "When a vague property is encountered the dialogue manager can send the request to the domain knowledge manager for information on suitable clarifications.",
        "By traversal of the ontology the DKM can produce a set of sub-properties which can be used to access the database.",
        "should there be only a few pieces of information these can be returned directly as an answer to the request.",
        "Otherwise the proper clarification is decided based on the relation between the given property and the sub-properties which produced the values.",
        "Note, however, that such a strategy can violate the learning aspect discussed below.",
        "A problem related to unnecessary clarifications are how partial and empty answers should be presented to the user when a vague property has been mapped to several sub-properties, for example \"Plumage\" in s22 in the example above, or \"size\" in the example below.",
        "s2: You can receive information about the size and plumage of a Magpie.",
        "Please specify what you are interested in.",
        "s4: Information about wingspan is missing for Magpie.",
        "A Magpie has a length of 46 cm from beak tip to",
        "In the case of empty answers, S22 above, an alternative could be to just state that Information about plumage is missing for mute swan, and for partial answers the sub-properties with missing information could be omitted.",
        "However, including all the sub-properties have a point in so far as it helps the user learn what type of information the system can provide.",
        "A solution is to make a compromise and make the system adaptive.",
        "This means that the first time a vague property is mapped to a set of sub-properties all of them are presented regardless of whether they have values or not, thereafter empty answers can be omitted.",
        "some seemingly simple interpretation failures that have been tagged as missing information in the lexicon are actually more complicated and relates to the representation of domain knowledge in the ontology.",
        "For example, users tend to ask what colour a specific bird have, see U1 below.",
        "However, in the bird encyclopaedia colour is linked to the body parts of a bird.",
        "The complex relation between the concept \"Bird\" and the property \"Colour\" via the body parts thus have to be captured in the ontology so that this knowledge can be used for interpretation and dialogue management.",
        "s2: Failed to interpret the question.",
        "Please try again",
        "With more information about how concepts and properties are related, for example, through a chain of hypernym and meronym relations, requests like u1 could be dealt with.",
        "since a bird consists ofbody parts and body parts have colours the missing link in the request is a body part and based on this a clarification could be produced A bird has several colours for different body parts.",

        "Migratory birds, as discussed in section 5.1, is another example when the ontology can be used to stipulate a certain interpretation.",
        "With the help of an ornithologist, we can define what migrating behaviour constitutes a migratory bird and add that to the ontology.",
        "used by the information extraction component, we can easily pick those birds that are migratory birds, and as we utilise the same ontology for the interaction component, we can interpret such requests.",
        "Note, however, that this goes beyond our initial goal of only utilising the bird encyclopaedia.",
        "users often posed questions that were outside the database coverage.",
        "A successful interpretation of such a request and an appropriate response is seen in the dialogue below:",
        "u1: What is the wingspan ofan Albatross?",
        "s2: There is no information on non-Nordic birds.",
        "The available birds are listed in the menu \"Birds a-o\".",
        "Please try again",
        "The same strategy could be used to handle similar questions concerning non-Nordic birds like canaries and ostriches.",
        "However, that would require addition of information of non-Nordic birds to the ontology collected from other sources than the bird encyclopedia.",
        "However, in most cases the requests concerned properties that are not covered by the database but users often ask about, for example \"Weight\" and \"Flight-speed\" as in How much does a Sea Gull weigh?",
        "or How fast can an Eagle fly?.",
        "The common response to these types of questions were Failed to interpret the question.",
        "Please try again or in some cases a partial interpretation was made which led to inappropriate responses.",
        "A more desirable response would be to give more informative error messages and explain to the user that it cannot answer questions about these topics.",
        "Extending the ontology could help give informative answers when the questions are outside database coverage.",
        "The properties similar to those in the database, such as \"Weight\", \"Flight-speed\", could be added to the ontology as user-oriented properties.",
        "since the DKM always have to map this type of properties to the system-oriented sub-properties before database access it could conclude that, if a user-oriented property do not have any user-oriented sub-properties, it is outside database coverage and an appropriate answer can be given.",
        "If these properties were related to others, for example, \"Weight\" is a sub-property of \"Appearance\", the system could even suggest some of the sibling properties, in this case \"size\" and \"Plumage\".",
        "Another strategy is to have BIRDQuEsT respond with help phrases explaining how to pose valid requests, as is done in Targeted Help (Gorrell et al., 2002).",
        "Targeted help is used for improving user behaviour in speech interfaces.",
        "It utilises the sLM-based recognition and categorised help message templates to present targeted help when the grammar based recogniser fails.",
        "Thus, a system must learn the most common types of mistakes which in turn must be classified to provide a targeted help.",
        "unfortunately, we do not yet have a large enough BirdQuest corpus for such classification."
