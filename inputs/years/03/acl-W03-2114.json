        "Recent work on dialogue and natural language processing in general has acknowledged the presence of such phenomena in natural speech, and in some cases the importance of its role in dialogue interaction.",

        "We believe that greater focus on \"interaction level\" phenomena is appropriate and will lead to benefits in building dialogue systems for more robust natural interaction.",
        "In this paper, we outline a two-layer architecture for dialogue systems, where one layer uses a range of \"shallow\" processing techniques to maintain a smooth interaction between the dialogue participants.",

        "Clark (1996) distinguishes between two separate communication tracks, which he calls communicative and meta-communicative.",
        "These are simultaneously occurring communications, the first dealing with the information at hand, and the other relating to the performance itself.",
        "Dialogue participants use what Clark refers to as signals to refer to the performance itself: e.g. timing, delays, re-phrasing, mistakes, repairs, etc.",
        "A second motivation is work on architectures for robots and autonomous agents embedded in complex, dynamic, unpredictable environments.",
        "Several researchers in this area have argued for multi-layered architectures for agents that plan action sequences to achieve some goal or task, but need to react quickly to change in the environment (e.g.",

        "(Firby, 1994; Müller, 1996)).",
        "In such architectures, the role of the bottom layer is to monitor the environment and initiate appropriate actions within the broader context of the goal-directed plan, which is provided by the higher layer of the architecture.",
        "The layers operate independently and asynchronously, but communicate as necessary: e.g. goals and plans are passed down to the execution layer, while observations or problems (which may trigger replanning) are passed up to the planning layer.",
        "We view the process of natural interaction with a dialogue participant as analogous to the interaction with a dynamic environment: dialogue phenomena arise which need to be negotiated (as a new obstacle must be avoided by a robot).",

        "The standard processing model for dialogue systems involves a sequence of modules from speech recognition to speech synthesis, as illustrated in Figure 1, which essentially illustrates (a simplification of) the original TRIPS architecture, as described in (Ferguson and Allen, 1998).",
        "Typically, each module is self-contained and relatively independent of other modules.",
        "Recent findings in the psycholinguistic literature have suggested various shortcomings of this modular approach.",
        "For example, work on alignment indicates that conversation participants' processing interacts on multiple levels, contravening the strict modular model (Pickering and Garrod, 2003).",
        "This is one of the considerations we address below, but we are primarily concerned with other interaction-level phenomena.",
        "One of our prime motivations for an interaction level processing layer is to ensure timely response to interaction.",
        "Parsing and processing takes time – this can be alleviated by incremental parsing techniques, but meta-communication signals typically do not need to be interpreted and processed to the same extent as communicative utterances, and instead require immediate attention that precludes full processing.",
        "For example, researchers have looked at the use of um and uh in conversation and found that these are often used as place-holders for a speaker who wants to maintain their speaking turn (Clark and Fox",
        "Tree, 2002).",
        "The detection of fillers such as these generally acts to inhibit (to some extent) the listener from interrupting or taking the turn from the current speaker.",
        "Hence, not only should such discontinuities not be ignored but they must also be processed immediately in order to maintain the ongoing interaction.",
        "Conversely, listeners also use what is known as back-channel feedback to indicate to the speaker that they are listening and paying attention.",
        "For English, back-channels include uh-huh, mhm and yeah.",
        "Back-channels differ from other devices used to keep a conversation flowing, such as repetitions and collaborative finishes, in that they tend to be nonspecific to the current utterance.",
        "Moreover, backchannel feedback is often produced without thinking, in response to simple prosodic clues such as a speaker pause, a lowering of speaker pitch, or a rise in speaker intonation (Ward and Tsukahara, 1999).",
        "Most importantly, however, back-channel feedback is important to the speaker.",
        "Bavelas et al.",
        "(2000) investigated how a speaker in a conversation (in this case someone narrating a story) is affected when listener responses are inhibited.",
        "They found that speakers with distracted and unresponsive listeners did not finish their stories effectively, measurably faltering at what should have been the dramatic ending.",
        "Speakers needed an interlocutor's feedback to be able to maintain fluency and continue the dialogue effectively.",
        "Bavelas et al. also found that response latency in one-on-one conversations is extremely short and may be simultaneous: listeners can provide back-channels without fully listening to the conversation partner and without being responsible for taking up a speaking turn.",
        "These results indicate that the nature of interaction between participants is crucial to the collaborative act of dialogue – signals and feedback that carry effectively no communicative content are still important for keeping the interaction smooth and to ensure that the participants stay attentive and focussed on the task at hand.",
        "When the dialogue task involves, say, a human user being guided through a safety-critical activity by an automated system, then such issues are of particular importance.",
        "Conversely, communicative behavior contains signals regarding a participant's attention, and in particular may indicate a loss of focus.",
        "In tutorial settings – one of the dialogue applications we are specifically concerned with – this can be used to determine students' confidence in their responses.",

        "In this standard architecture, modules tend to be self-contained and only loosely dependent.",

        "We augment the TRIPS approach by combining multiple processes for interpreting utterances (e.g. structured parsing versus statistical techniques) and for generating responses (e.g. generation from semantic representation versus template-based).",
        "More fundamental to the architectural distinction we propose, the processing of an utterance and generating an appropriate response may proceed without full processing by the Dialogue Management component: information gleaned from an utterance will always be passed up to the Dialogue Manager, but to ensure timely response, an appropriate response may be produced directly from a low-level component.",
        "Other processes included at the interaction layer detect non-communicative information, such as gaps or delays in the user s speech.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates various aspects of the specific two-level architecture we are developing.",
        "The lower level interfaces directly with the user and, importantly, is driven by this interaction.",

        "The agent may wish to communicate its own goals, the progress of its activities, or report on any observations it makes regarding its environment.",
        "As with multi-layered agent architectures, the two levels operate semi-autonomously and asynchronously: the lower level is driven by tight interaction with the user, while the upper level is driven by longer-range communicative goals from its activities and responses to user utterances.",
        "However, various types of information exchange connect the two levels.",
        "For instance, user utterances recognized at the lower level must clearly be passed to the content-management level to be parsed and then incorporated into the dialogue context, while high-level communication goals must be passed to the lower level's Output Agenda for generation and speech-synthesis.",
        "The Output Agenda plays a crucial role in mediating utterances to be communicated, whether they be system-initiated or responses, and generated from the planner or a low-level component.",
        "The Output Agenda is a prioritized list, where an utterance's priority is influenced by a number of factors, such as: whether it is in response to an error or misunderstanding (i.e. \"Pardon\"); the importance of the communicative content (i.e. an urgent observation); and the dialogue move that generated it (e.g. answering a question).",
        "The Agenda runs asynchronously, aggregating multiple utterances when appropriate as well as influencing speaker turn (see below).",
        "Of perhaps greater interest, the interaction level can be used to monitor user engagement and attention in other ways – e.g. time between utterances, speaking rate, use of speech fillers – to detect potential problems as soon as possible, and to provide early warning to the content layer that the user may have, for example, misunderstood some instruction.",
        "This can be used to generate a clarification or grounding sub-dialogue, in order to establish mutual understanding before proceeding (thus improving robustness of the system as a whole).",
        "Conversely, expectations at the upper-layer can influence processing at the interaction layer: for example, open points of attachment on the Dialogue Move Tree represent types of utterances the system expects from the user, and these are used to prime the recognition of incoming utterances for faster processing, as well as influencing the turn.",
        "In engineering terms, this division of labour is attractive in that the clarity and modularity of dialogue management is enhanced.",
        "Rather than conflating, for example, turn-management with utterance planning in a single generation component of a dialogue system, the separation into multiple levels of processing allows different turn-taking and utterance planning strategies to be developed independently, and various combinations to be experimented with.",

        "These accounts rely on the observation that answers generally follow questions, commands are usually acknowledged, and so on, so that dialogues can be partially described as consisting of adjacency pairs of such dialogue moves.",

        "An Activity Tree represents hierarchical and temporal information about the task-state of the dialogue.",
        "Activities are the joint tasks managed by the dialogue: e.g. booking a flight or moving a robot – again, see (Lemon et al., 2002b) for details.",
        "Nodes on the Activity Tree can be in various states (active, complete, failed, ), and any change in the state of a node (typically because of an action by the agent) is placed onto the system's Output Agenda for potential verbal report to the user, via the low-level message selection and generation module.",
        "This level of the architecture is where conversation planning and generation of system-initiated topics occur.",
        "Any planned communication (whether it be system-initiated or in response to a user utterance) is put on to the Output Agenda, where it is scheduled for generation.",
        "Conversely, true grounding – i.e. acknowledging that an utterance is understood within the context of the rest of the dialogue – only occurs after the utterance has been interpreted with respect to the DMT.",
        "Since a simple acknowledgment may already have been generated after recognition, output after interpretation is only needed if a response is required (e.g. the user asked a question), or if a problem is detected (e.g. an ambiguity must be resolved).",
        "Since system communication is planned here, this layer is also the one that interacts with the rest of the agent architecture: any goals, state-changes, or observations that the agent may wish to communicate are added as communicative goals, typically via the Activity Model.",
        "For command-and-control applications (e.g. guiding a robot or UAV), system-initiated utterances tend to be fairly short and simple and conversation-planning is minimal; however, for our dialogue-enabled tutorial application (Clark et al., 2001), conversation-planning is quite complex and the system may generate multiple, relatively long utterances on its own initiative.",
        "5 Low-level Conversation Management: Maintaining the Communication Channel",
        "We currently employ a range of shallow processing techniques to maintain a smooth interaction with the human dialogue participant.",
        "By \"shallow processing\" we mean processing that does not necessarily result in or concern itself with the semantic representation or pragmatic interpretation of the utterance in the context of the dialogue.",
        "In particular, information at this level is not processed in the context of the Dialogue Move Tree or the Activity Tree.",
        "In the following, we describe a number of the low-level processing techniques currently implemented in our system.",
        "Future work will address more of the interaction phenomena described earlier.",
        "In cases where a user utterance is not recognized, the input is passed to a statistical recognizer of wider coverage.",
        "This recognizer is often able to detect lexical items and grammatical structures in the input that are not covered by the first (grammar-based) recognizer.",
        "In these cases, the results of the second recognition pass are used to inform the user of the system's shortcomings, for example: \"The system heard you say 'Look around for a red car', but the system does not know the word 'around'.",
        "You could say 'Look for a red car' \".",
        "None of these utterances is planned or represented at the top level of dialogue management.",
        "They are produced simply to inform the user of a communication breakdown and to try to keep the communication flowing.",
        "If the user were to indulge in meta-dialogue about the help message, then that message would need to be represented in the high-level context.",
        "However, we present the help message as being generated by a different \"helper\" agent, which disappears (from the GUI) as soon as the help message is produced, thus discouraging the user from engaging it in dialogue.",
        "User tests have shown that the use of this low level module (which can be installed independently of the high-level dialogue manager) significantly improves task completion (both percentage of tasks completed and time taken).",
        "By the fifth task, 100% of users with the helper completed the task as compared with 80% of those without, and those without the helper took on average 53% longer to complete the tasks.",
        "For full details of the evaluation see (Hockey et al., 2003).",
        "Here we use a turn-marker at the low-level of dialogue processing.",
        "The turn can be marked as user, system or none, and is set in a variety of ways.",
        "If the user begins to speak (start-of-speech signal is received from the recognizer) the turn becomes user and any system audio output is stopped.",
        "If the system needs to take the turn (e.g. if it has urgent information it needs to communicate), but turn is set to user, and the user is not speaking, the system will output \"Just a moment\" and so take the turn before generating its required utterance.",
        "Again, note that this turn-grabbing utterance is not planned or represented at the top-level of dialogue moves.",
        "It does not need to enter into such high-level plans or representations because it is required only in order to manipulate and maintain the channel, and does not carry any content of its own.",
        "The demonstration system displays a turn marker on the GUI, allowing observers to monitor the changing possession of the turn.",
        "Aggregation (Appelt, 1985) combines and compresses utterances to make them more concise, avoid repetitious language structure, and make the system's speech more natural and understandable overall.",
        "In our system, this process is carried out not at the level of content planning, but at the lower-level of processing, where content logical forms are manipulated (possibly combined) and converted into strings for speech synthesis.",
        "Indeed, it is important that aggregation functions at this lower level, because the process needs access to:",
        "the message to be uttered (A), what has just been said (B), what is to be said next (C), and the precise surface form of B is only represented at the low-level.",
        "High-level processing only plans the content of the utterance to be generated, and passes it down, and so cannot determine the details of the eventual surface form of the generated utterance.",
        "Aggregation techniques on a prewritten body of text combine and compress sentences that have already been determined and ordered.",
        "In a complex dialogue system however, aggregation should produce similarly natural output, but must function incrementally because utterances are generated on the fly.",
        "In fact, when constructing an utterance we often have no information about the utterances that will follow it, and thus the best we can do is to compress it or \"retro-aggregate\" it with utterances that preceded it (see the example below).",
        "Only occasionally does the Output Agenda contain enough unsaid utterances to perform reasonable \"pre-aggregation\".",
        "At the low-level of processing, the generator receives an item (on the Output Agenda) to be converted into synthesized speech.",
        "This item consists of a dialogue move type along with some content (e.g. wh-answer, location(tower) ).",
        "Each dialogue move type (e.g. report, wh-question, wh-answer) has its own aggregation rules, stored in the class for that logical form (LF) type.",
        "In each type, rules specify which other dialogue move types can aggregate with it, and exactly how aggregation works.",
        "The rules note identical portions of LFs and unify them, and then combine the non-identical portions appropriately.",
        "For example, the LF that represents the phrase \"I will fly to the tower and I will land at the parking lot\", will be converted to one representing \"I will fly to the tower and land at the parking lot\" according to the compression rules.",
        "Similarly, \"I will fly to the tower and fly to the hospital\" gets converted to \"I will fly to the tower and the hospital\".",
        "In contrast, the \"retro-aggregation\" rules result in sequences of system utterances such as,",
        "Sys: I have cancelled flying to the base",
        "Sys: and landing at the school",
        "Again, this process happens only at the low-level processing stage of content realization, and needs no access to the high-level representations of dialogue structure, history, and plans.",
        "A separate thread running in the Output Agenda component asynchronously performs aggregation as needed and appropriate.",
        "Another low-level process in utterance realization is choosing appropriate NPs - anaphoric expressions such as \"it\" or \"there\", or NPs which \"echo\" those already used by the human operator.",
        "Again, this routine does not need access to the high-level dialogue management representations, but only to the list of NPs employed in the dialogue thus far (the Salience List).",
        "Echoing is achieved by accessing the Salience List whenever generating referential terms, and using whatever noun-phrase (if any) the user has previously employed to refer to the object in question.",
        "Anaphoric phrases are generated whenever the reference object is the same as the one at the top of the Salience List.",
        "As in the case of aggregation, the top level content generation algorithm does not manage the details of utterance realization - this is better handled at the instant that the content logical form is to be translated into a string for the speech synthesizer.",
        "Otherwise the top level would have to replan utterances after every intervening dialogue move.",
        "This example shows how respecting the multilevel architecture is desirable from an engineering point of view."

        "Phenomena such as fillers, timing, and feedback must be dealt with properly and in a timely manner; otherwise, the interaction and even the collaborative activity being performed may be adversely affected.",
        "Our approach is to cleanly separate the architecture of dialogue systems to provide for an asynchronous layer that is designed to handle interaction signals, analogously to agent/robot architectures that include a layer to manage interaction with a dynamic environment.",
        "This allows processing outside the full context of a dialogue history when required for processing speed, while allowing the context to still influence such processes when able.",
        "A system has been implemented based on this architecture, containing a range of low-level processes, which we have described here in some detail: shallow-helper feedback; turn-management; aggregation; NP selection.",
        "Current work is directed towards incorporating techniques to manage further phenomena – such as predictors of uncertainty and loss of attention – in both command-and-control and tutoring applications."
