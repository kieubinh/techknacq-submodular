        "Several such tools are discussed in Section 3 explaining why we decided to develop our own annotator.",
        "A brief description of it is presented in Section 4, followed by a three case studies briefly showing how the tool was used for marking different discourse phenomena.",

        "In recent years the need to produce reusable corpora led to an increasing use of XML encoding in annotation.",
        "As a result, the annotation cannot be applied using simple text editors.",
        "In addition, the discourse annotation is usually complicated requiring specialised tools.",
        "In this section, we present the most important characteristics of a discourse annotation tool.",
        "An annotation tool needs to be easy to use; with a minimum time required to learn how it works.",
        "It should also hide unnecessary details from the annotator (e.g. XML tags which are not directly linked to the task).",
        "Usually the annotators are linguists with little or no experience of computers or annotation schemes.",
        "Because of this, an annotation tool has to be designed so that humans provide the information in a very simple and friendly way.",
        "In addition, the tool needs to ensure that no illegal information is introduced during the process (e.g. illegal XML constructions, wrong values for the attributes, etc.",
        ").",
        "Last, but not least, it is desirable that a tool can be used for more than one task, so the annotators do not need to learn a new tool every time the task is changed.",
        "Moreover, in projects which build corpora in several languages, one way to ensure consistency between the annotations in the different languages is by using the same tool.",
        "Therefore, it is desired that a tool is language independent.",
        "PALinkA, the tool presented in this paper meets all these requirements, being appropriate for discourse annotation."

        "Unfortunately the support seems to be discontinued and the documentation how to use the machine learning algorithms is sparse.",
        "When we tried to process texts with rich annotation it became slow.",
        "Other tools which can be used to annotate a large range of discourse phenomena are MATE (McKelvie et al., 2001), ATLAS (Laprun et al., 2002) and MMAX (Müller and Strube, 2001).",
        "All these tools provide advanced frameworks for annotating text and speech, allowing customisation according to the task.",
        "They are very powerful, but they also require advanced computing knowledge in order to install and take full advantage of the facilities they provide.",
        "We consider that the installation and customisation process needs to be simple, so that people without much knowledge about computers can use them.",
        "In the next section, we present PALinkA, a tool which requires little computing knowledge to install and customise, and can be employed in a large number of annotation tasks."
