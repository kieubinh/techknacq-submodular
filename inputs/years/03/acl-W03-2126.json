        "Touch-tone menus are prevalent in call centers for accessing personal records and pre-recorded information.",
        "However, it can sometimes be very frustrating when we need to listen to a long list of options.",
        "Moreover, the information that we are looking for may not seem to be relevant to any of the given options.",
        "Recently, systems that allow people to access information based on spoken inputs have been built.",
        "They require a speech recognizer that is trained on a specific set of key words and speech grammars to understand the spoken inputs.",
        "Callers are guided through a series of prompts.",
        "At each prompt, the callers are supposed to speak out their choices in a way that is easy for the systems to understand.",
        "However, new callers may not know what should they say at different prompts and how should they say it.",
        "They might have spoken their choices too early, or the way they say it is not encoded in the systems grammar.",
        "Thus, we are motivated to work on the problem of accessing information using naturally spoken dialogue.",
        "We allow callers to speak in a natural way.",
        "Our ultimate aim is to provide the caller with the exact piece of information that s/he is looking for through a series of dialogue interaction.",
        "The work reported in this paper is our first attempt toward our ultimate aim, i.e., to determine what the callers want and find out the information the callers have provided that are useful for the task.",
        "To achieve that, we use Smets' (1988) TBM.",
        "TBM is the concept used to justify the use of belief functions (BFs), Dempster's rule of conditioning and Dempster's rule of combination to model someone's belief (Smets, 1988).",
        "Since early 1980's, BFs have generated considerable interest in the Artificial Intelligence community.",
        "In Smets (1999), Denœux (2000) and Zouhal and Denœux (1998), BFs are used to provide sound and elegant solutions to real life problems where some information is missing.",
        "As in Bayesian model, given the available evidences, parts of the amount of belief are allocated to each object in our problem domain.",
        "However, some evidences might support something other than only one of the various domain objects.",
        "In this case, Principle of Insufficient Reason (Smets, 1988) is invoked to decide that the belief mass must be split equally among the domain objects involved.",
        "TBM does not evoke this principle and leaves the belief mass allocated to the disjunct of the domain objects involved.",
        "Examples of the use of BFs include discriminant analysis using a learning set where classes are only partially known; determine the number of sources in a multi-sensor environment by studying the inter-sensors contradiction and pattern classification.",
        "As far as we know, nobody has used BFs to solve problems related to human-computer conversational dialogue.",
        "However, we belief that BFs can be applied on problems related to human-computer conversational dialogue, where the recognized utterances contain insertion, deletion and substitution errors.",
        "Currently, our multi-domain dialogue system contains knowledge of ten different domains.",
        "They are phone directory service (T ), train schedule inquiry (T2), flight status inquiry (T3), travel booking (T4), Bus Service inquiry (T5), financial planning (T ), phone banking (T ), checking of the employee's account (T ), concert ticket booking (T ) and course registration (T ).",
        "Similar works have been reported is the past.",
        "However, their main aim is to do call routing instead of information access.",
        "Their approaches include the use of a vector-based information retrieval technique (Lee et al., 2000; Chu-Carroll and Carpenter, 1999) /bin/bash: line 1: a: command not found Our domains are more varied, which may results in more recognition errors.",
        "In addition, we do not have a training corpus.",
        "However, we have a knowledge base that provides partial information based on word evidences.",
        "For examples, the occurrence of word evidence account indicates that the user wants to access her/his employee's account or bank account, the occurrence of a person name indicates that the user is not checking for a flight status or bus service, the occurrence of word evidence time indicates that the user probably wants to check the train schedules or flight status.",
        "Due to space limitation, readers are advised to refer to Smets (1988; 1997; 1989) for more detailed discussions on BFs, combination of BFs, decision making using BFs and TBM.",
        "2 Ranking Information from the Recognized Utterance of Naturally Spoken Input",
        "Our aim is to use TBM in dialogue management.",
        "First, TBM is used to rank the information identified from the recognized input.",
        "Then, the rank list is used in clarification dialogues if necessary.",
        "Otherwise, the best result is treated as the user input.",
        "Our experiments are done using Sphinx II speech recognition system (Huang et al., 1992).",
        "Using a test corpus of 1977 words, we find that the word recognition accuracy is 54.5%.",
        "In our experiments, we use 139 naturally spoken responses to an open-ended \"How may I help you prompt\" prompt.",
        "The callers are told in advance the list of tasks that the system can perform.",
        "As notations, let U denotes a recognized utterance, n the length of U in number of words and the word evidences from U.",
        "In this experiment, we show whether TBM can be used to identify the caller's intended tasks.",
        "First, we need to identify our problem domain or frame of discernment, A (Smets, 1988).",
        "For task identification, , i.e., the list oftasks presented in Section 1. mWi(T), i.e., the basic belief mass (bbm) of W{ given to T where T g 2A is calculated based on the occurrence frequency of word evidence in the knowledge-bases of .",
        "Currently the knowledge base Kj of each Tj, j = 1..10 consists of (a) a task specification; (b) information schemas for ; and (c) information for task, i.e., the database records, facts and rules, and remote tables and databases used in Tj.",
        "A task specification specifies the goal of the task and the list of steps required to attain the goal.",
        "Each step is linked to either a basic operation, for examples, fetch some records from a database and ask the caller for information, or a sub-task.",
        "Information schemas specify the highlevel formats of the information used in Tj.",
        "They include database schemas, XML schemas of facts and rules, and format descriptions of some remote tables and databases used in .",
        "We do indexing for each so that it is easy to calculate the bbm's mWi(T) where i = l..n and .",
        "We then do the following adjustments to make sure that : if yj,4:.4ca mWi (A) > 1, then the BF mWi is scaled to Figure 1 shows the results of selecting top-n-tasks is also called one; otherwise, where .",
        "the ignorance value relative to A (Smets, 1988).",
        "Larger implies that it is harder to decide which is the intended task of the caller by looking at evidence w,-.",
        "The BF's are then combined using Dempster's rule of combination, by combining mmWj and mWk.",
        "Lastly, Tj,j = are ranked in descending order according to their pignistic probability measure with the top of the rank being the most probable target task.",
        "Experiment results will be presented in Section 3.1.",
        "In this experiment, we show whether TBM can be used to identify the information provided by the caller in U.",
        "Here, the frame of discernment Ainf0consists of the objects in the information schemas for a specific task.",
