        "These are naturally occurring conversational dialogues conducted under unusual circumstances, in which the consultant's goal is to elicit concerns from the patient.",
        "They therefore contain an unusually high level of emotional speech.",
        "When read with a dialogue analyst's eye it is apparent that certain phenomena, interesting to the dialogue analysis community, are affected by the changing level of emotion.",
        "For example, grounding behaviour is more protracted when a participant is discussing a subject about which they feel emotional.",
        "This is manifested in an increase in the number of clarification requests and repetitions.",
        "E.g. -",
        "N. How do you feel when you look at your scar?",
        "P. Erm, it doesn't bother me that much",
        "P. But I still, When I'm washing and everything I still get a funny feeling N. You get a funny feeling, in which way?",

        "I envisage that a scheme to annotate dialogue would constitute one or more layers augmenting an existing annotation scheme.",
        "There are plenty of other schemes developed for previous dialogue research, many of which are designed to investigate a particular phenomenon of communicative behaviour.",
        "In this section we will look at some existing annotation schemes.",
        "We shall investigate if any of the layers may accommodate emotion and which may present interesting correlations with emotional tagging.",
        "Of course when looking for possible indicators of emotional speech it is important to remember that people exhibit different behaviours from each other when they speak.",
        "For example some people are more expressive than others and so a large number of expletives from one person may be natural, and not indicative of their emotional state.",
        "Prosodic studies of emotion also suffer from this complexity and it would be interesting to see if language use, and dialogue behaviour are more robust indicators of emotion than prosody.",
        "Most dialogue research concentrates either on task based dialogue, where the participants converse in order to achieve some set goal (e.g. Maptask (Anderson et al., 1991) Coconut (Di Eugenio et al., 1998)), or on conversational dialogue, which is often less structured and contains a richer use of language (e.g. DAMSL (Core and Allen, 1997) and Chat (MacWhinney, 1998)).",
        "It seems likely that we would see more expressions of emotion in conversational dialogue where people are discussing topics of personal interest rather than the more mechanical process of achieving a goal through communication.",
        "These differences are reflected in the types of phenomena that the schemes are designed to identify.",
        "Task based research may be more interested in the structure of the dialogue and the way that it represents the division of the task into sub-goals.",
        "Schemes to annotate conversational dialogue are more likely to require a greater breadth of dialogue acts to describe the wider range of illocutionary acts that may be performed in this type of speech.",
        "In order to learn how current annotation schemes accommodate emotion, we aligned the layers in a number of schemes.",
        "(Core and Allen, 1997; Di Eugenio et al., 1998; Traum, 1996; Walker et al., 1996; MacWhinney, 1996; Jekat et al., 1995; Anderson et al., 1991; Condon and Cech, 1996; van Vark et al., 1996; Walker and Passonneau, 2001).",
        "Layers from different schemes are grouped according to the similar phenomena that they label.",
        "Table 1 shows this alignment.",
        "In this section we will look at these layers and discuss how they may relate to annotating emotion in dialogue.",
        "Information level When analysing task dialogue, we may be interested in knowing whether an utterance pertains to the management of the communications channel, advancement of a task, discussing of a task etc.",
        "In the previous section we suggested that we are more likely to find emotional speech in conversational rather than task dialogue because the latter is more of a mechanical process than conversation.",
        "Perhaps we may consider this layer as an extension of that distinction where sub-dialogues are labelled according to how closely related to the task they are.",
        "This may reveal a correlation where the more related to the task a sub-dialogue is, the less emotional speech becomes.",
        "There is evidence in our corpus that when one participant is attempting to achieve a goal, often the elicitation of information, then the participants' behaviour becomes more business like and the language becomes more formal and less expressive -",
        "N. Was that Dr Smith who you saw there?",
        "P. Yes but it wasn't Dr Smith it was another doctor.",
        "N. Right.",
        "P. But I was under Dr Smith.",
        "N. Right.",
        "So when did you actually have those radiotherapy treatments?",
        "P. I had the radiotherapy October 13th.",
        "N. Right, thank you.",
        "Communications status",
        "Communications status indicates whether an utterance was successfully completed.",
        "It is used to tag utterances that are abandoned or unintelligible ratherthanwhetherthe intentionofa speechactwas achieved.",
        "Although failure to perform a successful utterance may be partly due to the emotional state of the speaker, annotating such utterances for their emotional content may be difficult, especially from the textual content alone.",
        "This and the multiplicity of reasons for unsuccessful communication means that using communications status as an indication of emotion in the speaker will produce unreliable results.",
        "In Human-Machine dialogue failure on behalf of the machine to communicate can lead to frustration and anger in the user.",
        "In these cases communication status may signal behaviour that can result in emotion in the listener which is also applicable to Human-Human dialogue.",
        "Speech acts",
        "All of the schemes that we examined annotated the utterances for their illocutionary force.",
        "Since this is the layer that contains most information regarding the semantic content of an utterance, this is likely to be where we shall find the most interesting correlations.",
        "We have already seen that high levels of emotion in dialogue alters the frequencies of dialogue acts compared with the more impassive conversations conducted in the Switchboard corpus (Wood and Craggs, 2002).",
        "Forward communicative functions describe utterances that intend to evoke some response from the listener (such as believing a statement or answering a question), perform an action (such as committing to something) or similar dialogue advancing functions.",
        "These types of utterance are likely to be motivated by some intention or belief on behalf of the speaker, providing clues as to their cognitive state.",
        "Forward communicative functions can play an important role in eliciting emotional responses from the listener.",
        "Open ended questions are more likely to produce an emotional response than a yes/no question (Maguire et al., 1996b).",
        "This is partly because open questions hand the initiative to the listener allowing them to express themselves.",
        "The relationship between questions, initiative and emotion is discussed further in (Wood and Craggs, 2003).",
        "The following extract from our corpus show how an open question elicits an emotional response from the listener.",
        "N. How were you coping with that yourself?",
        "P. Oh mentally I've never been down mentally",
        "Backward communicative functions are used to label utterances that respond to something that has been said to them.",
        "Some responses are required by the previous utterance, for example an answer following a question.",
        "In these cases the utterance wasn't motivated by a desire on behalf of the speaker but rather an obligation to adhere to the rules of engagement for communication.",
        "This of course doesn't mean that a response can not be emotional.",
        "When faced with a proposal, question or offer the listener is free to react as they wish and this includes emotional responses.",
        "Here a backward communicative act responds to appreciation with sympathy.",
        "N. Good okay.",
        "Well thank you as I say for filling me in and...",
        "P. poor girl you've got to listen to all",
        "However, from observations of our emotional dialogues it appears that short Question-Answer, Offer-Acceptance exchanges tend to be formal.",
        "Emotion tends to build though a sub-dialogue on a topic that speakers find funny, feel anxious about etc.",
        "Dialogue grammars are used to exploit the expected sequences of speech acts.",
        "These can be used in dialogue act classification to predict the next act in a series of utterances (Stolcke et al., 2000).",
        "It may be possible that a complementary approach may be used to automatically identify emotional utterances.",
        "One way would be to develop grammars based on patterns discovered in emotional sections of dialogue where a particular sequence of acts may indicate the proceedings have become emotional.",
        "Another may be to apply established grammars to dialogue so that deviations from the grammar may highlight interesting or emotional passages.",
        "Several annotation schemes contain a layer that labels the topic discussed in an utterance.",
        "This is usually in task domains where there is a finite number of subjects that will be discussed.",
        "For example in the Alparon scheme for transport dialogues (van Vark et al., 1996), the topic layer (called 'coding of information'), labels utterances according to whether they relate to topics such as timetable, price, time and locations.",
        "For our corpus of cancer consultations it is apparent that certain topics are more likely to invoke emotion in people.",
        "However topic annotation is only usually performed in the restricted domains of task dialogues, where the range of topics that may be discussed is limited.",
        "However it is in these types of dialogue that we expect the levels of emotion to be low, and topics are chosen because of their necessity for the task.",
        "Because of this we may not get to see the correlation between topic and emotion that we expect.",
        "Topics may play a further role in identification of emotion in dialogue since in our corpus, patients tend to remain on the same topic for longer when they emotional about it.",
        "Length of a topic, or returning to a previously discussed topic are indications of emotion.",
        "Some schemes distinguish between dialogue phases such as opening, negotiation and query.",
        "Emotion in dialogue also goes through phases and it is possible that there are boundaries between the phases of emotion that correspond to those tagged using the phase layer.",
        "An interesting area of research would be to identify how boundaries between the phases of different levels and types of emotion are manifested in the use of language.",
        "For instance psycho-oncology research states that open ended questions are more likely to elicit emotional responses than yes-no questions (Maguire et al., 1996a).",
        "This may cause a correlation between forward-looking functions and the onset of phases.",
        "Surface form",
        "Surface form tagging is used in David Traum's adaptation of the TRAINS annotation scheme (Traum, 1996) and the Coconut scheme to tag utterances for certain special features such as cue words or negation.",
        "It has been shown that certain syntactic features of an utterance may be indicators of emotion.",
        "For example in German use of modal particles such as 'eben' and 'denn' colour the utterance with a particular emotional attitude.",
        "Although the surface form of utterances is dependent on the style of the speaker, it does sometimes contain indications of emotion.",
        "P. Oh no, no no no no, I'm not in any discomfort",
        "Relatedness and Information relations",
        "The relatedness layer is used to show how utterances relate to one another, usually by tagging an utterance with the distance to the antecedent to which it refers.",
        "Information relation describes the relationship between utterances, for instance that one utterance presents information in support of its antecedent.",
        "These layers are more concerned with the structure of the dialogue than the semantic content and are therefore less likely to correlate well with emotional tags.",
        "It would be interesting to see if the emotional level of the dialogue or its participants has an affect on the dialogue's structure.",
        "In our corpus it appears that discussion of emotional topics is often more protracted, with speakers answering questions with successive statements, each adding more detail to their answer.",
        "This type of behaviour may show up in the relatedness and information relations layers.",
        "Grounding",
        "Grounding describes the process by which common ground between the participants is established.",
        "As with relatedness and information relations, emotion in the dialogue may be manifested in this layer by protracted grounding behaviour as people reiterate points about which they feel emotional.",
        "In our highly emotional corpus this resulted in four times as many summaries and five times as many repetitions than in the Switchboard corpus.",
        "Besides the layers listed here there are other layers included in schemes that do not fit into any of these categories.",
        "For instance Verbmobil (Jekat et al., 1995) includes a layer for annotating the propositional content of an utterance, and content relevance in the Penn multi-party coding scheme (Walker et al., 1996).",
        "Investigation on dialogue annotated for emotion will show whether there are any interesting correlations with these layers."

        "In developing an annotation scheme our first step will be to decide on the facets of emotion which we would like to identify.",
        "Emotion is a very vague word and so it is important that we polarise it into clear and understandable aspects of human cognition.",
        "In order for the annotation to be useful these aspects must have some influence on their communicative behaviour.",
        "They must also be identifiable from the language of the dialogue.",
        "This will mean that the scheme may consist of several layers each describing a different aspect of human emotion.",
        "One of the differences between these types of layers and those current schemes is that rather than discrete categories such as those used to label speech acts we can observe varying levels of emotion.",
        "A precedent for this type of annotation exists in the labelling of expressions of concern in the oncology consultation coding scheme of Psychological Medicine Group at Manchester University (Heaven and Green, 2001).",
        "where these cues are rated 0-3.",
        "If this approach was adopted then we would have to decide on the number of levels to chose from based on a trade-off between ease of performing annotation with getting a fine enough distinction between different levels.",
        "This would allow us to draw conclusions about communicative behaviour under different levels of emotion (e.g. \"The length of utterances becomes longer under increasing levels of anxiety\") and correlations with other layers (e.g. \"People ask open questions when relaxed but closed questions when agitated\").",
        "It would also allow us to plot the quantitative level of emotions throughout the dialogue, investigate the way in which this changes and identify the language phenomena that signal these changes.",
        "If only for pragmatic reasons, it would be wise to choose utterances as the basic unit for annotation.",
        "By utterances here we refer to the common understanding described as 'a sequence of communicative behaviour bounded by lack of activity' (Allwood, 1996).",
        "This would not only allow us to apply other schemes to emotionally annotated dialogue, but also to use tools that have been developed to work on utterances.",
