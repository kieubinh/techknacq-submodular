        "A good parser is expected to return an accurate syntactic structure of a sentence.",
        "This structure is typically forwarded to other modules so that they can work with unambiguous and well-defined structures representing the sentences.",
        "It is to be expected that the performance of an NLP system quickly degrades if the parsing system returns incorrect syntactic structures, and therefore an evaluation of parsing coverage and accuracy is important.",
        "According to Galliers and Sparck Jones (1993), there are two main criteria in performance evaluation: \"Intrinsic criteria are those relating to a system's objective, extrinsic criteria those relating to its function i.e. to its role in relation to its setup's purpose.\"",
        "(Galliers and Sparck Jones, 1993, p22).",
        "Thus, an intrinsic evaluation of a parser would analyse the accuracy of the results returned by the parser as a standalone system, whereas an extrinsic evaluation would analyse the impact of the parser within the context of a broader NLP application.",
        "There are currently several parsing systems that attempt to achieve a wide coverage of the English language (such as those developed by Collins (1996), Jarvinen and Tapanainen (1997), and Sleator and Temperley (1993)).",
        "There is also substantial literature on parsing evaluation (see, for example, work by Sutcliffe et al.",

        "(1998), and Bangalore et al.",
        "(1998)).",
        "Recently there has been a shift from constituency-based (e.g. counting crossing brackets (Black et al., 1991)) to dependency-based evaluation (Lin, 1995; Carroll et al., 1998).",
        "Those evaluation methodologies typically focus on comparisons of standalone parsers (intrinsic evaluations).",
        "In this paper we report on the comparison between an intrinsic evaluation and an evaluation of the impact of the parser in a real application (an extrinsic evaluation).",
        "We have chosen answer extraction as an example of a practical application within which to test the parsing systems.",
        "In particular, the extrinsic evaluation uses ExtrAns, an answer extraction system that operates over Unix manual pages (Molla et al., 2000).",
        "The two grammar systems to compare are Link Grammar (Sleator and Temperley, 1993) and the Conexor Functional Dependency Grammar parser (Tapanainen and Jarvinen, 1997) (henceforth referred to as Conexor FDG).",
        "These parsing systems were chosen because both include a dependency-based parser and a comprehensive grammar of English.",

        "Link Grammar (Sleator and Temperley, 1993) is a grammar theory that is strongly dependency-based.",
        "A freely available parsing system that implements the Link Grammar theory has been developed at Carnegie Mellon University.",
        "The parsing system includes an extensive grammar and lexicon and has a wide coverage of the English language.",
        "Conexor FDG (Tapanainen and Jarvinen, 1997) is a commercial parser and grammar, based on the theory of Functional Dependency Grammar, and was originally developed at the University of Helsinki.",
        "Despite both being dependency-based, there are substantial differences between the structures returned by the two parsers.",
        "Figure 1 shows Link Grammar's output for a sample sentence, and Figure 2 shows the dependency structure returned by Conexor FDG for comparison.",
        "Table 1 explains the dependency types used in the dependency structures of the figures.",
        "The differences between the dependency structures returned by Link Grammar 2.1 and Conexor FDG 3.6 can be summarised as follows.",
        "Direction of dependency: Link Grammar's 'links', although similar to true dependencies, do not state which participant is the head and which is the dependent.",
        "However, Link Grammar uses different link types for head-right links and head-left links, so this information can be recovered.",
        "Conexor FDG always indicates the direction ofthe dependence.",
        "Clausal heads: Link Grammar generally chooses the front-most element to be the head of a clause, rather than the main verb.",
        "This is true of both matrix and subordinate clauses, as exemplified by the Wd and R links in Figure 1.",
        "Conexor FDG follows the orthodox convention of choosing the main verb as the head of the clause.",
        "Graph structures: Link Grammar's links combine dependencies at the surface-syntactic and deep-syntactic levels (e.g., the link Bs, which links a noun modified by a subject-type relative clause to the relative clause's head verb, in Figure 1 indicates a deep-syntactic dependency).",
        "The resulting structures are graphs rather than trees.",
        "An example is shown in Figure 1, where the noun man modified by a relative clause is linked to both the complementiser and the head verb of the relative clause.",
        "Conjunctions: Our version of Link Grammar analyses a coordinating conjunction as the head of a coordinated phrase (Figure 1).",
        "This is a modification of Link Grammar's default behaviour which returns a list of parses, one parse per conjunct.",
        "However in Conexor FDG's analyses the head will be either the first or the last conjunct, depending on whether the coordinated phrase's head lies to the left or to the right (Figure 2).",
        "Dependency types: Link Grammar uses a set of about 90 link types and many subtypes, which address very specific syntactic constructions (e.g. the link type EB connects adverbs to forms of be before a noun phrase or prepositional phrase: He is APPARENTLY a good programmer).",
        "On the other hand, Conexor FDG uses a set of 32 deHill the man.n that came.v ate.v bananas.n and apples.n with a fork.nl Figure 1: Output of Link Grammar.",

        "Both Conexor FDG and Link Grammar also return non-dependency information.",
        "For Link Grammar, this consists of some word class information, shown as suffixes in Figure 1.",

        "Dependency-based evaluations are not easy either: directly comparing dependency graphs (as suggested by Lin (1995), for example) becomes difficult given the differences between the structures returned by the Link Grammar parser and Conexor FDG.",
        "We therefore need an approach that is independent from the format of the parser output.",
        "Following Carroll et al.",

        "'See (Jarvinen and Tapanainen, 1997) for more information on the output from Conexor FDG.",
        "each relation specify a head, a dependent, and possibly an initial grammatical relation (in the case of SUBJ in passive sentences, for example) or the 'type', which specifies the word introducing the dependent (in the case of XCOMP).",
        "For example, the grammatical relations of the sentence the man that came ate bananas and apples with a fork without asking has the following relations:",
        "The terms 'head' and 'dependent' used by Carroll et al.",
        "(1998) to refer to the arguments of grammatical relations should not be confused with the similar terms in the theory of dependency grammar.",
        "Grammatical relations and dependency arcs represent different phenomena.",
        "An example should suffice to illustrate the difference; consider The man that came ate bananas and apples with a fork.",
        "In dependency grammar a unique head is assigned to each word, for example the head of man is ate.",
        "However man is the dependent of more than one grammatical relation, namely SUBJ (eat, man, _) and SUBJ (come, man, _).",
        "Furthermore, in dependency grammar a word can have at most one dependent of each argument type, and so ate can have at most one object, for example.",
        "But the same is not true for grammatical relations, and we get both OBJ(eat,banana) and OBJ(eat,apple) .",
        "Our intrinsic evaluation began on the assumption that grammatical relations could be deduced from the dependency structures returned by the parsers.",
        "In practise, however, this deduction process is not always straightforward; for example complexity arises when arguments are shared across clauses.",
        "In addition, Link Grammar's analysis of the frontmost elements as clausal heads complicates the grammatical relation deduction when there are modifying clauses.",
        "An existing corpus of 500 sentences/10,000 words annotated with grammatical relations was used for the evaluation (Carroll et al., 1999).",
        "We restricted the evaluation to just the four relations shown in Table 2.",
        "This decision had two motivations.",
        "Firstly, since the dependency parsers' output did not recognise some distinctions made in the hierarchy of relations, it did not make sense to test these distinctions.",
        "Secondly, we wanted the deduction of grammatical relations to be as simple a process as possible, to minimise the chance of introducing errors.",
        "This second consideration also led us to purposefully ignore the sharing of arguments induced by control verbs, as this could not always be deduced reliably.",
        "Since this was done for both parsers the comparison remains meaningful.",
        "Algorithms for producing grammatical relations from Link Grammar and Conexor FDG output were developed and implemented.",
        "The results of parsing the corpus are shown in Table 3.",
        "Since Conexor FDG returns one parse per sentence only and Link Grammar returns all parses ranked, the first (i.e. the best) parse returned by Link Grammar was used in the intrinsic evaluation.",
        "The table shows significantly lower values of recall and precision for Link Grammar.",
        "This is partly due to the fact that Link Grammar's links often do not connect the head of the clause, as we have seen with the Wd link in Figure 1.",
        "Link Grammar took 1,212 seconds to parse the 10,000 word corpus, while Conexor FDG took 20.5 seconds.",
