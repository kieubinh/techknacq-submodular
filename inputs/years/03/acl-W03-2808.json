        "However, we were anxious about continuing to focus our efforts on just 40 of the 10,000 ambiguous words of the language, as it seemed plausible that some issues had simply not arisen in the first sample, and if we did not switch sample, there was no chance that they would ever be encountered.",
        "All Senseval resources are in the public domain and can be (and have been) used by researchers wanting to compare their system performance with performance figures as in Senseval proceedings.",

        "But the person might make mistakes, and there may be problems of interpretation and judgement calls where a different human may well have given a different answer.",

        "The task was to produce a gold standard corpus in which words were associated with their appropriate meanings, with the inventory of meanings taken from a dictionary.",
        "Firstly, tagset size is assumed to be fixed.",
        "In the Senseval context, there were three issues here.",
        "1.",
        "There were two variants of the task: 'lexical sample' and 'all-words'.",
        "In the all-words variant, all content words in a text are tagged.",
        "Some will be highly polyse-mous, others not polysemous at all.",
        "It is not clear how to present kappa figures that are averages across datasets where the tagset size varies.",
        "In the lexical sample task, first, a sample of sentences containing a particular word is identified, and then, only the instances of that word are tagged, so the issue does not arise immediately.",
        "It does still arise if a kappa figure is to be computed which draws together data from more than one lexical-sample word.",
        "2.",
        "In addition to the dictionary senses for the word, there were two tags, U for 'unassignable' and P for 'proper name', which were always available as options for the human taggers.",
        "If included, for purposes of calculating kappa, a word that only has two dictionary senses is classified ctS ct four-way choice, which seems inappropriate, particularly as U and P tags were quite rare and absent entirely for some words.",
        "3.",
        "There were a number of other 'marginal' senses which, if included in the tag count, extend it greatly (for some words).",
        "In the Senseval-1, taggers largely worked within a given word class, so noun instances of float were treated separately from verb instances, but, in e.g., noun cases where none of the noun instances fitted, they were instructed to consider whether any of the verb senses were a good semantic match (even though they evidently could not be a syntactic match).",
        "Also some words formed part of numerous multi-word units that were listed in the dictionary.",
        "Where a tagger found the lexical-sample word occurring within a listed multi-word unit, the instruction was to assign that as a sense.",
        "One response to issues 2 and 3 is to use a more sophisticated model of random guessing, in which, rather than assuming all tags are equally likely for the random guesser, we use the relative frequencies of the different tags as the basis for a probability model.",
        "The method succeeds in giving less weight to marginal tags, at the cost of making the maths of the calu-clation more complex and the output kappa figures correspondingly harder to interpret.",
        "Secondly, the Senseval tagging scheme allowed human taggers to give multiple answers, and also allowed multiple answers in the tagging scheme.",
        "Thirdly, in Senseval the number of humans tagging an instance varied (according to whether or not the instance was problematic).",
        "Fourthly, there is a distinction between two kinds of occasion on which two taggers give different tags.",
        "It may be a problematic case to tag, or it may be simple human error (such as a typo).",
        "Arguably, simple typos and similar are of no theoretical interest and should be corrected before considering IAA.",
        "A related point is the distinction between agreement levels (between individual taggers) and replica-bility (between teams of taggers).",
        "Where the concern is the integrity of a gold standard resource, replicability is the real matter of interest: would another team of taggers, using the same data, guidelines and methods, arrive at the same taggings?",
        "A tagging methodology which guards against simple errors, wayward individuals, and wayward interpretations will tend to produce replicable datasets.",
        "All of these considerations can be addressed using a variant of kappa.",
        "My point is that kappa becomes harder and harder to interpret, as more and more assumptions and intricacies are built into its calculation.",
        "Kappa has been widely embraced as an example of an aspect of evaluation technology that carries across different HLT evaluation tasks, giving a shimmer of statistical sophistication wherever it alights.",
        "My sense is that it is a bandwagon, which HLT researchers have felt they ought to jump on in order to display their scientific credentials and ability to use statistics, which, in many places where it has been used, has led to little but gratuitous obfuscation."
