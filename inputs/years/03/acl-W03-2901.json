        "In this paper we report on an exploration of the relations between inflection and word derivation (WD) in Czech.",
        "At first the inflectional morphology has to be mentioned which deals with formation of word forms by inflection, i. e. by morphological processes like the declension of nouns, adjectives, pronouns and numerals, the conjugation of verbs, and also forming degrees of adjectives and adverbs.",
        "The inflectional morphology (in Czech) is formally quite well described and at present we have reliable software tools at our disposal that make it possible both to generate and recognise arbitrary Czech word forms.",
        "They are ajka a morphological analyser and generator (Sedlacek and Smrz, 2001) and I_par a program for morphological database (Veber, 2002).",
        "The second area is derivational morphology, i. e. word derivation as such - it describes the processes of the derivation of new words (one word expressions) as distinct from basic ones (word bases).",
        "These processes operate on the morpheme level whose results follow from the ways of combining morphemes (prefixes, stems or roots, infixes, suffixes) using suffixation, prefixation and stem alterations (infixation).",
        "We have to bear in mind that the consequences of these formal processes have a semantic nature.",
        "The relations between the WD processes and inflectional morphology have been extensively studied in Czech linguistic literature, see e. g. (Dokulil, 1962; Karlik et al., 1995; Petr, 1986) where one may find informal descriptions of the WD processes using terms like \"fundace\" (basic derivation), as well as mutation, transposition, modification, adaptation, and others.",
        "The most interesting linguistic analyses link the derivation patterns with the inflectional ones.",
        "For example, in Karlik (1995) it is pointed out that the nouns with the suffix -tel having agentive meaning belong to the inflectional paradigm muz (man).",
        "In other words, it is possible to say that some inflectional patterns determine the sets of derivational suffixes forming semantically consistent groups of nouns.",
        "In this paper we set it as our task to map the relations between inflectional and word derivational patterns.",
        "In comparison with previous research we present the exploration of a large collection of data: our stem dictionary for Czech contains 385,066 items.",
        "The association of selected inflectional and WD patterns has been performed semi-automatically with the tool I_par and the",
        "Czech morphological database which contains all the necessary information about the inflectional paradigms in Czech (2,042 paradigms for all 10",
        "POS).",
        "The WD relations as they are described in the linguistic WD theories can be, after some modifications, appropriately linked to the semantic relations as they are used in contemporary ontologies and then applied within the inference engines that form a necessary part of the natural language processing mechanisms.",
        "However, it is true that algorithmic descriptions of WD relations have been worked out only recently and they do not cover the WD processes in all their complexity but just at the basic level."

        "It has to be kept in mind that the derivational analysis deals only with lemmata and not with the individual word forms.",
        "For the purpose of this work we perform inflectional analysis with the tool (program) ajka (Sedlacek, 1999) which is further developed in the NLP Laboratory (Sedlacek and Smrz, 2001) at FI MU.",

        "Non-motivated words cannot be described in the same way.",
        "Their meaning consists only in signifying the thing, which is why they are sometimes called words-signs, as e. g. stuul (table), trava (grass).",
        "Thus it is obvious that when making WD analyses we are more interested in motivated words, since only they display the derivational structure from which we are able to reconstruct the process of their formation.",
        "Formation of motivated word follows the basic WD relation called \"fundace\" (Dokulil, 1962).",
        "When we find the 'fundace\"-relation for all motivated words we obtain a complex of relations that form a hierarchical structure.",
        "In WD theory this structure is usually called word derivation nest, word derivation lattice and word derivation sequence.",

        "The appropriate formal apparatus for representing these relations and structures are graphs.",
        "For this purpose the special types of graphs (see Fig. 1), particularly graph-trees are used which further link up into forests.",
        "Strictly speaking we are dealing mainly with forests.",
        "The tree nodes are labelled with lemmata, and the next node is created dependent on its predecessor.",

        "Thus ucitel (teacher) je ten, kdo uci (is the one who teaches), zoubek (small tooth) je maly zub (is a tooth of small size).",
        "The meaning that follows from the WD relations is usually labelled as word derivation or internal meaning.",
        "This is a rather narrow point of view, typical of linguistic WD theories, since there is no reason to introduce separate semantic relations - they are the same as other semantic relations, for example the Internal Language Relations defined within EuroWordNet 1, 2 (Vossen, 1998).",
        "For the computer processing of the word meanings, it is necessary to bear in mind that semantic relations have a common nature irrespective of the forms by which they are expressed.",
        "From this point of view, it is obvious that there is no relevant difference between WD meaning and 'normal' lexical meaning as it is treated within the framework of semantic networks that are nowadays so popular in NLP and Language Engineering.",

        "Moreover, in this step the paradigms neumetel a KocabjiM have been removed.",
        "Also the number of lemmata assigned to the paradigm ucfitel (teacher) has been reduced to half, i. e. from 908 to 454.",
        "This means that according to our data (our morphological database) half of the agentives cannot form the feminine counterpart and this result can be expected to be confirmed by examining a larger corpus.",
        "The step C is again regular - it consists in the derivation of feminine possessives using suffix in with a number of lemmata not being changed.",
        "In the step D the adjectives are formed by means of suffix sky and this process is less regular.",
        "From the possible 454 lemmata belonging to the paradigm ucfitel the adjectives are derived only from 113+21+16=150.",
        "Moreover, these adjectives split into three adjective paradigmsprafsky (Prague), spolecensky (social) and kremzfskyi (Crems) depending on whether they form a comparative and adverb or not.",
        "The following step is again regular - it involves the derivation of adverbs from adjectives by shortening the last vowel from yi to y.",
        "It can be seen that from the adjectives belonging to the paradigm kremzfskyi such adverbs cannot be formed at all.",
        "The step E is irregular as well and it involves the derivation of the nouns from the respective adjectives by replacing the suffix sky for -sttvi."

        "Within this task we also demonstrated, using the selected examples, how the inflectional paradigms can be employed to create more general but less regular word derivation patterns, how both can be linked together and how WD patterns can be used to describe the selected WD processes in an algorithmic way.",
