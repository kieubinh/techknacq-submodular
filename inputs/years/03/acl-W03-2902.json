        "In book form, Zaliznjak's dictionary has two parts.",
        "The first is a set of tables identifying mor-phosyntactic classes and defining the realization of morphological features with them.",
        "The second is a listing of lexical entries, each followed by an index referring to a table in the first part which gives the paradigm for this particular type.",
        "For example, the word aôawcyp 'lamp shade' is a masculine noun of type 1A and as such follows the inflectional pattern of saeod 'factory' which is given as the example paradigm for masculine nouns of type 1A.",
        "The electronic form contains just the set of lexical entries (101401 lines, 98729 lexical entries).",
        "Thus our mapping process has two distinct components:",
        "1. manual construction of a DATR representation of the morphosyntactic class and realization information from the printed paradigm tables;",
        "2. automatic construction of the individual lexical entries from the electronic dictionary data.",
        "In practice we also introduce a third component, interfacing between the morphosyntactic classes and the automatic entries.",
        "As we discuss below, this gives us increased flexibility in the way we interpret the Zaliznjak data.",
        "The information in Zaliznjak's dictionary includes a fair number of subregular and idiosyncratic cases.",
        "The target representation, DATR, is specifically designed to support such situations, providing concise representation of hierarchically organized lexicons containing generalizations and exceptions.",
        "We have already a formal theoretical model of Russian morphology (Corbett and Fraser 1993; Brown, Corbett, Fraser, Hippisley and Tim-berlake 1996; Brown 1998) which underlies our approach.",
        "In addition, as we have a frequency based resource to check against (Brown, Corbett and Fraser 1995; Brown, Hippisley, Corbett and Fraser 1995), we are in a good position to check the accuracy of our automatic creation of lexical entries for the high frequency, least regular cases.",
        "The same framework can also be used to capture generalisations across languages (cf. Cahill and Gazdar 1999; Tiberius 2001), but this is not our current goal.",

        "These morphological types are then further divided according to stress.",

        "Here, NOMINAL defines the morphotactics of Russian nominals (nouns and adjectives), comprising a stem followed by a suffix that realizes the morphological features.",
        "NOUN inherits this definition and defines three plural suffixes that are generally shared between nouns, NOUN_M adds specific syntactic features and finally NOUN_M_1A fills out the rest of the possible suffixes.",
        "Notice that <stem> is not defined in this theory - it will be determined on a per-lexical entry basis from the automatically generated entries described below.",

        "Classes of feminine and neuter nouns are handled similarly; for feminine nouns, eight types and nine different stress patterns are identified, whereas for neuter nouns eight types and six stress patterns are distinguished.",
        "In addition, most of these types are found with both animate and inanimate nouns, and in the DATR theory, two noun classes are distinguished for each type occurring with both animate and inanimate nouns.",
        "In total about 100 different noun classes are distinguished per gender in the DATR theory.",
        "In order to make use of this theory, a lexical entry needs to inherit from the node representing its noun class and provide the specific morphotactic elements associated with the class.",
        "So for example, a possible definition for aôajtcyp 'lamp shade' might be:",
        "<> == NOUN_M_1A <stem> == aöaacyp .",
        "From this definition, plus the preceding example fragment, the standard inference rules of DATR allow all the relevant inflectional forms to be derived:",

        "Note that stress is not currently indicated in the derived forms.",
        "Our research involves the morpho-syntactic analysis of written text which generally does not mark stress.",
        "However, as the distinctions related to stress that are made in Zaliznjak (1977) have been kept in the DATR theory, the stress patterns can easily be used in our analysis of syncretism and frequency.",
        "In its electronic form, Zaliznjak represents each lexical entry as a text string of the sort given here for the word aôawcyp 'lamp shade':",
        "Here, the first item is the (uppercase) citation form of the word, the second is a line identifier (line 01 of 01 lines), the third is the word annotated with stress information, the fourth is gender/animacy information and the fifth morphological type.",
        "However, inevitably, many of the entries are more complex than this in various ways:",
        "1.",
        "Entries can spread over several lines, requiring textual concatenation of just the parts following the line identifier information to build the complete entry.",
        "2.",
        "Where inflectional class does not correspond to gender/animacy, it may be specified separately between angle brackets.",
        "For example, dedyiuua MO <2CO 3*A> 'grandfather' is a masculine noun which declines as a feminine noun of type 3*A.",
        "3.",
        "Alternative values for stress patterns and sometimes classes may be present between square brackets.",

        "Other punctuation (commas etc.)",
        "may or may not be present.",
        "In order to deliver lexical entry information in the form required by the hand-crafted theory, this data needs to be parsed and interpreted into the kind of format we saw above.",
        "A standard approach to this task is to use regular expression search and substitute commands to incrementally rewrite the data strings into a more uniform format and ultimately into the required input.",
        "However, DATR itself also provides powerful string-rewriting functionality, particularly suited for dealing with awkward exceptional cases, but less efficient for more routine rewriting.",
        "The approach we have taken strikes a balance between these two technologies.",
        "Initially we use regular expression rewriting to achieve a basic parse of the input data: joining multiple lines together, removing duplicate spaces, isolating various bracketed expressions, parsing the remaining fields and finally mapping into a DATR definition for each entry.",
        "However this DATR definition is very surface-oriented - little more than a basic segmentation of the input data.",
        "This process can be carried out completely automatically with a fairly high accuracy.",
        "But in order to link such entries to the core morphological classes, further interpretation of the data fields identified is necessary, and this is achieved dynamically in DATR.",
        "For example, a typical simple lexical entry is the lexeme apucmoKpamKa 'female aristocrat'.",
        "Its entry in Zaliznjak is:",
        "AFMCTOKFATKA 0101 APMCTOKF<ATKA XO 3*A",

        "<src cls> == '3*A'.",
        "This node is an instance of the predefined node ZALNODE with index number 30 (meaning simply that it was the 30th node to be processed in this batch).",
        "The <src txt> feature (omitted due to lack of space) is the whole original source string, and the other features provide the key components of the entry (cit - citation, str - stressed, gen -gender/animacy, cls - class).",
        "This is the 'surface level' representation of the lexical entry.",
        "The DATR node ZALNODE interprets this information to define implicitly a 'deep' representation as required by the morphological classes, roughly equivalent to this:",
        "Z-AFMCTOKFATKA:",
        "<root begin> == apMCTOKpaT <root end> == k.",
        "Here, the gender/animacy and class information have been combined (and transliterated to Latin script) to determine the declension class for this form.",
        "The stem forms for this class have been determined from the citation form (the morphotactic specification for NOUN_FO_3*A indicates what components are required - different from the simpler NOUN_M_1A case above, to allow for the possible insertion of a fleeting vowel).",
        "ZALNODE does not actually create a new node definition for the deep representation.",
        "Rather, appropriate values for deep features are calculated dynamically when the declension class code requests them, by rewriting and transforming the values provided by the surface form definitions.",
        "The overall effect is that, just as we saw previously, the declension class definitions can use this information to provide the syntax and all the inflected forms for this word:",
        "For most of these forms the inflection follows the value of <root_begin> and <root_end>.",
        "Notice, however, that in the genitive and accusative plural forms, a fleeting vowel, o in this case, is inserted between these two components.",
        "An example of a more complex lexical entry is apMeeij 'soldier' which is a masculine animate noun of type 5*A.",
        "This noun has a fleeting vowel which appears in the nominative singular apMeeij (phonologically armejec).",

        "In addition, we wanted the resources we created to be maximally reusable in other contexts, so a solution in line with agreed standards was highly desirable.",
        "To achieve these goals, we adopted Unicode as the standard representation for all our data, and identified or adapted tools to work with data in that form.",

        "The approach we intend to take will exploit the handcrafted components of the framework to the full, using them to construct recognisers for suffixes (and for verbs, prefixes) and identify potential roots, and then using the full lexicon to filter and validate the resulting candidate analyses (we expect the recognition process to overgenerate solutions).",
        "This will be more compact, probably faster, and able to cope with unknown root forms.",
        "Beyond such a lemmatizer, we are currently investigating how to combine inheritance-based lexical representation with traditional part-of-speech tagging technology, and hope to apply this work to the Zaliznjak data, to deliver a high quality detailed morphosyntactic tagger for Russian texts.",
