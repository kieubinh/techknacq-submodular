        "The mid-nineties saw – to a large extent via EU projects – the rapid development of multilingual language resources and standards for human language technologies.",
        "However, while the development of resources, tools, and standards was well on its way for EU languages, there had been no comparable efforts for the languages of Central and Eastern Europe.",
        "The Multext East project (Multilingual Text Tools and Corpora for Eastern and Central European Languages) was a spin-off of the EU Multext project (Ide and Véronis, 1994); it developed standardised language resources for six languages (Dimitrova et al., 1998): Bulgarian, Czech, Estonian, Hungarian, Romanian, and Slovene, as well as for English, the 'hub' language of the project.",
        "The main results of the project were an annotated multilingual corpus (Erjavec and Ide, 1998), comprising a speech corpus, a comparable corpus and a parallel corpus; lexical resources (Ide et al., 1998); and tool resources for the seven languages.",
        "One of the objectives of Multext East has been to make its resources freely available for research purposes.",
        "In the scope of the telri concerted action the results of Multext East have been extended with several new languages.",
        "This edition is now available via the telri Research Archive of Computational Tools and Resources, at http://www.",
        "tractor.",
        "de/.",
        "Following the telri release, the Multext East resources have been used in a number of studies and experiments, e.g., (Tufis., 1999; Hajic, 2000; Dzeroski et al., 2000).",
        "In the course of such work, errors and inconsistencies were discovered in the Multext East specifications and data, most of which were subsequently corrected.",
        "But because this work was done at different sites and in different manners, the encodings of the resources had begun to drift apart.",
        "The EU Copernicus project Concede, Consortium for Central European Dictionary Encoding, which ran from '98 to '00 and comprised most of the same partners as Multext -East, offered the possibility to bring the versions back on a common footing.",
        "Although Concede was primarily devoted to machine readable dictionaries and lexical databases (Erjavec et al., 2000), one of its work-packages did consider the integration of the dictionary data with the Multext East corpus.",
        "In the scope of this workpackage, the corrected mor-phosyntactically annotated corpus was normalised and re-encoded.",
        "This release of the Multext East resources (Erjavec, 2001a; Erjavec, 2001b) contains the revised and expanded morphosyntac-tic specifications, the revised lexica, and the significantly corrected and re-encoded 1984 corpus.",
        "In Table 1, we give all these connected resources by language, type and release.",
        "The ones marked by T belong to the TELRI edition, and those with C to the Concede edition.",
        "A special case is the Serbian specification, on which we have started working recently.",
        "The columns distinguish the resource in question: \"Other Res.\"",
        "are the multilingual tool specifications and the speech and comparable corpora, \"1984 Doc\" refers to the structurally annotated parallel Orwell corpus, and \"1984 Align\" to the sentence alignments.",
        "By far the most useful part of the Multext East project deliverables proved to be the mor-phosyntactic resources, and these were also taken forward to Concede.",
        "These resources are also included in the telri edition, but have been since substantially modified and added to.",
        "Producing this linked set of deliverables was also by the most labour intensive part of the project.",
        "First, while most Multext East languages had pre-existing morphological lexica and annotations, these had to be 7-way harmonised according to the common specifications, a huge task given not only the diversity of languages but also of linguistic practices.",
        "Furthermore, a morphosyn-tactically annotated corpus of 100,000 words was, for most of the languages, the first such resource to be made.",
        "This meant that the annotation had to be done largely manually, and that the corpus annotation process fed back into the lexica and specifications, through a series of revisions.",
        "The morphosyntactic resources consist of three layers, listed in order of abstraction:",
        "1.",
        "1984 MSD: the morphosyntactically annotated 1984 corpus, where each word is assigned its context-disambiguated MSD and lemma, e.g.,",
        "2.",
        "MSD Lexicons: the morphosyntactic lexicons, which contain the full inflectional paradigms of a superset of the lemmas that appear in the 1984 corpus.",
        "Each entry gives the word-form, its lemma and MSD, e.g., walk = Ncns",
        "walks walk Ncnp",
        "3.",
        "MSD Specs: the morphosyntactic specifications, which are the topic of this paper.",
        "They set out the grammar of valid morphosyn-tactic descriptions, MSDs.",
        "The specifications determine what, for each language, is a valid MSD and what it means, e.g., Ncms – > PoS:Noun, Type:common, Gen-der:masculine, Number:singular",
        "To obtain the corpus and lexica, it is necessary to fill out a web-based license agreement, which limits the use of resources to research pruposes.",
        "The specifications, however, are freely available on the Web, under http://nl.ijs.si/ME/.",
        "At the time of writing, the latest version is V2.1/msd/",
        "The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the structure of the Multext East morphosyntactic specifications and quantifies them; Section 3 explains the specifications for the Slavic languages; Section 4 turns to the standardisation of the encoding of the specifications in XML/TEI, and Section 5 gives the conclusions and directions for further work."

        "Originally, these specifications were released as a report of the Multext East project but have, in the Concede release (Erjavec (ed.",
        "), 2001), been significantly revised.",
        "The format of the report has been unified and structured in a more detailed manner (thus leading to an easily navigable HTML version), the formal specifications for some languages have been modified.",
        "The specifications have, in the Concede release also gained a new language, Croatian, and we have recently also added Serbian to the Specifications.",
        "Technically, the specifications are a LTeX document, with derived Postscript, PDF and HTML renderings, where the common tables are plain ASCII in a strictly defined format.",

        "2.1 The Common Part",
        "The common part of the specifications first defines the parts of speech and their codes; Multext East distinguishes the following, where not all PoS are used for all languages: Noun (N), Verb (V), Adjective (A), Pronoun (P), Determiner (D), Article (T), Adverb (R), Adposition (S), Conjunction (C), Numeral (M), Interjection (I), Residual (X), Abbreviation (Y), and Particle (Q).",
        "The common part of the specifications then gives, for each category, a table defining the attributes appropriate for the category, the values defined for these attributes, and one-letter codes to identify the values.",
        "They also define which languages distinguish each attribute-value pair.",
        "To illustrate, a part of the verb table is given in Table 2.",
        "The morphosyntactic descriptions, MSDs, are structured and more detailed than is commonly the case for part-of-speech tags; they are compact string representations of a simplified kind of feature structures.",
        "The first letter of a MSD encodes the part of speech, e.g., Noun or Adjective.",
        "The letters following the PoS give the values of the position determined attributes.",
        "The specifications define, for each part of speech, its appropriate attributes, their values and one-letter codes.",

        "The morphological specifications for Czech were developed exclusively for the Multext East project but the authors had already had some experience with the first draft of morphological specifications for Czech which is now thoroughly described in (Hajic, 2002).",
        "These specifications and the resulting tagset developed by Hajic are nowadays used as a standard for morphological and morphosyntactic annotations of the majority of Czech corpora, especially the 100 million word corpus of synchronic Czech developed within the Czech National Corpus project.",
        "From the present viewpoint, the Multext East specifications for Czech can be regarded as a subset of this standard.",
        "The formalism of both annotation schemes is similar in that both use positional attributes, the important difference being that in Multext East the attribute position is PoS-dependent, whereas in the standard specifications each attribute is always identified with a fixed position in the tag string.",
        "Among the Czech morphologically annotated corpora, only the Czech translation of 1984 is annotated by the Multext East specifications.",
        "The Multext East annotation of this corpus was mapped to the standard annotation, i.e., both 1984 corpora differing only in the tagsets used can now be accessed - both are included in the Czech National Corpus.",

        "The researchers from the Faculty of Mathematics, however, participated in both the TELRI-I and TELRI-II concerted actions.",
        "One of the results of this participation was the Serbian 1984 Doc corpus, but the morphosyntactic specification, lexicon and MSD tagged 1984 were not produced.",
        "Independently of these European projects, the same team was working on the production of a Serbian morphological lexicon (Dusko Vitas and Cvetana Krstev, 2001) in the format of the INTEX system, which is based on the technology of finite-state transducers (Silberztein, 2000).",
        "The team from the Faculty of Belgrade plans to convert its INTEX lexicon to a MSD-type lexicon.",
        "It is to be expected that Serbian MSDs will not differ much from the Croatian ones, as Serbian and Croatian are at the morphological level very similar.",
        "The combination of features and lexicon itself will exhibit more differences.",
        "A further plan is to produce the annotated version of 1984 that will also be used in the scope of BalkaNet project for the validation of the Serbian WordNet being produced, along with the other languages involved in both Multext East and BalkaNet, i.e., Czech, Bulgarian and Romanian.",
        "The first version of the Slovene specifications was produced in the scope of the Multext East project.",

        "Here the specifications were revised and localised.",
        "In particular, all the PoS, attribute, and value names, as well as value codes have been translated into Slovene; the Slovene MSDs are used in the FIDA corpus.",
        "The localisation is achieved by extending the tables with additional columns, giving the translation of the symbol(s) and code.",

        "As has been mentioned, the complete specifications are written in LTeX, where the common tables are plain ASCII in a strictly defined format.",
        "This, over time, has proved to be a good choice, as the format had to be portable and durable, as well as useful for further processing.",
        "While we did write several Perl scripts to process or use the common tables, their structure and that of other parts of the specifications (e.g., the combinations) are still quite implicit, and writing a parsing program is not trivial.",
        "For reuse it would certainly be beneficial if the specifications were converted into a standard interchange format, with the obvious choice being XML.",
        "As the Multext East corpus is already encoded in TEI (Sperberg-McQueen and Burnard, 2002), we pursued the option of using already existing TEI tag-sets to encode (parts of) the specifications.",
        "We have defined the MSD IDs in a TEI feature-value library.",
        "Additionally, we have also taken the common tables of the specifications and converted these to a TEI feature library, and provided a decomposition from the IDs (MSDs) to the attribute-values and their names.",
        "First, we needed to define the list of all valid MSDs.",
        "This, ofcourse, includes the MSDs used in the corpus, but also the MSDs culled from the lexicons; this list then constitutes the authoritative set of valid MSDs for each particular language, and is also included in the language specific sections of the specification.",
        "The MSDs are then encoded as a feature structure library, fsLib , where each MSD is expressed as a feature structure specifying its type (the category, i.e., Part of Speech), the language(s) the MSD is appropriate for, and its decomposition into features.",
        "The value of feats is of type IDREFs, i.e., it contains pointers to the definitions of the attribute/value pairs, e.g., <fs id=\"Npmpa\" type=\"Noun\" select=\"cs sl\" feats=\"N1.p N2.m N3.p N4.a\"/>",
        "The attribute/value pair definitions are given in the common tables of the morphosyntactic specifications and are encoded as a TEI feature library, fLib .",

        "In the corpus, both libraries are stored in a dedicated corpus element, together with the TEI header.",

        "The paper presented the eagles & Multext based multilingual morphosyntactic specifications, which currently include five Slavic languages.",
        "Presented were the Multext East project deliverables and their various editions, esp.",
        "those that deal with morphosyntactic resources.",
        "The structure and formats of the specifications were discussed, and the Slavic languages introduced in more depth.",
        "As mentioned, of the current Slavic languages, Croatian and Serbian do not yet have the lexical and corpus resource utilising the MSDs defined in the specifications; we hope to remedy this shortcoming sometime in the future, as only with such resources can we validate, quantify and exemplify the specifications.",
        "It should be noted that both languages already have lexica that need only to be converted to Multext East MSDs but producing the MSD tagged 1984 corpus is more complex; while both languages already have the text in digital form, the manual annotation of 100,000 tokens with MSDs is a labour intensive process.",
        "The format of the specifications makes it quite easy to add new languages, although choosing which attributes and values to use, and which word-forms and lemmas to assign them too is far from simple, not only because of the difference in languages, but also due to different linguistic traditions as well as computational models.",
        "In our further work on the specifications, it would be of course beneficial to add new languages, and also to re-evaluate some current choices in the specifications.",
        "On the encoding side, we would like to move to complete specifications to a full TEI/XML encoding and XSLT processing."
