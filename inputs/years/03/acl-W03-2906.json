        "The very idea of generating all possible combinations of morphemes appeared in Halle (1973) for the first time in the framework of generative grammar.",
        "Although at that time it seemed that morphology could be represented as a compact subcomponent of the lexicon in the generative grammar, that concept posed several theoretical problems.",
        "The most severe one was defining the criteria for filtering-out non-estab-",
        "Sanja FULGOSI Institute of Linguistics, Faculty of Philosophy, University of Zagreb Ivana Lucica 3 lished, yet possible combinations of morphemes.",
        "In fact this very approach negated the compactness of morphology since the derivative morphology was separated from inflectional.",
        "Later research in generative and lexical phonology (cf. in Mihaljevic 1991:85-86) separated derivative subcomponent from inflectional even more by introducing several layers where different types of rules appeared in different contexts (prefixation, suffixation, composition, inflection...).",
        "Not only rules but also the mode of their application resulted in different patterning schemes, particularly on two poles of that continuum of layers (rigidness of paradigms vs. non-rigidness of derivative system, symmetricity of paradigms vs. non-symmetricity of derivative system, cyclic rules in derivation vs. non-cyclic rules in inflection etc.",
        ").",
        "Recently, there has been several contributions that were aimed at modeling the morphological systems of other Slavic languages with lexicons like Vetulani (2000) for Polish, Klimova and Kocek (2000) and particularly OsolsobÃ« et al.",
        "(2002) for Czech as well as Rojc et al.",
        "(2002) for Slovenian.",
        "Our idea of modeling the morphology of Croatian was somewhere along that track but we wanted to keep the model as simple as possible and use the computational data from the research already completed for Croatian."

        "Already described concept of dividing a model of the morphological system of Croatian was kept along but in its simplified form i.e. consisting of only two components:",
        "1. derivation/composition: modeled as a list of lexical and a list of derivative morphemes with rules for their combining.",
        "A derivational generator could produce all possible combinations of lexical with derivative morphemes regardless of their existence in real texts.",
        "Each combination is not independent combination of morphemes (it equals the stem in traditional grammar), but it serves as the input for the second component.",
        "The cumulative result of generation of all possible combinations on that level could be called \"derivative capacity\" of a language (see Tadic 1994:40).",
        "2. inflection: modeled as a list of generated stems and a list of inflectional morphemes with rules for their combining.",
        "The inflectional generator produces the final word-forms along the paradigms and with regard to inflectional patterns for Croatian as defined and described in detail in Tadic ( 994).",
        "Each generated morpheme combination (from both components) should be accompanied by additional data which could give us the possibility to backtrack the generation or use that data for further processing.",
        "Each of the sub-lexicons of CML has different format covering different linguistic units and accompanying data.",
        "For stem lexicon the format is still under consideration but it could look like this:",
        "where prodavacic- (roughly: selleress-) is generated combination of morphemes, da- is lexical morpheme or root, p1ls1s2s3 is a derivational pattern describing the morphotactic ordering of morphemes.",
        "The p1, l, s1, s2 and s 3 could serve in database as pointers to the lists of morphemes.",
        "The NAf is a tag denoting nomen agentis of feminine gender.",
        "This system of derivational tags is still under construction and it should be submitted to further discussion and possible cross-Slavic-language examination and, hopefully, some standardization as well.",
        "Having in mind the closeness of Slavic languages, it seems that some kind of common recommendation may be achieved at least at the very basic level of unified list of derivational patterns and general semantic categories which are, in some languages more and in some less systematically, represented by certain derivational affixes.",
        "Introducing additional semantic information to that kind of lexicon could also be important because overlapping of derivational and semantic system is not always uniform and there is no exception-free 1:1 mapping.",
        "This kind of resource could be of a help to lexicographers, lexical semanticians, terminologists etc.",
        "Unlike derivation, for inflection there is already established standard for inflectional lexicon and tag system in the form of MulTextEast v2 recommendation (Erjavec 2001) with definition for Croatian dated from 1998.",

        "The lists of transformations are stored in tables, which are isomorphous to the tables with endings and are being accessed the same way.",
