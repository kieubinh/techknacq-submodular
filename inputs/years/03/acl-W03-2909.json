        "Its preliminary results for Polish still do not meet our expectations.",
        "Possible sources ofthe tagger's failures can be: inhomogeneity of the training corpus in preparation, lack of the automatic search of probability models, too general conditional independence assumptions in defining the class of interpretable models.",
        "Automatization of high-quality morphosyntactic tagging for strongly inflective languages, such as Slavic languages, seems to be a much harder task than so called part-of-speech (POS) tagging for weaker inflective languages.",
        "An important factor increasing the complexity is the very design of the tagset.",
        "Usually, the tags assigned to wordlike segments in the former task are long lists of subsequent attribute values, e.g. POS, number, case, gender, person etc.",

        "Allowing the values to be partially ambiguous depending on a context raises questions what is the accurate level of disambiguation (Wolinski and Przepiörkowski, 2001) and how to model it probabilistically in terms of random variables taking disjunctive values (Brew, 1995).",
        "Working for a project aiming at building a large morphosyntactically tagged corpus of written Polish (information site http://dach.ipipan.",

        "The main features of our software are as follows:",

        "Superiority of this approach over simulating a stochastic morphological analyzer by a tagger has been discussed in Hajic (2000).",
        "• The tags processed by the tagger have form of short human-readable lists of attribute values.",
        "Especially, non-applicable attributes are omitted and multiple atomic values can be given for the same attribute.",
        "• The tagger's internal representation of disambiguation alternatives (tagger's decisions) is different than the list of all admissible atomic tags.",
        "In this approach, some kind",
        "of contextually-dependent incompleteness of disambiguation could be learned.",
        "• Special configuration files inform the tagger which tag attributes are to be disambiguated and what multivalued context attribute are relevant for that.",
        "The tagger's inference uses a series of Naive-Bayes-like assumptions founded on joint distributions of disambiguation decisions for one tag attribute and values of one context attribute.",
        "• The values of the context attributes are automatically instantiated and smoothed strings whose templates are given in a handmade configuration file.",
        "This approach allows to combine strengths of generality of context attributes as in n-gram models (Brants, 2000; Megyesi, 2001) with their specificity as for binary features in MaxEnt taggers (Ratna-parkhi, 1996; Hajic and Hladkä, 1998).",
        "Possibility of using alternative files defining the templates of context attributes eases constructive critiques of the particular definition of them.",
        "• The tagger processes XML-formatted texts where input and output files have the same structure.",
        "Especially, it can be run on its own output to disambiguate some attributes in cascade rather than simultaneously.",
        "• The tagger can be used for any other language supplied with morphological analyzer, training data and tagset-dependent configuration files.",
        "In the following bulk of paper, we shall present the features of our tagger in more detail, we shall discuss its preliminary results for our Polish tagging project, as well as, we shall share remarks on possible extensions/improvements of the software behavior.",
        "Our general feeling is that the tagger as we have it implemented and configured now for Polish is not a very practical program: It works very slow and it makes much more mistakes than state-of-the-art taggers.",
        "In fact, the tagger gives its users so much freedom of manual configuration and feedback information in the error reports that they get lost.",
        "We hope that much accuracy can be earned when some automatic search for the optimal configuration files is implemented.",
        "On the hand, we are still afraid if we have not underfitted with various conditional independence assumptions, which restrain the tagger from seeing sequences of very specific tags as something systematic: Especially, each tag attribute is disambiguated probabilistically independently and the program does not allow for treating tags as atomic entities in probability modeling.",
        "This cannot be overcome without a major change in the program and, worse, in the already complex structure of its configuration files.",
        "Despite all these drawbacks, we present some study of how one can think creatively about tagging and how one cannot find a quick break-even when trying to implement too many good guidelines in one piece.",
        "We report on lots of apparently technical details, hoping that their exposition can help see the tagger as something more than a black box and identify the sources of its errors."
