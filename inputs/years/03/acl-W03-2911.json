        "An overwhelming amount of textual information presented in newswire, scientific literature, legal texts, etc., makes it difficult for a human to efficiently localise the information of interest.",
        "In particular, it is doubtful that anybody could process such huge amount of information without an automated help, especially when the information content spans across domains.",
        "The amount of e-documents and their fuzzy structure require effective tools that can help users to systematically gather and make use of the information encoded in text documents.",
        "For these reasons, different text and/or literature mining techniques have been developed recently (e.g. (Hearst et al., 2000; Grobelnik et al., 2000)) in order to facilitate efficient discovery of knowlcient discovery of knowledge contained in large scientific or legal text collections.",
        "The main goal is to retrieve the knowledge \"buried\" in a text and to present it to users in a digested form.",
        "The discovery (and transfer) of knowledge relies heavily on the identification of relevant concepts, which are linguistically represented by domain specific terms.",
        "Terms represent the most important notions in a domain and characterise documents semantically, and thus should be used as a basis for sophisticated knowledge acquisition.",
        "Still, few text-mining systems incorporate deep and dynamic terminology processing, although there is an increasing amount of new terms that represent newly created concepts in rapidly developing fields.",
        "Existing term dictionaries and standardised terminologies offer only a partial solution, as they are almost never up-to-date.",
        "Although naming conventions do exist for some types of concepts (e.g. gene and protein names in biomedicine), these are only guidelines and as such do not impose restrictions to domain experts, who frequently introduce ad-hoc terms.",
        "Thus, the lack of clear naming conventions makes the automatic term recognition (ATR) task difficult even for languages that are not morphologically and derivationally rich.",
        "ATR tools have been developed for English (Frantzi et al., 2000), French (Jacquemin, 2001), Japanese (Nakagawa and Mori, 2000), etc.",
        "Some methods rely purely on linguistic information, namely morpho-syntactic features of term candidates (Ananiadou, 1994).",
        "Hybrid approaches combining linguistic patterns and statistical measures (e.g. (Frantzi et al., 2000)) and machine-learning techniques (e.g. (Hatzivassiloglou et al., 2001)) have been also used.",
        "However, few studies have been done for morphologically rich Slavic languages.",
        "For example, Vintar (2000) presented two methods for extraction of terminological collocations in order to assist the translation process in Slovene.",
        "The statistical approach was based on the mutual expectation and LocalMax measures, and involved collocation extraction from raw text.",
        "The extracted collocations were filtered with a stop-word list, and only collocations containing single-word terms (devised previously by bilingual alignment) were accepted as relevant.",
        "In another approach, she used regular expression patterns to extract term collocations from a morpho-syntactically tagged corpus.",
        "However, these patterns are too general, and consequently not all extracted phrases were terminologically relevant.",
        "In this paper we discuss automatic terminology recognition in Serbian, in particular, the extraction of multiword terms, which are very frequentin certain domains (e.g. natural sciences, mathematics, etc.).",
        "Since Serbian is a highly inflective and morphologically and derivationally rich language, morpho-syntactic clues are indispensable in the ATR process.",
        "Our hybrid approach (called srCe - Serbian C-value) combines morpho-syntactic features of term candidates and statistical analysis of their occurrences in text.",
        "In addition, since terms appear in texts in many different forms due to their morphological and derivational variations, the necessity of taking these variations into account becomes particularly apparent.",
        "Therefore, the SRCE method incorporates generic morpho-syntactic patterns, a term normalisation approach and a foreign word detection method.",
        "The paper is organised as follows: in Section 2 we present an overview of the core term extraction method, called the C-value method.",
        "In Section 3 we discuss morpho-syntactic clues, the normalisation approach and the foreign word recognition that are used for singling out terms in Serbian.",

        "The approach is hybrid: the method combines linguistic knowledge (term formation patterns) and statistical analysis.",
        "Linguistic knowledge is used to single out term candidates, while their statistical features are used to measure the likelihood of term candidates being \"real\" terms.",
        "The method uses a POS tagged text as input, and outputs a list of extracted terms ranked according to their termhoods.",
        "Termhood is a numeric estimation of the degree to which a given linguistic unit (a multiword compound) is related to a domain-specific concept.",
        "However, the values are not normalised in the sense that a multiword, having a termhood value 10, is 10 times more likely to be a term than a term candidate with a termhood value 1.",
        "In general, the C-value method enhances the commonly used baseline method that extracts most frequent term candidates (assuming that termhoods directly correspond to frequencies of occurrence) by making it sensitive to a particular type of terms – nested terms.",
        "The method is implemented as a two-step procedure.",
        "In the first step, term candidates are extracted using a set of morpho-syntactic filters, which describe general term formation patterns in a given language.",

        "Although these patterns are regular expressions, the filters are implemented as unification-like LR(1) rules (Mima et al., 1995) in order to facilitate processing of grammatical agreements (if any) within term candidates.",
        "For each term candidate extracted by a filter, a set of nested term candidates is generated (see Table 1 for an example in English).",
        "The procedure for the generation of nested term candidates is implemented via transformation rules for each morpho-syntactic filter that is used to extract term candidates.",

        "Table 1: Nested term candidates",

        "In order to adjust the core C-value method for Serbian, we have defined an appropriate set of morpho-syntactic filters and rules for inflectional normalisation of term candidates, and, additionally, a module for foreign word recognition.",
        "As a rule, the vast majority of multiword terms in Serbianmatch the following general formation pattern: which has been used for recognition of NPs in Serbian (Nenadic and Vitas, 1998a).",
        "Of course,not all NPs that follow this pattern are terms.Moreover,when applied to an initially POS tagged text, this pattern may be too general even for description of NPs, as not all word sequences in a text that match this pattern are valid NPs.",
        "For example, in a sequence koji se naziva relacioni model (Engl.",
        "which is called the relational model), a word naziva can be initially tagged either as a noun naziv (Engl.",
        "name) or a verb nazivati (Engl.",
        "call), although, in this sentence, only the latter is correct.",
        "Thus, without further POS disambiguation, the string naziva relacioni model follows the pattern (1), although it is not a valid NP.",
        "This means that classical regular expressions are not sufficient for the representation of such constraints, and that we need more expressive means to model constraints related to the NP structure and agreements of multiword constituents on case, number and gender.",
        "We used the notion of generic patterns as an extension of regular expressions (Nenadic and Vitas, 1998b).",
        "For example, a generic pattern models obligatory agreements that each NP from a specific class has to fulfil: both first and second pairs of adjectives and nouns must have the same values for certain morphological features (i.e. values for gender, number and case denoted by xi,",

        "By defining generic patterns one can model the agreements within various lexical structures in a highly inflective language such as Serbian (Nenadic and Vitas, 1998b).",
        "As a result, these agreements can be used to detect the boundaries of the structures in questions.",
        "A set of generic patterns has been used to model the most frequent term formation patterns in Serbian.",
        "The set is mainly based on patterns used to model NPs in Serbian.",
        "Table 2 presents some of them.",
        "First four patterns describe NPs containing a nested NP whose lexical properties (such as case and/or number) are invariant in all inflected forms of the host NP.",
        "As a rule, the frozen part is in genitive.",
        "Depending on NP constituents, some agreements are obligatory within frozen part (see, for example, the third pattern agreements between an adjective and the corresponding noun), or not (see the fourth pattern no necessary agreement between the last two nouns in gender, number).",
        "The fifth pattern (Table 2) corresponds to NPs that do not have invariant parts.",
        "While these patterns are used to single out term candidates from an initially tagged text, agreements within NPs are used to generate possible nested structures.",
        "While the rules for nested structures are more \"blurred\" in English (since nouns are usually used as modifiers), \"nested-ness\" in Serbian has to preserve the necessary structure and inner agreements, which are specific for the NP class in question.",

        "Several methods for term variation management have been developed.",

        "If the core C-value method were to be applied without conflating morphological variants, then term-hoods would be distributed across different morphological variants providing separate frequencies for individual variants instead of a single frequency calculated for a term candidate unifying all of its variants.",
        "In addition, the \"nesting\" factor of the C-value method would cause skewed results, since the case property of nested terms does not have normal distribution.",
        "Namely, as indicated previously (see Table 2), the majority of nested terms in Serbian are in genitive case, which means that the termhood for a term candidate in genitive case would differ significantly from its counterparts in other cases.",

        "At this point, the usage of generic patterns in order to check the agreements in case, number and gender during the phase of filtering of term candidates might seem unnecessary, since all these features are subsequently normalised.",
        "However, in order to enhance the precision of the SRCE method, it is important for term candidates to be correctly recognised prior to the statistical analysis.",

        "amino acid)).",

        "Moreover, these restrictions can be described by regular expressions.",
        "Any other occurrence of successive vowels can be used to indicate a potential foreign word.",
        "Foreign word detection has been incorporated into the ATR process in two ways: during the selection of term candidates and for the calculation of termhoods.",
        "First, it is used before the initial POS tagging process in order to locate foreign words, which are tagged accordingly.",
        "Otherwise, foreign words would be typically considered as unknown.",

        "Extraction of term candidates is based on the recognition of proper NPs.",
        "In order to enhance both the precision and recall of the ATR method, it is inevitable to incorporate significant linguistic knowledge.",
        "Since describing NPs by means of regular expressions is not sufficient for modelling agreements between NP constituents, we have used generic morpho-syntactic patterns.",
        "Further, since not all NPs are terms that semantically characterise documents, we have used a statistical measure in order to estimate semantic significance of term candidates.",
        "Also, once the term candidates are correctly identified, they are normalised in order to make the most of the statistical part of the method.",
        "Term candidates suggested as terms by the statistical part of the SRCE method are finally mapped into the canonical form of the original term.",
        "The preliminary experiments show that the precision is in line with the results for English, and that for the top ranked terms the precision is well above 90%.",
        "The analysis of errors shows that the majority of them appear due to lexical ambiguity of the input text.",
        "Certainly, if the corpora were lexically disambiguated, we would have better precision.",
        "In order to improve the recall, additional mor-pho-syntactic filters need to be identified.",
        "In particular, we plan to study terms that contain prepositions, as this is a common formation pattern in many domains.",
        "Further, the broader handling of term variants (e.g. dialectic variants, acronyms, derivational variants) may also improve both precision and recall.",
        "Currently we deal only with inflectional variants by mapping them to a canonical form.",
        "Term variants unification and normalisation also provide a broader basis for further IR and IE tasks, as queries can be expanded by referring to a class of synonymous terms as opposed to a single term."
