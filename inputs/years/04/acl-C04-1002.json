        "In Section 3 previous work of dependency analysis of Japanese as well as of English is briefly reviewed.",

        "In English the syntactic function of each word is represented with word order, while in Japanese postpositions represent the syntactic function of each word.",
        "For example, one or more postpositions following a noun play a similar role to declension of nouns in German, which indicates a grammatical case.",
        "Based on such properties, a bunsetsu1 was devised and has been used to analyze syntactically a sentence in Japanese.",
        "A bunsetsu consists of one or more content words followed by zero or more function words.",
        "By defining a bunsetsu like that, we can analyze a sentence in a similar way that is used when analyzing a grammatical role of words in inflecting languages like German.",
        "Thus, strictly speaking, bunsetsu order rather than word order is free except the bunsetsu that contains a main verb of a sentence.",
        "Such bunsetsu must be placed at the end of the sentence.",

        "It clearly shows that the running time is proportional to the sentence length and this observation is consistent with our theoretical analysis in Section 4.2.",
        "One might think that although the upper bound of time complexity is lower than those of previous work, actual processing of our parser is not so fast.",
        "Slowness of our parser is mainly due to a huge computation of kernel evaluations in SVMs.",
        "The SVM",
        "classifiers in our experiments have about forty thousand support vectors.",
        "Therefore, for every decision of dependency also a huge computation of dot products is required.",
        "Fortunately, solutions to this problem have already been given by Kudo and Matsumoto (2003).",
        "They proposed methods to convert a polynomial kernel with higher degrees to a simple linear kernel and reported a new classifier with the converted kernel was about 30 to 300 times faster than the original one while keeping the accuracy.",
        "By applying their methods to our parser, its processing time would be enough practical.",
        "In order to roughly estimate the improved speed of our parser, we built a parser with a linear kernel and ran it on the same test set.",
        "Figure 5 shows the observed time of the parser with a linear kernel using the same machine.",
        "The parser runs fast enough.",
        "It can parse a very long sentence within 0.02 seconds.",
        "Furthermore, accuracy as well as speed of this parser was much better than we expected.",
        "It achieves a dependency accuracy of 87.36% and a sentence accuracy of 40.60%.",
        "These accuracies are slightly better than those in (Uchimoto et al., 1999), where combinations of features are manually selected."
