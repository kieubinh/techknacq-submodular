        "This paper focuses on the automated annotation of temporal information in texts, more specifically relations between events introduced by finite verbs.",
        "While the semantics of temporal markers and the temporal structure of discourse are well-developed subjects in formal linguistics (Steedman, 1997), investigation of quantifiable annotation of unrestricted texts is a somewhat recent topic.",
        "The issue has started to generate some interest in computational linguistics (Harper et al., 2001), as it is potentially an important component in information extraction or question-answer systems.",
        "A few tasks can be distinguished in that respect:",
        "• detecting dates and temporal markers • detecting event descriptions • finding the date of events described • figuring out the temporal relations between events in a text",
        "The first task is not too difficult when looking for dates, e.g. using regular expressions (Wilson et al., 2001), but requires some syntactic analysis in a larger framework (Vazov, 2001; Shilder and Habel, 2001).",
        "The second one raises more difficult, ontological questions; what counts as an event is not uncontroversial (Setzer, 2001): attitude reports, such as beliefs, or reported speech have an unclear status in that respect.",
        "The third task adds another level of complexity: a lot of events described in a text do not have an explicit temporal stamp, and it is not always possible to determine one, even when taking context into account (Filatova and Hovy, 2001).",
        "This leads to an approach more suited to the level of underspecification found in texts: annotating relations between events in a symbolic way (e.g. that an event e1 is before another one e2).",
        "This is the path chosen by (Katz and Arosio, 2001; Setzer, 2001) with human annotators.",
        "This, in turn, raises new problems.",
        "First, what are the relations best suited to that task, among the many propositions (linguistic or logical) one can find for expressing temporal location ?",
        "Then, how can an annotation be evaluated, between annotators, or between a human annotator and an automated system ?",
        "Such annotations cannot be easy to determine automatically anyway, and must use some level of discourse modeling (cf. the work of (Grover et al., 1995)).",
        "We want to show here the feasibility of such an effort, and we propose a way of evaluating the success or failure of the task.",
        "The next section will precise why evaluating this particular task is not a trivial question.",
        "Section 3 will explain the method used to extract temporal relations, using also a form of symbolic inference on available temporal information (section 4).",
        "Then section 5 discusses how we propose to evaluate the success of the task, before presenting our results (section 6)."

        "What we want to annotate is something close to the temporal model built by a human reader of a text; as such, it may involve some form of reasoning, based on various cues (lexical or discursive), and may be expressed in several ways.",
        "As was noticed by (Setzer, 2001), it is difficult to reach a good agreement between human annotators, as they can express relations between events in different, yet equivalent, ways.",
        "For instance, they can say that an event e1 happens during another one e2, and that e2 happens before e3, leaving implicit that e1 too is before e3, while another might list explicitly all relations.",
        "One option could be to ask for a relation between all pairs of events in a given text, but this would be demanding a lot from human subjects, since they would be asked for n × (n − 1)/2 judgments, most of which would be hard to make explicit.",
        "Another option, followed by (Setzer, 2001) (and in a very simplified way, by (Katz and Arosio, 2001)) is to use a few rules of inference (similar to the example seen in the previous paragraph), and to compare the closures (with respect to these rules) of the human annotations.",
        "Such rules are of the form \"if r1 holds between x and y, and r2 holds between y and z, then r3 holds between x and z\".",
        "Then one can measure the agreement between annotations with classical precision and recall on the set of triplets (event x,event y,relation).",
        "This is certainly an improvement, but (Setzer, 2001) points out that humans still forget available information, so that it is necessary to help them spell out completely the information they should have annotated.",
        "Setzer estimates that an hour is needed on average for a text with a number of 15 to 40 events.",
        "Actually, this method has two shortcomings.",
        "First, the choice of temporal relations proposed to annotators, i.e. \"before\", \"after\", \"during\", and \"simultaneously\".",
        "The latter is all the more difficult to judge as it lacks a precise semantics, and is defined as \"roughly at the same time\" ((Setzer, 2001), p.81).",
        "The second problem is related to the inferential model considered, as it is only partial.",
        "Even though the exact mental processing of such information is still beyond reach, and thus any claim to cognitive plausibility is questionable, there are more precise frameworks for reasoning about temporal information.",
        "For instance the well-studied Allen’s relations algebra (see Figure 2).",
        "Here, relations between two time intervals are derived from all the possibilities for the respective position of those intervals endpoints (before, after or same), yielding 13 relations.",
        "What this framework can also express are more general relations between events, such as disjunctive relations (relation between event 1 and event 2 is relation A or relation B), and reasoning on such knowledge.",
        "We think it is important at least to relate annotation relations to a clear temporal model, even if this model is not directly used.",
        "Besides, we believe that measuring agreement on the basis of a more complete \"event calculus\" will be more precise, if we accept to infer disjunctive relation.",
        "Then we want to give a better score to the annotation \"A or B\" when A is true, than to an annotation where nothing is said.",
        "Section 5 gives more details about this problem.",
        "We will now present our method to achieve the task of annotating automatically event relations.",

        "This was done to extract dates, temporal adjuncts, various temporal markers, and to achieve a somewhat coarse clause-splitting (one finite verb in each clause) and to attach temporal adjuncts to the appropriate clause (this is of course a potentially large source of errors).",
        "Relative clauses are extracted and put at the end of their sentence of origin, in a way similar to (Filatova and Hovy, 2001).",
        "Table 1 gives an idea of the kind of temporal infor",
        "mation defined and extracted at this step and for which potentially different temporal interpretations are given (for now, temporal focus is always the previously detected event; this is obviously an over-simplification).",
        "• date computation to precise temporal locations of events associated with explicit, yet imprecise, temporal information, such as dates relative to the time of the text (e.g. last Monday).",
        "• for each event associated to a temporal adjunct, a temporal relation is established (with a date when possible).",
        "• a set of discourse rules is used to establish possible relations between two events appearing consecutively in the text, according to the tenses of the verbs introducing the events.",
        "These rules for French are similar to rules for English proposed in (Grover et al., 1995; Song and Cohen, 1991; Kameyama et al., 1993), but",
        "are expressed with Allen relations instead of a set of ad hoc relations (see Table 1 for a subset of the rules).",
        "These rules are only applied when no temporal marker indicates a specific relation between the two events.",
        "• the last step consists in computing a fixed point on the graph of relations between events recognized in the text, and dates.",
        "We used a classical path-consistency algorithm (Allen, 1984).",
        "More explanation is given section 4.",
        "Allen relations are illustrated Figure 2.",
        "In the following (and Table 1) they will be abbreviated with their first letters, adding an \"i\" for their inverse relations.",
        "So, for instance, \"before\" is \"b\" and \"after\" is \"bi\" (b(x,y)= bi(y,x)).",
        "Table 1 gives the disjunction of possible relations between an event e1 with tense X and a event e2 with tense Y following e 1 in the text.",
        "This is considered as a first very simplified discourse model.",
        "It only tries to list plausible relations between two consecutive events, when there is no marker than could explicit that relation.",
        "For instance a simple past e1 can be related with e, b, m, s, d, f, o to a following simple past event e2 in such a context (roughly saying that e1 is before or during e2 or meets or overlaps it).",
        "This crude model is only intended as a basis, which will be refined once we have a larger set of annotated texts.",
        "This will be enriched later with a notion of temporal focus, following for instance (Kameyama et al., 1993; Song and Cohen, 1991), and a notion of temporal perspective necessary to capture more complex tense interactions.",

        "We have argued in favor of the use of Allen relations for defining annotating temporal relations, not only because they have a clear semantics, but also because a lot of work has been done on inference procedures over constraints expressed with these relations.",
        "We therefore believe that a good way of avoiding the pitfalls of choosing relations for human annotation and of defining inference patterns for these relations is to define them from Allen relations and use relational algebra computation to infer all possible relations between events of a text (that is saturate the constraint graph, see below), both from a human annotation and an annotation given by a system, and then to compare the two.",
        "In this perspective, any event is considered to correspond to a convex time interval.",

        "But we still want to have annotation relations with a clear semantics, that we could link to Allen’s algebra to infer and compare information about temporal situations.",

        "We thought they were rather intuitive, seem to have an appropriate level of granularity, and since three of them are enough to describe situations (the other 3 being the converse relations), they are not to hard to use by naive annotators.",

        "We do not want to limit the comparison to \"simple\" (base) relations, as in (Setzer, 2001), because it makes the evaluation very dependent on the choice of relations, and we also want to have a gradual measure of the imprecision of the system annotation.",

        "Results are typically very low, as shown on a newswire message taken as example Table 3.",
        "We have then made two series of measures: one on annotation relations (thus disjunctions of Allen relations are re-expressed as disjunctions of annotation relations that contains them), and one on equivalent Allen relations (which arguably reflects more the underlying computation, while deteriorating the measure of the actual task).",
        "In the first case, an Allen relation answer equals to b or d or s between two events is considered as “before or is_included” (using relations used by humans) and is compared to an annotation of the same form.",
        "We then used finesse and coherence to estimate our annotation made according to the method described in the previous sections.",
        "We tried it on a still limited2 set of 8 newswire texts (from AFP), for a total of 2300 words and 160 events, comparing to the English corpus of (Setzer, 2001), which has 6 texts for less than 2000 words and also about 160 events.",

        "It means we have made decisions that were not cautious enough, for reasons we still have to analyze.",
        "One potential reason is that relations offered to humans are maybe too vague in the wrong places: a lot of information in a text can be asserted to be \"strictly before\" something else (based on dates for instance), while human annotators can only say that events are \"before or meets\" some other event; each time this is the case, coherence is only 0.5.",
        "It is important to note that there are few points of comparison on this problem.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, only (Li et al., 2001) and (Mani and Wilson, 2000) mention having tried this kind of annotation, as a side job for their temporal expressions mark-up systems.",
        "The former considers only relations between events within a sentence, and the latter did not evaluate their method.",
        "Finally, it is worth remembering that human annotation itself is a difficult task, with potentially a lot of disagreement between annotators.",
