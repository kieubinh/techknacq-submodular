        "A dialogue manager provides the decision making at the heart of a spoken dialogue system.",
        "In an object-oriented approach to dialogue management, generic behaviour, such as confirming new or modified information that has been supplied by the user, is inherited by more specialised classes.",
        "These specialised classes either encapsulate behaviour typical of a particular business domain (service agents) or make available dialogue abilities that may be required in many business domains (support agents).",
        "In this paper we consider the interplay between the agents’ generic and specialised behaviour and consider the manner in which service and support agents collaborate within and across their respective groups.",
        "1 Object-orientation and cross-domain, mixed initiative dialogue Object-orientation provides an intuitive separation of, on the one hand, inheritable generic functionality and, on the other hand, domain-specific, specialized functionality that is supported by the generic elements of the system.",
        "Applied to the area of natural language dialogue, this has enabled us to create a generic, automated dialogue confirmation strategy – based on confirmation statuses and discourse pegs (see Section 3.3) – which supports domain-specific strategies to gather and provide information relating to particular transactions – for example booking a hotel or finding out about cinema times.",
        "Heuristics, or expert rules, specific to each transaction domain, prompt the user for significant missing information or assist the user by providing choices from a database (e.g. names of available hotels).",
        "Thus, while our generic confirmation strategy ensures that information newly supplied by the user is confirmed, and information changed is reconfirmed, and so on, the nature of that information may differ significantly from domain to domain.",
        "Likewise the system may respond to confirmed information in quite different ways depending on the domain – as it either completes a domain-specific transaction or attempts to elicit important missing information from the user.",
        "In the Queen’s Communicator dialogue system, expertise for different transaction domains is encapsulated within corresponding expert classes or ‘agents’.",
        "We have used this to our advantage by enabling the system to transfer between domains either at the user’s or the system’s initiative – in a mixed initiative dialogue either the user or the system may introduce new topics.",
        "Agents are able to announce their abilities to the system at large, or indeed to the user.",
        "Thus, when key words or phrases uttered by the user indicate that the topic of conversation has turned, for example, from accommodation booking to payment, the system’s DomainSpotter (see Section 4) can ask the agents if any of them deal with payments.",
        "The most suitable agent is then given the task of managing the specialised subdialogue."

        "A spoken dialogue system typically comprises a number of components: an automatic speech recogniser, a semantic parser, a dialogue manager (DM), a database ‘back-end’, a natural language generator, and a text-to-speech engine.",
        "The focus of our present research is the development of an object-based DM that can support mixed initiative dialogues that involve a number of business domains.",
        "Our DM operates within the DARPA1 Communicator architecture, which is based on the Galaxy hub – a software router developed by the Spoken Language Systems group at MIT (www.sls.csail.mit.edu/sls/technologies/galaxy.shtml) and subsequently released as an open source package in collaboration with the MITRE Corporation (fofoca.mitre.org).",
        "In the ‘Queen’s Communicator’ dialogue system, our newly developed DM interacts with a number of off-the-shelf components.",
        "For semantic parsing we use Phoenix (W. Ward, 1994), available from the",
        "For recognition we use the Microsoft English ASR Version 5 Engine as supplied with Windows XP.",
        "Synthesised speech is provided by Festival (www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/), also taken from the CU download.",
        "Figure 1 shows a typical Communicator configuration.",
        "The DM itself embodies decision-making similar to that of a human interlocutor as it queries, responds to and informs the user.",
        "Moreover, in mixed initiative dialogues that deal with more than one domain (e.g. enquiries about accommodation and events, and supporting exchanges about payment and addresses), the system has the additional task of identifying the (ongoing) topic of the dialogue and applying appropriate dialogue management expertise."

        "In order to enable mixed initiative interactions across domains, we model the system’s behaviour as a collaboration between the cohort of implemented agents.",
        "Other developers have also adopted an agent-based approach to dialogue, though sometimes dialogue agents each perform very simple tasks rather than engage in extensive discourse: in (Turunen and Hakulinen, 2001) for example, simple generic error-handling agents, based on Java and XML, ask the user to repeat misunderstood input.",
        "In our case an agent is a specialist in a particular transactional area – e.g. booking accommodation or eliciting an address.",
        "An agent uses its own domain-specific ‘expert-rules’ to elicit information (e.g. information for making a hotel booking) that is then stored in a specialised dialogue frame.",
        "Each agent thus encapsulates a skillset for a substantial dialogue or subdialogue.",
        "Like the Communicator team at Carnegie Mellon University, we view the dialogue product (the knowledge to be elicited) as a treelike structure (Rudnicky and Xu, 1999) – though for us the nodes are complete dialogue frames rather than individual data items.",
        "In the Queen’s Communicator the discourse structure evolves dynamically as agents are selected by a DomainSpotter, in the light of the user’s utterances or as a consequence of the agents’ own rules.",
        "It is this process, rather than an overarching dialogue plan or agenda, that drives the discourse forward, sometimes across domain boundaries.",
        "We do, however, maintain an ExpertFocusStack, which contains, in sequence, the name of the agent that is currently handling the dialogue and the names of agents that have last handled the dialogue and have unfinished business: this allows the system to quickly identify the current handler and to pass control back, once the current handling agent is finished."

        "As the dialogue evolves, the DomainSpotter tests which agents are best placed to handle the user’s last utterance: the tree of dialogue frames indicates to the DomainSpotter which support agents have been or may be involved in the current service enquiry, and should therefore be considered; the DomainSpotter will poll service agents as a matter of course.",
        "If the user’s utterance is scored most highly by a support agent (relevant to the current service) whose topic has already been in the discourse focus, the user can return to this topic (the shift may indicate the user’s intention to add to or modify information that was previously supplied).",
