        "In spite of novel algorithmic developments and the increased availability of large text corpora, statistical language modeling remains a difficult problem, particularly for languages with rich morphology.",
        "Such languages typically exhibit a large number of word types in relation to word tokens in a given text, which leads to high perplexity and a large number of unseen word contexts.",
        "As a result, probability estimates are often unreliable, even when using standard smoothing and parameter reduction techniques.",
        "Recently, a new language modeling approach, called factored language models (FLMs), has been developed.",
        "FLMs are a generalization of standard language models in that they allow a larger set of conditioning variables for predicting the current word.",
        "In addition to the preceding words, any number of additional variables can be included (e.g. morphological, syntactic, or semantic word features).",
        "Since such features are typically shared across multiple words, they can be used to obtained better smoothed probability estimates when training data is sparse.",
        "However, the space of possible models is extremely large, due to many different ways of choosing subsets of conditioning word features, backoff procedures, and discounting methods.",
        "Usually, this space cannot be searched exhaustively, and optimizing models by a knowledge-inspired manual search procedure often leads to suboptimal results since only a small portion of the search space can be explored.",
        "In this paper we investigate the possibility of determining the structure of factored language models (i.e. the set of conditioning variables, the backoff procedure and the discounting parameters) by a data-driven search procedure, viz. Genetic Algorithms (GAs).",
        "We apply this technique to two different tasks (language modeling for Arabic and Turkish) and show that GAs lead to better models than either knowledge-inspired manual search or random search.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the details of the factored language modeling approach.",
        "The application of GAs to the problem of determining language model structure is explained in Section 3.",
        "The corpora used in the present study are described in Section 4 and experiments and results are presented in Section 5.",

        "A standard statistical language model computes the probability of a word sequence W = w1, w2,..., wT as a product of conditional probabilities of each word wi given its history, which is typically approximated by just one or two preceding words (leading to bigrams, and trigrams, respectively).",

        "Probabilistic language models can then be constructed over (sub)sets of word features instead of, or in addition to, the word variables themselves.",
        "For instance, words can be decomposed into stems/lexemes and POS tags indicating their morphological features, as shown below: Word: Stock prices are rising Stem: Stock price be rise Tag: Nsg N3pl V3pl Vpart Such a representation serves to express lexical and syntactic generalizations, which would otherwise remain obscured.",
        "It is comparable to class-based representations employed in standard class-based language models; however, in FLMs several simultaneous class assignments are allowed instead of a single one.",
        "In general, we assume that a word is equivalent to a fixed number (K) of factors, i.e. W - f1:K. The task then is to produce a statistical model over the resulting representation - using a trigram approximation, the resulting probability model is as follows:",
        "Thus, each word is dependent not only on a single stream of temporally ordered word variables, but also on additional parallel (i.e. simultaneously occurring) features.",
        "This factored representation can be used in two different ways to improve over standard LMs: by using a product model or a backoff model.",
        "In a product model, Equation 2 can be simplified by finding conditional independence assumptions among subsets of conditioning factors and computing the desired probability as a product of individual models over those subsets.",
        "In this paper we only consider the second option, viz. using the factors in a backoff procedure when the word n-gram is not observed in the training data.",
        "For instance, a word trigram that is found in an unseen test set may not have any counts in the training set, but its corresponding factors (e.g. stems and morphological tags) may have been observed since they also occur in other words."

In that case, the maximum-likelihood estimate of the n-gram probability is replaced with a probability derived from the probability of the lower-order (n – 1)-gram and a backoff weight.",
        "N-grams whose counts are above the threshold retain their maximum-likelihood estimates, discounted by a factor that redistributes probability mass to the lower-order distribution:",

        "In this case, several backoff paths are possible, which can be summarized in a backoff graph (Figure 1(b)).",
