        "When we read a document, we usually read its title first, and then we read the body text only if the title catches our interest.",
        "Therefore, when we write a report or an explanation on a newly-developed technology intended for readers including laypersons, it is very important to compose a title that will stimulate their interest in the technology.",
        "However, technical specialists are not necessarily good at composing appealing titles, because it isn’t clear what sort of titles will stimulate the interest of lay readers in the technology.",
        "In the field of NLP and linguistics, there are few researches which help the specialists compose appealing titles for lay readers.",
        "Several researches have been reported on title generation (Jin and Hauptmann, 2000) (Berger and Mittal, 2000) and readability of texts (Minel et al., 1997) (Hartley and Sydes, 1997) (Inui et al., 2003).",
        "However, the researches on title generation focus on generating a very compact summary of the document rather than composing an appealing title.",
        "The previous researches on readability mainly see it as comprehensibility rather than interestingness.",
        "In this regard, our previous study (Senda and Sinohara, 2002) clarified what sort of content and wording in titles are effective in stimulating lay readers’ interest in the technology by an analysis of a parallel corpus of Japanese technical paper titles and Japanese newspapers headlines.",
        "The study categorized the effective content and wording of the titles into the following three key points.",
        "Key Point 1 (for Wording) Instead of technical terms, use synonymous plain terms even where the plain term is not synonymous with the technical term in a precise sense.",
        "Key Point 2 (for Content) Describe what the technology is for, rather than what the technology does.",
        "Key Point 3 (for Content) Describe the advantages of the technology, rather than the method of realizing the technology.",
        "Our next goal is to enable inexperienced authors to compose a title according to these key points.",
        "To this end, we developed a support system for revising titles.",
        "We call it “title revision wizard”.",
        "The wizard provides a guidance on revising draft title to compose a title meeting the key points, and a few support tools for coming up with and elaborating on appealing phrases.",
