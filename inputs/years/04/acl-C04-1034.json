        "Although most pronominal anaphora resolution algorithms only account for anaphors referring to individual entities, anaphors referring to abstract entities evoked by verbal phrases, clauses or discourse segments (henceforth APAs) are quite common in English see i.a.",
        "(Byron and Allen, 1998) and even more in Danish (Navarretta, 2004).",
        "Recently, two algorithms for resolving APAs and individual pronominal anaphors (henceforth IPAs) in specific English dialogues have been proposed Eckert and Strube’s (2000) es00 and Byron’s (2002) phora.",
        "Furthermore Strube and M¨uller (Strube and M¨uller, 2003) have presented a machine learning approach for resolving APAs in spoken dialogues.'",
        "Both es00 and PHORA 'We do not discuss this approach further in this paper.",
        "recognise IPAs and APAs on the basis of semantic constraints on the argument position occupied by the anaphors and account for differences in reference between personal and demonstrative pronouns.",
        "In es00 demonstrative pronouns preferentially refer to abstract entities, while personal pronouns preferentially refer to individual ones.",
        "es00 resolves IPAs applying Strube’s (1998) algorithm.",
        "In PHORA the antecedents of personal pronouns are searched for looking at their degree of salience which is implemented by word order as in (Grosz et al., 1995).",
        "Demonstratives, instead, are searched for in the list of activated entities (Gundel et al., 1993) containing non NP antecedents, which are assumed to be less salient.",
        "In PHORA demonstratives can also refer to Kinds.",
        "es00 requires that the structure of dialogues has been marked.",
        "Byron’s phora-algorithm does not rely on predefined dialogue structure, but only searches for abstract antecedents of APAs in the sentence preceding the anaphor.",
        "Thus it does not account for APAs referring to larger discourse segments.",
        "PHORA relies on both semantic knowledge and a model of speech acts and accounts for more phenomena than es00.",
        "Differing from es00, PHORA has been implemented.",
        "To resolve IPAs and APAs in Danish texts and dialogues Navarretta (2004) has proposed the so-called dar-algorithm (Navarretta, 2004).",
        "In DAR APAs are resolved following the es00 strategy, but DAR accounts for the Danish abstract anaphors which occur in much more contexts than the English ones.",
        "Individual anaphors are resolved in DAR following a novel strategy which combines models which identify high degree of salience with high degree of givenness (topicality) of entities in the hearer’s cognitive model, e.g. (Grosz et al., 1995), with Hajiˇcov´a et al.’s (1990) salience account which assigns the highest degree of salience to entities in the focal part of an utterance in Information Structure terms.",
        "These entities often introduce new information in discourse.",
        "In the present paper we describe an extended version of the dar-algorithm accounting for differences in the reference of various types of Danish demonstratives which we found analysing the uses of pronouns in three text collections (computer manuals, novels and newspaper articles) and three corpora of recorded naturally-occurring dialogues (the SL (Duncker and Hermann, 1996), the BYSOC (Gregersen and Pedersen, 1991) and the PID corpora (Jensen, 1989)).",
        "In the following we first discuss the background for our proposal (section 2) then we describe the extended dar-algorithm (section 3).",
        "In section 4 we evaluate it and compare its performance with that of other known algorithms.",
        "Finally we make some concluding remarks."

      "text": [
        "In most applied approaches resolving pronominal anaphors mainly consists in the following steps: 1: determining the anaphoric antecedent domain; 2: choosing the most prominent or salient antecedent among possible candidates.",
        "Thus determining the degree of salience of discourse elements, henceforth DEs, is essential to anaphor resolution.",
        "Although there is not always an identity relation between linguistic antecedents and referents, we also follow this strategy, well aware that it is particularly problematic for resolving APAs (se especially (Webber, 1991)).",
        "Nearly all salience-based algorithms identify high degree of salience with high degree of givenness of DEs.",
        "In fact, although different criteria are used for ranking DEs, such as linear order, hierarchy of grammatical roles, information structure, Prince’s Familiarity Scale (Prince, 1981), all algorithms assign the highest prominence to the DEs which are most topical, known, bound, familiar and thus given, e.g. (Grosz et al., 1995; Brennan et al., 1987; Strube, 1998).",
        "Analysing the Danish data we found a restricted number of cases where high degree of salience did not correspond to high degree of topical ity, as it is the case in example (1).",
        "(1)",
        "A: hvem ... hvem arbejdede [din mor]i med?",
        "(with whom... whom did [your mother]i work) B: [Hun]i arbejdede med [vores nabo]k",
        "([She]i worked with [our neighbour]k) [Hun]k var enke ... havde tre sønner [bysoc] ([She]k was a widow... had three sons) In (1) the antecedent of the second occurrence of the pronoun hun (she) is the object vores nabo (our neighbour) which provides the information requested in the preceding question.",
        "This nominal is assigned lower prominence than the subject pronoun hun (she) in most salience models.",
        "The only salience model which departs from the givenness2 assumption has been proposed by Hajiˇcov´a et al.",
        "(1990).",
        "Hajiˇcov´a et al., in fact, assign the highest degree of salience to DEs in the focal part of an utterance in information structure terms (Sgall et al., 1986).",
        "These entities often represent new information.",
        "Hajiˇcov´a et al.’s approach is original and can account for the data in (1), but it is problematic from an applied point of view.",
        "In the first place it is difficult to determine the information structure of all utterances.",
        "Secondly, focal candidate antecedents are ranked highest in Hajiˇcov´a et al.’s model, but they still compete with given candidate antecedents in their system.",
        "Finally the data does not confirm that all entities in the focal part of an utterance have the highest degree of accessibility.",
        "We agree with Hajiˇcov´a’s insight, but in order to operationalise the influence of focality in a reliable way propose the following.",
        "Accessibility by default is connected with givenness as assumed in most algorithms.",
        "However, when speakers explicitly change the degree of accessibility of entities in discourse by marking them as salient with information structure related devices, these entities get the highest degree of salience and are proposed as the preferred antecedents of anaphors.",
        "In cases of explicit focus marking the shift of focus of attention is as coherent as continuing speaking about the same entities, because it is preannounced to the addressee.",
        "On the basis of the data we propose a list of identifiable constructions in which explicit focus marking occurs.3 Examples from the list are the following: a: Entities referred to by NPs which in Danish are focally marked structurally (clefts, existential and topicalised constructions).",
        "b: Entities referred to by NPs that follow focusing adverbs.",
        "c: Entities focally marked by the prosody (if this information is available) and/or entities providing information requested in questions, as in (1).",
        "Givenness preference in Danish can be modelled by the hierarchy of verbal complements.",
        "In addition to salience preferences we found that parallelism can account for numerous uses of Danish anaphors.4 Inspired by the work of (Kameyama, 1996) we have defined a preference interaction model to be used in resolution.",
        "Our model is given in figure 1.5 The interaction model states that givenness preferences are overridden by focality preference, when in conflict, and that they all are overridden by parallelism.",
        "DAR also accounts for reference differences between Danish demonstrative and personal pronouns.",
        "Weak (cliticised and unstressed) pronouns usually refer to the most salient entity in the utterance.",
        "Strong (stressed and demonstrative) pronouns emphasise or put in contrast the entities they refer to and/or indicate that their antecedents are not the most expected ones.6 Demonstratives preferentially refer to abstract entities, while personal pronouns preferentially refer to individual entities in ambiguous contexts.",
        "All these differences are also accounted for in the literature on anaphora.",
        "However we also found more language-specific peculiarities in our data.",
        "Two examples of these pecular-ities are the following.",
        "The Danish demonstratives denne/dette/disse (this common gender/this neuter gender/these) never corefer with a subject antecedent intrasententially.",
        "In the few cases where they have a subject antecedent in a preceding clause, there are no other antecedent competitors.",
        "The abstract anaphor dette, furthermore, is often used to refer to the last mentioned situation in the previous sentence, often expressed in a subordinated clause, and not to the whole sentence or to an abstract anaphor in the preceding sentence.",
        "The partic-4According to parallelism in adjacent utterances with parallel grammatical complements, the preferred antecedent of an anaphor in the second utterance is the linguistic expression in the first utterance with the same grammatical function.",
        "der pronoun det can both be a personal pronoun (corresponding to it) and a demonstrative pronoun (corresponding to this/that).",
        "In the latter case it is always stressed.",
        "ular phenomena are also accounted for in dar.",
        "Approx.",
        "half of the APA occurrences in our dialogues refer to entities evoked by larger discourse segments (more turn takings).",
        "Thus we follow Eckert and Strube’s approach of marking the structure of dialogues and searching for APA antecedents in the right frontier of the discourse tree (Webber, 1991).",
        "DAR presupposes different discourse structures for texts and dialogues.",
        "DAR follows the es00 and PHORA strategy of discriminating between IPAs and APAs by rules looking at the semantic constraints on the predication contexts in which the anaphors occur.",
        "DAR relies on more discriminating rules than es00, which were defined on the basis of large amounts of data and of the encodings of a large computational lexicon.",
        "DAR uses language-specific rules to account for Danish APAs.",
        "These occur in much more contexts than in English where elliptical constructions or other anaphors such as too and so are used.",
