        "The phenomenon of sluicing – bare wh-phrases that exhibit a sentential meaning – constitutes an empirically important construction which has been understudied from both theoretical and computational perspectives.",
        "Most theoretical analyses (e.g. (Ross, 1969; Chung et al., 1995)), focus on embedded sluices considered out of any dialogue context.",
        "They rarely look at direct sluices – sluices used in queries to request further elucidation of quantified parameters (e.g. (1a)).",
        "With a few isolated exceptions, these analyses also ignore a class of uses we refer to (following (Ginzburg and Sag, 2001) (G&S)) as reprise sluices.",
        "These are used to request clarification of reference of a constituent in a partially understood utterance, as in (1b).",
        "Our corpus investigation shows that the combined set of direct and reprise sluices constitutes 'This notation indicates the British National Corpus file (KP4) and the sluice sentence number (512).",
        "more than 75% of all sluices in the British National Corpus (BNC).",
        "In fact, they make up approx.",
        "33% of all wh-queries in the BNC.",
        "In previous work (Fern´andez et al., to appear), we implemented G&S’s analysis of direct sluices as part of an interpretation module in a dialogue system.",
        "In this paper we apply machine learning techniques to extract rules for sluice classification in dialogue.",
        "In Section 2 we present our corpus study of classifying sluices into dialogue types and discuss the methodology we used in this study.",
        "Section 3 analyses the distribution patterns we identify and considers possible explanations for these patterns.",
        "In Section 4 we identify a number of heuristic principles for classifying each sluice dialogue type and formulate these principles as probability weighted Horn clauses.",
        "In Section 5, we then use the predicates of these clauses as features to annotate our corpus samples of sluices, and run two machine learning algorithms on these data sets.",
        "The first machine learner used, SLIPPER, extracts optimised rules for identifying sluice dialogue types that closely resemble our Horn clause principles.",
        "The second, TiMBL, uses a memory-based machine learning procedure to classify a sluice by generalising over similar environments in which the sluice occurs in a training set.",
        "Both algorithms performed well, yielding similar success rates of approximately 90%.",
        "This suggests that the features in terms of which we formulated our heuristic principles for classifying sluices were well motivated, and both learning algorithms that we used are well suited to the task of dialogue act classification for fragments on the basis of these features.",

        "Here we restrict ourselves to sketching an explanation of a couple of striking patterns exhibited in Table 3.",
        "One such pattern is the low frequency of when sluices, particularly by comparison with what one might expect to be its close cousin – where; indeed the direct/reprise splits are almost mirror images for when v. where.",

        "This latter hypothesis offers a route towards explaining the when v. where contrast.",
        "There are two factors at least which make grounding a temporal parameter significantly easier on the whole than grounding a locative parameter.",
        "The first factor is that conversationalists typically share a temporal ontology based on a clock and/or calendar.",
        "Although well structured locative ontologies do exist (e.g. grid points in a map), they are far less likely to be common currency.",
        "The natural ordering of clock/calendarbased ontologies reflected in grammatical devices such as sequence of tense is a second factor that favours temporal parameters over locatives.",

        "In this paper we have presented a machine learning approach to bare sluice classification in dialogue using corpus-based empirical data.",
        "From these data, we have extracted a set of heuristic principles for sluice disambiguation and formulated such principles as probability weighted Horn clauses.",
        "We have then used the predicates of these clauses as features to annotate an input dataset, and ran two different machine learning algorithms: SLIPPER, a rule-based learning algorithm, and TiMBL, a memory-based learning system.",
        "SLIPPER has the advantage of generating transparent rules that closely resemble our Horn clause constraints.",
        "Both algorithms, however, perform well, yielding to similar success rates of approximately 90%.",
        "This shows that the features we used to formulate our heuristic principles were well motivated, except perhaps for the feature frag, which does not seem to have a significant predictive power.",
        "The two algorithms we used seem to be well suited to the task of sluice classification in dialogue on the basis of these features.",
        "In the future we will attempt to construct an automatic procedure for annotating a dialogue corpus with the features presented here, to which both machine learning algorithms apply."
