        "In ambiguity resolution of natural language, both explicit linguistic information and probability calculation have been used as basic approaches.",
        "In early experiments usually only one strategy was applied, so that ambiguity resolution was performed either with the help of linguistic rules, or through probability calculation.",
        "Advanced approaches make use of both strategies, and they differ mainly in what kind of role each of these two methods has in the system (Wilks and Stevenson 1998, Stevenson and Wilks 2001).",
        "Sources of structured data, such as the WordNet (Miller 1990; Resnik 1998b; Banerjee and Pedersen 2002), have also been made use of.",
        "It is commonly known that the more comprehensive the description of language is, the more ambiguous is the interpretation of individual words1.",
        "Ambiguity occurs between word classes, between variously inflected word-forms, and above all, between various meanings of a word.",
        "A fairly large number2 of words in different word categories have more than one clearly distinguished meaning.",
        "Semantic disambiguation tends to be the hardest part of the disambiguation process, largely because of the fact that in semantics there are few distinguishable categories that could be used for generalising disambiguation rules.",
        "Below I shall describe a method where the use of linguistic rules and probability has been optimised with minimal loss of linguistic precision.",
        "Morphological description is carried out in the framework of two-level formalism3.",
        "After having been under development for 19 years (Hurskainen 1992, 1996), the parser of Swahili has now reached a phase where the recall as well as the precision4 is close to 100% in unrestricted standard Swahili text.",
        "1 By word is here meant any string of characters, excluding punctuation marks and diacritics.",
        "Also, multi-word concepts, if they are handled as single entities, are considered words.",
        "2 I do not consider it meaningful to present statistical details of ambiguity, because, when semantic glosses are included, the borderline between real ambiguity and such ambiguity as is found between synonyms and near-synonyms is vague.",
        "3 The development environment for designing the morphological parser was provided by Lingsoft and Kimmo Koskenniemi (1983).",
        "4 The criterion of precision in morphological analysis is considered fulfilled if one of the readings of a word is correct in the context concerned, and all other readings are grammatically correct analyses in some other context.",
        "Disambiguation rules, as well as the rules for syntactic mapping (not discussed here) and for identifying idioms, were written within the framework of constraint grammar by using the CG-2 parser5.",
        "In other words, morphological disambiguation and semantic disambiguation were implemented within a single rule system.",
        "This was possible because the CG-2 parser treats all strings in the analysis result, including glosses in English, as tags that can be made use of in rule writing (Tapanainen 1996: 6).6 The properties of the CG-2 parser include the following: (a) With a rule one may either select or remove a reading from a cohort7.",
        "(b) The application of a rule can be constrained in several ways by making use of the occurrence or absence of features.",
        "Reference to the position of the constraining feature can be precisely made forwards and backwards within the sentence.",
        "(c) The identification of constraining features can be made relational by more than one phase of scanning, whereby after finding one feature, scanning may be continued again in either direction.",
        "By default, scanning terminates at a sentence boundary, but its termination can also be defined elsewhere.",
        "(d) Rule conditions can be expressed either directly with concrete tags or indirectly by using set names.",
        "The latter facility simplifies rule writing, especially of general rules.",
        "(e) The possibility of concatenating tag sets as well as concrete tags decreases considerably the need of defining tag sets.",
        "(f) The application of rule order can be defined by placing the rules into sections, so that the more general and reliable rules come first and other rules later in the order of decreasing reliability.",
        "This also makes it possible to write heuristic rules within the same rule system.",
        "(g) Mapping rules, which are the standard rules for syntactic mapping, also include a possibility of adding a new reading as well as of replacing the reading of a line.",
        "The latter facility is demonstrated below when discussing idioms.",
        "2 Maximal morphological and semantic description as precondition The basic strategy in processing is that the morphological description is as full and detailed as possible.",
        "Each string in text is interpreted and all possible interpretations of each string are made explicit.",
        "The maximal recall and precision are achieved by updating the dictionary from time to time with the help of the changing target language8.",
        "As a result of analysis there is a text where every string has at least one interpretation and no legitimate interpretation is excluded.",
        "Example (1) illustrates the point.",
        "8 By target language I mean the kind of text, for which the application is intended.",
        "It is hardly possible to maintain a dictionary that is optimal for handling all types of domain-specific texts.",
        "Although the large size of the dictionary would not be a problem, it would be difficult to handle e.g. such words that in one type of text are individual lexemes but in another domain are part of multi-word concepts that should be treated as one unit.",
        "In addition to new words, misspellings also cause problems.",
        "Some commonly occurring misspellings and non-standard spellings can be encoded into the dictionary and thus give the word a precise interpretation.",
        "Without disambiguation, the following interpretations are possible: (a) A fat person, who lives in lakes, has eaten tomatoes.",
        "(b) A fat person, who lives in lakes, has eaten grandmothers.",
        "(c) A fat person, who lives in breasts, has eaten tomatoes.",
        "(d) A fat person, who lives in breasts, has eaten grandmothers.",
        "(e) A fat person, who lives in milk, has eaten tomatoes.",
        "(f) A fat person, who lives in milk, has eaten grandmothers.",
        "(g) A hippo, which lives in lakes, has eaten tomatoes.",
        "(h) A hippo, which lives in lakes, has eaten grandmothers.",
        "(i) A hippo, which lives in breasts, has eaten tomatoes.",
        "(j) A hippo, which lives in breasts, has eaten grandmothers.",
        "(k) A hippo, which lives in milk, has eaten tomatoes.",
        "(l) A hippo, which lives in milk, has eaten grandmothers.",
        "The situation would be even worse if \"aishiye\" with relative marker (GEN-REL 1/2-SG) were missing.",
        "It requires that the preceding referent be animate and thus excludes inanimate alternatives.",
        "The subject prefix in the main verb \"amekula\" also refers to an animate subject.",
        "But because it can also stand without an overt subject, this clue is not reliable.",
        "When we look for the possible subject in the sentence, we seem to have three candidates.",
        "\"Kiboko\" certainly is one of them, because it is a noun and some of its readings agree9 with the",
        "9 In this case agreement means something other than morphological agreement.",
        "The noun belongs to",
        "subject prefix of the main verb.",
        "In regard to its position, \"ziwani\" would also suit, but it is ruled out because it has a locative suffix.",
        "Finally, no overt subject would be necessary, whereby the phrase preceding the main verb would be an object dislocated to the left and the sentence would mean, \"The grandmother has eaten the hippo/fat person who lives in the lakes/breasts/milk\"."

        "The grades of animacy (e.g. human, animal, vegetation) are an example of useful semantic groupings, which can be used in generalising disambiguation.",
        "Another useful feature, actually belonging to syntax, is the division of verbs into categories according to their argument structure (e.g. SV, SVO, SVOO) Neural networks have been used successfully for identifying clusters of co-occurrence of words and their accompanying tags (Veronis and Ide 1990; Sussna 1993; Resnik 1998a).",
