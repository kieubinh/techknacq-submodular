        "The claim made in this paper is that in a formal description of language, it is possible and useful to work with dependency-based underlying representations of sentences (tectogrammatical representations) meeting the condition of projectivity.",
        "The reasons for the inclusion of this condition into the definition of the tectogrammatical representations are both formally and empirically sound (Section 1).",
        "An analysis of the material offered by the Prague Dependency Treebank with annotations of the underlying syntactic structure of sentences (described in Section 2) has led to an interesting classification of non-projective constructions in Czech (Section 3).",
        "It documents that most (types of) constructions that appear to be non-projective in the surface shape of sentences can be described by means of projective trees.",
        "The realization of the surface word order (with the use of movement rules) is then relegated to the morphemic level, where the representation of the sentence has the shape of a string rather than a tree.",
        "1 Condition of projectivity and tectogrammatical representations of sentences It may be assumed that in most different languages the prototypical means expressing grammatical values are morphemes (endings, affixes, function words).",
        "On the other hand, word order (with intonation) expresses first of all the Topic-Focus Articulation (TFA); this holds also in English, as will be illustrated.",
        "The grammatical values themselves are (i) values of morphological categories (number, definiteness, tense, aspect, modality, etc.",
        "), and (ii) syntactic relations.",
        "The latter may be specified on the basis of valency, as is the case e.g. with FrameNet (Fillmore et al., 2003).",
        "As was shown already by Robinson (1970), a valency based approach makes it possible to use dependency syntax (with the relations between a head and its modifiers) as the backbone for a specification of sentence representations.",
        "The valency frame of a lexical unit specifies its obligatory and optional dependents, i.e. arguments (such as Actor, Ob",
        "and temporal ones, and so on).",
        "In the descriptive framework of Functional Generative Description (FGD), elaborated in Prague (see Sgall et al.",
        "(1986)), the above mentioned set of dependency relations is used to describe the underlying structure, which can serve as an appropriate input to semantic (-pragmatic) interpretation.",
        "The dependency trees, which constitute the prototypical underlying (tectogrammatical) representations of sentences in FGD, meet the condition of projectivity.",
        "The condition of projectivity of a rooted tree has been defined in several ways, some of which have been shown by Marcus (1965) to be equivalent, cf. also the concept of adjacency in Hudson (1984).",
        "1.1 Formal definition of projectivity as a property of dependency tree structures We present a definition of projectivity and an algorithm for projectivizing/testing the projectivity of a (sub)tree.",
        "(In devising this approach, we were motivated by the practical purposes of the annotation of TFA within the Prague Dependency Treebank, PDT.)",
        "Definition A subtree S of a rooted dependency tree T is projective iff for all nodes a, b and c of the subtree S the condition (P) holds: (bra&b<a&cJ,J,b >c<a) V(b�a&b>a&cJ,J,b >c>a).",
        "(P) (Here b � a means that b is immediately dependent on a, c J,J, d means that c is subordinated to d the relation of subordination JJ is the irreflexive transitive closure of the relation of im",

        "The symbols <, > denote the relation of linear ordering on the nodes corresponding to the underlying word order.)",
        "A subtree is called ✆o✆✟projective iff it does not satisfy condition M. To make the notion of projectivity more tangible, in Figure 1 we present the configurations (subtrees of a dependency tree) forbidden by the Definition (lines represent immediate dependency and nodes are ordered from left to right according to the linear ordering on nodes).",
        "It is easy to prove that in condition (P) it is enough to work with immediate dependency only, so for a subtree to be projective it suffices to check configurations where three nodes form a chain in the relation of immediate dependency.",
        "The edge between the two lower nodes in such a non-projective configuration will be called ✆o✆✟ projective.",
        "For a (sub)tree to be projective, neither of the configurations in Figure 1 may appear in it.",
        "Our definition of projectivity is equivalent to other definitions when applied to the whole dependency tree then the forbidden configurations cannot appear anywhere in the tree (cf. Sgall et al.",
        "(1986), p. 152, and works cited above) .",
        "The definition of projectivity presented above lends itself readily to algorithmization.",
        "It can be used not only for checking whether a particular subtree is projective, it can also be easily adapted to a procedure for projectivizing the subtree (i.e. transforming the potentially non-projective subtree into a projective one by rearranging its nodes in the linear ordering).",
        "We give a simplified imperative pseudo-code of a recursive version of the algorithm for projectivizing a subtree: ☞✌✎✑✒✔✖✌✒ ✘✌✎✛✒✑✜✢✤✢✦✒✧node☆ ✫ ✭✎✌✒✮✑✯ c✱ild ✢✲ node✴✵c✱ildren ✔✎ ✘✌✎✛✒✑✜✢✤✢✦✒✧c✱ild☆✸ ✺✒✮✌✌✮✲✻✒✼ ✽✖✾✜✌✒✒ ✧node☆✸ ❀ Let us describe the algorithm in more detail: the parameter of the procedure is the root of the subtree we want to projectivize; the procedure first recursively projectivizes the subtrees of nodes immediately depending on the current node (its ❃children❅), and then rearranges the subtree of the current node in such a way that the relative order of the current node and its children remains unaltered, but the whole subtrees are moved right before and after the current node in the linear ordering.",
        "In other words, nodes in the subtree to be projectivized are moved as closely to their parent node as possible preserving the relative ordering of all nodes with respect to their parent nodes.",
        "(For lack of space we do not give details of data stuctures used for representing rooted dependency trees, but we hope that the exposition is clear enough to be easily understandable.)",
        "Figure 2 shows the result of projectivizing the forbidden configurations from Figure 1.",
        "For checking the projectivity of a subtree using the algorithm, it suffices to projectivize a copy of the subtree and compare it with the original subtree.",
        "The complexity of the algorithm depends on the data representation of rooted dependency trees and the usage of auxiliary data stuctures.",
        "If the recursion is transformed to iteration and an auxiliary data structure is used, we can get linear complexity with respect to the number of nodes of the input (sub)tree.",
        "1.❆ Formal and empirical su❈stantiation of t✱e condition of projectivity The condition of projectivity is a very strong restriction laid on the tectogrammatical representations, but we believe there are very good reasons to postulate it, both formal and empirical.",
        "From the formal side, the more restricted is a formal framework the more interesting it is.",
        "In addition, projective rooted trees allow for a straightforward one-to-one linearisation.",
        "From the linguistic point of view, such a representation makes it possible to interpret the left-to-right order of nodes of the tree as the basic (underlying) word order and thus to capture the description of the TFA of the sentences at this level.",
        "TFA as a semantically relevant opposition can be then defined on the basis of deep word order (or, more precisely, of the opposition of contextual boundness and non-boundness, see Section 2.2 below), and Topic and Focus can be described as continuous parts of the sentence.",
        "1.3 Projectivity and deviations from it in theoretical description In FGD, we proceed from the projective core with tectogrammatical representations (TRs) treated as projective rooted trees and view the deviations from projectivity (as well as many other marked cases and exceptions) as differences between underlying and morphemic structures.",
        "Most (types of) non-projective constructions can be described by means of projective trees, leaving the realization of the surface word order to the morphemic level, where the representation of the sentence has the shape of a string rather than a tree (possibilities of a specification of such a transition are illustrated by examples of movement rules in Hajicova and Sgall (2003)).",
        "Deviations of all kinds are determined by contextual restrictions (definable by lists, e.g. a list of quasi-modal predicates), by specific indices in node labels (contrast) and by specific behavior of certain items (lists, analogy, additional rules, e.g. those of word-order shifts), see Hajicova et al.",
        "(in press) and Section 3 below.",
        "2 Annotation of the underlying sentence structure in the Prague Dependency Treebank The Prague Dependency Treebank (containing 100,000 sentences of Czech text samples; a sub-collection of the Czech National Corpus) is manually annotated on three levels: morphological layer (lowest), analytical layer (intermediate)– surface syntactic annotation, and tectogrammatical layer (highest)–underlying structure of the sentence.",
        "In this paper we are concerned with the tectogrammatical layer of annotation, which apart from dependency relations captures also the TFA of sentences."
