        "The lexicon models used in these systems typically do not include any linguistic or contextual information which often results in inadequate alignments between the sentence pairs.",
        "In this work, we propose an approach to improve the quality of the statistical alignments by taking into account the interdependencies of different derivations of the words.",
        "We are getting use of the hierarchical representation of the statistical lexicon model as proposed in (Nießen and Ney, 2001) for the conventional EM training procedure.",

        "Context dependencies have been introduced into the training of alignments in (Varea et al., 2002), but they do not take any linguistic information into account.",
        "Some recent publications have proposed the use of morpho-syntactic knowledge for statistical machine translation, but mostly only for the preprocessing step whereas training procedure of the statistical models remains the same (e.g. (Nießen and Ney, 2001a)).",
        "Incorporation of the morpho-syntactic knowl-egde into statistical models has been dealt in (Nießen and Ney, 2001): hierarchical lexicon models containing base forms and set of morpho-syntactic tags are proposed for the translation from German into English.",
        "However, these lexicon models are not used for the training but have been created from the Viterbi alignment obtained after the usual training procedure.",
        "The use of POS information for improving statistical alignment quality of the HMM-based model is described in (Toutanova et al., 2002).",
        "They introduce additional lexicon probability for POS tags in both languages, but actually are not going beyond full forms."
