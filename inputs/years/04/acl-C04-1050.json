        "For a long time, parsing has been a central issue for the area of natural language analyses.",
        "In recent years, its accuracy has improved to over 90%, and it became the fundamental technology that is applied to a lot of NLP applications, such as question answering, text summarization, and machine translation.",
        "Accordingly, anaphora resolution, which is positioned as the next step of parsing, has been studied actively (Ng and Cardie, 2002; Yang et al., 2003; Iida et al., 2003; Isozaki and Hirao, 2003; Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2004).",
        "Its performance, however, is not satisfactory enough to benefit the NLP applications.",
        "We investigated errors of our Japanese zero pronoun resolution system (Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2004), and found that word sense ambiguity causes a major part of errors.",
        "Our zero pronoun resolution system utilizes the general-purpose thesaurus Nihongo Goi Taikei (Ikehara et al., 1997) (hereafter, NTT thesaurus) to do matching of example words.",
        "In this thesaurus, one or more semantic features are given to each word, and similarity between words can be calculated by comparing closeness of their semantic features in the thesaurus tree (Appendix A).",
        "Multiple semantic features for a word, i.e. word sense ambiguity, cause incorrect matching, and furthermore deteriorate accuracy of the zero pronoun resolution system.",
        "For instance, in the thesaurus, “gobou” (burdock/priest/temple) has four semantic features: <crop>, <vegetable>, <priest> and <temple>*.",
        "If <priest> is used for “gobou” in a cooking domain text, though “gobou” means ‘burdock’ (a genus of coarse biennial herbs) in its context, “gobou” is identified as an agent.",
        "That is, “gobou” is incorrectly analyzed as antecedents of the following nominative zero pronouns.",
        "If such word sense ambiguity can be resolved, incorrect matching decreases, and the anaphora resolution system will improve.",
        "Word sense disambiguation is a basic issue of NLP.",
        "Recently, the evaluation exercises for word sense disambiguation such as SENSEVAL-1 (Kilgarriff and Palmer, 2000) and SENSEVAL-2 (Yarowsky, 2001) have been held, but word sense disambiguation has rarely been incorporated into deep analyses like anaphora resolution.",
        "This paper proposes unsupervised word sense disambiguation based on automatically constructed case frames and its incorporation into the zero pronoun resolution system.",
        "The word sense disambiguation is applied to verbst and nouns.",
        "We consider that case frames define verb senses and semantic features in the thesaurus define noun senses, respectively.",
        "A verb is disambiguated by selecting a corresponding case frame to its context, and a noun is disambiguated by selecting an appropriate semantic",
        "feature from the ones defined for the noun in the thesaurus.",
        "In addition, according to the one sense per discourse heuristic, the disambiguation results are cached and applied globally to the following words in the same text.",

        "Verbs which have different meanings should have different case frames, but it is hard to disambiguate verb senses precisely.",
        "To deal with this problem, predicate-argument examples which are collected from a large corpus are distinguished by coupling a verb and its closest case component.",
        "That is, examples are not distinguished by verbs (e.g. “tsumu” (load/accumulate)), but by couples (e.g. “nimotsu-wo tsumu” (load baggage) and “keiken-wo tsumu” (accumulate experience)).",

        "Example words are collected for each case marker, such as “ga” , “wo” , “ni” and “kara” .",
        "They are case-marking postpositions in Japanese, and usually mean nominative, accusative, dative and ablative, respectively.",
        "We call such a case marker ‘case slot’ and example words in a case slot ‘case examples’.",
        "Case examples in a case slot are similar, but have some incorrect semantic features because of word sense ambiguity.",
        "For instance, “nimotsu” (baggage), “busshi” (supply) and “nisemono” (imitation) are gathered in a case slot, and all of them are below the semantic feature <goods>.",

        "<lie> is incorrect for this case slot, and possibly causes errors in case analysis.",
        "We delete a semantic feature that is not similar to the other semantic features of its case slot.",

        "1.",
        "A large raw corpus is parsed by the Japanese parser, KNP (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994b), and reliable predicate-argument examples are extracted from the parse results.",

        "The extracted examples are bundled according to the verb and its closest case component, making initial case frames.",
