        "(Miller, 1995), (Fellbaum, ed., 1998) While WordNet’s current version (2.0) has broad medical coverage, it manifests a number of defects, which reflect both the lack of domain expertise on the part of the responsible lexicographers, and also the fact that WordNet was not built for domain-specific applications.",
        "The research community has long been aware of these defects (Magnini and Strapparava, 2001), (Bodenreider and Burgun, 2002), (Burgun and Bodenreider, 2001), (Bodenreider, et al., 2003).",
        "Our response is to create Medical WordNet (MWN), a free-standing lexical database designed specifically for the needs of natural-language processing in the medical domain, with the goal of removing the ‘noise’ which is associated with the application of WordNet and similar resources to this specialized domain.",
        "MWN’s initial focus is on English single-word expressions as used and understood by non-experts.",
        "We systematically review WordNet’s existing medical coverage by assembling a validated corpus of sentences involving specific medically relevant vocabulary.",
        "Input to our validation process includes the definitions of medical terms already existing in WordNet, and also sentences generated via the semantic relations linking such terms in WordNet.",
        "In addition, input includes sentences derived from online medical information services targeted to consumers.",
        "Our methodology is designed (1) to document natural language sentential contexts for each relevant word sense in such a way that the expressed information can be (2) validated by medical experts and (3) accessed automatically by NLP applications such as information retrieval, machine translation, question-answer systems, and text summarization.",
        "A major stumbling block for existing NLP applications is automatic sense disambiguation.",
        "An automatic system can detect with high reliability that a given occurrence of a word like feel or dead is a verb or adjective.",
        "But it cannot easily determine which of a variety of alternative meanings such polysemous words have in any given context.",
        "WordNet’s architecture, designed for representing and distinguishing word senses, has made an important contribution towards a solution of the automatic word sense disambiguation problem.",
        "Our corpus of English language sentences relating to medical phenomena is designed to build upon this contribution.",
        "The corpus is restricted to grammatically complete, syntactically simple sentences in natural language which have been rated as understandable by non-expert human subjects in controlled questionnaire-based experiments.",
        "It is restricted in addition to sentences which are self-contained in the sense that they make no reference to any prior context and do not contain any proper names, or anaphoric elements (like it or he or then) that need to be interpreted with respect to other sentences or some surrounding discourse or context.",
        "This corpus is designed to be used initially for purposes of quality assurance of MWN and also to support the population of MWN by yielding new families of words and word senses for inclusion.",
        "As will become clear, however, our use of human validators will allow us to extend the usefulness of the corpus in a variety of ways.",
        "Thus we can use it to build new sorts of applications for information retrieval in the domain of consumer health.",

        "The validation process that is involved in the construction of MFN is used to detect errors in the existing WordNet, and also to ensure that the coverage of the natural language medical lexicon in MWN is of a scientific level sufficient to allow MWN technology to work in tandem with terminology and ontology systems designed for use by experts.",
        "Both MFN and MBN inherit from MWN the formal architecture of the Princeton WordNet.",
        "(Fellbaum, ed., 1998) However, we enhance this architecture to maximize its usefulness in medical information retrieval.",

        "Recent studies of the use of computer-based tools for consumer health information retrieval point to a mismatch between existing tools and the non-expert language used by most consumers – the language used not only by patients but also by family members, advisors, administrators, lawyers, and so forth, and to some degree also by nurses and physicians.",
        "(Slaughter, 2002), (C. A. Smith, et al., 2002), (Tse, 2003), (Tse and Soergel, 2003), (McCray and Tse, 2003), (Zeng, et al., in press) Where the usage of medical terms by professionals is at least in principle subject to control by standardization efforts, the highly contextually dependent usage of medical terms on the part of lay persons is much more difficult to capture in applications – and this in spite of the fact that it is in many ways simpler than expert usage.",
        "The taxonomies reflecting popular lexicalizations in all domains are indeed much less elaborate at both the upper and lower levels than in the corresponding technical lexica.",
        "(Medin and Atran, eds., 1999) Thus there are no popular terms linking infectious disease and mumps, so that in the popular medical taxonomy of diseases the former immediately subsumes the latter.",
        "The popular medical vocabulary naturally covers only a small segment of the encyclopedic vocabulary of medical professionalsm, and it lexicalizes mainly at the level of taxonomic orders.",
        "Popular medical terms (flu) are often fuzzier than technical medical terms.",
        "Many popular terms also cover a larger range of referent types than do technical terms; others may cover only part of the extension of their technical counterparts.",
        "We hypothesize, however, that with few exceptions the focal meanings (Berlin and Kay, 1969) of expert and non-expert terms will be identical.",
        "Constructing MFN and MBN allows us to test this and related hypotheses in a systematic way."

      "text": [
        "The skills of a physician in general practice comprise the ability to acquire relevant and reliable information through communication with patients through the use of non-expert language and to convey diagnostic and therapeutic information in ways tailored to the individual patient.",
        "Since the physician, too, is a member of the wider community of non-experts, and continues to use the non-expert language for everyday purposes, one might assume that there are no difficulties in principle keeping him from being able to formulate medical knowledge in a vocabulary that the patient can understand.",
        "As (Slaughter, 2002) and (C. A. Smith, et al., 2002) have shown, however, there are limits to this competence.",
        "The former examines dialogue between physicians and patients in the form of question-answer pairs, focusing especially on the relations documented in the UMLS Semantic Network.",
        "Only some 30% of the relations used by professionals in their answers directly match the relations used by consumers in formulating their questions.",
        "An example of one such question-answer pair is taken from (Slaughter, p. 224): Question Text: My seven-year-old son developed a rash today that I believe to be chickenpox.",
        "My concern is that a friend of mine had her 10-day-old baby at my home last evening before we were aware of the illness.",
        "My son had no contact with the infant, as he was in bed during the visit, but I have read that chickenpox is contagious up to two days prior to the actual rash.",

        "[ ... ] (b) You are correct in that a person with chickenpox can be contagious for 48 hours before the first vesicle is seen.",
        "[ ... ] (c) The fact that your son did not come in close contact with the infant means he most likely did not transmit the virus.",
        "(d) Of concern, though, is the fact that newborns are at higher risk of complications of varicella, including pneumonia.",

        "A form of antibody to varicella called varicella-zoster immune globulin (VZIG) can be given up to 48 hours after exposure and still prevent disease.",
        "Such examples illustrate also that there are lexically rooted mismatches in communication (which may in part reflect legal and ethical considerations) between experts and non-experts.",
        "Professionals often do not reuse the concepts and relations made explicit in the questions put to them by consumers.",
        "In our example, the questioner requests a yes/no-judgment on the possibility of contagion in a 10-day-old baby.",
        "In fact, however, only section (c) of the answer responds to this question, and this in a way which involves multiple departures from the type of non-expert language which the questioner can be presumed to understand.",
        "Rather, physicians expand the range of concepts and relations addressed (for example through discussion of issues of prevention, etc.).",
        "In all cases, the information source, whether it be a primary care physician or an online information system, must respond primarily with generic information (i.e. with information that is independent of case or context), and this is so even where requests relate to specific and episodic phenomena (occurrences of pain, fever, reactions to drugs, etc.).",
        "(Patel, et al., 2002) In our example, all sections except for (c) are of this generic kind.",
        "They contain answers in the form of context-independent statements about causality, about types of persons or diseases, about typical or possible courses of a disease.",

        "The building blocks of WordNet are synonym sets (‘synsets’), which are unordered sets of distinct word forms and which correspond closely to what, in medical terminology research, are called ‘concepts.’ Membership in a synset requires that the word forms express the same concept and are in this sense ‘cognitively synonymous’ (Cruse, 1986).",
        "More formally, synset members must be interchangeable in some sentential contexts without altering the truth-value of the sentences involved.",
        "WordNet’s architecture is thus grounded in the notion of truth-preserving interchangeability of word forms in sentential contexts, although research has not thus far focused on this feature.",
        "Constructing Medical FactNet allows us to rectify this gap by making explicit the contexts in which word forms are used in an environment that allows the systematic testing of the effects of word form substitution.",
        "Examples of synsets are {car, automobile} or {shut, close}.",
        "WordNet 2.0 contains some 115,000 synsets, with many word forms belonging to a plurality of synsets.",
        "WordNet is a net in virtue of the fact that the synsets are linked to one another via a small number of binary relations that differ for each of the four syntactic categories covered by WordNet: nouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs.",
        "Noun synsets are interlinked by means of the subtype (or is-a) relation, as exemplified by the pair poodle-dog, and by means of the part-of relation, as exemplified by the pair tire-car.",
        "Verb synsets are connected by a variety of lexical entailment relations that express manner elaborations, temporal relations, and causation (walk-limp, forget-know, show-see).",
        "(Fellbaum, 2002), (Fellbaum, 2003) Thus if X limps, then X also walks, but not vice versa.",
        "The links among the synsets structure the noun and verb lexica into hierarchies, with noun hierarchies being considerably deeper than those for verbs.",
        "WordNet’s appeal for NLP applications stems from the fact that its synset architecture can be exploited in building NLP applications that target the problem of automatic word sense disambiguation.",
        "Although most word forms in English are monosemous (clinician, epidemic), the most frequently occurring words are highly polysemous (host, dress, arm).",
        "The ambiguity of a polysemous word in a context can be resolved by distinguishing the multiple senses in terms of their links to other words within the WordNet net.",
        "For example, the noun club can be disambiguated by an automatic system that considers the superordinates of the different synsets in which this word form occurs: association, playing card, and stick.",
        "The information contained in WordNet is of two sorts: lexical (i.e. verbal) knowledge, stored in WordNet’s synset architecture, and encyclopedic (i.e. factual) knowledge, found in the definitions (or ‘glosses’) associated with each concept.",
        "These definitions can be problematic, however, as they were generated by lexicographers who were not specialists in the domains to which the words in the synsets belong.",
        "Often, the definitions were modelled on those found in existing dictionaries, but in these cases, too, problems have arisen above all in the form of a mismatch between definitions representing technical (specialist) knowledge and definitions reflecting non-expert usage.",

        "However, it was left undecided on what criteria terms should be selected as domain labels and what the relations among the relevant domains should be (arguably, surgery and drug should be included in the wider domain of medicine).",
        "In addition, labels were not systematically assigned to WordNet terms.",
        "Currently, when asked to output terms associated with medicine, the browser returns some 504 nouns, verbs, and adjectives (both single words and phrases), representing some 270 different senses.",
        "On the other hand, many cognate senses with clear medical uses are currently not labeled in this way.",
        "Table 2 provides examples, with the medicine label picked out in bold: autopsy {autopsy, necropsy, postmortem, #1 PM, postmortem examination – (an examination and dissection of a dead body to determine cause of death or the changes produced by",
        "Table 2 also illustrates the degree to which WordNet currently includes obsolete medical terms (ichor, morbific, unction) and also terms drawn seemingly indiscriminately from both technical medical vocabularies and from natural language.",
        "Some synsets contain only folk or only technical terms, some contain a mixture of both.",
        "Definitions are largely taken over from medical dictionaries prepared for experts.",
        "To provide a preliminary estimate of the extent of WordNet’s somewhat arbitrary medical coverage we derived a test lexicon of 2838 single-word medical terms from an existing digitalized lexical resource for medical language processing (LinKBase of the Belgian NLP company L&C), which was constructed independently of WordNet by medical professionals.",
        "The method used was to transform LinKBase into an alphabetically ordered term list and to eliminate automatically all acronyms, all multi-word terms, all proprietary terms, all terms containing numbers, and all terms longer than 10 letters.",
        "Remaining technical terms were then removed manually.",
        "Of the residual 2838 terms, only 11 were not present in any form in WordNet 2.0, though considerably more were not treated adequately in regard to their specifically medical usages.",
        "Almost all missing terms were compounds such as bedwetting, breastfed, coldsore.",
        "WordNet 2.0 has inadequate treatment of the systematic polysemy of nouns like dizziness and itching.",
        "These, like many other nouns, are both sensations and symptoms.",
        "The symptom role is also not encoded for many other nouns, including redness, retching, swelling, and so forth.",
        "WordNet states: a tumor is a mass of tissue and a tumor is abnormal, but not: some tumors are malignant.",
        "WordNet’s treatment of is-a, part-of and other relations, too, is marked by inadequacies in the medical domain.",
        "Thus WordNet currently contains a verb entailment relation exemplified by the pair snore-sleep defined as: ‘if someone snores, then he necessarily also sleeps.’ In medicine, however, it is recognized that it is quite possible to snore while awake, since snoring is there defined as the respiratory induced vibration of glottal tissues and this is associated not only (and most usually) with sleep but also with relaxation or obesity.",
        "Our methodology for constructing MFN involves the validation by experts of all relations between WordNet’s medically relevant synsets.",
        "It provides us with a systematic means to detect such errors.",
        "Constructing MBN gives us in addition the resources to do justice to the reason why such cases were included in WordNet in the first place: People can only snore when they are asleep and similar sentences belong precisely to the folk beliefs about medicine which MBN documents – not, however, to MFN.",
        "More generally, constructing MBN in tandem with MFN allows us to highlight those cases where non-experts and experts use the same term in different ways.",
        "Another family of terms currently poorly treated in WordNet are those manifesting polysemy along the medical/non-medical axis.",
        "For example, the medical senses of recession or rigors are not recorded in WordNet 2.0.",
        "A lexical database for purposes of automatic sense disambiguation must clearly differentiate all such senses.",
        "(Computerized medical information systems do not offer the possibility of follow-up in the sort of cases of misunderstanding which we have in communication between laypersons and medical practitioners.)",
        "Thus while MWN will contain only word forms that are used by non-experts (and thus part of natural rather than technical language), it must for practical reasons record word senses that are peculiar to the technical vocabulary."

        "This may prove a valuable source of information in targeting particular groups for specific types of remedial medical education.",
        "Furthermore, the extended MBN will provide opportunities for a new type of research in the field of consumer health.",
        "Specifically, we envisage experiments that investigate how the domain of medical phenomena is conceptualized by non-expert human subjects.",
        "Cognitive psychologists and anthropologists such as Rosch and others (Rosch, 1975), (Rosch, 1973), (Rosch, 1978) have postulated a level of lexical specification that they call ‘basic level.’ Basic level words correspond to basic kinds in the ontology of language-using subjects.",
        "Such words exist in all semantic domains, but they have been studied predominantly among words denoting natural kinds, such as animals, vegetables, fruit, and colors.",
        "(Medin and Atran, 1999), (Berlin and Kay, 1969) For example, tomato is often cited as an example of a basic level word, whereas vegetable is a superordinate, and cherry tomato is a subordinate.",
        "Basic level words have many striking properties: they are universally lexicalized, characterized by high frequency of occurrence, and they are learned first by children.",
        "The concepts they denote have properties that differ maximally from each other (e.g., a tomato is very different from a cabbage or a bean), but the difference between a basic level word and a subordinate (such as between a tomato and a cherry tomato) is less pronounced.",
        "The basic level lexicon in the medical domain has thus far not been explored, but such research promises important theoretical benefits.",
        "MBN might be used to determine the basic level in the domain under investigation by examining the difference in the frequency of occurrence of synonyms: highly frequent terms are good candidates for basic level words.",
        "We can then use the results of this work to provide a specification of the non-expert ontology of the medical domain and begin to explore differences between it and the ontologies underlying expert medical terminologies.",
        "Note that, in all of the above, MFN and MBN have characteristically played different roles.",
        "Thus where MFN has been associated with constructing practical tools designed to assist users in coming to believe what is true, MBN has been associated with research, for example regarding what people believe about medical phenomena."
