        "The investigation we describe here arose from a very commonly discussed experience, apparently triggered by the recent popularity of shared task evaluations that have opened opportunities for researchers to informally compare their experiences “with a common denominator”, so to speak.",
        "Among the perennial observations which are made during the analysis of the results is that (1) methods designed to “fine-tune” the high-accuracy base classifiers behave unpredictably, their success or failure often appearing far more sensitive to where the test set was drawn from, rather than on any true quality of the “fine-tuning”, and consequently, (2) the resulting system rankings are often unpredictable, especially as they are typically conducted only on a single new test set, often drawn from a single arbitrary new source of a significantly different nature than the training sets.",
        "One could argue that such evaluations do not constitute a fair test, but in fact, this is",
        "where computational linguistics modeling diverges from machine learning theory, since for any serious NLP application, such evaluations constitute a much more accurate representation of the real world.",
        "We believe one primary reason for this common experience is that the models involved are typically already operating well beyond the limits of accuracy of the models’ assumptions about the nature of distributions from which testing samples will be drawn.",
        "For this reason, even “sophisticated” discriminative training criteria, such as maximum entropy, minimum error rate, and minimum Bayes risk, are susceptible to these stability problems.",
        "There has been much theoretical work done on error correction, but in practice, any error correction usually lowers the performance of the combined system on unseen data, rather than improving it.",
        "Unfortunately, most existing theory simply does not apply.",
        "This is especially true if the base model has been highly tuned.",
        "For the majority of tasks, the performance of the trained models, after much fine tuning, tend to plateau out at around the same point, regardless of the theoretical basis of the underlying model.",
        "This holds true with most highly accurate classifiers, including maximum entropy classifiers, SVMs, and boosting models.",
        "In addition, even though data analysis gives us some general idea as to what kinds of feature conjunctions might help, the classifiers are not able to incorporate those into their model (usually because the computational cost would be infeasible), and any further post-processing tends to degrade accuracy on unseen data.",
        "The common practice of further improving accuracy at this point is to resort to ad hoc classifier combination methods, which are usually not theoretically well justified and, again, unpredictably improve or degrade performance – thus consuming vast amounts of experimental resources with relatively low expected payoff, much like a lottery.",
        "There are a variety of reasons for this, ranging from the aforementioned validity of the assumptions about the distribution between the training and test corpora, to the absence of a well justified stopping point for error correction.",
        "The latter problem is much more serious than it seems at first blush, since without a well-justified stopping criterion, the performance of the combined model will be much more dependent upon the distribution of the test set, than on any feature engineering.",
        "Empirical evidence for this argument can be seen from the result of the CoNLL shared tasks (Tjong Kim Sang, 2002)(Tjong Kim Sang and Meulder, 2003), where the ranking of the participating systems changes with the test corpora.",
        "Inspired by the repeated observations of this phenomenon by many participants, we decided to stop “sweeping the issue under the rug”, and undertook to confront it head-on.",
        "Accordingly, we challenged ourselves to design an error corrector satisfying the following criteria, which few if any existing models actually meet: (1) it would leverage off existing base models, while targeting their errors; (2) it would consistently improve accuracy, even on top of base models that already deliver high accuracy; (3) it would be robust and conservative, so as to almost never accidentally degrade accuracy; (4) it would be broadly applicable to any classification or recognition task, especially high-dimensional ones such as named-entity recognition and word-sense disambiguation; and (5) it would be template-driven and easily customizable, which would enable it to target error patterns beyond the base models’ representation and computational complexity limitations.",
        "Our goal in this undertaking was to invent as little as possible.",
        "We expected to make use of relatively sophisticated error-minimization techniques.",
        "Thus the results were surprising: the simplest models kept outperforming the “sophisticated” models.",
        "This paper attempts to investigate some of the key reasons why.",
        "To avoid reinventing the wheel, we originally considered adapting an existing error-driven method, transformation-based learning (TBL) for this purpose.",
        "TBL seems well suited to the problem as it is inherently an error corrector and, on its own, has been shown to achieve high accuracies on a variety of problems (see Section 4).",
        "Our original goal was to adapt TBL for error correction of high-performing models (Wu et al., 2004a), with two main principles: (1) since it is not clear that the usual assumptions made about the distribution of the training/test data are valid in such extreme operating ranges, empirical observations would take precedence over theoretical models, which implies that (2) any model would have to be empirically justified by testing on a diverse range of data.",
        "Experimental observations, however, increasingly drove us toward different goals.",
        "Our resulting error corrector, NTPC, was instead constructed on the principle of making as few assumptions as possible in order to robustly generalize over diverse situations and problems.",
        "One observation made in the course of experimentation, after many attempts at fine-tuning model parameters, was that many of the complex theoretical models for error correction often do not perform consistently.",
        "This is perhaps not too surprising upon further reflection, since the principle of Occam’s Razor does prefer simpler hypotheses over more complex ones.",
        "NTPC was introduced in (Wu et al., 2004b), where the controversial issues it raised generated a number of interesting questions, many of which were were directed at NTPC’s seeming simplicity, which seems in opposition to the theory behind many other error correcting models.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the most commonly-asked questions.",
        "We illuminate these questions by contrasting NTPC against the more powerful TBL, presenting experiments that show that NTPC’s simple model is indeed",
        "key to its robustness and reliability.",
        "The rest of the paper is laid out as follows: Section 2 presents an introduction to NTPC, including an overview of its architecture.",
        "Section 3 addresses key questions related to NTPC’s architecture and presents empirical results justifying its simplicity."

        "One of the most surprising things about NTPC lies in the fact that despite its simplicity, it outperforms mathematically much more “sophisticated” methods at error correcting.",
        "Architecturally, it relies on a simple rule-learning mechanism and cross-partitioning of the training data to learn very conservative, cautious rules that make only a few corrections at a time.",
        "Figure 1 illustrates the NTPC architecture.",
        "Prior to learning, NTPC is given (1) a set of rule templates which describe the types of rules that it is allowed to hypothesize, (2) a single base learning model, and (3) an annotated training set.",
        "The NTPC architecture is essentially a sequentially chained piped ensemble that incorporates cross-validation style n-fold partition sets generated from the base model.",
        "The training set is partitioned n times in order to train n base models.",
        "Subsequently the n held-out validation sets are classified by the respective trained base models, with the results combined into a “reconstituted” training set.",
        "The reconstituted training set is used by ErrorCorrectorLearner, which learns a set of rules.",
        "Rule hypotheses are generated according to the given set of allowable templates:",
        "where X is a sequence of X training examples xi, Y is a sequence of reference labels yi for each example respectively, Yˆ is a sequence of labels ˆyi as predicted by the base model for each example respectively, H is the hypothesis space of valid rules implied by the templates, and τmin is a confidence threshold.",
        "Setting τmin to a relatively high value (say 15) implements the requirement of high reliability.",
        "R is subsequently sorted by the τi value of each rule ri into an ordered list of rules",
        "During the evaluation phase, depicted in the lower portion of Figure 1, the test set is first labeled by the base model.",
        "The error corrector’s rules r∗i are then applied in the order of R∗ to the evaluation set.",
        "The final classification of a sample is then the classification attained when all the rules have been applied.",
        "2.2 NTPC consistently and robustly improves accuracy of highly-accurate base models In previous work (Wu et al., 2004b), we presented experiments on named-entity identification and classification across four diverse languages, using Adaboost.MH as the base learner, which showed that NTPC was capable of robustly and consistently improving upon the accuracy of the already-highly-accurate boosting model; correcting the errors committed by the base model but not introducing any of its own.",
        "Table 1 compares results obtained with the base Ad-aboost.MH model (Schapire and Singer, 2000) and the NTPC-enhanced model for a total of eight different named-entity recognition (NER) models.",
        "These experiments were performed on the CoNLL-2002 and CoNLL2003 shared task data sets.",
        "It can be seen that the Ad-aboost.MH base models clearly already achieve high accuracy, setting the bar very high for NTPC to improve upon.",
        "However, it can also be seen that NTPC yields further F-Measure gains on every combination of task and language, including English NE bracketing (Model M2) for which the base F-Measure is the highest.",
        "An examination of the rules (shown in the Appendix) can give an idea as to why NTPC manages to identify and correct errors which were overlooked by the highly tuned base model.",
        "NTPC’s advantage comes from two aspects: (1) its ability to handle complex conjunctions of features, which often reflect structured, linguistically motivated expectations, in the form of rule templates; and (2) its ability to “look forward” at classifications from the right context, even when processing the sentence in a left-to-right direction.",
        "The base classifier is unable to incorporate these two aspects, because (1) including complex conjunctions of features would raise the computational cost of searching the feature space to a point where it would be infeasible, and (2) most classifiers process a sentence from left-to-right, deciding on the class label for each word before moving on to the next one.",
        "Rules that exploit these advantages are easily picked out in the table; many of the rules (especially those in the top 5 for both English and Spanish) consist of complex conjunctions of features; and rules that consider the right context classifications can be identified by the string “ne<num>”, where <num> is a positive integer (indicating how many words to the right)."

        "Another key difference between NTPC and TBL is the process of rule interaction.",
        "Since TBL allows a rule to use the current classification of a sample and its neighbours as features, and a rule updates the current state of the corpus when it applies to a sample, the application of one rule could end up changing the applicability (or not) of another rule.",
        "From the point of view of a sample, its classification could depend on the classification of “nearby” samples.",
        "Typically, these “nearby” samples are those found in the immediately preceding or succeeding words of the same sentence.",
        "This rule interaction is permitted in both training and testing.",
        "NTPC, however, does not allow for this kind of rule interaction.",
        "Rule applications only update the output classification of a sample, and do not update the current state of the corpus.",
        "In other words, the feature values for a Figure 2: NTPC’s zero tolerance condition yields less fluctuation and generally higher accuracy than the relaxed tolerance variations, in bracketing experiments.",
        "(bold = NTPC, dashed = relaxed tolerance) sample are initialized once, at the beginning of the program, and not changed again thereafter.",
        "The rationale for making this decision is the hypothesis that rule interaction is in nature unreliable, since the high-accuracy base model provides sparse opportunities for rule application and thus much sparser opportunities for rule interaction, making any rule that relies on rule interaction suspect.",
        "As a matter of fact, by considering only rules that make no mistake during the learning phase, NTPC’s zero error tolerance already eliminates any correction of labels that results from rule interaction – since a label correction on a sample that results from the application of more than one rule necessarily implies that at least one of the rules made a mistake.",
        "Since TBL is a widely used error-correcting method,",
        "it is natural to speculate that NTPC’s omission of rule interaction is a weakness.",
        "In order to test this question, we implemented an iterative variation of NTPC that allows rule interaction, where each iteration targets the residual error from previous iterations as follows:",
        "1. i←0,X0←X 2. ri ← null, si ← 0 3. foreach r ∈ H such that Ei (r) = 0 • if τi (r) > τi then ri ← r, τi ← τi (r) 4. if τi < τmin then return 5.",

        "In Step 5 of the algorithm, the current state of the corpus is updated with the latest rule on each iteration.",
        "That is, in each given iteration of the outer loop, the learner considers the corrected training data obtained by applying rules learned in the previous iterations, so the learner has access to the labels that result from applying the previous rules.",
        "Since these rules may apply anywhere in the corpus, the learner is not restricted to using only labels from the left context.",
