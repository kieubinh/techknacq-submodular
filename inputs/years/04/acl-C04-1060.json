        "Statistical approaches to machine translation, pioneered by Brown et al.",
        "(1990), estimate parameters for a probabilistic model of word-to-word correspondences and word re-orderings directly from large corpora of parallel bilingual text.",
        "In recent years, a number of syntactically motivated approaches to statistical machine translation have been proposed.",
        "These approaches assign a parallel tree structure to the two sides of each sentence pair, and model the translation process with reordering operations defined on the tree structure.",
        "The tree-based approach allows us to represent the fact that syntactic constituents tend to move as unit, as well as systematic differences in word order in the grammars of the two languages.",
        "Furthermore, the tree structure allows us to make probabilistic independence assumptions that result in polynomial time algorithms for estimating a translation model from parallel training data, and for finding the highest probability translation given a new sentence.",
        "Wu (1997) modeled the reordering process with binary branching trees, where each production could be either in the same or in reverse order going from source to target language.",
        "The trees of Wu’s Inversion Transduction Grammar were derived by synchronously parsing a parallel corpus, using a grammar with lexical translation probabilities at the leaves and a simple grammar with a single nonterminal providing the tree structure.",
        "While this grammar did not represent traditional syntactic categories such as verb phrases and noun phrases, it served to restrict the word-level alignments considered by the system to those allowable by reordering operations on binary trees.",
        "This restriction corresponds to intuitions about the alignments that could be produced by systematic differences between the two language’s grammars, and allows for a polynomial time algorithm for finding the highest-probability alignment, and for re-estimation of the lexical translation and grammar probabilities using the Expectation Maximization algorithm.",
        "Yamada and Knight (2001) present an algorithm for estimating probabilistic parameters for a similar model which represents translation as a sequence of reordering operations over children of nodes in a syntactic tree, using automatic parser output for the initial tree structures.",
        "This gives the translation model more information about the structure of the source language, and further constrains the reorder-ings to match not just a possible bracketing as in Wu (1997), but the specific bracketing of the parse tree provided.",
        "In this paper, we make a direct comparison of a syntactically unsupervised alignment model, based on Wu (1997), with a syntactically supervised model, based on Yamada and Knight (2001).",
        "We use the term syntactically supervised to indicate that the syntactic structure in one language is given to the training procedure.",
        "It is important to note, however, that both algorithms are unsupervised in that they are not provided any hand-aligned training data.",
        "Rather, they both use Expectation Maximization to find an alignment model by iteratively improving the likelihood assigned to unaligned parallel sentences.",
        "Our evaluation is in terms of agreement with word-level alignments created by bilingual human annotators.",
        "We describe each of the models used in more detail in the next two sections, including the clone operation of Gildea (2003).",
        "The reader who is familiar with these models may proceed directly to our experiments in Section 4, and further discussion in Section 5."

        "Given a bilingual sentence pair, a synchronous parse can be built using a two-dimensional extension of chart parsing, where chart items are indexed by their nonterminal Y and beginning and ending positions l, m in the source language string, and beginning and ending positions i, j in the target language string.",
        "For Expectation Maximization training, we compute inside probabilities Q(Y,l, m, i, j) from the bottom up as outlined below: for all l, m, n such that 1 < l < m < n < Ns do for all i, j, k such that 1 < i < j < k < Nt do for all rules X – > YZ E G do"

        "The final step, a French translation of each original English word, at the leaves of the tree, is chosen according to a distribution Pt (f Ie).",
        "The French word is predicted conditioned only on the English word, and each English word can generate at most one French word, or can generate a NULL symbol, representing deletion.",
        "Given the original tree, the re-ordering, insertion, and translation probabilities at each node are independent of the choices at any other node.",
        "These independence relations are analogous to those of a stochastic context-free grammar, and allow for efficient parameter estimation by an inside-outside Expectation Maximization algorithm.",
        "The computation of inside probabilities Q, outlined below, considers possible reorderings of nodes in the original tree in a bottom-up manner: for all nodes ei in input tree T do for all k, l such that 1 < k < l < N do for all orderings p of the children E1 ... em of ei do for all partitions of span k, l into",

        "While this constraint gives us a way of using syntactic information in translation, it may in many cases be too rigid.",
        "In part to deal with this problem, Yamada and Knight (2001) flatten the trees in a preprocessing step by collapsing nodes with the same lexical headword.",
        "This allows, for example, an English subject-verb-object (SVO) structure, which is analyzed as having a VP node spanning the verb and object, to be reordered as VSO in a language such as Arabic.",
        "Larger syntactic divergences between the two trees may require further relaxation of this constraint, and in practice we expect such divergences to be frequent.",
        "For example, a nominal modifier in one language may show up as an adverbial in the other, or, due to choices such as which information is represented by a main verb, the syntactic correspondence between the two sentences may break down completely.",
        "While having flatter trees can make more reorderings possible than with the binary Inversion Transduction Grammar trees, fixing the tree in one language generally has a much stronger opposite effect, dramatically restricting the number of permissible alignments."

        "Adding the cloning operation improves tree-to-string results by 2% precision and recall.",
        "It is particularly significant that the ITG gets higher recall than the other models, when it is the only model entirely limited to one-to-one alignments, bounding the maximum recall it can achieve.",
        "Our French-English experiments show only small differences between the various systems.",
        "Overall, performance on French-English is much better than for Chinese-English.",
        "French-English has less reordering overall, as shown by the percentage of productions in the viterbi ITG parses that are inverted: 14% for French-English in comparison to 23% for Chinese-English.",
        "One possible explanation for our results is parser error.",
        "While we describe our system as “syntacti",
        "cally supervised”, in fact this supervision comes in the form of the annotation of the Wall Street Journal treebank on which the parser is trained, rather than parses for our parallel training corpus.",

        "a typical sentence from our corpus.",
        "While we did not have human-annotated gold-standard parses for our training data, we did have human annotated parses for the Chinese side of our test data, which was taken from the Penn Chinese Treebank (Xue et al., 2002).",
        "We trained a second tree-to-string model in the opposite direction, using Chinese trees and English strings.",

        "Results are shown in Table 3.",
        "Because the ITG is a symmetric, generative model, the ITG results in Table 3 are identical to those in Table 1.",

        "(1996).",
        "They find higher coverage for an extended version of ITG than for the IBM decoding constraint for both language pairs, with the unmodified ITG implementation covering about the same amount of German-English data as IBM, and significantly less French-English data.",
        "These results show promise for ITG as a basis for efficient decoding, but do not address which model best aligns the original training data, as IBM-derived alignments were taken as the gold standard, rather than human alignments.",
        "We believe that our results show that syntactically-motivated models are a promising general approach to training translation models as well to searching through the resulting probability space.",
        "Computational complexity is an issue for the tree-based models presented here.",
        "While training the IBM models with the GIZA++ software takes minutes, the tree-based EM takes hours.",
        "With our C implementation, one iteration of the syntactically supervised model takes 50 CPU hours, which can be parallelized across machines.",
        "Our tree-based models are estimated with complete EM, while the training procedure for the IBM models samples from a number of likely alignments when accumulating expected counts.",
        "Because not every alignment is legal with the tree-based models, the technique of sampling by choosing likely alignments according to a simpler model is not straightforward.",
        "Nonetheless, we feel that training times can be improved with the right pruning and sampling techniques, as will be necessary to train on the much larger amounts data now available, and on longer sentences."
