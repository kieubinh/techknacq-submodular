        "Recently, much attention has been focused on the domain of multi-person meeting understanding.",
        "Meeting dialogue presents a wide range of challenges including continuous multi-speaker automatic speech recognition (ASR), 2D whiteboard gesture and handwriting recognition, 3D body and eye tracking, and multimodal multi-human dialogue management and understanding.",
        "A significant amount of research has gone toward understanding the problems facing the collection, organization, and visualization of meeting data (Moore, 2002; Waibel et al., 2001), and meeting corpora like the ICSI Meeting Corpus (Janin et al., 2003) are being made available.",
        "Continuing research in the multimodal meeting domain has since blossomed, including ongoing work from projects such as AMI1 and M42, and efforts from several institutions.",
        "Previous work on automatic meeting understanding has mostly focused on surface-level recognition, such as speech segmentation, for obvious reasons: understanding free multi-human speech at any level is an extremely difficult problem for which best performance is currently poor.",
        "In addition, the primary focus for",
        "applications has been on off-line tools such as post-meeting multimodal information browsing.",
        "In parallel to such efforts we are applying dialogue-management techniques to attempt to understand and monitor meeting dialogues as they occur, and to supplement multimodal meeting records with information relating to the structure and purpose of the meeting.",
        "Our efforts are focused on assisting artifact-producing meetings, i.e. meetings for which the intended outcome is a tangible product such as a project management plan or a budget.",
        "The dialogue-understanding system helps to create and manipulate the artifact, delivering a final product at the end of the meeting, while the state of the artifact is used as part of the dialogue context under which interpretation of future utterances is performed, serving a number of useful roles in the dialogue-understanding process:",
        "• The dialogue manager employs generic dialogue moves with plugin points to be defined by specific artifact types, e.g. project plan, budget; • The artifact state helps resolve ambiguity by providing evidence for multimodal fusion and constraining topic-recognition; • The artifact type can be used to bias ASR language-models; • The constructed artifact provides a interface for a meeting browser that supports directed queries about discussion that took place in the meeting, e.g. “Why did we decide on that date?”",
        "In addition, we focus our attention on the handling of ambiguities produced on many levels, including those produced during automatic speech recognition, multimodal communication, and artifact manipulation.",
        "The present dialogue manager uses several techniques to do this, including the maintenance of",
        "highlighting the dialogue-management components.",
        "multiple dialogue-move hypotheses, fusion with multimodal gestures, and the incorporation of artifact-specific plug-ins.",
        "The software architecture we use for managing multi-human dialogue is an enhancement of a dialogue-management toolkit previously used at CSLI in a range of applications, including command-and-control of autonomous systems (Lemon et al., 2002) and intelligent tutoring (Clark et al., 2002).",
        "In this paper, we detail the dialogue-management components (Section 3), which support a larger project involving multiple collaborating institutions (Section 2) to build a multimodal meeting-understanding system capable of integrating speech, drawing and writing on a whiteboard, and physical gesture recognition.",
        "We also describe our toolkit for on-line and off-line meeting browsing (Section 4), which allows a meeting participant, observer, or developer to visually and interactively answer questions about the history of a meeting, the processes performed to understand it, and the causal relationships between dialogue and artifact manipulation."

        "The components for drawing and writing recognition and multimodal integration (Kaiser et al., 2003) were developed at The Oregon Graduate Institute (OGI) Center for Human-Computer Communication3; the component for physical gesture recognition (Ko et al., 2003) was developed at The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) AI Lab 4.",
        "Integration between all components was performed by project members at those sites and at SRI International5, and integration between our CSLI Conversational Intelligence Architecture and OGI’s Multimodal Integrator (MI) was performed by members of both teams.",
        "ASR is done using CMU Sphinx6, from which the n-best list of results are passed to SRI’s Gemini parser (Dowding et al., 1993).",
        "Gemini incorporates a suite of techniques for handling noisy input, including fragment detection, and its dynamic grammar capabilities are used to register new lexical items, such as names of tasks that may be out-of-grammar.",
        "An example of a multimodal meeting conversation that the meeting assistant currently supports can be found in Figure 2.7 There are two meeting participants in a conference room with an electronic whiteboard which can record their pen strokes and a video camera that tracks their body movements; A is standing at the whiteboard and drawing while B is sitting at the table.",
        "A gloss of how the system behaves in response to each utterance and gesture follows each utterance; these glosses will be explained in greater detail throughout the rest of the paper.",

        "dialogue manager expects next utterance to be an answer B: Six months before the demos [A draws two diamonds on the signoff task line, each one about 6 months before the demo milestones drawn above] answer arrives; dialogue manager hypothesizes two new milestones which are confirmed by gesture A: And we’ll need the systems by then too [A draws two diamonds on the system task line] dialogue manager hypothesizes two more milestones, confirmed by gesture B: That’s a bit aggressive I think.",

        "The present application is however very different to our previous applications, and those commonly encountered in the literature, which typically involve a single human user interacting with a dialogue-enabled artificial agent.",
        "In the meeting environment, the dialogue manager should at most very rarely interpose itself into the discussion – to do so would be disruptive to the interaction between the human participants.",
        "This requirement prohibits ambiguity and uncertainty from being resolved with, say, a clarification question, which is the usual strategy in conversational interfaces.",

        "The principal base classes in the artifact ontology are designed to be both architecturally elegant and intuitive.",
        "To this end, we characterize the world of artifacts as being made up of three essential classes: entities which represent the tangible objects themselves, relations which represent how the entities relate to one another, and events which change the state of entities or relations.",

        "They comprehensively characterize the set of actions which can change the current state of an artifact.",

        "also demonstrate how it uses the current state of the artifact in the KB to constrain the interpretation of utterances in context, and how multimodal gestures help to resolve ambiguous interpretations.",
        "To begin, each dialogue-move hypothesis consists of the following elements: (1) the DMT node associated with this hypothesis, (2) the parse that gave rise to the hypothesis, (3) the probability of the hypothesis, (4) an is Unimodal flag indicating whether or not the dialogue move requires confirmation from other modalities, (5) a list of artifact-change events to be made to the KB, and (6) the information state update function to be invoked if this hypothesis is confirmed by the multimodal integrator.",

        "In our system, the ambiguous or uncertain utterance, the current dialogue context, and the current state of the chart is delegated to artifact-type specific components called hypothesizers.",
        "Hypothesizers take the above as input, and using the set of events available to its corresponding artifact in the ontology, they pro-grammatically generate a list of dialogue-move hypotheses appropriate in the given context – or they can return the empty list to indicate that there is no reasonable interpretation of the utterance given the current context.",
        "Hypothesizers work directly with the DMT architecture: as an incoming utterance is sequentially presented to each active node in the DMT, the dialogue context and the proposed active node are passed into a hypothesizer corresponding to the particular artifact associated with that node.",
        "If the hypothesizer can create one or more valid hypotheses, then the utterance is attached to the DMT as a child of that active node.",
        "10 In a multimodal domain, some hypotheses require confirmation in other modalities before the dialogue manager can confidently update loThere are, in fact, other rules as well which allow for attachment.",
        "For example, questions – which don’t immediately generate hypotheses – can also be attached to various nodes depending on the dialogue context.",
        "While the emphasis here is on hypothesizers, these are just one part of the dialogue processing toolkit the information state.",
        "In this particular system, in fact, the dialogue manager does not directly update the KB’s current artifact state; rather, it hypothesizes a set of dialogue-move hypotheses and assigns each a confidence derived from ASR confidence, the fragmentedness of the parse, and confidence in the proposed attachment to a conversational thread.",
        "Each conversational move is then provided a Hypothesis Repository for storing the hypotheses associated with it.",
        "When dialogue processing is completed for a particular conversational move, i. e. when all possible attachments of all possible parses on the n-best list have been made, the set of hypotheses is sent to the Multimodal Integrator (MI) for potential fusion with gesture.",
        "Depending on the information from other modalities, the MI confirms or rejects the hypotheses – moreover, a confirmed hypothesis might be augmented with information provided by other modalities.",
        "Such an augmentation occurs for the utterance We have three tasks from the example dialogue.",
        "In this situation, the dialogue manager hypothesizes that the user may be creating three new task lines on the chart.",

        "A meeting participant might have questions as the meeting occurs, like “What did the chart look like 5 minutes ago?”, “What did we say to make the system move that milestone?”, and “What did Mr. Smith say at the beginning of the meeting?”.",
