        "In the embedded approach, an on-line module which statistically induces the likelihood of a particular string being a word is embedded in a morphological analyzer (Nagata, 1999; Uchimoto et al., 2001).",
        "A modular approach is generally preferable in practice, since it allows developers to maintain a high quality lexicon which is crucial for good performance.",
        "Previous work of the modular approach was either unable to detect low frequency unknown words (Mori 1996) or limited to predefined character patterns for low frequency unknown words (Ikeya 2000).",
