        "Word segmentation in Chinese and Japanese is an important and difficult task.",
        "In these languages, words are not separated by explicit delimiters, and word segmentation must be conducted first in most natural language processing applications.",
        "One of the problems which makes word segmentation more difficult is existence of unknown (out-of-vocabulary) words.",
        "Unknown words are defined as words that do not exist in a system’s dictionary.",
        "The word segmentation system has no knowledge about these unknown words, and determining word boundaries for such words is difficult.",
        "Accuracy of word segmentation for unknown words is usually much lower than that for known words.",
        "In this paper, we propose a hybrid method for Chinese and Japanese word segmentation, which utilizes both word-level and character-level information.",
        "Word-level information is useful for analysis of known words, and character-level information is useful for analysis of unknown words.",
        "We use these two types of information at the same time to obtain high overall performance.",

        "Word-based Markov models are used in English part-of-speech (POS) tagging (Charniak et al., 1993; Brants, 2000).",
        "This method identifies POS-tags T = t1, ... , tn, given a sentence as a word sequence W = w1, ... , wn, where n is the number of words in the sentence.",
        "The method assumes that each word has a state which is the same as the POS of the word and the sequence of states is a Markov chain.",
        "A state t transits to another state s with probability P(s|t), and outputs a word w with probability P(w|t).",
        "From such assumptions, the probability that the word sequence W with parts-of-speech T is generated is",
        "where w0(t0) is a special word(part-of-speech) representing the beginning of the sentence.",
        "Given a word sequence W, its most likely POS sequence Tˆ can be found as follows:",
        "The equation above can be solved efficiently by the Viterbi algorithm (Rabiner and Juang, 1993).",
        "In Chinese and Japanese, the method is used with some modifications.",
        "Because each word in a",
        "sentence is not separated explicitly in Chinese and Japanese, both segmentation of words and identification of the parts-of-speech tags of the words must be done simultaneously.",
        "Given a sentence S, its most likely word sequence Wˆ and POS sequence Tˆ can be found as follows where W ranges over the possible segments of S (w1 • • • wn = S):",
        "The equation above can be solved using the Viterbi algorithm as well.",
        "The possible segments of a given sentence are represented by a lattice, and Figure 1 shows an example.",
        "Given a sentence, this method first constructs such a lattice using a word dictionary, then chooses the best path which maximizes Equation (3).",
        "This Markov model-based method achieves high accuracy with low computational cost, and many Japanese word segmentation systems adopt it (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1998; Matsumoto et al., 2001).",
        "However, the Markov model-based method has a difficulty in handling unknown words.",
        "In the constructing process of a lattice, only known words are dealt with and unknown words must be handled with other methods.",
        "Many practical word segmentation systems add candidates of unknown words to",
        "the lattice.",
        "The candidates of unknown words can be generated by heuristic rules(Matsumoto et al., 2001) or statistical word models which predict the probabilities for any strings to be unknown words (Sproat et al., 1996; Nagata, 1999).",
        "However, such heuristic rules or word models must be carefully designed for a specific language, and it is difficult to properly process a wide variety of unknown words."

        "This method carries out word segmentation by tagging each character in a given sentence, and in this method, the tags indicate word-internal positions of the characters.",

        "The POC-tags can represent word boundaries for any sentences, and the word segmentation task can be reformulated as the POC-tagging task.",

        "This character tagging method can easily handle unknown words, because known words and unknown words are treated equally and no other exceptional processing is necessary.",

        "This seems natural because words are used as a processing unit in the Markov model-based method, and therefore much information about known words (e.g., POS or word bigram probability) can be used.",
        "However, unknown words cannot be handled directly by this method itself.",
        "On the other hand, characters are used as a unit in the character tagging method.",
        "In general, the number of characters is finite and far fewer than that of words which continuously increases.",
        "Thus the character tagging method may be robust for unknown words, but cannot use more detailed information than character-level information.",
