        "The ability to draw on past experience is often useful in information-providing applications.",
        "For instance, users who interact with help-desk applications would benefit from the availability of relevant contextual information about their request, e.g., from previous, similar interactions between the system and other users, or from interactions between domain experts.",
        "The work reported in this paper is the first step in a project which aims to provide such information.",
        "The eventual objective of our project is to automatically identify related interactions in help-desk applications, and to generate summaries from their combined experience.",
        "These summaries would then assist both users and operators.",
        "Our approach to the identification of related interactions hinges on the application of clustering techniques.",
        "These techniques have been used in Information Retrieval for some time (e.g. Salton, 1971).",
        "They involve grouping a set of related documents, and then using a representative element to match input queries (as opposed to matching the whole collection of documents).",
        "Document clustering has been used in search engine applications to improve and speed up retrieval (e.g. Zamir and Et-zioni, 1998), but also for more descriptive purposes, such as using representative elements of a cluster to generate lists of keywords (Neto et al., 2000).",
        "However, discussions (and dialogues in general) have distinguishing features which make clustering a corpus of such interactions a more challenging task than clustering plain documents.",
        "These features are: (1) the corpus consists of contributions made by a community of authors, or “speakers”; (2) certain speakers are more dominant in the corpus; and (3) speakers often use idiosyncratic, speaker-specific language, or make comments that are not about the task at hand.",
        "In this paper, we report on a preliminary study where we cluster discussions carried out in electronic newsgroups.",
        "Specifically, we report on the influence of the above features on the clustering process, and describe a filtering mechanism that identifies and removes undesirable influences.",
        "Table 1 shows the newsgroups used as data sources in our experiments.",
        "These newsgroups were obtained from the Internet.",
        "The table shows the number of threads in each newsgroup, the number of people posting to the newsgroups, and the highest number of postings by an individual for each newsgroup.",
        "It also shows the impact of the filtering mechanism on each newsgroup (Section 2).",
        "The clustering process and filtering mechanism were evaluated by means of two experiments: (1) coarse-level clustering, and (2) simple information retrieval.",
        "Coarse-level clustering.",
        "This experiment consists of merging the discussion threads (documents) in different newsgroups into a single dataset, and applying a clustering mechanism to separate them.",
        "The performance of the clustering mechanism is then evaluated by how well the generated clusters match the original newsgroups from which the discussion threads were obtained.",
        "Clearly, this evaluation is at a coarser level of granularity than that required for our final system.",
        "However, we find it useful for the following reasons:",
        "• Owing to the number and diversity of newsgroups on the Internet, we can perform controlled experiments where we vary the degree of similarity between newsgroups, thereby simulating discussions with different levels of relatedness.",
        "• Our experiments show that our filtering mechanism has a positive influence at different levels of granularity (Section 4).",
        "Hence, there is reason to expect that this influence will remain for finer levels of granularity, e.g., the level of a task or request.",
        "• Finally, the different newsgroups are identified in advance, which obviates the need for manual discussion-tagging at this stage.",
        "Due to space limitations, we report only on a subset of our experiments.",
        "In (Marom and Zukerman, 2004) we present a comparative study that considers different sets of newsgroups of varying levels of relatedness.",
        "We regard the set of newsgroups presented here as having a “medium” level of relatedness.",
        "Simple information retrieval.",
        "This experiment constitutes a simplistic and restricted version of the document retrieval functionality envisaged for our eventual system.",
        "In this experiment, we matched pairs of query terms to the centroids of the generated clusters, and assessed the system’s ability to retrieve relevant discussion threads from the best-matching cluster, with and without filtering.",
        "The experiment makes the implicit assumption that the corpus contains discussions relevant to incoming requests, i.e. that new requests are similar to old ones.",
        "We believe that the results of this restricted experiment are indicative of future system performance, as the envisaged system is also expected to operate under this assumption.",
        "Next, we describe our filtering mechanism.",
        "Section 3 describes the clustering procedure, including our data representation and cluster identification method.",
        "Section 4 presents the results from our experiments, and Section 5 concludes the paper."

        "Our filtering mechanism identifies and removes idiosyncratic words used by dominant speakers.",
        "Such words typically have a high frequency in the postings authored by these speakers.",
        "Even though these words can appear anywhere in a person’s posting, they appear mostly in signatures (about 75% of these words appear towards the end of a person’s posting, while the remaining 25% are distributed throughout the posting).",
        "We therefore refer to them throughout this paper as signature words.",
        "The filtering mechanism operates in two stages: (1) profile building, and (2) signature-word removal.",
        "Profile building.",
        "First, our system builds a ‘profile’, or distribution of word posting frequencies, for each person posting to a newsgroup.",
        "The posting frequency of a word is the number of postings where the word is used.",
        "For example, a person might have two postings in one newsgroup discussion, and three postings in another, in which case the maximum possible posting frequency for each word used by this person is five.",
        "Alternatively, one could count all occurrences of a word in a posting, which could be useful for constructing more detailed stylistic profiles.",
        "However, at present we are mainly concerned with words that appear across postings.",
        "Signature-word removal.",
        "In the second stage, word-usage proportions are calculated for each person.",
        "These are the word posting frequencies divided by the person’s total number of postings.",
        "The aim of this calculation is to filter out words that have a very high proportion.",
        "In addition, we wanted to distinguish between the profile of a dominant individual and that of a non-dominant one.",
        "Hence, rather than just using a simple cut-off threshold for word-usage proportions, we base the decision to fi l-ter on the number of postings made by an individual as well as on the proportions.",
        "This is done by utilising a statistical significance test (a Bernoulli test) that measures if a proportion is significantly higher than a threshold (0.4),1 where significance is based on the number of postings.",
        "The impact of this filtering mechanism on the various newsgroups is shown in the last column of Table 1, which displays the average number of times the filter is applied per discussion thread.",
        "This number gives an indication of the existence of signature",
        "words from dominant speakers.",
        "For example, although the ‘hp’ newsgroup has a very dominant individual (who accounts for 17.5% of the postings), the filter is applied to this person’s postings a very small number of times, as s/he does not have signature words.",
        "In contrast, the ‘tex’ and ‘photoshop’ newsgroups have less dominant individuals, but here the filter is applied more frequently, as these individuals do have signatures."

        "As indicated in Section 1, we are interested in clustering complete newsgroup discussions rather than individual postings.",
        "Hence, we extract discussion threads from the newsgroups as units of representation.",
        "Each thread constitutes a document, which consists of a person’s inquiry to a newsgroup and all the responses to the inquiry.",
        "Our data representation is a bag-of-words with TF.IDF scoring (Salton and McGill, 1983).",
        "Each document (thread) yields one data point, which is represented by a vector.",
        "The components of the vector correspond to the words chosen to represent a newsgroup.",
        "The values of these components are the normalised TF.IDF scores of these words.",
        "The words chosen to represent a newsgroup are all the words that appear in the newsgroup, except function words, very frequent words (whose frequency is greater than the 95th percentile of the newsgroup’s word frequencies), and very infrequent words (which appeared less than 20 times throughout the newsgroup).",
        "This yields vectors whose typical dimensionality (i.e. the number of words retained) is between 1000 and 2000.",
        "Since dimensionality reduction is not detrimental to retrieval performance (Sch¨utze and Pedersen, 1995) and speeds up the clustering process, we use Principal Components Analysis (Afi fi and Clark, 1996) to reduce the dimensionality of our dataset.",
        "This process yields vectors of size 200.",
        "The TF.IDF method is used to calculate the score of each word.",
        "This method rewards words that appear frequently in a document (term frequency – TF), and penalises words that appear in many documents (inverse document frequency – IDF).",
        "There are several ways to calculate TF.IDF (Salton and McGill, 1983).",
        "In our experiments it is calculated as TFi,j = 1092(fij + 1) and IDFi = 1092(N/ni), where fij is the frequency of word i in document j, ni is the number of documents where word i appears, and N is the total number of documents in the dataset.",
        "In order to reduce the effect of document length, the TF.IDF score of a word in a document is then normalised by taking into account the scores of the other words in the document.",
        "One might expect that the IDF component should be able to reduce the influence of signature words of dominant individuals in a newsgroup.",
        "However, IDF alone cannot distinguish between words that are representative of a newsgroup and signature words of frequent contributors, i.e. it would discount these equally.",
        "Further, we have observed that an individual does not have to post to many threads (documents) for his/her signature words to influence the clustering process.",
        "Since IDF discounts words that occur in many documents, it would fail to discount signature words that appear mainly in the subset of documents where such individuals have postings."

        "However, because K-Means is an unsupervised mechanism, we do not know which cluster to compare with which newsgroup.",
        "We resolve this issue as follows.",
        "We calculate the goodness of the match between each cluster i E { 1.. k } and each newsgroup j E { 1.31 } (k > l) using the F-score from Information Retrieval (Salton and McGill, 1983).",
        "This gives an overall measure of how well the cluster represents the newsgroup, taking into account the ‘correctness’ of the cluster (precision) and how much of the newsgroup it accounts for (recall).",

        "The F-score is then recalculated for each pooled cluster to give an overall performance measure for these clusters.",
        "The clustering procedure is evaluated using two main measures: (1) the number of newsgroups that were matched by the generated clusters (between 1 and ✫), and (2) the F-score of the pooled clusters.",
        "The first measure estimates how many clusters are needed to find all the newsgroups, while the second measure assesses the quality of these clusters.",

        "These tables show how many clusters were found for each newsgroup, the number of documents in each pooled cluster, and the performance of the cluster (P, R and F).",
        "The tables also present the top 30 representative words in each cluster (restricted to 30 due to space limitations).",
        "These words are sorted in decreasing order of their average TF.IDF score over the documents in the cluster (words representative of a cluster should have high TF.IDF scores, because they appear frequently in the documents in the cluster, and infrequently in the documents in other clusters).",
        "According to the results in Table 2, the top-30 list for the ‘hp’ cluster does not have many signature words.",
        "This was anticipated by the observation that the filtering mechanism was applied very rarely to the ‘hp’ newsgroup (Table 1).",
        "In contrast, the majority of the top-30 words in the ‘tex’ cluster are signature words (some exceptions are ‘chapter’, ‘english’ and ‘examples’).",
        "We conclude that this pooled cluster was created (using two different clusters) to represent the various signatures in the ‘tex’ newsgroup.",
        "Further, a relatively small number of documents are assigned to the ‘tex’ cluster, which therefore has a very low recall value (0.34).",
        "Its precision is perfect, but its low recall suggests that many of the documents representing the true topics of this newsgroup were assigned to other clusters.",
        "The ‘photoshop’ cluster has a very high precision and recall, so most of the ‘photoshop’ documents were assigned correctly.",
        "However, here too many of the top words are signature words.",

        "In Table 3 most of the words discovered by the clustering procedure represent the true topics of the newsgroups.",
        "The filtering mechanism removes the dominant signature words, and thus the clustering procedure is able to find the true topic-related clusters (precision and recall are very high for all pooled clusters).",
        "Notice that there are still some signature-related words, such as ‘arseneau’ and ‘fairbairns’ in the ‘tex’ cluster, and ‘tacit’ and ‘gifford’ in the ‘photoshop’ cluster.",
        "These words correspond mainly to a dominant individual’s name or email address, and the filtering mechanism fails to filter them when other individuals reply to the dominant individual using these words.",
        "In a thread (document) containing a dominant individual, that individual’s signature words are filtered, but unless the people replying to the dominant individual are dominant themselves, the words they use to refer to this individual will not be filtered, and therefore will influence the clustering process.",

Although the clustering procedure without filtering is able to find three distinct newsgroups with k = ✆, it requires a higher value of k to achieve a satisfactory performance.",

        "Our results show that filtering out the signature words of dominant speakers has a positive effect on clustering and retrieval performance.",
        "Although these experiments were performed at a coarser level of granularity than that of our target domain, our results indicate that filtering signature words is a promising preprocessing step for clustering electronic discussions.",
        "From a more qualitative perspective, we clearly saw the benefit of the filtering mechanism in the example in Section 3.3 (Tables 2 and 3): when a generation component is used to describe the contents of clusters, the inclusion of author-specific words is uninformative and even confusing.",
        "Our approach to filtering is general in the sense that we do not target specific parts of electronic discussions (e.g. the last few lines of a posting) for filtering.",
        "We have experimented with a more naive approach that removes all web and email addresses from a posting (they account for a significant portion of a signature).",
        "However, this simple heuristic yielded only a small improvement in clustering performance.",
        "More importantly, it clearly does not generalise to deal with the problem of identifying and removing author-specific terminology."
