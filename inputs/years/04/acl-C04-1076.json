        "Nowadays, several works on automatic speech recognition (ASR) for continuous speech are being developed, not only system that rely on dictionary, but also the recognition on out of vocabulary circumstances.",
        "In a situation of misrecognition and out-of-vocabulary words, a practical and efficient solution that would assist the ASR is to equip the system with a spelling recognition subsystem, where users can spell out a word letter by letter.",
        "Spelling recognition is a challenging task with a high interest for directory assistance sevices, or other applications where a large number of proper names or addresses are handled.",
        "Many works that focus on spelling recognition were widely developed in several languages, for instance, English, Spanish, Portuguese and German.",
        "In (San-Segundo et al., 2001) the hypothesis-verification Spanish continuous spelled proper name recognition over the telephone was proposed.",
        "In this work, several feature sets were investigated by using models of neural networks.",
        "In their succeeding work (San-Segundo et al., 2002), three different recognition architectures, including the two-level architecture, the integrated architecture and the hypothesis-verification architecture, are analyzed and compared.",
        "In (Rodrigues et al., 1997), a Portuguese speaker independent system for recognizing an isolated letter was introduced.",
        "The system dealt with speech utterances over a telephone line using Hidden Markov Model (HMM).",
        "A number of experiments were made over four different perplexity language models.",
        "Mitchell and Setlur (1999) proposed a fast list matcher to select a name from a name list that was created from an n-best letter recognizer on spelling over a telephone line recognition task.",
        "In (Bauer and Junkawitsch, 1999), an approach is proposed to combine word recognition with spelling recognition in a user-friendly manner as a fall back strategy.",
        "As a German city name recognizer, the system was applied to directory assistance services.",
        "Unlike other languages, spelling in Thai has several styles.",
        "One of them is similar to spelling in English, i.e., /d-ii//z-oo//g-ii/ for “dog”.",
        "There are three more methods in Thai spelling, where some syllables are inserted to make it clearer for the hearer.",
        "One is to spell out a letter followed by its representative word’s utterance.",
        "Another way is to mix the former two types.",
        "The third method is to spell out a set of letters that form a syllable, followed by its corresponding utterance.",

        "One of the main reasons is that there is no standard corpus for this purpose.",
        "Creating a corpus of spelled utterances is a time comsuming task.",
        "In this work we use the NECTEC-ATR Thai Speech Corpus, a standard continuous Thai speech corpus, for our spelling recognition system.",
        "Another objective of this work is to examine how a spelling system can be implemented using a normal Thai continuous speech corpus.",
        "That is, as the preliminary stage, we investigate the effects of spelling using such existing corpus.",
