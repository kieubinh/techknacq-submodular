        "Multiple document summarization from multiple sources, i.e., several newspapers concerned with the same topic but with different publishers, is more difficult than single document summarization since it must deal with more text (in terms of numbers of characters and sentences).",
        "Moreover, it is peculiar to multiple document summarization that the summarization system must decide how much redundant information should be deleted3.",
        "In a single document, there will be few sentences with the same content.",
        "In contrast, in multiple documents with multiple sources, there will be many sentences that convey the same content with different words and phrases, or even identical sentences.",
        "Thus, a text summarization system needs to recognize such redundant sentences and reduce the redundancy in the output summary.",
        "However, we have no way of measuring the effectiveness of such redundancy in the corpora for DUC and TSC2.",
        "Key data in TSC2 was given as abstracts (free summaries) whose number of characters was less than a fixed number and, thus, it is difficult to use for repeated or automatic evaluation, and for the extraction of important sentences.",
        "Moreover, in DUC, where most of the key data were abstracts whose number of words was less than a",
        "fixed number, the situation was the same as TSC2.",
        "At DUC 2002, extracts (important sentences) were used, and this allowed us to evaluate sentence extraction.",
        "However, it is not possible to measure the effectiveness of redundant sentences reduction since the corpus was not annotated to show sentence with same content.",
        "In addition, this is the same even if we use the SummBank corpus (Radev et al., 2003).",
        "In any case, because many of the current summarization systems for multiple documents are based on sentence extraction, we believe these corpora to be unsuitable as sets of documents for evaluation.",
        "On this basis, in TSC3, we assumed that the process of multiple document summarization consists of the following three steps, and we produce a corpus for the evaluation of the system at each of the three steps4.",
