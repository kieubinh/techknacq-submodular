        "Such a discussion may require an urgent response and a user’s lack of contribution may be a bottleneck in some matter being resolved.",
        "Such a scenario is seems quite familiar and intuitively, one would expect that better solutions to presenting the contents of the email inbox might be useful in facilitating a timely reply to a missed email discussion.",
        "One such solution might be a summary of that very email discussion.",
        "However, it would be much more useful if the summary did not just tell the user what the thread is about.",
        "Such information might be easily obtained from the subject line, or if not, a conventional off-the-shelf summarizer might provide the gist of the thread quite easily.",
        "However, in contrast to a conventional sentence extraction summary in Figure 1, the ideal summary ought to provide sufficient information about the current state-of-affairs of the discussion, in order to minimize any further delay in the matter being resolved.",
        "Specifically, this might include a description of the matter being discussed and the responses received so far.",
        "An example of such a summary is presented in Figure 2.",
        "In this example, it is not sufficient to know that a plaque is being designed.",
        "Crucially, the wording of the plaque is under discussion and requires feedback from the thread participants.",
        "It is not difficult to appreciate the usefulness of such a summary to avoid writing responses to older, and hence irrelevant, emails.",
        "Accordingly, we envisage that the resulting summary to be not just indicative of the thread content but informative Borko (1975).",

        "4.",
        "We just need to contact the plaque folks and ask what format they need for the logo.",
        "Issue: Let me know if you agree or disagree w/choice of plaque and (especially) wording.",
        "We present a novel approach which identifies the main issue within the email and finds the responses to that issue within subsequent emails.",
        "Our approach uses a combination of traditional vector space techniques and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).",
        "We rely on the premise that the participants of the discussion have implicitly determined which sentence from the initiating email of the thread is most important and that we can see evidence of this inherent in the content of their respective replies.",
        "In the remainder of the paper, we provide background on email usage and our observations of discussion thread structure in Section 2 to support our basic premise.",
        "Section 3 provides a description of related work in the area.",
        "To date, use of dialogue structure has mostly been limited to finding question-answer pairs in order to extract the pairing as a whole for the sake of coherence.",

        "Whilst there was little difference between the recall values of the three oracles and the baselines, the benefit of using a more involved approach such as ours is demonstrated clearly by the gain in precision performance which will impact the usefulness of such a summary.",
        "It is also interesting to note that the performance of the oracles was achieved by simply using simple rules without any corpus training."
