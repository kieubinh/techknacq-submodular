        "During the last 10 years, TREC (Harman, 1993) allowed many researchers to evaluate their search engines and helped the field to progress.",
        "In 2000, Donna Harman studied the evolution of 2 search engines from 1993 (Harman, 2000).",
        "She showed that, after an improvement period, the performances have been almost the same for several years.",
        "This observation seems now classic: improving the heuristics or adding linguistic knowledge to a \"good\" engine does not dramatically improve its results.",
        "The problem is that even the best engines do not come up to the expectations of most users.",
        "So, if the performances do not really rise anymore, how can we rise users’ satisfaction?",
        "In fact, there are other ways to evaluate search engines than recall and precision.",
        "Time spent to find answers seems to be the most important one for the users and several papers present such an evaluation (Borlund and Ingwersen, 1998) (Järvelin and Kekäläinen, 2002).",
        "Considering the time factor, it is quite easy to improve the performances using procedures in order to help the user in his/her search.",
        "In this paper, we present the different 'browse help' features proposed to the users by Intuition, the search engine of Sinequa.",
        "First of all, we present the search engine itself (section 2).",
        "Then four types of help features are presented in section 3: conceptualisation, named entities filtering, similar documents and entity visualization.",
        "Section 4 describes the experiments done in order to evaluate the different browsing features and section 5 presents the results.",

        "Intuition, the search engine of Sinequa, is based both on deep statistics and linguistic knowledge and treatments (Loupy et al., 2003).",
        "During indexing, the documents are analysed with a part of speech tagging, and a lemmatization procedure.",
        "But the most original linguistic feature of Intuition is the use of a semantic lexicon based on the \"see also\" relation (Manigot and Pelletier, 1997).",
        "In fact, it is based on bags of words containing units linked by a common seme.",
        "For instance, the bag of words \"Wind\" contains wind, hurricane, to blow, tornado, etc.",
        "800 bags of words describe the \"Universe\".",
        "It seems very poor but it is enough for most applications.",
        "A Salton like vector space (Salton, 1983) of 800 dimensions is created with these bags of words.",
        "120,000 lemmas are represented in this space for French (a word can belong to several dimensions).",
        "During the analysis of a document, the vector of each term is added to the others in order to have a document representation in this space.",
        "This analysis allows a thematic characterization of a document.",
        "Secondly, it increases both precision and recall.",
        "When a query is submitted to Intuition, two searches are made in parallel.",
        "The first one is the standard search of documents containing the words (lemmas) of the query or synonyms.",
        "The second one searches for documents with similar subjects that are having a close vector.",
        "Each document of the corpus has two scores and they are merged according to a user defined heuristic.",
        "The advantage of such an approach is that the first documents retrieved not only contain the words of the query but are also closely related to the subject of the query.",
