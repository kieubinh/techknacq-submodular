        "New words such as person names, organization names, technical terms, etc.",
        "appear frequently.",
        "In order for a machine translation system to translate these new words correctly, its bilingual lexicon needs to be constantly updated with new word translations.",
        "Much research has been done on using parallel corpora to learn bilingual lexicons (Melamed, 1997; Moore, 2003).",
        "But parallel corpora are scarce resources, especially for uncommon language pairs.",
        "Comparable corpora refer to texts that are not direct translation but are about the same topic.",
        "For example, various news agencies report major world events in different languages, and such news documents form a readily available source of comparable corpora.",
        "Being more readily available, comparable corpora are thus more suitable than parallel corpora for the task of acquiring new word translations, although relatively less research has been done in the past on comparable corpora.",
        "Previous research efforts on acquiring translations from comparable corpora include (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999).",
        "When translating a word w, two sources of information can be used to determine its translation: the word w itself and the surrounding words in the neighborhood (i.e., the context) of w. Most previous research only considers one of the two sources of information, but not both.",
        "For example, the work of (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002a; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002b; Knight and Graehl, 1998) used the pronunciation of w in translation.",
        "On the other hand, the work of (Cao and Li, 2002; Fung and Yee, 1998; Koehn and Knight, 2002; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999) used the context of w to locate its translation in a second language.",
        "In this paper, we propose a new approach for the task of mining new word translations from comparable corpora, by combining both context and transliteration information.",
        "Since both sources of information are complementary, the accuracy of our combined approach is better than the accuracy of using just context or transliteration information alone.",
        "We fully implemented our method and tested it on Chinese-English comparable corpora.",
        "We translated Chinese words into English.",
        "That is, Chinese is the source language and English is the target language.",
        "We achieved encouraging results.",
        "While we have only tested our method on Chinese-English comparable corpora, our method is general and applicable to other language pairs."

        "The work of (Fung and Yee, 1998; Rapp, 1995; Rapp, 1999) noted that if an English word e is the translation of a Chinese word c, then the contexts of the two words are similar.",
        "We could view this as a document retrieval problem.",
        "The context (i.e., the surrounding words) of c is viewed as a query.",
        "The context of each candidate translation e' is viewed as a document.",
        "Since the context of the correct translation e is similar to the context of c, we are likely to retrieve the context of e when we use the context of c as the query and try to retrieve the most similar document.",
        "We employ the language modeling approach (Ng, 2000; Ponte and Croft, 1998) for this retrieval problem.",
        "More details are given in Section 3.",
        "On the other hand, when we only look at the word w itself, we can rely on the pronunciation of w to locate its translation.",
        "We use a variant of the machine transliteration method proposed by (Knight and Graehl, 1998).",
        "More details are given in Section 4.",
        "Each of the two individual methods provides a ranked list of candidate words, associating with each candidate a score estimated by the particular method.",
        "If a word e in English is indeed the translation of a word c in Chinese, then we would expect e to be ranked very high in both lists in general.",
        "Specifically, our combination method is as follows: we examine the top M words in both lists and find e1, e2,..., ek that appear in top M positions in both lists.",
        "We then rank these words e1 , e2,..., ek according to the average of their rank positions in the two lists.",
        "The candidate ei that is ranked the highest according to the average rank is taken to be the correct translation and is output.",
        "If no words appear within the top M positions in both lists, then no translation is output.",
        "Since we are using comparable corpora, it is possible that the translation of a new word does not exist in the target corpus.",
        "In particular, our experiment was conducted on comparable corpora that are not very closely related and as such, most of the Chinese words have no translations in the English target corpus."

        "For our task, the query is C(c) , the context (i.e., the surrounding words) of a Chinese word c. Each C(e) , the context of an English word e, is considered as a document in IR.",
        "If an English word e is the translation of a Chinese word c, they will have similar contexts.",
        "So we use the query C(c) to retrieve a document C(e) that best matches the query.",
        "The English word e* corresponding to that document C(e*) is the translation of c .",

        "The language modeling approach to IR has been shown to give superior retrieval performance (Ponte & Croft, 98; Ng, 2000), compared with traditional vector space model, and we adopt this approach in our current work.",
        "To estimate P(Q |D) , we use the approach of (Ng, 2000).",

        "Translation by transliteration",
        "For the transliteration model, we use a modified model of (Knight and Graehl, 1998) and (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002b).",
        "Knight and Graehl (1998) proposed a probabilistic model for machine transliteration.",
        "In this model, a word in the target language (i.e., English in our task) is written and pronounced.",
        "This pronunciation is converted to source language pronunciation and then to source language word (i.e., Chinese in our task).",
        "Al-Onaizan and Knight (2002b) suggested that pronunciation can be skipped and the target language letters can be mapped directly to source language letters.",
        "Pinyin is the standard Romanization system of Chinese characters.",
        "It is phonetic-based.",
        "For transliteration, we estimate P(e |c) as follows:",
        "First, each Chinese character in a Chinese word c is converted to pinyin form.",
        "Then we sum over all the alignments that this pinyin form of c can map to an English word e. For each possible alignment, we calculate the probability by taking the product of each mapping.",
        "pi is the ith syllable of pinyin, 1ia is the English letter sequence that the ith pinyin syllable maps to in the particular alignment a.",
        "Since most Chinese characters have only one pronunciation and hence one pinyin form, we assume that Chinese character-to-pinyin mapping is one-to-one to simplify the problem.",
        "We use the expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to generate mapping probabilities from pinyin syllables to English letter sequences.",
        "To reduce the search space, we limit the number of English letters that each pinyin syllable can map to as 0, 1, or 2.",
        "Also we do not allow cross mappings.",
        "That is, if an English letter sequence e1 precedes another English letter sequence e2 in an English word, then the pinyin syllable mapped to e1 must precede the pinyin syllable mapped to e2 .",
        "Our method differs from (Knight and Graehl, 1998) and (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002b) in that our method does not generate candidates but only estimates P(e |c) for candidates e appearing in the English corpus.",
        "Another difference is that our method estimates P (e |c) directly, instead of P (c |e) and P(e) ."
