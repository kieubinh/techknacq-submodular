        "Given a source language sentence S, a statistical machine translation (SMT) model translates it by finding the target language sentence T such that the probability P(T|S) is maximized.",
        "In word-based models, such as IBM Model 1-5 (Brown et al. 1993), the probability P(T|S) is decomposed into statistical parameters involving words.",
        "There have been many recent proposals to improve translation quality by decomposing P(T|S) into probabilities involving phrases.",
        "Phrase-based SMT approaches can be classified into two categories.",
        "One type of approach works with parse trees.",
        "In (Yamada&Knight 2001), for example, the translation model applies three operations (re-order, insert, and translate) to an English parse tree to produce its Chinese translation.",
        "A parallel corpus of English parse trees and Chinese sentences are used to obtain the probabilities of the operations.",
        "In the second type of phrase-based SMT models, phrases are defined as a block in a word aligned corpus such that words within the block are aligned with words inside the block (Och et al. 1999, Marcu&Wong 2002).",
        "This definition will treat as phrases many word sequences that are not constituents in parse trees.",
        "This may look linguistically counter-intuitive.",
        "However, (Koehn et al. 2003) found that it is actually harmful to restrict phrases to constituents in parse trees, because the restriction would cause the system to miss many reliable translations, such as the correspondence between “there is” in English and “es gibt” (“it gives”) in German.",
        "In this paper, we present a path-based transfer model for machine translation.",
        "The model is trained with a word-aligned parallel corpus where the source language side consists of dependency trees.",
        "The training algorithm extracts a set of paths from the dependency trees and determines the translations of the paths using the word alignments.",
        "The result of the training process is a set of rules for translating paths in the source language into tree fragments in the target language with certain probabilities.",
        "To translate a sentence, we first parse it and extract a set of paths from its dependency tree S. We then find a set of transfer rules that cover S and produce a set of tree fragments obtained to form a tree T* such that T*=argmaxT P(T|S).",
        "The output sentence can then simply be read off T*.",
        "In the remainder of the paper, we first define paths in dependency trees.",
        "We then describe an algorithm for learning transfer rules and their probabilities.",
        "The translation algorithm is presented in Section 4.",
        "Experimental result is presented in Section 5.",
