        "Decoding is one of the three fundamental problems in classical SMT (translation model and language model being the other two) as proposed by IBM in the early 1990’s (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "In the decoding problem we are given the language and translation models and a source language sentence and are asked to find the most probable translation for the sentence.",
        "Decoding is a discrete optimization problem whose search space is prohibitively large.",
        "The challenge is, therefore, in devising a scheme to efficiently search the solution space for the solution.",
        "Decoding is known to belong to a class of computational problems popularly known as NP-hard problems (Knight, 1999).",
        "NP-hard problems are known to be computationally hard and have eluded polynomial time algorithms (Garey and Johnson, 1979).",
        "The first algorithms for the decoding problem were based on what is known among the speech recognition community as stack-based search (Jelinek, 1969).",
        "The original IBM solution to the decoding problem employed a restricted stack-based search (Berger et al., 1996).",
        "This idea was further explored by Wang and Waibel (Wang and Waibel, 1997) who developed a faster stack-based search algorithm.",
        "In perhaps the first work on the computational complexity of Decoding, Kevin Knight showed that the problem is closely related to the more famous Traveling Salesman problem (TSP).",
        "Independently, Christoph Tillman adapted the Held-Karp dynamic programming algorithm for TSP (Held and Karp, 1962) to Decoding (Tillman, 2001).",
        "The original Held-Karp algorithm for TSP is an exponential time dynamic programming algorithm and Tillman’s adaptation to Decoding has a prohibitive complexity of O (l3m22m) ≈ O (m52m) (where m and l are the lengths of the source and target sentences respectively).",
        "Tillman and Ney showed how to improve the complexity of the Held-Karp algorithm for restricted word reordering and gave a O (l3m4) ≈ O (m7) algorithm for French-English translation (Tillman and Ney, 2000).",
        "An optimal decoder based on the well-known A* heuristic was implemented and benchmarked in (Och et al., 2001).",
        "Since optimal solution can not be computed for practical problem instances in a reasonable amount of time, much of recent work has focused on good quality suboptimal solutions.",
        "An O (m6) greedy search algorithm was developed (Ger-mann et al., 2003) whose complexity was reduced further to O (m2) (Germann, 2003).",
        "In this paper, we propose an algorithmic framework for solving the decoding problem and show that several efficient decoding algorithms can be derived from the techniques developed in the framework.",
        "We model the search problem as an alternating search problem.",
        "The search, therefore, alternates between two subproblems, both of which are much easier to solve in practice.",
        "By breaking the decoding problem into two simpler search problems, we are able to provide handles for solving the problem efficiently.",
        "The solutions of the subproblems can be combined easily to arrive at a solution for the original problem.",
        "The first subproblem fixes an alignment and seeks the best translation with that alignment.",
        "Starting with an initial alignment between the source sentence and its translation, the second subproblem asks for an improved alignment.",
        "We show that both of these problems are easy to solve and provide efficient solutions for them.",
        "In an iterative search for a local optimal solution, we alternate between the two algorithms and refine our solution.",
        "The algorithmic framework provides handles for solving the decoding problem at several levels of complexity.",
        "At one extreme, the framework yields an algorithm for solving the decoding problem optimally.",
        "At the other extreme, it yields a provably linear time algorithm for finding suboptimal solutions to the problem.",
        "We show that the algorithmic handles provided by our framework can be employed to develop a very fast decoding algorithm which finds good quality translations.",
        "Our fast suboptimal search algorithms can translate sentences that are 50 words long in about 5 seconds on a simple computing facility.",
        "The rest of the paper is devoted to the development and discussion of our framework.",
        "We start with a mathematical formulation of the decoding problem (Section 2).",
        "We then develop the alternating search paradigm and use it to develop several decoding algorithms (Section 3).",
