        "Recent researches in NLP have promoted a now widely-accepted shallow-based analysis framework that has proven to be efficient for a number of tasks, including information extraction and question answering.",
        "However, this approach often leads to oversimplified solutions to complex problems.",
        "For example, the bag-of-words approach fails in examples such as: Lee Harvey Oswald, the gunman who assassinated President John F. Kennedy, was later shot and killed by Jack Ruby (example taken from Lin and Katz, 2003).",
        "In this case, it is essential to keep track of the argument structure of the verb, to be able to infer that it is Jack Ruby and not John Kennedy who is the murderer of Lee Harvey Oswald.",
        "A wrong result would be obtained considering too shallow analysis techniques or heuristics, based for example of the proximity between two person names in the sentence.",
        "Several studies have recently proposed some approaches based on the redundancy of the web to acquire extraction patterns and semantic structures.",
        "However, these methods cannot be applied to medium size corpora.",
        "Moreover, existing structured knowledge contained in dictionaries, thesauri or semantic networks can boost the learning process by providing clear intuition over text units.",
        "In this paper, we propose a knowledge rich approach to paraphrase acquisition.",
        "We will firstly describe some related work for the acquisition of knowledge, especially paraphrases, from texts.",
        "We then describe how semantic similarity between words can be inferred from large semantic networks.",
        "We present an acquisition process, in which the semantic network is projected on the corpus to derive extraction patterns.",
        "This mechanism can be seen as a dynamic lexical tuning of information contained in the semantic network in order to generate paraphrases of an original pattern.",
        "In the last section, we propose an evaluation and some perspectives."

        "Different measures have been proposed, which are not easy to evaluate (see (Lin and Pantel, 2002) for proposals).",
        "The methods proposed so far are automatic or manual and generally imply the evaluation of word clusters in different contexts (a word cluster is close to another one if the words it contains are interchangeable in some linguistic contexts).",

        "All the algorithms they examine are based on the hypernym-hyponym relation which structures the classification of clusters inside Wordnet (the synsets).",
        "They sometimes obtain unclear conclusions about the reason of the performances of the different algorithms (for example, comparing Jiang and ConrathÕs measure (1997) with LinÕs one (1998): ÒIt remains unclear, however, just why it performed so much better than LinÕs measure, which is but a different arithmetic combination of the same termsÓ).",
        "However, the authors emphases on the fact that the use of the sole hyponym relation is insufficient to capture the complexity of meaning: ÒNonetheless, it remains a strong intuition that hyponymy is only one part of semantic relatedness; meronymy, such as wheelÐcar, is most definitely an indicator of semantic relatedness, and, a fortiori, semantic relatedness can arise from little more than common or stereotypical associations or statistical co-occurrence in real life (for example, penguinÐAntarctica; birthdayÐcandle; sleepÐpajamas)Ó.",
        "In this paper, we propose to use the semantic distance described in (Dutoit et al., 2002) which is based on a knowledge-rich semantic net encoding a large variety of semantic relationships between set of words, including meronymy and stereotypical associations.",
        "The semantic distance between two words A and B is based on the notion of nearest common ancestors (NCA) between A and B. NCA is defined as the set of nodes that are daughters of c (A) c (B) and that are not",
