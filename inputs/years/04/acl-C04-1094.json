        "The fundamental question addressed in this article is: can syntactic information be used to find the key concepts of a set of documents?",
        "We will provide empirical answers to this question in a multi-document summarization environment.",
        "The identification of key terms out of a set of documents is a common problem in information access applications and, in particular, in text summarization: a fragment containing one or more key concepts can be a good candidate to be part of a summary.",
        "In single-document summarization, key terms are usually obtained from the document title or heading (Edmundson, 1969; Preston, 1994; Kupiec et al., 1995).",
        "In multi-document summarization, however, some processing is needed to identify key concepts (Lin and Hovy, 2002; Kraaij et al., 2002; Schlesinger et al., 2002).",
        "Most approaches are based on statistical criteria.",
        "Criteria to elaborate a manual summary depend, by and large, on the user interpretation of both the information need and the content of documents.",
        "This is why this task has also been attempted from an interactive perspective (Boguraev et al., 1998; Buyukkokten et al., 1999; Neff and Cooper, 1999; Jones et al., 2002; Leuski et al., 2003).",
        "A standard feature of such interactive summarization assistants is that they offer a list of relevant terms (automatically extracted from the documents) which the user may select to decide or refine the focus of the summary.",
        "Our hypothesis is that the key concepts of a document set will tend to appear in certain syntactic functions along the sentences and clauses of the texts.",
        "To confirm this hypothesis, we have used a test bed with manually produced summaries to study:",
        "• which are the most likely syntactic functions for the key concepts manually identified in the document sets.",
        "• whether this information can be used to automatically extract the relevant terms from a set of documents, as compared to standard statistical term weights.",
        "Our reference corpus is a set of 72 lists of key concepts, manually elaborated by 9 subjects on 8 different topics, with 100 documents per topic.",
        "It was built to study Information Synthesis tasks (Amigo et al., 2004) and it is, to the best of our knowledge, the multi-document summarization testbed with a largest number of documents per topic.",
        "This feature enables us to obtain reliable statistics on term occurrences and prominent syntactic functions.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we review the main approaches to the evaluation of automatically extracted key concepts for summarization.",
        "In Section 3 we describe the creation of the reference corpus.",
        "In Section 4 we study the correlation between key concepts and syntactic function in texts, and in Section 5 we discuss the experimental results of syntactic function as a predictor to extract key concepts.",
        "Finally, in Section 6 we draw some conclusions.",
        "2 Evaluation of automatically extracted key concepts It is necessary, in the context of an interactive summarization system, to measure the quality of the terms suggested by the system, i.e., to what extent they are related to the key topics of the document set.",
        "(Lin and Hovy, 1997) compared different strategies to generate lists of relevant terms for summarization using Topic Signatures.",
        "The evaluation was extrinsic, comparing the quality of the summaries generated by a system using different term lists as input.",
        "The results, however, cannot be directly extrapolated to interactive summarization systems, because the evaluation does not consider how informative terms are for a user.",
        "From an interactive point of view, the evaluation of term extraction approaches can be done, at least, in two ways:",
        "• Evaluating the summaries produced in the interactive summarization process.",
        "This option is difficult to implement (how do we evaluate a human produced summary?",
        "What is the reference gold standard?)",
        "and, in any case, it is too costly: every alternative approach would require at least a few additional subjects performing the summarization task.",
        "• Comparing automatically generated term lists with manually generated lists of key concepts.",
        "For instance, (Jones et al., 2002) describes a process of supervised learning of key concepts from a training corpus of manually generated lists of phrases associated to a single document.",
        "We will, therefore, use the second approach, evaluating the quality of automatically generated term lists by comparing them to lists of key concepts which are generated by human subjects after a multi-document summarization process."
