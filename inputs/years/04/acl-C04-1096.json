        "In the last two decades, many researchers have studied the generation of referring expressions to enable computers to communicate with humans about concrete objects in the world.",
        "For that purpose, most past work (Appelt, 1985; Dale and Haddock, 1991; Dale, 1992; Dale and Reiter, 1995; Heeman and Hirst, 1995; Horacek, 1997; Krahmer and Theune, 2002; van Deemter, 2002; Krahmer et al., 2003) makes use of attributes of an intended object (the target) and binary relations between the target and others (distractors) to distinguish the target from distractors.",
        "Therefore, these methods cannot generate proper referring expressions in situations where no significant surface difference exists between the target and distractors, and no binary relation is useful to distinguish the target.",
        "Here, a proper referring expression means a concise and natural linguistic expression enabling hearers to distinguish the target from distractors.",
        "Meguro ˆOokayama 2-12-1, Tokyo 152-8552, Japan take@ cl.cs.titech.ac .jp For example, consider indicating object b to person P in the situation shown in Figure 1.",
        "Note that person P does not share the label information such as a and b with the speaker.",
        "Because object b is not distinguishable from objects a or c by means of their appearance, one would try to use a binary relation between object b and the table, i.e., “A ball to the right of the table”.",
        "1 However, “to the right of” is not a discriminatory relation, for objects a and c are also located to the right of the table.",
        "Using a and c as a reference object instead of the table does not make sense, since a and c cannot be uniquely identified because of the same reason that b cannot be identified.",
        "Such situations have never drawn much attention, but can occur easily and frequently in some domains such as object arrangement (Tanaka et al., 2004).",
        "van der Sluis and Krahmer (2000) proposed using gestures such as pointing in situations like those shown in Figure 1.",
        "However, pointing and gazing are not always available depending on the positional relation between the speaker and the hearer.",
        "In the situation shown in Figure 1, a speaker can indicate object b to person P with a simple expression “the front ball” without using any gesture.",
        "In order to generate such an expression, one must be able to recognize the salient perceptual group of the objects and use the nary relative relations in the group.",
        "2 In this paper, we propose a method of generat",
        "ing referring expressions that utilizes nary relations among members of a group.",
        "Our method recognizes groups by using Th´orisson’s algorithm (Th´orisson, 1994).",
        "As the first step of our research project, we deal with the limited situations where only homogeneous objects are randomly arranged (see Figure 2).",
        "Therefore, we handle positional nary relation only, and other types of nary relation such as size, e.g., “the biggest one”, are not mentioned.",
        "Speakers often refer to multiple groups in the course of referring to the target.",
        "In these cases, we can observe two types of relations: the intra-group relation such as “the front two among the five near the desk”, and the intergroup relation such as “the two to the right of the five”.",
        "We define that a sub-sumption relation between two groups is an intra-group relation.",
        "In what follows, Section 2 explains the experiments conducted to collect expressions in which perceptual groups are used.",
        "The proposed method is described and evaluated in Section 3.",
        "In Section 4, we examine a possibility to predict the adequacy of an expression in terms of perceptual grouping.",
        "Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 5. to nine objects were arranged manually so that the objects distributes non-uniformly.",
        "An example of images presented to subjects is shown in Figure 2.",
        "Labels a, ... , f, x in the image are assigned for purposes of illustration and are not assigned in the actual images presented to the subjects.",
        "Each subject was asked to describe a command so that the person in the image picks a target object that is enclosed with dotted lines.",
        "When a subject could not think of a proper expression, she/he was allowed to abandon that arrangement and proceed to the next one.",

        "The performance of the algorithm was evaluated by 23 subjects and it generated promising results.",
        "In the following, we look at future work to be done.",
        "Recognizing salient geometric formations: Th´orisson’s algorithm (Th´orisson, 1994) cannot recognize a linear arrangement of objects as a group, although such arrangements are quite salient for humans.",
        "This is one of the reasons for the disconformity between the evaluations given by the algorithm and those of the humans subjects.",
        "We can enumerate most of such geometric arrangements salient for human subject by referring to geometric terms found in lexicons and thesauri such as ”line”, ”circle”, ”square” and so on.",
        "Th´orisson’s algorithm should be extended to recognize these arrangements.",
        "Using relations other than positional relations: In this paper, we focused on positional relations of perceptual groups.",
        "Other relations such as degree of color and size should be treated in the same manner.",
        "Th´orisson’s original algorithm (Th´orisson, 1994) takes into account these relations as well as positional relations of objects when calculating similarity between objects to generate groups.",
        "However, if we generate groups using multiple relations simultaneously, the assumption used in Step 1 of our algorithm that any pair of groups in an output list do not intersect without a subsumption relation cannot be held.",
        "Therefore, the mechanism generating SOG representations (Step 2 in Section 3.1) must be reconsidered.",
        "Resolving reference frames and differences of perspective: We assumed that all participants in a conversation shared the same reference frame.",
        "However, when we apply our method to conversational agent systems, e.g., (Cavazza et al., 2002; Tanaka et al., 2004), reference frames must be properly determined each time to generate referring expressions.",
        "Although there are many studies concerning reference frames, e.g., (Clark, 1973; Her-skovits, 1986; Levinson, 2003), little attention has been paid to how reference frames are determined in terms of the perceptual groups and their elements.",
        "In addition to reference frames, differences of perspective also have to be taken into account to produce proper referring expressions since humans often view spatial relations between objects in a 3-dimensional space by projecting them on a 2 dimensional plane.",
        "In the experiments, we presented the subjects with 2-dimensional bird’s-eye images.",
        "The result might have been different if we had used 3-dimensional images instead, because the projection changes the sizes of objects and spatial relations among them.",
        "Integration with conventional methods: In this paper, we focused on a limited situation where inherent attributes of objects do not serve any identifying function, but this is not the case in general.",
        "An algorithm integrating conventional attribute-based methods and the proposed method should be formulated to achieve the end goal.",
        "A possible direction would be to enhance the algorithm proposed by Krahmer et al.",
        "(Krahmer et al., 2003).",
        "They formalize an object arrangement (scene) as a labeled directed graph in which vertices model objects and edges model attributes and binary relations, and regard content selection as a subgraph construction problem.",
        "Their algorithm performs searches directed by a cost function on a graph to find a unique subgraph.",
        "If we consider a perceptual group as an ordinary object as shown in Figure 4, their algorithm is applicable.",
        "It will be able to handle not only intra-group relations (e.g., the edges with labels “front”, “middle”, and “back” in Figure 4) but also intergroup relations (e.g., the edge from “Group 1” to “Table” in Figure 4).",
        "However, introducing perceptual groups as vertices makes it difficult to design the cost function.",
        "A well-designed cost function is indispensable for generating concise and comprehensible expressions.",
