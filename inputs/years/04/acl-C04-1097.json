        "(2001) and Reiter and Dale (2000)).",
        "In contrast, the Nitrogen (Langkilde and Knight, 1998a, 1998b) system employs a word n-gram language model to choose among a large set of word sequence candidates which vary in constituent order, word order, lexical choice, and morphological inflection.",
        "Nitrogen’s model does not take into consideration any non-surface linguistic features available during realization.",
        "The Fergus system (Bangalore and Rambow, 2000) employs a statistical tree model to select probable trees and a word n-gram model to rank the string candidates generated from the best trees.",
        "Like Nitrogen, the HALogen system (Langkilde, 2000; Langkilde-Geary, 2002a, 2002b) uses word n-grams, but it extracts the best-scoring surface realizations efficiently from a packed forest by constraining the search first within the scope of each constituent.",
        "Our research is carried out within the Amalgam broad coverage sentence realization system.",
        "Amalgam generates sentence strings from abstract predicate-argument structures (Figure 1), using a pipeline of stages, many of which employ machine-learned models to predict where to perform specific linguistic operations based on the linguistic context (Corston-Oliver et al., 2002; Gamon et al., 2002a, 2002b; Smets et al., 2003).",
        "Amalgam has an explicit ordering stage that determines the order of constituents and their daughters.",
        "The input for this stage is an unordered tree of constituents; the output is an ordered tree of constituents or a ranked list of such trees.",
        "For ordering, Amalgam leverages tree constituent structure and, importantly, features of those constituents and the surrounding context.",
        "By separately establishing order within constituents, Amalgam heavily constrains the possible alternatives in later stages of the realization process.",
        "The design allows for interaction between ordering choices and other realization decisions, such as lexical choice (not considered in the present work), through score combinations from distinct Amalgam pipeline stages.",
        "Most previous research into the problem of establishing order for sentence realization has focused on English, a language with fairly strict word and constituent order.",
        "In the experiments described here we first focus on German and French which present novel challenges.1 We also describe an English experiment involving data from the Penn Treebank.",
        "Our ultimate goal is to develop a model that handles all ordering phenomena in a unified and elegant way across typologically diverse languages.",

        "As equation (1) indicates, we can limit our search to those trees π which are alternative orderings of the given tree ρ .",
        "Interdependencies among ordering decisions within different constituents (e.g., for achieving parallelism) make the global sentence ordering problem challenging and are certainly worth investigating in future work.",
        "For the present, we constrain the possible model types considered here by assuming that the ordering of any constituent is independent of the ordering within other constituents in the tree, including its daughters; consequently,",
        "Given this independence assumption, the only possible ordered trees are trees built with non-terminal constituents computed as follows: for each B ∈ constits(ρ) ,",
        "In fact, we can further constrain our search for the best ordering of each unordered constituent B, since C’s head must match B’s head:",
        "Thus, we have reduced the problem to finding the best ordering of each constituent of the unordered tree.",
        "Now if we wish to condition on some feature x = f (ρ) , then we must first predict it as follows:",
        "If x is truly a feature of ρ and does not depend on any particular ordering of any constituent in ρ, then P(x ) is constant, and we do not need to compute it in practice.",
