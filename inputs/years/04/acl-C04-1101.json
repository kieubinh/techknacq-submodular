        "As for relating two events adjoined by a temporal/causal connective, Hornstein (Hornstein, 1990) proposed a neo-Reichenbach structure which organized the BTSs into a Complex Tense Structure (CTS).",
        "It has been argued that all sentences containing a matrix and an adjunct clause were subject to linguistic constraints on tense structure regardless of the lexical words included in the sentence.",
        "Generally, constraints were used to support syntactic disambiguation (Brent, 1990) or to generate acceptable sentences (Dorr, 2002).",
        "In a given CTS, a past perfect clause should precede the event described by a simple past clause.",
        "However, the order of two events in CTS does not necessarily correspond to the order imposed by the interpretation of the connective (Dorr, 2002).",
        "Temporal/casual connective, such as “after”, “before” or “because”, can supply explicit information about the temporal ordering of events.",
        "Passonneau (Passonneau, 1988), Brent (Brent, 1990 and Sing (Sing, 1997) determined intra-sentential relations by accounting for temporal or causal connectives.",
        "Dorr and Gaast-erland (Dorr, 2002), on the other hand, studied how to generate the sentences which reflect event temporal relations by selecting proper connecting words.",
        "However, temporal connectives can be ambiguous.",
        "For instance, a “when” clause permits many possible temporal relations.",
        "Several researchers have developed the models that incorporated aspectual types (such as those distinct from states, processes and events) to interpret temporal relations between clauses connected with “when”.",
        "Moens and Steedmen (Moens, 1988) developed a tripartite structure of events2, and emphasized it was the notion of causation and consequence that played a central role in defining temporal relations of events.",
        "Webber (Webber, 1988) improved upon the above work by specifying rules for how events are related to one another in a discourse and Sing and Sing defined semantic constraints through which events can be related (Sing, 1997).",
        "The importance of aspectual information in retrieving proper aspects and connectives for sentence generation was also recognized by Dorr and Gaasterland (Dorr, 2002).",
        "Some literature claimed that discourse structures suggested temporal relations.",
        "Lascarides and Asher (Lascarides, 1991) investigated various contextual effects on rhetorical relations (such as narration, elaboration, explanation, background and result).",
        "They corresponded each of the discourse relations to a kind of temporal relation.",

        "A hierarchy of rhetorical and temporal relations was adopted so that they could mutually constrain each other.",
