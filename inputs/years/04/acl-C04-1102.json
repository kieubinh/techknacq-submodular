        "This paper discusses a detection method for transliterated orthographic variants of foreign words.",
        "Transliteration of foreign words causes orthographic variants because there are several conditions required for transliterating.",
        "One may person transliterate to approximate pronunciation, whereas another one may conduct transliteration based on spelling.",
        "For example, the English word report can be transliterated into two Japanese words, “ 9 ✁ ✄✆ (ripooto)” and “ ✞ ✁ ✄✆ (re-pooto).” The former “ripooto” is based on an approximation of its pronunciation, while “repooto” is transliterated from its spelling.",
        "In addition, several source languages can be transliterated.",
        "For instance, the English word virus corresponds to the Japanese words: “✠ ✡ ☞ ✍ (uirusu)” from Latin, “ ✏ ✄☞ ✍ (biirusu)” and “ ☞ ✍ (viirusu)” from German, while “✖ ✍ (bairasu)” or “ ✒ ✙ ✡ ✗ ✡ ✗ ✍ (vairasu)” are also possible as transliterations that approximate the English pronunciation.",
        "Moreover, some foreign words end up in different forms in Japanese because of variation in English pronunciation; e.g., between British and American.",
        "For example, the English word body corresponds to two words: “✚ ✛ ✓ (bodi)” from British and“ ✖ ✛ ✓ (badi)” from American.",
        "One may think that if back-transliteration were done precisely, those variants would be back-transliterated into one word, and they would be recognized as variants.",
        "However, back-transliteration is known to be a very difficult task(Knight and Graehl, 1997).",
        "Not only Japanese but any language that has a phonetic spelling has this problem of transliterated orthographic variants.",
        "For example, English has variants for a Chinese proper noun as “Shan-haiguan,” “Shanhaikwan,” or “Shanhaikuan.” Nowadays, it is well recognized that orthographic variant correction is an important processing step for achieving high performance in natural language processing.",
        "In order to achieve robust and reliable processing, we have to use many language resources: many types of corpora, dictionaries, thesauri, and so on.",
        "Orthographic variants cause many mismatches at any stage of natural language processing.",
        "In addition, not only orthographic variants, but also misspelled words tend to slip into a corpus.",
        "These words boost the perplexity of the corpus, and worsen the data sparseness problem.",
        "To date, several studies have tried to cope with this orthographic variant problem; however, they considered the problem in a relatively clean corpus that was well organized by natives of the target language.",
        "As with orthographic variants, misspelled words cause mismatches, and we have to detect not only predictable orthographic variants but also misspelled variants.",
        "In addition, it is very hard to detect orthographic variants caused by misspelling with ordinary rule-based methods, because preparing such rules for misspellings that might be written is an unrealistic approach.",
        "If a corpus includes texts that were written by non-natives of the language, orthographic variants that are misspelled will likely be increased because non-natives have a limited vocabulary in that language.",
        "We propose a robust detection method for transliterated orthographic variants in a Japanese corpus.",
        "The method is marked by a combination of different types of similarities.",
        "It is not such a difficult task to detect simple misspelled words, because a large dictionary would tell us whether the word is common as long as we prepare a large enough dictionary.",
        "However, it often occurs that a misspelled word is recognized as a common word.",
        "For example, in English, someone may mistype “from” as “form,” and string information will tell us nothing because both words are common.",
        "Therefore, we use contextual information to detect this kind of mistyping."

      "text": [
        "Japanese features three types of characters (katakana, hiragana, and kanji (Chinese characters)).",
        "Katakana is a syllabary which is used mostly to write Western loanwords, onomatopoeic words, names of plants and animals, non-Japanese personal and place names, for emphasis, and for slang, while hiragana is an ordinary syllabary.",
        "Katakana cannot express the precise pronunciation of loanwords, because the katakana transliteration of a loanword is an attempt to approximate the pronunciation of its etymon (the foreign word from which it is derived).",
        "Thus, katakana orthography is often irregular, thus the same word may be written in multiple ways.",
        "Although there are general guidelines for loanword orthography, in practice there is considerable variation.",
        "In addition, recent years have seen an enormous increase in katakana use, not only in technical terminology, but in common daily usage.",
        "To date, several detecting methods have been proposed for English and other languages.",
        "One may think that such methods can be applied to Japanese and work well.",
        "However, most katakana characters correspond to two phonemes, and this causes several problems.",
        "Due to the correspondence between katakana characters and phonemes, it is easy to imagine that the application would require tangled procedures."

      "heading": "2.1 Romanization",
      "text": [
        "We use Japanese romanization for katakana characters to capture its pronunciation because there are several katakana characters for which the pronunciation is the same.",
        "For example, “V (possible romanization: zi/ji)” and “f (possible romanization: di/zi)” are not differentiated in pronunciation.",
        "In addition, there are several katakana expressions that have very similar pronunciations.",
        "For instance, “-f- (possible romanization: chi/ti)” in “ % 1 (ticket)” and “5- f (t’i)” in “`T-,T ,y 1 (ticket)” are similar in pronunciation and they cause these variants.",
        "Naturally we can use katakana characters to compare two strings, but employing katakana characters makes the comparing procedure cumbersome and complicated.",
        "To avoid the complicated comparing procedure for katakana expressions, we use Japanese romanization.",
        "We used a system of Japanese romanization based on ISO 3602, the romanization of which is based on the Kunreisiki system.",
        "There are two major systems for Japanese romanization.",
        "One is based on the theory of the Kunrei (Kunreisiki) system.",
        "The other one is the Hepburn system, which is widely used in English-speaking communities.",
        "The Kunreisiki system was designed to represent kana morphology accurately.",
        "For example, the katakana character “ ✓” is written as “si” in the Kunreisiki system while it is written as “shi” in the Hepburn system.",
        "In this example, the character “h” that is inserted disturbs simple matching procedures, because most katakana characters correspond to two romanized characters: a consonant and a vowel.",
        "Thus we prefer to use a romanization system based on the Kunreisiki system to make the matching procedure simple."

        "More precisely, there are two metrics of similarity: one measures the similarity between romanized strings of two words, while the other measures the similarity between raw strings of two words.",

        "Figure 4 shows the impact of the dictionary.",
        "Most of the detection errors are related to proper nouns, because there are many proper nouns that are difficult to recognize as different words, such as “ 9 – (marii, Mary)” and 9 7 (maria, Maria),” and so on.",
        "Furthermore, it is also hard to differentiate these words by their contextual vectors, because using proper nouns is independent of context.",
        "If we can precisely detect these proper nouns written in katakana, we will be able to avoid such mis-detection.",
        "In practical situations, an enormous dictionary of proper nouns such as ENAMDICT2 would be useful for this problem.",
        "The detection method successfully detected several mistyped words, such as “7 / (buran)” for “7 7 1' 1 ✓ (buraun, Brown),”“7 �) �- - ✓ 1 5-IV (furiimonto hoteru)” for “7 1/ T ✓ � i,'T >/ (furemonto hoteru, the Fremont Hotel),” and so on.",
        "Most of the detected mistypes were vowels, because the string similarity is designed to be tolerant of mistyped vowels, and such mistypes were detected successfully.",
        "However, it seems to be a difficult task to detect mistypes with consonants, because, in ordinary situations, most mistypes related to consonants seem to be completely different words.",
        "In addition, there are several variants that are difficult to detect by this method.",
        "A typical example was shown in the Introduction: “''7 >L , (uirusu)” or “ L:f – >/ 7.",
        "(biirusu)” for the English word virus.",
        "This type of variant includes drastic changes; for instance, the ordinary edit distance between “ 1�1 A/ �7, (uirusu)” and “ L:f ~ A/ �7, (biirusu)” is four, and the similarity derived from the distance is too small (0.5) to identify it as the same word.",
        "Moreover, there is another type of orthographic variant that has changed with time.",
        "BTEC includes such an example: for the English word milkshake, both “ A/ � t -- V (mirukuseeki)” and “ � >/ ,�' ;/ _ - � (mirukusyeeku)” exist.",
        "We have to be careful of this problem when we process a corpus that has been developed for quite some time, and that includes both very old texts and new ones.",
        "A well known problem arises here: data sparseness.",
        "Orthographic variants appear less frequently than their standard expressions, and we cannot expect to have much contextual information for orthographic variants.",
        "Therefore, we always have to cope with this problem even when we process very large corpus, because the appearance of variants does not relate to the size of the corpus.",
        "The",
        "basic idea of the contextual vector seems very reasonable for words that appear frequently in a target corpus.",
        "However, experimental results showed that the contextual similarity did not work as expected because of this data sparseness.",
        "Consequently, to achieve reliable contextual similarity, we have to use sentences in which a candidate of the variant is used.",
        "On-line WWW searching seems to be good as such a resource for variant detection because WWW texts include many variants.",
        "On the other hand, there was a pair of words that have very high string similarity and contextual similarity, but they are not variants.",
        "That pair is “ ✓ r ✓'� ✓ (syanpen champagne): � 4 /'� / (sainpen sign pen /felt-tip pen),” and examples of sentences that include each word are as follows: syanpen o gurasu de kudasai.",
