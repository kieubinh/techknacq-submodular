        "It is well known that appropriate translations for a word vary with domains, and bilingual-dictionary adaptation to domains is an effective way to improve the performance of, for example, machine translation and cross-language information retrieval.",

        "It is thus desirable to develop an automated method for bilingual-dictionary adaptation.",

        "They can, naturally, be used to adapt a bilingual dictionary to domains, that is, to select corpus-relevant translation equivalents from among those provided by an existing bilingual dictionary.",
        "However, their applicability is limited because of the limited availability of large parallel corpora.",
        "Methods of bilingual-dictionary adaptation using weakly comparable corpora, i.e., a pair of two language corpora of the same domain, are therefore required.",
        "There are a number of previous works related to bilingual-dictionary adaptation using comparable corpora.",
        "Tanaka and Iwasaki's (1996) optimization method for a translation-probability matrix mainly aims at adapting a bilingual dictionary to domains.",
        "However, it is hampered by a huge amount of computation, and was only demonstrated in a small-scale experiment.",
        "Several researchers have developed a contextual-similarity-based method for extracting pairs of translation equivalents (Kaji and Aizono 1996; Fung and McKeown 1997; Fung and Yee 1998; Rapp 1999).",
        "It is computationally efficient compared to Tanaka and Iwasaki's method, but the precision of extracted translation equivalents is still not acceptable.",
        "In the light of these works, the author proposes two methods for bilingual-dictionary adaptation.",
        "The first one is a variant of the contextual-similarity-based method for extracting pairs of translation equivalents; it focuses on selecting corpus-relevant translation equivalents from among those provided by a bilingual dictionary.",
        "This selecting may be easier than finding new pairs of translation equivalents.",
        "The second one is a newly devised method using the ratio of associated words that suggest each translation equivalent; it was inspired by a research on word-sense disambiguation using bilingual comparable corpora (Kaji and Morimoto 2002).",
        "The two methods were evaluated and compared by using the EDR (Japan Electronic Dictionary Research Institute) bilingual dictionary together with Wall Street Journal and Nihon Keizai Shimbun corpora."

        "This is due to the smoothing effects of the iterative algorithm for calculating correlation between translation equivalents and associated words; namely, associated words are correlated with translation equivalents even if they fail to be aligned with their counterpart.",
        "In contrast, the CS method is much affected by the above-mentioned difficulties.",
        "All low values of contextual similarity (see Table 1) support this fact.",
        "• The RAW method assumes that a target word has more than one sense, and, therefore, it is effective for polysemous target words.",
        "In contrast, contextual similarity is ineffective for a target word with two or more senses occurring in a corpus.",
        "The context vector characterizing such a word is a composite of context vectors characterizing respective senses; therefore, the context vector characterizing any candidate translation equivalent does not show very high similarity.",
        "• The RAW method can select an appropriate number of translation equivalents for each target word by setting a threshold for the ratio of associated words.",
        "In contrast, the CS method is forced to select a fixed number of translation equivalents for all target words; it is difficult to predetermine a threshold for the contextual similarity, since the range of its values varies with target words (see Table 1).",
        "Finally, from a practical point of view, advantages of the RAW method are discussed in the following.",
        "• The RAW method selects translation equivalents contained in the comparable corpora of a domain together with evidence, i.e., representative associated words that suggest the selected translation equivalents.",
        "Accordingly, it allows lexicographers to check the appropriateness of selected translation equivalents efficiently.",
        "• The ratio of associated words can be regarded as a rough approximation of a translation probability.",
        "Accordingly, a translation equivalent can be fixed for a word, when the particular translation equivalent has an exceedingly large ratio of associated words.",
