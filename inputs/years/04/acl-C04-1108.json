        "The growth of computerized documents enables us to find relevant information easily owing to technological advances in Information Retrieval.",
        "Although it is convenient that we can obtain a great number of documents with a search engine, this situation also presents the information pollution problem: “Who is willing to take the tedious burden of reading all those text documents?” Automatic text summarization (Mani, 2001), is one solution to the problem, providing users with a condensed version of the original text.",
        "Most existing summarization systems make use of sentence or paragraph extraction, which finds significant textual segments in source documents, and compile them in a summary.",
        "After we select significant sentences as a material for a summary, we must find a proper arrangement of the sentences and edit each sentence by deleting unnecessary parts or inserting necessary expressions.",
        "Although there has been a great deal of research on extraction since the early stage of natural language processing (Luhn, 1958), research on post-processing of automatic summarization is relatively small in number.",
        "It is essential to pay attention to sentence ordering in case of multi-document summarization.",
        "Sentence position in the original document, which yields a good clue to sentence arrangement for single-document summarization, is not enough for multi-document summarization because we must consider inter-document order at the same time.",
        "In this paper we propose an approach to coherent text structuring for summarizing newspaper articles.",
        "We improve chronological ordering, which is widely used by conventional summarization system, complementing presupposed information of each sentence.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "We first review the sentence ordering problem and present our approach to generate an acceptable ordering in the light of coherence relation.",
        "The subsequent section (Section 3) addresses evaluation metrics and experiment results.",

Because a method for multi-document summarization (e.g., MMR (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998)) makes effort to acquire information coverage and refuse redundant information at the same time, it is quite natural that the method does not choose both sentence c’ and c in terms of redundancy and prefers sentence c as c’ in terms of information coverage.",

        "We search a shortest path from sentence c to sentences a and b by best-first search in order to find suitable sentences before sentence c. Given that sentence e in Figure 4 describes similar content as the precedent sentences of sentence c and is a lead sentence, we trace the shortest path from sentence c to sentences a and b via sentence e. We extend the resultant ordering to [a-b-e-c] , inserting sentence e before sentence c. Then we consider sentence d, which is not a lead sentence again (distance = 0.4).",
        "Preparing a term vector of the precedent sentences of sentence d, we search a shortest path from sentence d to sentences a, b, c, and e. The search result shows that we should leave sentence d this time because the precedent content seems to be described in sentences a, b, c, and e better than f.
