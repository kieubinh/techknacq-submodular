        "For example, the FASTUS (Appelt et al., 1996) and Proteus (Grishman, 1996) systems, which performed well for MUC-6, used handwritten rules for event patterns.",
        "The symbolic learning systems, like AutoSlog (Riloff, 1993) and CRYSTAL (Fisher et al., 1996), generated patterns automatically from specific examples (text segments) using generalization and predefined pattern templates.",
        "There are also statistical approaches (Miller et al., 1998) (Collins et al., 1998) trying to encode event patterns in statistical CFG grammars.",
        "All of these approaches assume events occur in text in certain patterns.",
        "However this assumption may not be completely correct and it limits the syntactic information considered by these approaches for finding events, such as information on global features from levels other than deep processing.",
        "This paper will show that a simple bag-of-words model can give us reliable information about event occurrence.",
        "When training data is limited, these other approaches may also be less effective in their ability to generate reliable patterns.",
        "The idea for overcoming these problems is to avoid making any prior assumption about the syntactic structure an event may assume; instead, we should consider all syntactic features in the target text and use a discriminative classifier to decide that automatically.",
        "Discriminative classifiers make no attempt to resolve the structure of the target classes.",
        "They only care about the decision boundary to separate the classes.",
        "In our case, we only need criteria to predict event elements from text using the syntactic features provided.",
        "This seems a more suitable solution for IE where training data is often sparse.",
        "This paper presents an approach that uses kernel functions to represent different levels of syntactic structure (information).",
        "With the properties of kernel functions, individual kernels can be combined freely into comprehensive kernels that cross syntactic levels.",

        "This paper describes a discriminative approach that can use syntactic clues automatically for slot filler detection.",
        "It outperformed a hand-crafted system on sparse data by considering different levels of syntactic clues.",
        "The result also shows that low level syntactic information can also come into play in finding events, thus it should not be ignored in the IE framework.",
        "For slot filler detection, several classifiers were trained to find names for each slot and there is no correlation among these classifiers.",
        "However, entity slots in events are often strongly correlated, for example the PER _IN and POST slots for management succession events.",
        "Since these classifiers take the same input and produce different results, correlation models can be used to integrate these classifiers so that the identification of slot fillers might benefit each other.",
        "It would also be interesting to experiment with the tasks that are more difficult for pattern matching, such as determining the on-the-job status property in MUC-6.",
        "Since events often span multiple sentences, another direction is to explore cross-sentence models, which is difficult for traditional approaches.",
        "For our approach it is possible to extend the kernel from one sentence to multiple sentences, taking into account the correlation between NE’s in adjacent sentences."
