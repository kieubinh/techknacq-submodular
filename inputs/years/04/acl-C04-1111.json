        "2001).",

        "The current state of the art co-occurrence model requires an estimated 10 years just to parse a 1TB corpus (see Table 1).",
        "Instead of using a syntactically motivated co-occurrence approach as above, our system uses lexico-syntactic rules.",
        "In particular, it finds lexico-POS patterns by making modifications to the basic edit distance algorithm.",
        "Once these patterns have been learnt, the algorithm for finding new is-a relations runs in O(n), where n is the number of sentences.",
        "In semantic hierarchies such as WordNet (Miller 1990), an is-a relation between two words x and y represents a subordinate relationship (i.e. x is more specific than y).",
        "Many algorithms have recently been proposed to automatically mine is-a (hypo-nym/hypernym) relations between words.",
        "Here, we focus on is-a relations that are characterized by the questions “What/Who is X?” For example, Table 2 shows a sample of 10 is-a relations discovered by the algorithms presented in this paper.",
        "In this table, we call azalea, tiramisu, and Winona Ryder instances of the respective concepts flower, dessert and actress.",
        "These kinds of is-a relations would be useful for various purposes such as ontology construction, semantic information retrieval, question answering, etc.",
        "The main contribution of this paper is a comparison of the quality of our pattern-based and co-occurrence models as a function of processing time and corpus size.",
        "Also, the paper lays a foundation for terascale acquisition of knowledge.",

        "There is a long standing need for higher quality performance in NLP systems.",
        "It is possible that semantic resources richer than WordNet will enable them to break the current quality ceilings.",
        "Both statistical and symbolic NLP systems can make use of such semantic knowledge.",
        "With the increased size of the Web, more and more training data is becoming available, and as Banko and Brill (2001) showed, even rather simple learning algorithms can perform well when given enough data.",
        "In this light, we see an interesting need to develop fast, robust, and scalable methods to mine semantic information from the Web.",
        "This paper compares and contrasts two methods for extracting is-a relations from corpora.",
        "We presented a novel pattern-based algorithm, scalable to the terascale, which outperforms its more informed syntactical co-occurrence counterpart on very small and very large data.",
        "Albeit possible to successfully apply linguistically-light but data-rich approaches to some NLP applications, merely reporting these results often fails to yield insights into the underlying theories of language at play.",
        "Our biggest challenge as we venture to the terascale is to use our new found wealth not only to build better systems, but to improve our understanding of language."
