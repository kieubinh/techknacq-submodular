        "A major problem in natural language processing (NLP) for which no satisfactory solution has been found to date is word sense disambiguation (WSD).",
        "WSD refers to the resolution of lexical semantic ambiguity and its goal is to attribute the correct sense(s) to words in a certain context.",
        "For instance machine translation, information retrieval or document extraction could all benefit from the accurate disambiguation of word senses.",
        "The WSD system for Dutch1 presented here is a corpus-based supervised algorithm combining statistical classification with various kinds of linguistic information.",
        "The intuition behind the system is that linguistic information is beneficial for WSD which means that it will improve results over purely statistical approaches.",
        "The linguistic information includes lemmas, part-of-speech (PoS), and the context around the ambiguous word.",
        "In this paper, we focus on a lemma-based approach to WSD for Dutch.",
        "So far, systems built individual classifiers for each ambiguous wordform",
        "(Hendrickx et al., 2002; Hoste et al., 2002).",
        "In the system presented here, the classifiers built for each ambiguous word are based on its lemma instead.",
        "Lemmatization allows for more compact and generalizable data by clustering all inflected forms of an ambiguous word together, an effect already commented on by Yarowsky (1994).",
        "The more inflection in a language, the more lemmatization will help to compress and generalize the data.",
        "In the case of our WSD system this means that less classifiers have to be built therefore adding up the training material available to the algorithm for each ambiguous wordform.",
        "Accuracy is expected to increase for the lemma-based model in comparison to the wordform model.",
        "The paper is structured as follows: First, we will present the dictionary-based lemmatizer for Dutch which was used to lemmatize the data, followed by a detailed explanation of the lemma-based approach adopted in our WSD system.",
        "Next, the statistical classification algorithm, namely maximum entropy, and Gaussian priors (used for smoothing purposes) are introduced.",
        "We will then proceed to describe the corpus, the corpus preparation, and the system settings.",
        "We conclude the paper with results on the Dutch SENSEVAL-2 data, their evaluation and ideas for future work."

        "Lemmatization2 is a method that can be used to reduce the number of wordforms that need to be taken into consideration, as estimation is more reliable for frequently occurring data.",
        "Lemmatization reduces all inflected forms of a word to the same lemma.",
        "The number of different lemmas in a training corpus will therefore in general be much smaller than the number of different wordforms, and the frequency of lemmas will therefore be higher than that of the corresponding individual inflected forms, which in turn suggests that probabilities can be estimated more reliably.",
        "For the experiments in this paper, we used a lemmatizer for Dutch with dictionary lookup.",
        "Dictionary information is obtained from Celex (Baayen et al., 1993), a lexical database for Dutch.",
        "Celex contains 381,292 wordforms and 124,136 lemmas for Dutch.",
        "It also contains the PoS associated with the lemmas.",
        "This information is useful for disambiguation: in those cases where a particular wordform has two (or more) possible corresponding lemmas, the one matching the PoS of the wordform is chosen.",
        "Thus, in a first step, information about wordforms, their respective lemmas and their PoS is extracted from the database.",
        "Dictionary lookup can be time consuming, especially for large dictionaries such as Celex.",
        "To guarantee fast lookup and a compact representation, the information extracted from the dictionary is stored as a finite state automaton (FSA) using Daciuk’s (2000) FSA morphology tools.3 Given a wordform, the compiled automaton provides the corresponding lemmas in time linear to the length of the input word.",
        "Contrasting this dictionary-based lemmatizer with a simple suffix stripper, such as the Dutch Porter Stemmer (Kraaij and Pohlman, 1994), our lemmatizer is more accurate, faster and more compact (see (Gaustad and Bouma, 2002) for a more elaborate description and evaluation).",
        "During the actual lemmatization procedure, the FSA encoding of the information in Celex assigns every wordform all its possible lemmas.",
        "For ambiguous wordforms, the lemma with the same PoS as the wordform in question is chosen.",
        "All wordforms that were not found in Celex are processed with a morphological guessing automaton.",
