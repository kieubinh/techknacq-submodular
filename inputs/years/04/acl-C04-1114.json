        "This seems to be an extremely huge amount but it has to be considered that there are terms in the UMLS and the resulting lexicon that are probably too special to be really useful for the translation of dialogues (e.g. “1,1,1-trichloropropene-2,3-oxide” translating to “oxido de tricloropropeno”).",
