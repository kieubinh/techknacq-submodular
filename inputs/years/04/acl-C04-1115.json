        "But, as is well known, manual compilation of such resources is a very costly procedure, and their automated construction is an important research issue.",
        "One promising possibility to speed up the lexical acquisition process is to glean the semantics of words from a corpus by adopting the cooccurrence model of word meaning.",
        "Previous research has investigated a wide range of its applications, including automatic construction of thesauri, their enrichment, acquisition of bilingual lexicons, learning of information extraction patterns, named entity classification and others..",
        "The basic idea behind the approach is that the distribution of a word across lexical contexts (other words and phrases it co-occurs with) is highly indicative of its meaning.",
        "The method represents the meaning of a word as a vector where each feature corresponds to a context and its value to the frequency of the word’s occurring in that context.",
        "Once such representation is built, machine learning techniques can be used to perform various lexical acquisition tasks, e.g. automatically classify or cluster words according to their meaning.",

        "It is therefore desirable to determine a measure of usefulness of each feature and weight it accordingly.",
        "Still, despite a wide variety of feature weighting methods existing in machine learning, these methods are poorly explored in application to lexical acquisition.",
        "There have been a few studies (e.g., Lin, 1998; Ciaramita, 2002; Alfonseca and Manandhar, 2002) where word representations are modified through this or that kind of feature weighting.",
        "But in these studies it is performed only as a standard preprocessing step on the analogy with similar tasks like text categorization, and the choice of a particular weighting procedure is seldom motivated.",

        "In machine learning, feature weighting before classification is performed with the purpose to reflect how much particular features reveal about class membership of instances.",
        "The weights of features are determined from their distribution across training classes, which is why the weighting procedure can be called supervised.",
        "In the context of word classification this procedure can be formalized as follows.",
        "Let us assume that each word n∈ N of the training set is represented as a feature vector, consisting of features f ∈ F, and that each n is assigned a class label c∈ C, i.e. ∀n∃c∈ C: nc.",
        "For each f, from its distribution across C, a certain function computes its relevance score, specific to each class.",
        "This score can be used directly as its local weight w(f,c).",
        "Alternatively, from class-specific weights of a feature, one can compute its single global weight, using some globalization policy.",
        "For example, as a global weight one can use the maximum local weight of f across all classes wglob(f)=maxc∈C w(f, c) .",
        "After the weights have been applied to the training data, a classifier is learned and evaluated on the test data.",
        "A key decision in the weighting procedure is to choose a function computing w(f,c).",
        "Such functions typically try to capture the intuition that the best features for a class are the ones that best discriminate the sets of its positive and negative examples.",
        "They determine w(f,c) from the distribution of f between c and c, attributing greater weights to those f that correlate with c or c most.",
        "In the present study we include three such functions widely used in text categorization: mutual information, information gain ratio and odds ratio.",
        "There is another view on feature scoring that it is sometimes adopted in classification tasks.",
        "According to this view, useful are those features that are shared by the largest number of positive examples of c. The purpose of emphasizing these features is to characterize the class without necessarily discriminating it from other classes.",
        "Functions embodying this view assess w(f,c) from the distribution of f across n c, giving greater weight to those f that are distributed most uniformly.",
        "Although they do not explicitly aim at underpinning differences between classes, these functions were shown to enhance text retrieval (Wilbur and Sirotkin, 1992) and text categorization (Yang and Pedersen, 1997).",
        "In this paper we experimented with term strength, a feature scoring function previously shown to be quite competitive in information retrieval.",
        "Since term strength is an unsupervised function, we develop two supervised variants of it tailoring them for the classification task."

        "It was later studied in a number of works by Yang and her colleagues (e.g., Yang and Pedersen, 1997), who found that it performs on par with best discriminative functions on the document categorization task.",
        "This method is based on the idea that most valuable features are shared by related documents.",
        "It defines the weight of a",
        "feature as the probability of finding it in some document d given that it has also appeared in the document d’, similar to d. To calculate TS for feature f, for each n we first retrieved several related words n’ using a distributional similarity measure, thus preparing a set of pairs (n, n’).",
        "The TS weight for f was then calculated as the conditional probability of f appearing in n given that f appears also in n’ (the ordering of words inside a pair is ignored):",
        "An important parameter in TS is the threshold on the similarity measure used to judge two words to be sufficiently related.",
        "Yang and Pedersen determined this threshold by first deciding how many documents can be related to a given one and then finding the average minimum similarity measure for this number of neighbors over all documents in the collection.",
        "It should be noted that TS does not make use of the information about feature-class associations and therefore is unsupervised and can be used only for global feature weighting.",
        "We introduce two supervised variants of TS, which can be applied locally: TSL1 and TSL2.",
        "The first one is different from TS in that, firstly, related words for n are looked for not in the entire training set, but within the class of n; secondly, the weight for a feature is estimated from the distribution of the feature across pairs of members of only that class: TSL1(f,c)=P(f∈n |f∈ d), with n,n'∈c (6) Thus, by weighting features using TSL1 we aim to increase similarity between members of a class and disregard possible similarities across classes.",
        "Both TS and TSL1 require computation of similarities between a large set of words and thus incur significant computational costs.",
        "We therefore tried another, much more efficient method to identify features characteristic of a class, called TSL2.",
        "As TSL1, it looks at how many members of a class share a feature.",
        "But instead of computing a set of nearest neighbors for each member, it simply uses all the words in the class as the set of related words.",
        "TSL2 is the proportion of instances which possess feature f to the total number of instances in c: TSL2(f,0=|{n∈ c |f∈ n}| {n ∈ c} Table 1 illustrates the 10 highest scored features according to five supervised functions for the class {ambulance, car, bike, coupe, jeep, motorbike, taxi, truck} (estimated from the BNC cooccurrence data described in Section 4).",
        "{ambulance, car, bike, coupe, jeep, motorbike, taxi, truck} according to MI, GR, OR, TSL1, TSL2 The examples vividly demonstrate the basic differences between the functions emphasizing discriminative features vs. those emphasizing characteristic features.",
        "The former attribute greatest weights to very rare context words, some of which seem rather informative (knock_by, climb _of, see _into), some also appear to be occasional collocates (remand_to, recover_in) or parsing mistakes (entrust_to, force_of).",
        "In contrast, the latter encourage frequent context words.",
        "Among them are those that are intuitively useful (drive, park, get_into), but also those that are too abstract (see, get, take).",
        "The inspection of the weights suggests that both feature scoring strategies are able to identify different potentially useful features, but at the same time often attribute great relevance to quite non-informative features.",
