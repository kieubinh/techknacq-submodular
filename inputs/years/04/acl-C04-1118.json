        "Times of feminist (language) revolution are gone, but marks are left behind in the form of a changed society with a changed consciousness and changed gender roles.",
        "Nevertheless language use seems to oppose changes much stronger than society does.",
        "As the use of non-discriminatory language is nowadays compulsory in administration and official documents, a number of guidelines and recommendations exist, which help to avoid gender imbalance and stereotypes in language use.",
        "Although in some cases men may be concerned (as for example most terms referring to criminals are masculine nouns) the main concern is about adequate representation of women in language, especially in a professional context.",
        "Psychological tests demonstrate that persons reading or hearing masculine job titles (so-called generic terms allegedly meaning both women and men) do not visualize women working in this field.",
        "In order to avoid this kind of discrimination two main principles are often suggested (e.g. as in (Ges, 1999; Uni, 2000)):",
        "1. use of gender-neutral language, which rather ”disguises” the acting person by using impersonal phrases.",
        "2. explicit naming of women and men as equally represented acting persons.",
        "Using and applying these guidelines in a faithful manner is time-consuming and requires a great amount of practice, which can not always be provided, particularly by unexperienced writer.",
        "Moreover these guidelines are often completely unknown in non-feminist circles.",
        "A tool which checks texts for discriminatory use of language is thus mandatory to promote written gender equality, educate and remind writer of unacceptable forms to avoid.",
        "In this paper we describe the project “Gendercheck” which uses a controlled-language authoring tool (CLAT) as a platform and editor to check German texts for discriminatory language.",
        "In section 2 we introduce three categories of gender discrimination in German texts and provide possibilities for their reformulation.",
        "Section 3 introduces the technology on which the Gendercheck editor is based.",
        "The linguistic engine proceeds in two steps, a marking and filtering phase where gender discriminatory formulations are automatically detected.",
        "A graphical interface plots the detected formulations and prompts the according messages for correction .",
        "Section 4 then goes into the detail of the marking and filtering technique.",
        "We use the shallow pattern formalism KURD (Carl and Schmidt-Wigger, 1998; Ins, 2004) first to mark possible erroneous formulations and the to filter out those which occur in “gendered” context.",
        "Section 5 evaluates the Gendercheck editor on two texts."

        "Most prominent to achieve gender equality on a linguistic level in German texts is to find solutions and alternatives for the so-called generic masculine: the masculine form is taken as the generic form to designate all persons of any sex.",
        "The major problem is to figure out whether or not a given person denotation refers to a particular person.",
        "For instance, in example (1a) “Beamter” (officer) is most likely used in its generic reading and refers to female officers (Beamtinnen) and masculine officers (Beamten).",
        "To achieve gender equality an appropriate reformulation is required as shown in example (1b).",
        "(1a) Der Beamte muss den Anforderungen Gen¨uge leisten.",
        "(1b) Alle Beamten und Beamtinnen m¨ussen den Anforderungen Gen¨uge leisten.",
        "Since we tackle texts from administrative and legal domains we principally assume unspecified references.",
        "That is, a masculine (or feminine!)",
        "noun will not denote a concrete person but rather refers to all persons, irrespectively of their sex.",
        "A second class of errors are masculine relative, possessive and personal pronouns which refer to a generic masculine or an indefinite masculine pronoun.",
        "(2a) Der Beamte muss seine Wohnung in der N¨ahe des Arbeitsplatzes suchen.",
        "(2b) Jeder muss seinen Beitrag dazu leisten.",
        "(2c) Wer Rechte hat, der hat auch Pflichten.",
        "The possessive pronoun “seine” (his) in example (2a) refers to the preceeding “Beamte” (officer).",
        "The generic masculine use of “Beamte” and the referring pronoun will be marked.",
        "The same holds for sentence (2b) where the possessive pronoun refers to the indefinite pronoun “jeder” (everymasc).",
        "The indefinite pronouns “jemand” (someone) and “wer” (who) count as acceptable.",
        "However, masculine pronouns referring to it will be marked.",
        "In example (2c), the masculin relative pronoun “der” can be omitted.",
        "A third class of gender inequality is lack of agreement between the subject and the predicative noun.",
        "Example (3a) gives an example where the masculine subject “Ansprechpartner” (partnermasc) occurs with the a female object “Frau M¨uller” (Mrs. M¨uller).",
        "(3a) Ihr Ansprechpartner ist Frau M¨uller.",
        "(3b) Ihre Ansprechpartnerin ist Frau M¨uller.",
        "A solution for this class of errors is shown in example (3b) where the subject (Ansprechpartnerin) is adapted to the female gender of the predicate.",
        "Suggestions to reformulate gender imbalances as shown in examples (1) and (2) can be classified in two main categories:",
        "1.",
        "Whenever possible, use gender neutral formulations.",
        "These include collectiva (e.g. Lehrk¨orper (teaching staff) or Arbeitnehmerschaft (collective of employees)) as well as nominalized participles (Studierende (scholar)) or nominalized adjectives (Berechtigte).",
        "2.",
        "Use both forms if gender neutral formulations cannot be found.",
        "That is, the feminine and the masculine form are to be coordinated with “und”, “oder” or “bzw.”.",
        "A coordination with slash “/” will also be suggested but should only be used in forms, ordinance and regulations.",
        "Amendments should accord to general German writing rules.",
        "The so called “Binnen-I”, an upper case “I” as in “StudentInnen” will not be suggested and also naming of the female suffix in parenthesis should be avoided.",
        "The same holds for the indefinite pronoun “frau” (woman) which was occasionally suggested to complement the pronoun “man”."

        "b) In some cases nominalized participles such as “Angestellte” (employee) and “Hin-terbliebene” (surviving dependant), which are usually very well suited for gendered formulations due to their ambiguity in gender, were erroneously disambiguated.",
        "These instances produced noise because filters did not apply.",
