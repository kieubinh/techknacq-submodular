        "Software companies typically receive high volumes of electronic customer feedback every day, some of it in the form of elicited surveys, some of it in the form of unsolicited comments, suggestions, criticism.",
        "In order to react to that feedback quickly, and to direct it to the appropriate channels inside the company, it is desirable to provide intelligent and automatic classification of the feedback along two dimensions: What is the feedback about?",
        "Is the feedback positive or negative?",
        "The first question is addressed by text mining tools.",
        "Automatic sentiment classification addresses the second question.",
        "Text mining tools can help make large quantities of feedback more manageable by splitting them into clusters based on keywords or topics.",
        "Sentiment analysis, which is the focus of this paper, adds a second dimension to the analysis.",
        "It makes it possible to focus the text mining on areas in need of improvement (negative feedback) or on areas of success (positive feedback).",
        "Sentiment classification is a special case of text categorization, where the criterion of classification is the attitude expressed in the text, rather than the “content” or topic.",
        "Faced with the task of having to automatically classify a piece of text as expressing positive or negative sentiment, a reasonable first approach would consist of paying special attention to words that tend to express a positive or negative attitude.",
        "Pang et al.",
        "(2002) have demonstrated, however, that this is not as straightforward as one may think, given that sentiment is often expressed in more subtle and indirect ways.",
        "The literature on sentiment classification can be divided into approaches that rely on semantic resources, such as a sentiment or affect lexicon (Nasukawa and Yi 2003, Subasic and Huettner 2001), or a large scale knowledge base (Liu et al. 2003) on the one hand, and approaches that try to learn patterns directly from tagged data, without additional resources (Dave et al. 2003, Pang et al.",
        "2003).",
        "Much research is also being directed at acquiring affect lexica automatically (Turney 2002, Turney and Littman 2002).",
        "There is also a considerable amount of research on classification of text as “subjective” or “objective” (Wiebe et al. 2001, Yu and Hatzivassiloglou 2003), a task that is not relevant for the processing of very brief pieces of direct customer feedback.",
        "In many studies, research on sentiment classification is conducted on review-type data, such as movie or restaurant reviews.",
        "These data often consist of relatively well-formed, coherent and at least paragraph-length pieces of text.",
        "The results we present in this paper are based on customer feedback data from web surveys, which, as we will discuss below, are particularly noisy and fragmentary.",
        "For our purpose of automatic classification of customer feedback, we decided to use machine-learning directly on the customer feedback, instead of relying on additional semantic resources of any kind.",
        "This decision was motivated by practical considerations: first, the customer feedback data we are facing are often very short and sometimes very incoherent.",
        "This makes it seem unlikely that a detailed semantic resource would be of particular help.",
        "Second, we believe that an appropriately chosen machine-learning technique will be able to draw its own conclusions from the distribution of lexical elements in a piece of feedback.",
        "We conducted our sentiment classification experiments using support vector machines.",
        "Support vector machines (SVMs) have a good track record in text classification (Joachims 1998, Dumais et al.",
        "1998), they can be trained using a large number of features, and both training and classification for linear SVMs are fast with optimized learning algorithms.",
        "For our experiments we use John Platt’s Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) tool (Platt 1999).",
        "In the absence of any evidence that would suggest a more complicated kernel function such as a polynomial or an RBF kernel, we have decided to train linear SVMs for our classification task (see also the results in Joachims 1998).",
        "The procedure, as is standard in supervised machine learning tasks, consists of training a classifier on pretagged training data and then evaluating the performance of the classifier on a held-out set of test data.",
        "The two main questions we wanted to assess with our experiments are:",
        "1. which features and feature sets are relevant for sentiment classification on customer feedback?",
        "2. what is the maximum classification accuracy that can be achieved on this data set?"

        "We excluded pieces of feedback without any verbatim from the data.",
        "Along with the verbatim, customers provided a numeric satisfaction score on a scale from 1 (not satisfied) to 4 (very satisfied) for each of those pieces of feedback.",
        "The numeric score served as the target tag in our experiments, making it unnecessary to perform any costly human evaluation and tagging.",
        "The distribution of items across numerical scores is given in Table 1.",
        "The data is extremely noisy, and a human evaluation of a random set of 200 pieces of feedback could only assign a positive or negative sentiment to 117 (58.5%) items, the rest was either balanced (16 cases or 8%), expressed no sentiment (50 cases or 25%), or too incoherent or random to be classified (17 cases or 8.5%).",
        "Amongst the 117 classifiable cases, the human evaluator assigned the category “positive”: to 26 cases (or 22.2%) and the category “negative” to 91 cases (or 77.8%).",
        "After automatic sentence breaking into one sentence per line, the individual files contained an average of 2.56 lines.",
        "For our experiments we split the data 90/10 into training and held-out test data.",
        "We performed 10-fold cross validation for each of the experiments reported in this paper.",
        "For each of the various classification tasks, we trained a linear SVM using the standard settings of the SMO tool, and calculated accuracy, precision and recall numbers on the held-out test data, averaging them across the 10-fold cross validation."
