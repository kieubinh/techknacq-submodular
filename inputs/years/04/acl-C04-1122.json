        "Recently, Named Entity (NE) recognition has been getting more attention as a basic building block for practical natural language applications.",
        "A Named Entity tagger identifies proper expressions such as names, locations and dates in sentences.",
        "We are trying to extend this to an Extended Named Entity tagger, which additionally identifies some common nouns such as disease names or products.",
        "We believe that identifying these names is useful for many applications such as information extraction or question answering (Sekine et al., 2002).",
        "Normally a Named Entity tagger uses lexical or contextual knowledge to spot names which appear in documents.",
        "One of the major problem of this task is its data sparseness.",
        "Names appear very frequently in regularly updated documents such as news articles or web pages.",
        "They are, however, much more varied than common nouns, and changing continuously.",
        "Since it is hard to construct a set of predefined names by hand, usually some corpus based approaches are used for building such taggers.",
        "However, as Zipf’s law indicates, most of the names which occupy a large portion of vocabulary are rarely used.",
        "So it is hard for Named Entity tagger developers to keep up with a contemporary set of words, even though a large number of documents are provided for learning.",
        "There still might be a “wild” noun which doesn’t appear in the corpora.",
        "Several attempts have been made to tackle this problem by using unsupervised learning techniques, which make vast amount of corpora available to use.",
        "(Strzalkowski and Wang, 1996) and (Collins and Singer, 1999) tried to obtain either lexical or contextual knowledge from a seed given by hand.",
        "They trained the two different kind of knowledge alternately at each iteration of training.",
        "(Yangarber et al., 2002) tried to discover names with a similar method.",
        "However, these methods still suffer in the situation where the number of occurrences of a certain name is rather small."

        "In this paper we propose another method to strengthen the lexical knowledge for Named Entity tagging by using synchronicity of names in comparable documents.",
        "One can view a “comparable” document as an alternative expression of the same content.",
        "Now, two document sets where each document of one set is associated with one in the other set, is called a “comparable” corpus.",
        "A comparable corpus is less restricted than a parallel corpus and usually more available.",
        "Several different newspapers published on the same day report lots of the same events, therefore contain a number of comparable documents.",
        "One can also take another view of a comparable corpus, which is a set of paraphrased documents.",
        "By exploiting this feature, one can extract paraphrastic expressions automatically from parallel corpora (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001) or comparable corpora (Shinyama and Sekine, 2003).",
        "Named Entities in comparable documents have one notable characteristic: they tend to be preserved across comparable documents because it is generally difficult to paraphrase names.",
        "We think that it is also hard to paraphrase product names or disease names, so they will also be preserved.",
        "Therefore, if one Named Entity appears in one document, it should also appear in the comparable document.",
        "Consequently, if one has two sets of documents which are associated with each other, the distribution of a certain name in one document set should look similar to the distribution of the name in the other document set.",
        "We tried to use this characteristic of Named Entities to discover rare names from comparable news articles.",
        "We particularly focused on the time series distribution of a certain word in two newspapers.",
        "We hypothesized that if a Named Entity is used in two newspapers, it should appear in both newspapers synchronously, whereas other words don’t.",
        "Since news articles are divided day by day, it is easy to obtain the time series distribution of words appearing in each newspaper.",
        "Figure 2 shows the time series distribution of the two words “yigal” and “killed”, which appeared in several newspapers in 1995.",
        "The word “yigal” (the name of the man who killed Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin on Nov. 7, 1995) has a clear spike.",
        "There were a total of 363 documents which included the word that year and its occurrence is synchronous between the two newspapers.",
        "In contrast, the word “killed”, which appeared in 21591 documents, is spread over all the year and has no clear characteristic."

        "To verify our hypothesis, we conducted an experiment to measure the correlation between the occurrence of Named Entity and its similarity of time series distribution between two newspapers.",
        "First, we picked a rare word, then obtained its document frequency which is the number of articles which contain the word.",
        "Since newspaper articles are provided separately day by day, we sampled the document frequency for each day.",
        "These numbers form, for one year for example, a 365-element integer vector per newspaper.",
        "The actual number of news articles is oscillating weekly, however, we normalized this by dividing the number of articles containing the word by the total number of all articles on that day.",
        "At the end we get a vector of fractions which range from 0.0 to 1.0.",
        "Next we compared these vectors and calculated the similarity of their time series distributions across different news sources.",
        "Our basic strategy was to use the cosine similarity of two vectors as the likelihood of the word’s being a Named Entity.",
        "However, several issues arose in trying to apply this directly.",
        "Firstly, it is not always true that the same event is reported on the same day.",
        "An actual newspaper sometimes has a one or two-day time lag depending on the news.",
        "To alleviate this effect, we applied a simple smoothing to each vector.",
        "Secondly, we needed to focus on the salient use of each word, otherwise a common noun which constantly appears almost every day has an undesirable high similarity between newspapers.",
        "To avoid this, we tried to intensify the effect of a spike by comparing the deviation of the frequency instead of the frequency itself.",
        "This way we can degrade the similarity of a word which has a “flat” distribution.",
        "In this section we first explain a single-word experiment which detects Named Entities that consist of one word.",

        "We only used a simple tokenizer and converted all words into lower case.",
        "A part of speech tagger was not used.",
        "Then we obtained the document frequency vector for the word.",
