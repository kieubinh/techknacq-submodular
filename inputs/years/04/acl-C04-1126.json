        "This paper addresses the problem by comparing a corpus which has been annotated using two separate schemes: one which lists all events described in the text and another listing only those expressed within a single sentence.",
        "It was found that only 40.6% of the events in the first annotation scheme were fully contained in the second."

        "Information Extraction (IE) is the process of identifying specific pieces of information in text, for example, the movements of company executives or the victims of terrorist attacks.",
        "IE is a complex task and a the description of an event may be spread across several sentences or paragraphs of a text.",
        "For example, Figure 1 shows two sentences from a text describing management succession events (i.e. changes in corporate executive management personnel).",
        "It can be seen that the fact that the executives are leaving and the name of the organisation are listed in the first sentence.",
        "However, the names of the executives and their posts are listed in the second sentence although it does not mention the fact that the executives are leaving these posts.",
        "The succession events can only be fully understood from a combination of the information contained in both sentences.",
        "Combining the required information across sentences is not a simple task since it is necessary to identify phrases which refer to the same entities, “two top executives” and “the executives” in the above example.",
        "Additional difficulties occur because the same entity may be referred to by a different linguistic unit.",
        "For example, “International Business Machines Ltd.” may be referred to by an abbreviation (“IBM”), Pace American Group Inc. said it notified two top executives it intends to dismiss them because an internal investigation found evidence of “self-dealing” and “undisclosed financial relationships.” The executives are Don H. Pace, cofounder, president and chief executive officer; and Greg S. Kaplan, senior vice president and chief financial officer.",
        "nickname ( “Big Blue”) or anaphoric expression such as “it” or “the company”.",
        "These complications make it difficult to identify the correspondences between different portions of the text describing an event.",
        "Traditionally IE systems have consisted of several components with some being responsible for carrying out the analysis of individual sentences and other modules which combine the events they discover.",
        "These systems were often designed for a specific extraction task and could only be modified by experts.",
        "In an effort to overcome this brittleness machine learning methods have been applied to port systems to new domains and extraction tasks with minimal manual intervention.",
        "However, some IE systems using machine learning techniques only extract events which are described within a single sentence, examples include (Soderland, 1999; Chieu and Ng, 2002; Zelenko et al., 2003).",
        "Presumably an assumption behind these approaches is that many of the events described in the text are expressed within a single sentence and there is little to be gained from the extra processing required to combine event descriptions.",
        "Systems which only attempt to extract events described within a single sentence only report results across those events.",
        "But the proportion of events described within a single sentence is not known and this has made it difficult to compare the performance of those systems against ones which extract all events from text.",
        "This question is addressed here by comparing two versions of the same IE data set, the evaluation corpus used in the Sixth Message Understanding Conference (MUC-6) (MUC, 1995).",
        "The corpus produced for this exercise was annotated with all events in the corpus, including those described across multiple sentences.",
        "An independent annotation of the same texts was carried out by Soderland (1999), although he only identified events which were expressed within a single sentence.",
        "Directly comparing these data sets allows us to determine what proportion of all the events in the corpus are described within a single sentence.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the formats for representing events used in the MUC and Soderland data sets.",
        "Section 3 introduces a common representation scheme which allows events to be compared, a method for classifying types of event matches and a procedure for comparing the two data sets.",
        "The results and implications of this experiment are presented in Section 4.",
        "Some related work is discussed in Section 5."

        "The MUC organisers provided strict guidelines about what constituted a succession event and how the templates should be filled which the annotators sometimes found difficult to interpret (Sundheim, 1995).",

        "Consequently Soderland produced his own simpler structure to represent events which he described as “case frames”.",
        "This representation could only be used to annotate events described within a single sentence and this reduced the complexity of the IE rules which had to be learned.",

        "In each case one event contained details of the move type, person involved and post title and another contained the same information without the post title.",

        "Diller, 50 years old, succeeds Joseph M. Segel, who has been named to the post of chairman emeritus.” which is later followed by “At that time, it was announced that Diller was in talks with the company on becoming its chairman and chief executive upon Mr. Segel’s scheduled retirement this month.” Table 1 also shows that there are 56 events in the MUC data which fall into the nomatch category.",

Young, chief financial officer, stepped down voluntarily on a ‘temporary basis pending conclusion’ of the investigation.” The analysis also identified one event in the Soderland data which appeared to correspond to an event in the text but was not listed in the MUC scenario template for that document.",
        "It could be argued that there nine events should be added to the set of MUC events and treated as fully matches.",
