        "Research in information extraction (IE) and its related fields has led to a wide range of applications in many domains.",
        "The portability issue of IE systems across different domains, however, remains a serious challenge.",
        "This problem is being addressed through automatic knowledge acquisition methods, such as unsupervised learning for domain-specific lexicons (Lin et al., 2003) and extraction patterns (Yangarber, 2003), which require the user to provide only a small set of lexical items of the target classes or extraction patterns for the target domain.",
        "The idea of a self-customizing IE system emerged recently with the improvement of pattern acquisition techniques (Sudo et al., 2003b), where the IE system customizes itself across domains given by the user’s query.",
        "Furthermore, there are demands for access to information in languages different from the user’s own.",
        "However, it is more challenging to provide an IE system where the target language (here, English) is different from the source language (here, Japanese): a cross-lingual information extraction (CLIE) system.",
        "In this research, we explore various methods for efficient automatic pattern acquisition for the CLIE system, including the translation of the entire source document set into the target language.",
        "To achieve efficiency, the resulting CLIE system should (1) provide a reasonable level of extraction performance (both accuracy and coverage) and (2) require little or no knowledge on the user’s part of the source language.",
        "Today, there are basic linguistics tools available for many major languages.",
        "We show how we can take advantage of the tools available for the source language to boost extraction performance.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 and 3 discuss the self-adaptive CLIE system we assess throughout the paper.",
        "In Section 4, we show the experimental result for entity detection.",
        "Section 5 discusses the problems in translation that affect the pattern acquisition and Section 6 discusses related work.",
        "Finally, we conclude the paper in Section 7 with future work."

        "One approach to IE portability is to have a system that takes the description of the event type from the user as input and acquires extraction patterns for the given scenario.",
        "Throughout the paper, we call this kind of IE system QDIE (Query-Driven Information Extraction) system, whose typical procedure is illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "QDIE (e.g. (Sudo et al., 2003a)) consists of three phases to learn extraction patterns from the source documents for a scenario specified by the user.",
        "First, it applies morphological analysis, dependency parsing and Named Entity (NE) tagging to the entire source document set, and converts all the sentences in the source document set into dependency trees.",
        "The NE tagging replaces named entities by their class, so the resulting dependency trees contain some NE class names as leaf nodes.",
        "This is crucial to identifying common patterns, and to applying these patterns to new text.",
        "Second, the user provides a set of narrative sentences describing the scenario (the events of interest).",
        "Using these sentences as a retrieval query, the information retrieval component of QDIE retrieves representative documents of the scenario specified by the user (relevant documents).",
        "Then from among all the possible connected subtrees of all the sentences in the relevant documents, the system calculates the score for each pattern candidate.",
        "The scoring function is based on TF/IDF scoring in IR literature; a pattern is more relevant when it appears more in the relevant documents and less across the entire collection of source documents.",
        "The final output is the ordered list of pattern candidates.",
        "Note that a pattern candidate contains at least one NE, so that it can be used to match a portion of a sentence which contains an instance of the same NE type.",
        "The matched NE instance is then extracted.",
        "The pattern candidates may be simple predicate-argument structures (e.g. (resign from {C-POST}) in business domain) or even a complicated subtree of a sentence which commonly appears in the relevant documents (e.g. (QC-ORG} report personnel affair (that {C-PERSON} resigns)) )."

        "Then we ran English-QDIE system to get the extraction patterns, which are used to extract the entities by pattern matching.",
        "On the other hand, one can first translate the scenario description into the source language and use it for the monolingual QDIE system for the source language, assuming that we have access to the tools for pattern acquisition in the source language.",
        "Each entity in the extracted table is translated into the target language (Crosslingual-QDIE).",
