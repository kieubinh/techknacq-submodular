        "In this paper, we discuss work on the detection of question and answer pairs in email threads, i.e., coherent exchanges of email messages among several participants.",
        "Email is a written medium of asynchronous multi-party communication.",
        "This means that, as in face-to-face spoken dialog, the email thread as a whole is a collaborative effort with interaction among the discourse participants.",
        "However, unlike spoken dialog, the discourse participants are not physically co-present, so that the written word is the only channel of communication.",
        "Furthermore, replies do not happen immediately, so that responders need to take special precautions to identify relevant elements of the discourse context (for example, by quoting previous messages).",
        "Thus, email is a distinct linguistic genre that poses its own challenges to summarization.",
        "With the increasing popularity of email as a means of communication, an increasing number of meetings are scheduled, events planned, issues resolved, and questions answered through emails.",
        "As the number of emails in one’s mailbox increases, in-Regarding “acm home/bjarney”, on Apr 9, 2001, Muriel Danslop wrote: Two things: Can someone be responsible for the press releases for Stroustrup?",
        "Responding to this on Apr 10, 2001, Theresa Feng wrote: I think Phil, who is probably a better writer than most of us, is writing up something for dang and Dave to send out to various ACM chapters.",
        "Phil, we can just use that as our “press release”, right?",

        "formation from past conversations becomes increasingly inaccessible and difficult to manage.",
        "For example, a number of emails can be used in scheduling a meeting, and a search for information on the meeting may retrieve all the intermediate emails, thus hindering one’s access to the required information.",
        "Access to required information could be dramatically improved by querying summaries of email conversations While summarization of email conversations seems a natural way to improve upon current methods of email management, research on email summarization is in early stages.",
        "Consider an example summary of a thread of email conversation produced by a sentence extraction based email thread summarization system developed at Columbia (Rambow et al., 2004) shown in Figure 1.",
        "While this summary does include an answer to the first question, it does not include answers to the two questions posed subsequently even though the answers are present in the thread.",
        "This example demonstrates one of the inadequacies of sentence extraction based summarization modules: namely, the absence of discourse segments that would have made the summaries more readable and complete.",
        "A summarization module that includes answers to questions posed in extractive summaries, then, becomes very useful.",
        "Further, questions are a natural means of resolving any issue.",
        "This is especially so of email conversations through which most of our issues, whether professional or personal, get resolved.",
        "And, the asynchronous nature of email conversation makes it possible for users to pursue several questions in parallel.",
        "In fact, in our corpus of email exchanges, we found that about 20% of all email threads focus primarily on a question-answer exchange, whether one question is posed and multiple people respond or whether multiple questions are posed and multiple responses given.",
        "For these type of email exchanges, a summary that can highlight the main question(s) asked and the response(s) given would be useful.",
        "Being able to distinguish questions pertaining to different issues in an email thread and being able to associate the answers with their questions is a necessity in order to generate this type of summary.",
        "In this paper, we present our work on the detection of question and answer pairs in email conversations.",
        "The question-answer detection system we present will ultimately serve as one component of a full email summarization system, providing a portion of summary content.",
        "We developed one approach for the detection of questions in email messages, and a separate approach to detect the corresponding answers.",
        "These are described in turn below."

        "While the detection of questions in email messages is not as difficult a problem as in speech conversations where features such as the question mark character are absent, relying on the use of question mark character for identifying questions in email messages is not adequate.",
        "The need for special attention in detecting questions in email messages arises due to three reasons.",
        "First, the use of informal language means users might use the question mark character in cases other than questions (for example, to denote uncertainty) and may overlook using a question mark after a question.",
        "Second, a question may be stated in a declarative form, as in, “I was wondering if you are free at 5pm today.” Third, not every question, whether in an interrogative form or in a declarative form, is meant to be answered.",
        "For example, rhetorical questions are used for purposes other than to obtain the information the question asked, and are not required to be associated with answer segments.",
        "We used supervised rule induction for the detection of interrogative questions.",
        "Training examples were extracted from the transcribed SWITCHBOARD corpus annotated with DAMSL tags.1 This particular corpus was chosen not only because an adequate number of training examples could be extracted from the manual annotations, but also because of the use of informal language in speech that is also characteristic of email conversation.",
        "Utterances with DAMSL tags “sv” (speech act “statement-opinion”) and “sd” (speech act “statement-non-opinion”) were used to extract 5,000 negative examples.",
        "Similarly, utterances with tags “qy” (“yes-no-question”), “qw” (“Wh-question”), and “qh” (“rhetorical-question”) were used to extract 5,000 positive examples.",
        "Each utterance was then represented by a feature vector which included the following features:",
        "• POS tags for the first five terms (shorter utterances were padded with dummies) • POS tags for the last five terms (shorter utterances were padded with dummies) • length of the utterance",
        "• POS-bigrams from a list of 100 most discriminating POS-bigrams list.",
        "The list of most discriminating POS-bigrams was obtained from the training data by following the same procedure that (Zechner and Lavie, 2001) used.",
        "We then used Ripper (Cohen, 1996) to learn rules for question detection.",
        "Like many learning programs, Ripper takes as input the classes to be learned, a set of feature names and possible values, and training data specifying the class and feature values for each training example.",
        "In our case, the training examples are the speech acts extracted from the SWITCHBOARD corpus as described above.",
        "Ripper outputs a classification model for predicting the class (i.e., whether a speech act is a question or not) of future examples; the model is expressed as an ordered set of if-then rules.",
        "For testing, we manually extracted 300 questions in interrogative form and 300 statements in declarative form from the ACM corpus.2 We show our test results with recall, precision and Fi-score3 in Table 1 on the first column.",
        "While the test results show that the precision was very good, the recall score could be further improved.",
        "Upon further investigation on why the recall was so low, we found that unlike the positive examples we used in our training data, most of the questions in the test data that were missed by the rules learned by Ripper started with a declarative phrase.",
        "For example, both “I know its on 108th, but after that not sure, how exactly do we get there?”, and “By the way, are we shutting down clic?” begin with declarative phrases and were missed by the Ripper learned rules.",
        "Following this observation,",
        "we manually updated our question detection module to break a speech act that was not initially predicted as question into phrases separated by comma characters.",
        "Then we applied the rules on the first phrase of the speech act and if that failed on the last phrase.",
        "For example, the rules would fail on the phrase “I know its on 108th”, but would be able to classify the phrase “how exactly do we get there” as a question.",
        "In doing this we were able to increase the recall score to 0.72, leading to a F,-score of 0.82 as shown in Table 1 in the second column."

        "Whereas in speech a set of heuristics can be used to identify answers as shown by (Zechner and Lavie, 2001), such heuristics cannot be readily applied to the task of question and answer pairing in email conversations.",
        "First, more than one topic can be discussed in parallel in an email thread, which implies that questions relating to more than a single topic can be pursued in parallel.",
        "Second, even when an email thread starts with the discussion of a single topic, the thread may eventually be used to initiate a different topic just because the previous topic’s list of recipients closely matched those required for the newly initiated topic.",
        "Third, because of the use of “Reply” and “ReplyAll” functions in email clients, a user may be responding to an issue posed earlier in the thread while using one of the email messages subsequent to the message posing the issue to “reply back” to that issue.",
        "So, while it may seem from the structure of the email thread that a person is replying back to a certain email, the person may actually be replying back to an email earlier in the thread.",
        "This implies that when several persons answer a question, there may be answers which appear several emails after the email posing the question.",
        "Finally, the fact that the question and its corresponding answers may have few words in common further complicates answer detection.",
        "This is possible when a person uses the context of the email conversation to ask questions and make answers, and the semantics of such questions and answers have to be interpreted with respect to the context they appear in.",
        "Such context is readily available for a reader through the use of quoted material from past email messages.",
        "All of these make the task of detecting and linking question and answer pairs in email conversations a complicated task.",
