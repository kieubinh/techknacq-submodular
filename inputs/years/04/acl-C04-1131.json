        "The task of word sense disambiguation (WSD) is to identify the correct sense of a word in context.",
        "WSD is usually performed by matching information from the context in which the word occurs with disambiguation knowledge source.",
        "Our approach uses supervised machine-learning techniques to automatically acquire such disambiguation knowledge from sense-tagged corpora.",
        "At present, this type of approach is widely used and seems to yield the best results (Kilgarriff, Rosenzweig, 2000; Ng, 1997b).",
        "Information conveyed by context words (morphological form) is enriched with further annotations: part-of-speech tag, lemma, etc.",
        "Each individual piece of information is called a feature.",
        "A good feature should capture an important source of knowledge that is critical in determining the sense of the word to be disambiguated.",
        "The choice of the appropriate set of features is an important issue for WSD (Bruce, Wiebe, Perdersen, 1996; Ng, Zelle, 1997; Pedersen, 2001).",
        "Thus, this paper describes the results of a systematic and in-depth study of homogenous criteria (i.e. set of features) that can be used for WSD."

        "The corpus we worked on is composed of different types of texts and comprises 6 468 522 words.",
        "It was put together within the framework of the SyntSem project that aims at producing a French corpus which is morphologically and syntactically tagged, lemmatised and that comprises a light syntactical tagging as well as a lexical tagging of 60 target words selected for their strongly polysemous nature (Véronis, 1998)1.",
        "These 60 target words are evenly divided into 20 nouns, 20 adjectives and 20 verbs, having a total of 53 796 occurrences in the corpus.",
        "The inadequacy of standard dictionaries (Véronis, 2001) and computational lexicons (Palmer, 1998) for natural language processing is presently one of the major difficulties encountered in word sense disambiguation.",
        "For instance, by using these dictionaries, the inter-annotator agreement may sometimes reach only 57% (Ng, Lee, 1996) or may simply be equivalent to random sense allocation (Véronis, 1998).",
        "To overcome this weakness, a dictionary more specific to natural language processing is being developed in our team (Reymond, 2002).",
        "It has been used to tag the occurrences of the 60 target words of the SyntSem corpus.",
        "Table 8 in the appendix gives quantitative information for each target word.",
        "The number of senses per word may be very large for it includes idioms and phrasal verbs such as: « mettre sur pied », « mettre à pied », « pied de nez », etc.",
        "A general agreement seems to emerge according to which morpho-syntatic disambiguation and sense disambiguation can be disentangled (Kilgarriff, 1997; Ng, Zelle, 1997).",
        "We have entrusted the part-of-speech tagging of our corpus to the Cordial software (developed by Synapse Développement company) as it offers lemmatisation and part-of-speech tagging of a satisfactory accuracy (Valli, Véronis, 1999).",
        "Table 1 displays an extract of the SyntSem corpus.",

        "The aim of our study is to evaluate a large variety of homogenous criteria (i.e. set of features).",
        "The name of each criterion specifies its nature and takes the following form [par1 |par2|par3|par4].",
        "Parameter par1 indicates whether the criterion takes into account unigrams (par1=1gr), bigrams (par1=2gr) or trigrams (par1=3gr), knowing that an n-gram represents the juxtaposition of n words.",
        "Parameter par2 indicates which word tag is considered: morphological form (par2=mform), lemma (par2=lemma), part-of-speech (par2=ems) or coarse-grained part-of-speech (par2=cgems).",
        "Parameter par3 indicates if we take into account word positions (par3=position), if we only distinguish left from right context (par3=leftright), or if we simply consider unordered set of surrounding words (par3=unordered).",
        "Lastly, parameter par4 shows whether the criterion takes into account all the words (par4=all) or content words only (par3=content).",
        "We call these criteria “homogeneous criteria” as the four parameters together determine the nature of all pieces of contextual evidence selected by the criterion.",
        "For contexts within a range of ±1 to ± 8 words, the combination of all parameters generates 576 (3 x 4 X 3 X 2 X 8) distinct criteria.",
        "We have systematically evaluated each one of these criteria as well as other criteria in order to answer specific questions and to validate or invalidate certain hypothesis.",
        "Within the framework of this study, we have developed an application used to model these criteria and to further apply them to the corpus in order to generate feature vectors used by our classifiers (Audibert, 2001)."

        "We have chosen the Naïve-Bayes classifier (NB) for its simplicity and widespread use, as well as for its well-known state-of-the-art accuracy on supervised WSD (Domingos, Pazzani, 1997; Mooney, 1996; Ng, 1997a).",
        "The NB classifier assumes the features are independent given the sense.",
        "During classification, it chooses the sense with the highest posterior probability.",
        "We have also selected a decision list classifier (DL) which is similar to the classifier used by (Yarowsky, 1994) for words having two senses, and extended for more senses by (Golding, 1995).",
        "DL classifier is further developed in (Audibert, 2003).",
        "In DL, features are sorted in order of decreasing strength, where strength reflects feature reliability for decision-making.",
        "The DL classifier distinguishes itself clearly from the NB classifier as it does not combine the features, but bases its classifications solely on the single most reliable feature identified in the target context selected by the criteria.",
        "We will make a use of this decision-making transparency several times in this article.",
        "Some other advantages of DL classifier are its significant simplicity and its ease of implementation.",
        "Both of the classifiers we used require probability estimates.",
        "Given the data-sparseness, we have to deal with zero or low frequency counts.",
        "For this reason, we have decided to use m-estimation (Cussens, 1993) rather than classical estimations of probabilities or Laplace (“add one”) smoothing.",
        "When a classifier is not able to disambiguate a target word, which is very rare, it selects the most frequent sense from the training data.",
        "Thus, all occurrences are tagged.",
        "As in this case precision equals the recall, the present article speaks in terms of precision only.",
        "To evaluate a criterion in the corpus, we use a k-fold cross-validation method (in accordance with the common use, in our experiment, k=10).",
        "Despite the fact that this method takes much computing time, it enables the evaluation of the criterion in the whole corpus.",
        "Throughout the tests, the two classifiers have generally obtained comparable accuracy, although the NB classifier has almost systematically outperformed the DL classifier."

        "Figure 1 graphics show the space distribution of the main parts-of-speech of the indicators used to disambiguate each one of the three term categories.",
        "The dissymmetric shape of verbs, and more precisely, the strong prevalence of indicators located in position +1, +2, +3, makes us believe that disambiguating verbs is done more accordingly to their object than to their subject since as a rule the main form encountered is subject–verb–object.",
        "Table 4 summarizes these graphs.",
        "Our results and those of (Yarowsky, 1993) agree in many respects, although his study applies only to pseudo-words having only two “senses”:",

        "Table 5 shows the average decrease of the precision of the content words based criteria ([par1 |par2|par3 |content]) compared to the same criteria based on all words ([par1 |par2 |par3 |all]).",
