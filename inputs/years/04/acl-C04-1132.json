        "Over the past decade, many studies have been made on WSD of Japanese.",

        "However, as supervised learning methods require word sense-tagged corpora, they often suffer from data sparseness, i.e., words which do not occur frequently in a training corpus can not be disambiguated.",
        "Therefore, we cannot use supervised learning algorithms alone in practical NLP applications, especially when it is necessary to disambiguate both high frequency and low frequency words.",
        "To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a method to combine two WSD classifiers.",
        "One is a classifier obtained by supervised learning.",
        "The learning algorithm used for this classifier is the Support Vector Machine (SVM); this classifier will work well for the disambiguation of high frequency words.",
        "The second classifier is the Naive Bayes model, which will work well for the disambiguation of low frequency words.",
        "In this model, hypernyms extracted from definition sentences in a dictionary are considered in order to overcome data sparseness.",

        "For Japanese, in most cases the last word in a definition sentence is a hy-pernym.",
