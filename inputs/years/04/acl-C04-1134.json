        "The merits of translation at the word level or the concept level have long been a cause for debate among linguists.",
        "Some linguists suggest that the two languages of a bilingual speaker share a common semantic system (Illes and Francis 1999; Ikeda 1998) and hence translation is carried out at the concept level.",
        "Meanwhile, there has been a gradual convergence of statistical and transfer approaches in machine translation recently (Wu 2003).",
        "Statistical MT systems are based on a stochastic mapping between lexical items, assuming the underlying semantic transfer is hidden.",
        "Transfer systems use explicit lexical, syntactic and semantic transfer rules.",
        "Consequently, cognitive scientists and computational linguists alike have been interested in the study of semantic mapping between languages (Ploux and Ji, 2003, Dorr et al., 2002, Ngai et al., 2002, Boas 2002, Palmer and Wu, 1995).",
        "We propose to automatically construct a bilingual lexical semantic network with word sense and semantic role mapping between English and Chinese, simulating the “concept lexicon”, suggested by cognitive scientists, of a bilingual person.",
        "The linguists-defined ontologies–-FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), HowNet (Dong and Dong, 2000), and bilingual dictionaries are the basis for the induction of the mapping.",
        "We automatically estimate the semantic transfer likelihoods between English FrameNet lexical entries and the Chinese word senses in HowNet, and align those frames and lexical pairs with high likelihood values.",
        "In addition, we propose to induce Chinese example sentences automatically to match English annotated sentences provided in the FrameNet.",
        "The BiFrameNet thus induced provides an additional resource for machine-aided or machine translation systems.",
        "It can also serve as a reference to be compared to cognitive studies of the translation process.",
        "Ploux and Ji, (2003) proposed a spatial model for matching semantic values between French and English.",
