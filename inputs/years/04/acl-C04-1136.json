        "Many tools in the area of natural-language processing involve the application of ranking methods to sets of candidates, in order to select the most useful items from an all too often overwhelming list.",
        "Examples of such tools range from syntactic parsers (where alternative analyses are ranked by their plausibility) to the extraction of collocations from text corpora (where a ranking according to the scores assigned by a lexical association measure is the essential component of an extraction “pipeline”).",
        "To this end, a scoring function g is applied to the candidate set, which assigns a real number g(x) E to every candidate x.1 Conventionally, higher scores are assigned to candidates that the scoring function considers more “useful”.",
        "Candidates can then be selected in one of two ways: (i) by comparison with a predefined threshold γ E 1,' (i.e. x is accepted iff g(x) > γ), resulting in a γ-acceptance set; (ii) by ranking the entire candidate set according to the scores g(x) and selecting the n highest-scoring candidates, resulting in an n-best list (where n is either determined by practical constraints or interactively by manual inspection).",
        "Note that an n-best list can also be interpreted as a γ-acceptance set with a suitably chosen cutoff threshold γg (n) (determined from the scores of all candidates).",
        "Ranking methods usually involve various heuristics and statistical guesses, so that an empirical eval1 Some systems may directly produce a sorted candidate list without assigning explicit scores.",
        "However, unless this operation is (implicitly) based on an underlying scoring function, the result will in most cases be a partial ordering (where some pairs of candidates are incomparable) or lead to inconsistencies.",
        "uation of their performance is necessary.",
        "Even when there is a solid theoretical foundation, its predictions may not be borne out in practice.",
        "Often, the main goal of an evaluation experiment is the comparison of different ranking methods (i.e. scoring functions) in order to determine the most useful one.",
        "A widely-used evaluation strategy classifies the candidates accepted by a ranking method into “good” ones (true positives, TP) and “bad” ones (false positives, FP).",
        "This is sometimes achieved by comparison of the relevant γ-acceptance sets or n-best lists with a gold standard, but for certain applications (such as collocation extraction), manual inspection of the candidates leads to more clear-cut and meaningful results.",
        "When TPs and FPs have been identified, the precision Π of a γ-acceptance set or an n-best list can be computed as the proportion of TPs among the accepted candidates.",
        "The most useful ranking method is the one that achieves the highest precision, usually comparing n-best lists of a given size n. If the full candidate set has been annotated, it is also possible to determine the recall R as the number of accepted TPs divided by the total number of TPs in the candidate set.",
        "While the evaluation of extraction tools (e.g. in information retrieval) usually requires that both precision and recall are high, ranking methods often put greater weight on high precision, possibly at the price of missing a considerable number of TPs.",
        "Moreover, when n-best lists of the same size are compared, precision and recall are fully equivalent.2 For these reasons, I will concentrate on the precision Π here.",
        "As an example, consider the identification of collocations from text corpora.",
        "Following the methodology described by Evert and Krenn (2001), German PP-verb combinations were extracted from a chunk-parsed version of the Frankfurter Rundschau Corpus.3 A cooccurrence frequency threshold of 2Namely, Π = nTP • R/n, where nTP stands for the total number of TPs in the candidate set.",
        "f > 30 was applied, resulting in a candidate set of 5102 PP-verb pairs.",
        "The candidates were then ranked according to the scores assigned by four association measures: the log-likelihood ratio G2 (Dunning, 1993), Pearson’s chi-squared statistic X2 (Manning and Sch¨utze, 1999, 169–172), the t-score statistic t (Church et al., 1991), and mere cooccurrence frequency f.4 TPs were identified according to the definition of Krenn (2000).",
        "The graphs in Figure 1 show the precision achieved by these measures, for n ranging from 100 to 2 000 (lists with n < 100 were omitted because the graphs become highly unstable for small n).",
        "The baseline precision of 11.09% corresponds to a random selection of n candidates.",
        "From Figure 1, we can see that G2 and t are the most useful ranking methods, t being marginally better for n Pz� 800 and G2 for n > 1500.",
        "Both measures are by far superior to frequency-based ranking.",
        "The evaluation results also confirm the argument of Dunning (1993), who suggested G2 as a more robust alternative to X2.",
        "Such results cannot be taken at face value, though, as they may simply be due to chance.",
        "When two equally useful ranking methods are compared, method A might just happen to perform better in a particular experiment, with B taking the lead in a repetition of the experi",
        "ment under similar conditions.",
        "The causes of such random variation include the source material from which the candidates are extracted (what if a slightly different source had been used?",
        "), noise introduced by automatic preprocessing and extraction tools, and the uncertainty of human annotators manifested in varying degrees of inter-annotator agreement.",
        "Most researchers understand the necessity of testing whether their results are statistically significant, but it is fairly unclear which tests are appropriate.",
        "For instance, Krenn (2000) applies the standard χ2- test to her comparative evaluation of collocation extraction methods.",
        "She is aware, though, that this test assumes independent samples and is hardly suitable for different ranking methods applied to the same candidate set: Krenn and Evert (2001) suggest several alternative tests for related samples.",
        "A wide range of exact and asymptotic tests as well as computationally intensive randomisation tests (Yeh, 2000) are available and add to the confusion about an appropriate choice.",
        "The aim of this paper is to formulate a statistical model that interprets the evaluation of ranking methods as a random experiment.",
        "This model defines the degree to which evaluation results are affected by random variation, allowing us to derive appropriate significance tests.",
        "After formalising the evaluation procedure in Section 2, I recast the procedure as a random experiment and make the underlying assumptions explicit (Section 3.1).",
        "On the basis of this model, I develop significance tests for the precision of a single ranking method (Section 3.2) and for the comparison of two ranking methods (Section 3.3).",
        "The paper concludes with an empirical validation of the statistical model in Section 4.",
        "2 A formal account of ranking methods and their evaluation In this section I present a formalisation of rankings and their evaluation, giving γ-acceptance sets a geometrical interpretation that is essential for the formulation of a statistical model in Section 3.",
        "The scores computed by a ranking method are based on certain features of the candidates.",
        "Each candidate can therefore be represented by its feature vector x E Ω, where Ω is an abstract feature space.",
        "For all practical purposes, Ω can be equated with a subset of the (possibly high-dimensional) real Euclidean space N\".",
        "The complete set of candidates corresponds to a discrete subset C C_ Ω of the feature space.5 A ranking method is represented by 5More precisely, C is a multi-set because there may be multiple candidates with identical feature vectors.",
        "In order to simplify notation I assume that C is a proper subset of 0, which a real-valued function g : Ω – * P' on the feature space, called a scoring function (SF).",
        "In the following, I assume that there are no candidates with equal scores, and hence no ties in the rankings.",
        "The γ-acceptance set for a SF g contains all candidates x E C with g(x) > γ.",
        "In a geometrical interpretation, this condition is equivalent to x E Ag (γ) C Ω, where Ag(γ):={xEΩ Ig(x)>γ} is called the γ-acceptance region of g. The γ- acceptance set of g is then given by the intersection Ag (γ) n C =: Cg (γ).",
        "The selection of an n-best list is based on the γ-acceptance region Ag (γg (n)) for a suitably chosen n-best threshold γg(n).7 As an example, consider the collocation extraction task introduced in Section 1.",

        "Oij are the cell counts of a 2 x 2 contingency table (Evert, 2004).",
        "Therefore, we have a four-dimensional feature space Ω C_ 1,,,4 , and each association measure defines a SF g : Ω – * 1,.",
        "The selection of collocation candidates is usually made in the form of an n-best list, but may also be based on a predefined threshold γ.8 For an evaluation in terms of precision and recall, the candidates in the set C are classified into true positives C+ and false positives C_.",
        "The precision corresponding to an acceptance region A is then given by",
        "i.e. the proportion of TPs among the accepted candidates.",

        "There are many causes for such variation, including different source material used by the second experiment, changes in the tool settings, changes in the evaluation criteria, or the different intuitions of human annotators.",
        "Statistical significance tests are designed to account for a small fraction of this variation that is due to random effects, assuming that all parameters that may have a systematic influence on the evaluation results are kept constant.",
        "Thus, they provide a lower limit for the variation that has to be expected in an actual repetition of the experiment.",
        "Only when results are significant can we expect them to be reproducible, but even then a second experiment may draw a different picture.",
        "In particular, the influence of qualitatively different source material or different evaluation criteria can never be predicted by statistical means alone.",
        "In the example of the collocation extraction task, randomness is mainly introduced by the selection of a source corpus, e.g. the choice of one particular newspaper rather than another.",
        "Disagreement between human annotators and uncertainty about the interpretation of annotation guidelines may also lead to an element of randomness in the evaluation.",
        "However, even significant results cannot be generalised to a different type of collocation (such as adjective-noun instead of PP-verb), different evaluation criteria, a different domain or text type, or even a source corpus of different size, as the results of Krenn and Evert (2001) show.",
        "A first step in the search for an appropriate significance test is to formulate a (plausible) model for random variation in the evaluation results.",
        "Because of the inherent randomness, every repetition of an evaluation experiment under similar conditions will lead to different candidate sets C+ and C_.",
        "Some elements will be entirely new candidates, sometimes the same candidate appears with a different feature vector (and thus represented by a different point x E Ω), and sometimes a candidate that was annotated as a TP in one experiment may be annotated as a FP in the next.",
        "In order to encapsulate all three kinds of variation, let us assume that C+ and C_ are randomly selected from a large set of hypothetical possibilities (where each candidate corresponds to many different possibilities with different feature vectors, some of which may be TPs and some FPs).",
        "For any acceptance region A, both the number of TPs in A, TA := IC+ n AI, and the number of FPs in A, FA := IC_ n AI, are thus random variables.",
        "We do not know their precise distributions, but it is reasonable to assume that (i) TA and FA are always independent and (ii) TA and TB (as well as FA and FB) are independent for any two disjoint regions A and B.",
        "Note that TA and TB cannot be independent for A n B =7� 0 because they include the same number of TPs from the region A n B.",
        "The total number of candidates in the region A is also a random variable NA := TA+FA, and the same follows for the precision ΠA, which can now be written as",
        "Following the standard approach, we may now assume that ΠA approximately follows a normal distribution with mean πA and variance σA, i.e. ΠA – N(πA, σA).",
        "The mean πA can be interpreted as the average precision of the acceptance region A (obtained by averaging over many repetitions of the evaluation experiment).",
        "However, there are two problems with this assumption.",
        "First, while ΠA is an unbiased estimator for πa, the variance σA cannot be estimated from a single experiment.10 Second, ΠA is a discrete variable because both TA and NA are non-negative integers.",
        "When the number of candidates NA is small (as in Section 3.3), approximating the distribution of ΠA by a continuous normal distribution will not be valid.",
        "It is reasonable to assume that the distribution of NA does not depend on the average precision πA.",
        "In this case, NA is called an ancillary statistic and can be eliminated without loss of information by conditioning on its observed value (see Lehmann (1991, 542ff) for a formal definition of ancillary statistics and the merits of conditional inference).",
        "Instead of probabilities P(ΠA) we will now consider the conditional probabilities P(ΠA I NA).",
        "Because NA is fixed to the observed value, ΠA is proportional to TA and the conditional probabilities are equivalent to P(TA I NA).",
        "When we choose one of the NA candidates at random, the probability that it is a TP (averaged over many repetitions of the experiment) 9 In the definition of the n-best precision Πg,n, i.e. for A = Cg(γg(n)), the number of candidates in A is constant: NA = n. At first sight, this may seem to be inconsistent with the interpretation of NA as a random variable.",
        "However, one has to keep in mind that γg (n), which is determined from the candidate set C, is itself a random variable.",
