        "It distinguishes three major tasks: (a) segmentation of a continuous information flow (e.g. spoken news) into individual news items, (b) detection of breaking news, i.e. of a new subject that has not previously been discussed, and (c) topic tracking, i.e. the identification of related news over time.",

        "Newspapers often publish the news they receive from press agencies with no or few amendments.",
        "The corpus of news articles thus contains not only summaries of the same events written by different journalists, but also many duplicates and near duplicates of the same original text which need to be eliminated from the collection.",
        "In order to identify the major news, we identify clusters of similar news items, i.e. news items that deal with the same subject.",
        "All subjects that trigger a large number of news articles from various feeds are of interest.",
        "The related news thus do not necessarily have to discuss events, i.e. things that happen at a particular time and place (e.g. the 11/03 Madrid bombing), but they can also be a thread of discussions on the same subject, such as the campaign for the US presidential elections.",

        "Cross-lingual cluster links were evaluated for two languages, English to French and English to Italian.",
        "The evaluation was again binary, i.e. clusters were either judged as being ‘closely related’ (+) or ‘unrelated, or not so related’ (–).",
        "For 31 English clusters, no French cluster was found.",
        "Similarly, for 32 English clusters, no Italian cluster was found.",
        "This means that for almost 25% of the English-speaking major news stories (31/136), there was no equivalent news cluster in the other languages.",
        "For the remaining English clusters, a total of 131 French and 133 Italian clusters were detected by the system, i.e. on average more than one for each English cluster.",
        "However, when several related news clusters were found, only the one with the highest score was considered in the evaluation.",
        "Table 2 not only shows that the English-Italian links are less reliable than the English-French ones (the Italian document representation is inferior to the French one because we spent less effort on optimising the Italian keyword assignment), but also that the quality of cross-lingual links is generally lower than the historical links presented in section 5.1.",
        "If we set the threshold for identifying related news across languages to 30%, the system catches 74 of the 75 good French clusters (99%) and 67 of the 69 Italian clusters (97%).",
        "However, the system then also proposes 13 bad French and 12 bad Italian clusters to the users.",
        "Setting the threshold higher would decrease the number of wrong hits.",
        "However, we decided to use the threshold of 30% because we consider it important for users to be able to find related news in other languages.",
        "Furthermore, unrelated clusters are usually very easy to detect just by looking at the title of the cluster.",
        "olds, of the automatically detected cross-lingual links between English major news and French (FR) or Italian (IT) news of the same day.",
        "The distinction was binary: Related (+) or Not (so) related (–)."

        "We have shown that our system can rather accurately identify clusters of major news per day in five languages and that it can link these clusters to related news over time (topic tracking).",
        "The most interesting and novel feature of the system is, however, that it can also identify related news across languages, without translating articles or using bilingual dictionaries.",
        "This cross-lingual cluster similarity is achieved by a combination of three feature sets, which currently have an impact of 50%, 30% and 20%, respectively: the main feature set is the mapping onto the multilingual classification scheme Eurovoc; the others are the countries referred to in the articles (direct mention of the country, or of a smaller place name of that country) and the cognates (same strings used in the articles across languages, i.e. mainly named entities).",
        "The evaluation has shown that the results are good, but that the cross-lingual linking performs less well than the monolingual historical linking of related news clusters.",
        "Users felt that the system performs well enough for it to go online soon, for usage by a large user community of several thousand people.",
        "Improvements to the system will nevertheless be sought.",
        "Future work will include testing different settings concerning the relative impact of the three components, as well as detecting and using more named entities such as absolute and relative date expressions, proper names, etc.",
        "A further aim is to extend the system to another six languages.",
        "The usage of cognate similarity could be improved.",
        "Currently it will not work with Greek, for instance, except for a few proper names.",
        "We would therefore like to experiment with multilingual stemming methods to exploit the existence of similar words across languages such as English elephant, French éléphant, Spanish and Italian elefante and German Elefant.",
        "Several customer groups requested an advanced news analysis that distinguishes between articles about concrete events and articles commenting about these events.",
        "We will explore this issue, but it is very likely that this distinction will require a syntactic analysis of the news and cannot be made with our bag-of-words approach.",
        "Finally, we intend to work on breaking news detection, i.e. detecting new events, as opposed to detecting major news.",
        "This work will require working on smaller time windows than the current 24-hour window."
