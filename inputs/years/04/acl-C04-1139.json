        "Traditionally, corpora would be compiled with a specific purpose in mind.",
        "Such corpora characteristically were well-balanced collections of data.",
        "In the form of metadata, record was kept of the design criteria, sampling procedures, etc.",
        "Thus the researcher would have a fair idea of where his data originated from.",
        "Over past decades, data collection has been boosted by technological developments.",
        "More and more and increasingly large collections of data have been and are being compiled.",
        "It is tempting to think that the problem of data sparseness has been solved – at least for raw data or data without any annotation other than can be provided fully automatically – especially now that large amounts of data can be accessed through the internet.",
        "However, with data coming to us from all over the world, originating from all sorts of sources, we now possibly have a new problem on our hands: often the origins of the found data remain obscure.",
        "It is not always clear what exactly the implications for our research are of employing data whose origin we do not know.",
        "Is it legal to use these data, ethical, appropriate, ...?",
        "In this paper we will focus on the last point: the appropriateness of the data in the light of a specific application or research goal.",
        "More in particular, we will investigate to what extent we can devise a procedure that will enable us to identify texts produced by native speakers of the language (and thus by default those produced by non-native speakers).",
        "The present study is motivated by the fact that for many uses the (near-)nativeness of the data is a critical factor in the development of adequate resources and applications.",
        "Thus, for example, a style checker or some other writing assistant tool which has been based on erroneous materials or at least materials deviant from the language targeted, will not always respond appropriately."

        "These studies are all based on data of known origin.",

        "It is important to realize that non-native use is the complex result of different processes and conditions.",
        "First of all, there is the level of achievement.",
        "A non-native user gradually developes language skills in the target language.",
        "As he/she masters certain lexical items or morpho-syntactic structures and feels confident in using them, certain items and structures are bound to be overused.",

        "This may lead to transfer effects and interference (the effects of which are found, for example, in the use of false friends and word order deviations).",
        "In the present paper, we report the results obtained in some experiments that were carried out and which aimed to assess whether texts are of (British English) native or non-native origin using the method of linguistic profiling.",

        "As previous research has shown (see e.g Biber 1995), there are a great many linguistic features that contribute to marked structural differences between texts.",
        "These features mark ‘basic grammatical, discourse, and communicative functions’ (Biber, 1995: 104).",
        "They comprise features referring to vocabulary, lexical patterning, syntax, semantics, pragmatics, information content or item distribution through a text.",
        "Here we restrict ourselves to lexical features.",
        "Sufficiently frequent tokens, i.e. those that were observed to occur with a certain frequency in some language reference corpus, are used as features by themselves.",
        "In the present case these are ítems that occur at least five times in the written texts from the BNC Sampler (BNC, 2002).",
        "For less frequent tokens, we determine a token pattern consisting of the sequence of character types.",
        "For example, the token Uefa-cup is represented by the pattern “#L#6+/CL-L”, where the first “L” indicates low frequency, 6+ the size bracket, and the sequence “CL-L” a capital letter followed by one or more lower case letters followed by a hyphen and again one or more lower case letters.",
        "For lower case words, the final three letters of the word are also included in the pattern.",
        "For example, the token altercation is represented by the pattern “#L#6+/L/ion”.",
        "These patterns were originally designed for English and Dutch and will probably have to be extended for use with other languages.",
        "Furthermore, for this specific task, we wanted to avoid recognizing text topics rather than nativeness, and decided to mask content words.",
        "Any high frequency word classified primarily as noun, verb or adjective (see below), which had a high document bias (cf. van Halteren, 2003) was replaced by the marker #HC# followed by the same type of pattern we use for low frequency words, but always without the final three letters.",
        "This occludes topical words like brain or injury, while leaving more functional words like case or times intact.",
        "In addition to the form of the token, we also use the syntactic potential of the token as a feature.",
        "We apply the first few modules of a morphosyntactic tagger (in this case the tagger described by van Halteren, 2000) to the text, which determine which word class tags could apply to each token.",
        "For known words, the tags are taken from a lexicon; for unknown words, they are estimated on the basis of the word patterns described above.",
        "The most likely tags (with a maximum of three) are combined into a single feature.",
        "Thus still is associated with the feature “RR-JJ-NN1” and forms with the feature “NN2-VVZ”.",
        "Note that the most likely tags are determined exclusively on the basis of the current token; the context in which the token occurs is not taken into account.",
        "The modules of the tagger which are normally used to obtain a context dependent disambiguation are not applied.",
        "On top of the individual token and tag features we use all possible bi and trigrams.",
        "For example, the token combination an attractive option is associated with the complex feature “wcw= #HF#an#HC#JJ#HC#6+/L”.",
        "Since the number of features quickly grows too big to allow for efficient processing, we filter the set of features.",
        "This done by requiring that a feature occur in a set minimum number of texts in the profile reference corpus (in the present case a feature must occur in at least two texts).",
        "A feature which is filtered out contributes to a rest category feature.",
        "Thus, the complex feature above would contribute to “wcw=<OTHER>”.",
        "The lexical features currently also include features that relate to utterance length.",
        "For each utterance two such features are determined, viz. the exact length (e.g. “len=15”) and the length bracket (e.g. “len=10-19”)."
