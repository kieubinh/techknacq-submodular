        "We ran both Brill’s rule-based tagger and TNT, a statistical tagger, with a default German newspaper-language model on a medical text corpus.",
        "Supplied with limited lexicon resources, TNT outperforms the Brill tagger with state-of-the-art performance figures (close to 97% accuracy).",
        "We then trained TNT on a large annotated medical text corpus, with a slightly extended tagset that captures certain medical language particularities, and achieved 98% tagging accuracy.",
        "Hence, statistical off-the-shelf POS taggers cannot only be immediately reused for medical NLP, but they also – when trained on medical corpora – achieve a higher performance level than for the newspaper genre."

        "The application of language technology in the medical field, dubbed as medical language processing (MLP), is gaining rapid recognition (for a survey, cf. Friedman and Hripcsak (1999)).",
        "It is both important, because there is strong demand for all kinds of computer support for health care and clinical services, which aim at improving their quality and decreasing their costs, and challenging – given the miracles of medical sublanguage, the various text genres one encounters and the enormous breadth of expertise surfacing as medical terminology.",
        "However, the development of human language technology for written language material has, up until now, almost exclusively focused on newswire or newspaper genres.",
        "This is most prominently evidenced by the PENN TREEBANK (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "Its value as one of the most widely used language resources mainly derives from two features.",
        "First, it supplies everyday, non-specialist document sources, such as the Wall Street Journal, and, second, it contains value-added, viz. annotated, linguistic data.",
        "Since the understanding of newspaper material does not impose particular requirements on its reader, other than the mastery of general English and common-sense knowledge, it is easy for almost everybody to deal with.",
        "This is essential for the accomplishment of the second task, viz. the annotation and reuse of part-of-speech (POS) tags and parse trees, as the result of linguistic analysis.",
        "With the help of such resources, whole generations of state-of-the-art taggers, chunkers, grammar and lexicon learners have evolved.",
        "The medical field poses new challenges.",
        "First, medical documents exhibit a large variety of structural features not encountered in newspaper documents (the genre problem), and, second, the understanding of medical language requires an enormous amount of a priori medical expertise (the domain problem).",
        "Hence, the question arises, how portable results are from the newspaper domain to the medical domain?",
        "We will deal with these issues, focusing on the portability of taggers, from two perspectives.",
        "We first pick up off-the-shelf technology, in our case the rule-based Brill tagger (Brill, 1995) and the statistically-based TNT tagger (Brants, 2000), both trained on newspaper data, and run it on medical text data.",
        "One may wonder how the taggers trained on newspaper language perform with medical language.",
        "Furthermore, one may ask whether it is necessary (and, if so, costly) to retrain these taggers on a medical corpus, if one were at hand?",
        "These questions seem to be of particular importance, because the use of off-the-shelf language technology for MLP applications has recently been questioned (Campbell and Johnson, 2001).",
        "Answers will be given in Section 2.",
        "Once a large annotated medical corpus becomes available, additional questions can be tackled.",
        "Will taggers, e.g., improve their performance substantially when trained on medical data, or is this more or less irrelevant?",
        "Also, if medical sublanguage particularities can already be identified on the level of POS co-occurrences, would it be a good idea to enhance newspaper-oriented, general-purpose tagsets with dedicated medical tags?",
        "Finally, does this extension have a bearing on the performance of tagging medical documents and, if so, to what extent?",
        "We will elaborate on these questions in Section 4."

        "Interestingly though, it has also been observed (Friedman and Hripcsak, 1999; Campbell and Johnson, 2001) that medical language shows less variation and complexity than general, newspaper-style language, thus exhibiting typical properties of a sublanguage.",

        "An easy-to-set-up medical backup lexicon eliminates this difference entirely.",
        "It appears that it is the underlying language model which determines whether a POS tagger is more or less suited to be portable to the medical domain, not the surface characteristics of medical sublanguage.",
        "Moreover, lexical backup facilities show up as a significant asset to MLP.",
        "Much to our surprise, a full-scale, carefully maintained lexicon did not substantially improve the tagger’s performance in comparison with a heuristically assembled brief list of the most common tagging mistakes.",
        "A reason for the statistical tagger’s outperfor-mance may be derived from our comparative corpus statistics, which was the focus of our second series of experiments.",
        "Concerning POS n-grams, the data points to a less varied and less complex grammar of medical sublanguage(s).",
        "Not only is the number of POS n-gram types much lower for medical narratives than for general-language newspaper texts, but the distribution also favors high-occurring (more than 1000 times) types in MED.",
        "Another indicator of a simpler POS n-gram grammar in medical narratives is the fact that the absolute number of POS n-gram types common to NEGRA and MED is much lower than for NEGRA and NEWS.",
        "Scaled against the total number of types in MED, however, the common ones cover a bigger part of the medical narratives, whereas they cover less of NEGRA.",
        "For POS trigrams, half of NEGRA is congruent with three quarters of MED; for POS bigrams three quarters of NEGRA is congruent with nine tenths of MED.",
        "Common POS n-grams that are x✁ significant indicate that two corpora are similar with respect to them.",
        "Their number was significantly higher for the NEGRA-MED comparison than for NEGRA-NEWS.",
        "Hence, the congruency of a high proportion of POS n-gram types between NEGRA and MED is not accidental.",
        "At the POS n-gram type level, this shows a higher degree of similarity between NEGRA and medical narratives than between NEGRA and other newspaper texts.",
        "Furthermore, the high x✁ numbers for the top ranked POS n-grams indicate that they are especially characteristic of the NEGRA-MED similarity.",
        "Eight of the top-ranked trigrams and bigrams can be identified as parts of a noun phrase.",
        "All of them contain a prenominal adjective (ADJA in Table 4), six a common noun (NN in Table 4).",
        "The prenominal adjective is by far the most characteristic POS unigram for medical-newspaper inter-language similarity.",
        "None of these observations hold for newspaper intra-language similarity.",
        "Our third series of experiments showed that Markovian taggers like TNT improve their performance substantially when trained on medical data.",
        "Indeed, we were able to achieve a performance boost which goes beyond current state-of-the-art numbers.",
        "This seems to be even more notable inasmuch as the tagger’s retraining was done on a comparatively small-sized corpus (90,000 tokens).",
        "These experiments suggest two explanations.",
        "First, annotating medical texts with a medically enhanced tagset took care of medical sublanguage properties not covered by general-purpose tagsets.",
        "Second, several tagging experiments on newspaper language, whether statistical (Ratnaparkhi, 1996; Brants, 2000) or rule-based (Brill, 1995), report that the tagging accuracy for unknown words is much lower than the overall accuracy.2 Thus, the lower percentage of unknown words in medical texts seems to be a sublanguage feature beneficial to POS taggers, whereas the higher proportion of unknown words in newspaper language seems to be a prominent source of tagging errors.",
        "This is witnessed by the tagging accuracy for unknown words, which is much higher for the FRAMED-trained tagger than for the newspaper-trained one.",
        "For the medical tagger, there is only a 5 percentage point difference between overall and unknown word accuracy at training point 90,000, whereas, for the newspaper tagger, this difference amounts to 8.8 percentage points.",
        "This may be interrelated with another property of sublanguages, viz. their lower number of word types: At each training point, the lexicon of the FRAMED tagger is 20 percentage points smaller than that of the newspaper tagger.",
        "TNT’s handling of unknown words relies on the probability distribution for a particular (formal) suffix of some fixed length (cf. Brants (2000)).",
        "Thus, guessing an unknown word’s category is easier on a small-sized tagger lexicon, because there are less choices for the POS category of a word with a paricular suffix.",
        "Only recently has the accuracy of data-driven POS taggers moved beyond the the ‘97% barrier’ (derived from newspaper corpora).",
        "This was partly achieved by computationally more expensive models than TNT’s efficienct unidirectional Markovian one.",
        "For example, Gim´enez and M`arquez (2003) report an accuracy of 97.13% for their SVM-based power tagger.",
        "The best automatically learned POS-tagging result reported so far (97.24%) is Toutanova et al.",
        "(2003)’s feature-based cyclic dependency network tagger.",
        "Although reaching the 98% accuracy level constitutes a breakthrough, it is of course conditioned by the medical sublanguage we are working with.",
        "Still, the application of language technologies in certain sublanguage domains like medicine, and more recently, genomics and biology, is gaining rapid importance, and thus, our results also have to be considered from this perspective."

        "We collected experimental evidence, contrary to recent claims (Campbell and Johnson, 2001), that off-the-shelf NLP tools can be applied to MLP in a straightforward way.",
        "We explain this finding with statistically significant POS n-gram type overlaps of newspaper language and medical sublanguage, which has not been recognized before.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first tagging study that reaches a 98% accuracy level for a data-driven tagger (which must be distinguished from linguistically backuped taggers which come with ‘heavy’ parsing machinery (Samuelsson and Voutilainen, 1997)).",
        "Still, we deal with a specialized sublanguage simpler in structure compared with newspaper language, although we kept it diverse through the various text genres.",
