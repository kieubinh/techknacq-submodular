        "Natural language is an open and very flexible communication system.",
        "Syntax, of course, imposes constraints, e.g., on word order or the occurrence of particular phrasal types such as PPs or NPs, and lexical semantics imposes, e.g., selectional constraints on conceptually permitted sorts or types within the context of specific verbs or nouns.",
        "Nevertheless, natural language speakers usually enjoy an enormous degree of freedom to express the content they want to convey in a great variety of linguistic forms.",
        "There is, however, a significant subset of expressions which do not share this rather free combinability, so-called collocations.",
        "From a linguistic perspective, they can be characterized by at least three recurrent and prominent properties (Manning and Sch¨utze, 1999):",
        "• Non-(or limited) compositionality.",
        "The meaning of a collocation is not a straightforward composition of the meanings of its parts.",
        "For example, the meaning of ‘red tape’ is completely different from the meaning of its components.",
        "• Non-(or limited) substitutability.",
        "The parts of a collocation cannot be substituted by semantically similar words.",
        "Thus, ‘gut’ in ‘to spill gut’ cannot be substituted by ‘intestine’ (see also Lin (1999)).",
        "• Non-(or limited) modifiability.",
        "Many collocations cannot be supplemented by additional lexical material.",
        "For example, the noun in ‘to kick the bucket’ cannot be modified as ‘to kick the {holey/plastic/water} bucket’.",
        "Considering these observations, from a natural language processing perspective, collocations should not enter, e.g., the standard syntax-semantics pipeline so as to prevent compositional semantic readings of expressions for which this is absolutely not desired.",
        "Hence, collocations need to be identified as such and subsequently be blocked, e.g., from compositional semantic interpretation.",
        "In computational linguistics, a wide variety of lexical association measures have been employed for the task of (semi-)automatic collocation identification and extraction.",
        "Almost all of these measures can be grouped into one of the following three categories:",
        "• frequency-based measures (e.g., based on absolute and relative co-occurrence frequencies) • information-theoretic measures (e.g., mutual information, entropy) • statistical measures (e.g., chi-square, t-test, log-likelihood, Dice’s coefficient)",
        "The corresponding metrics have been extensively discussed in the literature both in terms of their mathematical properties (Dunning, 1993; Manning and Sch¨utze, 1999) and their suitability for the task of collocation extraction (see Evert and Krenn (2001) and Krenn and Evert (2001) for recent evaluations).",
        "Typically, they are applied to a set of candidate lexeme pairs which were obtained from preprocessors varying in linguistic sophistication.",
        "The selected measure then assigns an association score",
        "to each candidate pair, which is computed from its joint and marginal frequencies, thus expressing the strength of the hypothesis stating whether it constitutes a collocation or not.",
        "While these association measures have their statistical merits in collocation identification, it is interesting to note that they have relatively little to do with the linguistic properties (such as those mentioned at the beginning) which are typically associated with the notion of collocativity.",
        "Therefore, it may be interesting to investigate whether there is a way to implement a measure which directly incorporates linguistic criteria in the collocation identification task, and even more important, whether such a linguistically rooted approach would fare better in comparison to some of the standard lexical association measures.",
        "In the following study, we will introduce such a linguistic measure for identifying PP-verb collocations in German, which is based on the property of non or limited modifiability.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to use this kind of linguistic measure to acquire collocations automatically.",
        "By contrasting our method to previous studies which use the standard lexical association measures, we intend to emphasize a more linguistically inspired use of statistics in collocation mining.",
        "Section 2 motivates our definition of the notion of collocation and Section 3 describes our methods, in particular the linguistically grounded collocation extraction algorithm, and the experimental setup derived from it.",
        "In Section 4 we present and discuss the results of our experiments."

        "There have been various approaches to define the notion of ‘collocation’.",
        "This is by no means an easy task, especially when it comes to defining the demarcation line between collocations and free word combinations (modulo general syntactic and semantic semantic constraints).",
        "We favor an approach which draws this line on the semantic layer, viz. the compositionality between the components of a linguistic expression.",

        "lexical components involved contribute to the overall meaning in a semantically transparent way.",

        "Its figurative meaning is ‘to lampoon somebody’.",
        "2.",
        "Support Verb Constructions/Narrow Collocations.",

        "‘Verf¨ugung’ is the semantic core of the expression, whereas the verb only has a support function with some impact on argument structure, causativity or aktionsart.",
        "There are, however, also narrow collocations in which the basic lexical meaning of the verb is the semantic core: For example, in ‘aus eigener Tasche bezahlen’ (‘to pay out of one’s own pocket’) the verb ‘bezahlen’ is the semantic core.",
        "What unifies these two types is the fact that they function as predicates.",

        "more transparent way.",
        "Still, they are not as completely compositional as to classify them as free word combinations.",
        "For example, all the basic lexical meanings of the different lexical components in ‘im Koma liegen’ (literal: ‘to lie in coma’; actual: ‘to be comatose’) contribute to the overall meaning of the expression.",
        "Still, this is different from a completely compositional free word combination, such as ‘auf der Strasse gehen’ (‘to walk on the street’).",
        "Our goal is to consider all three types of collocations as a whole, i.e., we will not distinguish between the three different kinds of collocations.",
        "However, in order to focus our experiments, we will concentrate on a particular surface pattern in which they occur, viz. PP-verb collocations."

        "Although the modifiability property constitutes common wisdom about collocations, it has not yet been empirically evaluated.",
        "Thus, we ran an experiment which took both the PNV triples classified as collocations and the PNV triples classified as non-collocations and counted the numbers of distinct supplements (referred to as n in Subsection 3.3).",
        "From this data, we set up a distribution of collocational and non-collocational PNV triples in which the distributional ranking criterion was the number of distinct supplements (cf.",
        "Figure 3).",
        "As Figure 3 reveals, not only is the proportion of collocational PNV triples with only one distinct supplement higher (36%) than the proportion for non-collocational ones (20%), but with each additional supplement, the collocational proportion curve declines more steeply than its non-collocational counterpart.",
        "Moreover, the collocational proportion curve already ends with 54 distinct supplements, whereas the non-collocational proportion curve leads up 520 distinct supplements.",
        "Thus, we are able to add some empirical grounding to the widespread textbook assumption about the limited modifiablity of collocations.",
        "Another observation (which is also inherent to our linguistic measure) based on this experiment is that some collocations do possess at least limited modifiability.",
        "Collocation acquisition is, of course, not a goal by itself, but rather aims at creating collocation lexicons for both language processing and generation (Smadja and McKeown, 1990).",

        "Smadja (1993), which is the classic work on collocation extraction, uses a two-stage filtering model in which, in the first step, n-gram statistics determine possible collocations and, in the second step, these candidates are submitted to a syntactic validation procedure (e.g., determining verb-object collocations) in order to filter out invalid collocations.",
        "In a single-judge evaluation of 4,000 collocation candidates, the incorporation of linguistic criteria (via tagging and predicate-argument parsing) boosts precision up to a level of 80% and recall to 94%.",
        "These results are, of course, not comparable to ours.",
        "First of all, precision and recall are measured at a fixed point for a fixed unranked candidate list.",
        "In order to obtain more reliable evaluation results, we plot these values continuously on a ranked candidate list.",
        "Secondly, our kind of syntactic preprocessing (which is standard nowadays) allows collocation extraction algorithms to better control the structural types of collocations.",
        "Lin (1998) acquires a lexical dependency database by assembling dependency relationships from a parsed corpus.",
        "An entry in this database is classified as collocation if its log-likelihood value is greater than some threshold.",
        "Using an automatically constructed similarity thesaurus, Lin (1999) then separates compositional from non-compositional collocations by taking into account the second linguistic property described in Section 1, viz. their non or limited substitutability.",
        "In particular, he checks the existence and mutual information values of phrases obtained by substituting the words with similar ones, which results in the classification of the phrase as being compositional or non-compositional.",
        "Although this study offers some promising results, its applicability rather falls into the category of fine-classifying an already acquired set of collocations, e.g., according to the criteria described in Section 2, and thus is not really comparable to our work.",
        "Moreover, the linguistic property in his focus is of course a semantic one, whereas ours is purely syntactic in nature."
