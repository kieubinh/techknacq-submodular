        "Information extraction from tables in web pages is a challenging problem due to the diverse nature of table formats and the vocabulary variants in attribute names.",
        "This paper presents a new approach to automated table extraction that exploits formatting cues in semi-structured HTML tables, learns lexical variants from training examples and uses a vector space model to deal with non-exact matches among labels.",
        "We conducted experiments with this method on a set of tables collected from 157 university web sites, and obtained the information extraction performance of 91.4% in the F1-measure, showing the effectiveness of the combined use of structural table parsing and example-based label learning."

        "Tables are an important means of presenting information and are widely used on the web for the reason that they show relational data in a form concise and easy to read by human eyes.",
        "Automatic extraction of tables has applications in information retrieval, knowledge acquisition, summarization and web mining.",
        "A table is made of cells.",
        "Each cell is either a label cell (attribute name) or a data cell (attribute value).",
        "The task of table extraction involves differentiating between the two types of cells and identifying the associations between labels and data.",
        "Automatic information extraction from tables is a challenging problem since tables are designed for viewing by humans and not for understanding by computers.",
        "A table which is unambiguous for humans may still be difficult to parse by a computer.",
        "Figure 1 shows such an example: a table of student enrollment statistics (in a particular year) provided by a university.",
        "The layout of the table, the positions of the labels and the data, the meaning of the words, the shaded areas, and the contrasts between empty and non-empty cells together make the table readable and unambiguous for human understanding.",
        "However, it is not so obvious how a system can identify which cells are the attribute labels and which cells are the attribute values.",
        "The nested structure of labels makes the problem further complicated.",
        "For example, \"Undergraduates\" and \"Degree-seeking, first-time freshmen\" together define the row coordinate of a data cell, while \"Full-Time\" and \"Men\" together define the column coordinate of the data cell.",
        "Clearly, for tables as in the given example, relying on HTML tags along will not be sufficient to parse a table and to interpret the meanings of its cells.",
        "A better approach is to jointly use layout information (including HTML tags) and lexical constraints in the parsing of a table, and to learn those constraints automatically from training examples.",
        "Another challenging issue in table extraction is dealing with the formatting differences and lexical variants in the tables that have the same semantic structures.",
        "The Common Data Set (CDS) tables available on different university web sites are a good example.",
        "The Common Data Set (CDS) initiative is a collaborative effort among data providers in the higher education community and publishers to define a standard format for university data.",
        "However, the tables that appear on the university web sites differ greatly in terms of HTML formatting, lexical variants of labels, extra or missing portions in those tables, etc.",
        "Mapping the various forms of those tables in distributed web sites to the unified underlying structures (predefined) is indeed a non-trivial problem.",
        "We propose a simple and yet effective learning algorithm that learns lexical variants of attribute names from training examples, and that employs a vector space model to support \"fuzzy\" match between lexical variants and canonical forms of attribute names.",
        "In our view this is the first work which provides a complete solution for extraction from HTML tables.",
        "We have not encountered any experimental evaluation of table extraction in the literature that can be used as a reference of comparison with our work.",
        "Therefore we have defined our own evaluation methodology.",
        "The research questions we address here for table extraction are: 1) how to use the layout information provided by the HTML tags, 2) how to learn from existing tables and predefined structures, 3) how to deal with lexical constraints of labels to improve the efficiency, and 4) how to evaluate the effectiveness of table extraction.",
        "The rest of the paper has been organized as follows: In section 2 we discuss the related work done in this area.",
        "Section 3 describes our algorithm and Section 4 describes our experimental setup and evaluation results.",
        "In Section 5 we present the conclusions."

        "The table detection task involves separating tables that contain logical and relational information from those that are used for formatting the layout.",
        "The input to a table detection system is documents containing both real tables and tables used for layout formatting.",
        "The output is a classification of the data into real tables and non-real tables.",
        "The task of table detection is sometimes the first step for performing table extraction because it needs real tables.",

        "(Chen et al., 2000) presents work on table detection and extraction on HTML tables.",

        "They split the cells which span over multiple cells into individual cells.",

        "The paper did not provide evaluation results for their table extraction algorithm.",
        "The problem of merging different tables which are about the same type of information has been addressed in (Yoshida et al., 2001).",
        "The merging task as defined in the paper considers combining different tables into one large table.",
        "They define different structures for tables based on the arrangement of the labels and use Expectation Maximization to classify the tables to one of the defined structures.",
        "The structure recognition task is similar to the classification task.",

        "Table extraction by wrapper learning has been explored in (Cohen et al., 2002).",
        "Wrappers learn rules based on examples.",
        "The rules are composed of tokens made of HTML tags or the content itself.",
        "The rules tend to be specific and can be applied only to those documents whose structure is similar to the training documents.",
        "The use of tokens to compose rules makes it difficult to generalize across distributed websites.",
        "Hence wrappers learned for one website cannot be used on another website.",
        "No clear evaluation for table extraction has been described this work.",
        "Conditional random fields for table extraction from ASCII tables have been described in (Pinto et al., 2003).",
        "However the system described does not perform a complete table extraction task – it only classifies the rows of the table into a type such as \"datarow\", \"sectionheader\" or \"superheader\".",
