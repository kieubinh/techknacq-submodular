        "The evaluative character of a word is called its semantic orientation (SO).",
        "A positive SO indicates desirability (e.g. Good, Honest) and a negative SO indicates undesirability (e.g., Bad, Ugly).",
        "This paper presents a method, based on Turney (2003), for inferring the SO of a word from its statistical association with strongly-polarized words and morphemes in Chinese.",
        "It is noted that morphemes are much less numerous than words, and that also a small number of fundamental morphemes may be used in the modified system to great advantage.",
        "The algorithm was tested on 1,249 words (604 positive and 645 negative) in a corpus of 34 million words, and was run with 20 and 40 polarized words respectively, giving a high precision (79.96% to 81.05%), but a low recall (45.56% to 59.57%).",
        "The algorithm was then run with 20 polarized morphemes, or single characters, in the same corpus, giving a high precision of 80.23% and a high recall of 85.03%.",
        "We concluded that morphemes in Chinese, as in any language, constitute a distinct sub-lexical unit which, though small in number, has greater linguistic significance than words, as seen by the significant enhancement of results with a much smaller corpus than that required by Turney."

        "The semantic orientation (SO) of a word indicates the direction in which the word deviates from the norm for its semantic group or lexical field (Lehrer, 1974).",
        "Words that encode a desirable state (e.g., beautiful) have a positive SO, while words that represent undesirable states (e.g. absurd) have a negative SO (Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe, 2000).",
        "Hatzivassiloglou and Mckeown (1997) used the words ‘and’, ‘or’, and ‘but’ as linguistic cues to extract adjective pairs.",
        "Turney (2003) assessed the SO of words using their occurrences near strongly-polarized words like ‘excellent’ and ‘poor’ with accuracy from 61% to 82%, subject to corpus size.",
        "Turney’s algorithm requires a colossal corpus (hundred billion words) indexed by the AltaVista search engine in his experiment.",
        "Undoubtedly, internet texts have formed a very large and easily-accessible corpus.",
        "However, Chinese texts in internet are not segmented so it is not cost-effective to use them.",
        "This paper presents a general strategy for inferring SO for Chinese words from their association with some strongly-polarized morphemes.",
        "The modified system of using morphemes was proved to be more effective than strongly-polarized words in a much smaller corpus.",
        "Related work and potential applications of SO are discussed in section 2.",
        "Section 3 illustrates one of the methods of Turney’s model for inferring SO, namely, Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI), based on the hypothesis that the SO of a word tends to correspond to the SO of its neighbours.",
        "The experiment with polarized words is presented in section 4.",
        "The test set includes 1,249 words (604 positive and 645 negative).",
        "In a corpus of 34 million word tokens, 410k word types, the algorithm is run with 20 and 40 polarized words, giving a precision of 79.96% and 81.05%, and a recall of 45.56% and 59.57%, respectively.",
        "The system is further modified by using polarized morphemes in section 5.",
        "We first evaluate the distinction of Chinese morphemes to justify why the modification can probably give simpler and better results, and then introduce a more scientific selection of polarized morphemes.",
        "A high precision of 80.23% and a greatly increased recall of 85.03% are yielded.",
        "In section 6, the algorithm is run with 14, 10 and 6 morphemes, giving a precision of 79.15%, 79.89% and 75.65%, and a recall of 79.50%, 73.26% and 66.29% respectively.",
        "It shows that the algorithm can be also effectively run with 6 to 10 polarized morphemes in a smaller corpus.",
        "The conclusion and future work are discussed in section 7."

        "Hatzivassiloglou and Mckeown (1997) presented a method for automatically assigning a + or – orientation label to adjectives known to have some SO by the linguistic constraints on the use of adjectives in conjunctions.",
        "For example, ‘and’ links adjectives that have the same SO, while ‘but’ links adjectives that have opposite SO.",
        "They devised an algorithm based on such constraints to evaluate 1,336 manually-labeled adjectives (657 positive and 679 negative) with 97% accuracy in a corpus of 21 million words.",
        "Turney (2003) introduced a method for automatically inferring the direction and intensity of the SO of a word from its statistical association with a set of positive and negative paradigm words, i.e., strongly-polarized words.",
        "The algorithm was evaluated on 3,596 words (1,614 positive and 1,982 negative) including adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and verbs.",
        "An accuracy of 82.8% was attained in a corpus of hundred billion words.",
        "SO can be used to classify reviews (e.g., movie reviews) as positive or negative (Turney, 2002), and applied to subjectivity analysis such as recognizing hostile messages, classifying emails, mining reviews (Wiebe et al., 2001).",
        "The first step of those applications is to recognize that the text is subjective and then the second step, naturally, is to determine the SO of the subjective text.",
        "Also, it can be used to summarize argumentative articles like editorials of news media.",
        "A summarization system would benefit from distinguishing sentences intended to present factual materials from those intended to present opinions, since many summaries are meant to include only facts."

        "Turney (2003) examined SO-PMI (Pointwise Mutual Information) and SO-LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis).",
        "SO-PMI will be our focus in the following parts.",
        "PMI is defined as:",
        "where p(word1 & word2) is the probability that word1 and word2 co-occur.",
        "If the words are statistically independent, the probability that they co-occur is given by the product p(word1) p(word2).",
        "The ratio between p(word1 & word2) and p(word1) p(word2) is a measure of the degree of statistical dependence between the words.",
        "The SO of a given word is calculated from the strength of its association with a set of positive words, minus the strength of its association with a set of negative words.",
        "Thus the SO of a word, word, is calculated by SO-PMI as follows:",
        "where Pwords is a set of 7 positive paradigm words (good, nice, excellent, positive, fortunate, correct, and superior) and Nwords is a set of 7 negative paradigm words (bad, nasty, poor, negative, unfortunate, wrong, and inferior).",
        "Those 14 words were chosen by intuition and based on opposing pairs (good/bad, excellent/poor, etc.).",
        "The words are rather insensitive to context, i.e., ‘excellent’ is positive in almost all contexts.",
        "A word, word, is classified as having a positive SO when SO-PMI(word) is positive and a negative SO when SO-PMI(word) is negative.",
        "Turney (2003) used the Alta Vista Advanced search engine with a NEAR operator, which constrains the search to documents that contain the words within ten words of one another, in either order.",
        "Three corpora were tested.",
        "AV-ENG is the largest corpus covering 350 million web pages (English only) indexed by Alta Vista.",
        "The medium corpus is a 2% subset of AV-ENG corpus called AV-CA (Canadian domain only).",
        "The smallest corpus TASA is about 0.5% of AV-CA and contains various short documents.",
        "One of the lexicons used in Turney’s experiment is the GI lexicon (Stone et al., 1966), which consists of 3,596 adjectives, adverbs, nouns, and verbs, 1,614 positive and 1,982 negative.",
        "Table 1 shows the precision of SO-PMI with the GI lexicon in the three corpora.",
        "The strength (absolute value) of the SO was used as a measure of confidence that the words will be correctly classified.",
        "Test set words were sorted in descending order of the absolute value of their SO and the top ranked words (the highest confidence words) were then classified.",
        "For example, the second row (starting with 75%) in table 1 shows the precision when the top 75% were classified and the last 25% (with lowest confidence) were ignored.",
        "We will employ this measure of confidence in the following experiments.",
        "Turney concluded that SO-PMI requires a large corpus (hundred billion words), but it is simple, easy to implement, unsupervised, and it is not restricted to adjectives."

        "The experiment details include: NEAR Operator: it was applied to constrain the search to documents that contain the words within ten words of one another, in either order.",
        "Corpus: the LIVAC synchronous corpus (Tsou et al., 2000, http://www.livac.org) was used.",
        "It covers 9-year news reports of Chinese communities including Hong Kong, Beijing and Taiwan, and we used a sub-corpus with about 34 million word tokens and 410k word types.",
        "Test Set Words: a combined set of two dictionaries of polarized words (Guo, 1999, Wang, 2001) was used to evaluate the results.",
        "While LIVAC is an enormous Chinese corpus, its size is still far from the hundred-billion-word corpus used by Turney.",
        "It is likely that some words in the combined set are not used in the 9-year corpus.",
        "To avoid a skewed recall, the number of test set words used in the corpus is given in table 2.",
        "In other words, the recall can be calculated by the total number of words used in the corpus, but not by that recorded in the dictionaries.",
        "The difference between two numbers is ijust 100.",
        "Paradigm words: The paradigm words were chosen using intuition and based on opposing pairs, as Turney (2003) did.",
        "The first experiment was conducted with 10 positive and 10 negative paradigm words, as follows, Pwords: (honest), (clever), (sufficient), basic constructions for deriving disyllabic words in Chinese, including: (1) combination of synonyms or near synonyms ( , warm, genial, =warm, mild, In table 6, the precision of 80.23% is slightly better than 79.96% of the 20-word condition, and just 1% lower than that of the 40-word condition.",
        "However, the recall drastically increases from 45.56%, or 59.57% under the 40-word condition, to 85.03%.",
        "In other words, the algorithm run with 20 Chinese paradigm morphemes resulted not only in high precision but also much higher recall than Chinese paradigm words in the same corpus.",
        "% of test set 100% 75% 1 50% 25% Size of test set 1249 937 625 312 recall could be attributed to the low frequency of test set words.",
        "Therefore, 6 to 10 morphemes are already ideal for deducing the SO of high-frequency words.",
        "Morpheme",
        "Thus, conveniently defined morphemes in Chinese enhance the effectiveness of the algorithm by simplifying processing and yielding better results even in a smaller corpus compared with what Turney (2003) used.",
        "Just 6 to 10 morphemes can give satisfactory results in a smaller corpus.",
        "The efficient application of Turney’s algorithm with help of colossal corpus like hundred-billion-word corpus is matched by the ready availability of internet texts.",
        "However, the same convenience is not available to Chinese because of the heavy cost of word segmentation.",

        "In our experiment, all syntactic markers are ignored.",
        "Better results can be expected if syntactic markers are taken into consideration.",
        "An obvious example is negation (not, never) which can counteract the polarity of a word.",
        "In future, we will try to handle negation and other syntactic markers.",
        "The lists of the probability of morphemes forming polarized words in section 5.2 can be handled by the concept of decision list (Yarowsky, 2000) which has not been applied in this paper for simplification.",
        "In the future, decision lists can be employed to systematically include the loaded features of morphemes.",
        "The experiment can be conducted with different sets of paradigm morphemes, and on corpora of different sizes.",
        "With the LIVAC synchronous corpus (Tsou et al., 2000), it should be possible to compare the SO of some words in different communities like Beijing, Hong Kong and Taipei.",
        "The data would be valuable for cultural studies if the SO of some words fluctuates in different communities.",
        "SO from association can be also applied to the judgment of news articles like editorials on celebrities.",
        "Given a celebrity name or organization name, we can calculate, using SO-PMI, the strength of SO of the ‘given word’, i.e., the name.",
        "Then we would be able to tell whether the news about the target is positive or negative.",
        "For example, we tried to calculate the SO-PMI of the name ‘George W Bush’, the U.S. President, with thousands of polarized Chinese words in the corpus, it was found that the SO-PMI of ‘Bush’ was about -200 from January to February, 2003, and plunged to -500 from March to April, 2003, when U.S. launched an ‘unauthorized war’ against Iraq.",
        "Such useful applications will be further investigated in future."
