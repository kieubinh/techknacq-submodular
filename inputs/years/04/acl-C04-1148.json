        "This project is based on the participation of voluntary contributors.",
        "In order to be really attractive, this project must imperatively find a convenient solution so that contributors can easily edit the dictionary entries.",
        "Since Papillon dictionary is available on a web server and the contributors are located all around the world, the obvious solution is to implement an editor available online.",
        "Unfortunately, the existing solutions (HTML forms, java applets) have important limitations.",
        "Thus, we propose an entirely generic solution that can adapt very easily not only the interfaces to the various entry structures needing to be edited but also to the user needs and competences.",
        "Firstly, we outline the issue addressed in this paper; and draw up an overview of the existing methods for dictionary entry edition.",

        "The first step is to prepare preexisting data on the server (implemented here in Macintosh Common Lisp).",
        "Then, the data is converted into rtf by using a different Word style for each part of information (the style ”headword” for the headword, the style ”pos” for the part-of-speech, etc.)",

        "It was considered as a very convenient method, nevertheless, two important drawbacks prevented us to reuse this solution.",
        "The first is that in order to convert easily from the database to rtf and vice-versa, the dictionary entry structure cannot be too complex.",
        "Furthermore, when the user edits the entry with Word, it is very difficult to control the syntax of the entry, even if some Word macros can partially remedy this problem.",
        "The second is the communication between the users and the database.",
        "The Word files have to be sent to the users, for example via email.",
        "It introduces inevitably some delay.",
        "Furthermore, during the time when the file is stored on the user machine, no other user can edit the contents of the file.",

        "Theoretically, it is possible to develop an ad hoc editor for any complicated structure, like the 3.1 solution.",
        "Nevertheless, the problems linked to the use of a java applet are numerous: the client machine must have java installed, and it must be the same java version of the applet.",
