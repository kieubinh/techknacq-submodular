        "Many different methods have been previously proposed to mine parallel sentences from multilingual corpora.",
        "Many of these algorithms are described in detail in (Manning and Schiitze, 1999, Dale et al., 2000, Veronis 2001).",
        "The challenge of these tasks varies according to the degree of comparability of the input multilingual documents.",
        "Existing work extract parallel sentences from parallel, noisy parallel or comparable corpora based on the assumption that parallel sentences should be similar in sentence length, sentence order and bi-lexical context.",
        "In our work, we try to find parallel sentences from a quasi-comparable corpus, and we find that many of assumptions in previous work are no longer applicable in this case.",
        "Alternatively, we propose an effective, multilevel bootstrapping approach to accomplish this task (Figure 1).",
        "Extraction of matching bilingual segments from non-parallel data has remained a challenging task after almost a decade.",
        "Previously, the author and other researchers had suggested that bi-lexical information based on context can still be used to find correspondences between passages, sentences, or words, in non-parallel, comparable texts of the same topic (Fung and McKeown 1995, Rapp 1995, Grefenstette 1998, Fung and Lo 1998, Kikui 1999).",
        "More recent works on parallel sentence extraction from comparable data align documents first, before extracting sentences from the aligned documents (Munteanu and Marcu, 2002, Zhao and Vogel, 2002).",
        "Both work used a translation model trained from parallel corpus and adaptively extract more parallel sentences and bilingual lexicon in the comparable corpus.",
        "In Zhao and Vogel (2002), the comparable corpus consists of Chinese and English versions of new stories from the Xinhua News agency.",
        "Munteanu and Marcu (2002) used unaligned segments from the French-English Hansard corpus and finds parallel sentences among them.",
        "Zhao and Vogel (2002) used a generative statistical machine translation alignment model, Munteanu and Marcu (2002) used suffix trees-based alignment model, and Munteanu and Marcu (2004) used a maximum entropy based classifier trained from parallel corpus to extract matching sentences from a comparable corpus of Arabic and English news.",
        "The comparable corpora used in all these work consist of documents on the same topic.",
