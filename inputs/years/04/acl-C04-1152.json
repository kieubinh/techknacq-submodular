        "Automatic word segmentation is a basic requirement for unsupervised learning in morphological analysis.",

        "We derive a local expression for the change in description length under resegmentation, i.e., one which depends only on properties of the specific prefix (not on the rest of the corpus).",

        "Although computational morphological analyzers have existed for many years for a number of languages, there are still many languages for which no such analyzer exists, but for which there is an abundance of electronically-available text.",

        "Supervised learning methods, on the other hand, require annotated data, which is often scarce or nonexistent, and is also costly to develop.",
        "For this reason, there is increasing interest in unsupervised learning of morphology, in which unannotated text is analysed to find morphological structures.",
        "Even approximate unsupervised morphological analysis can be useful, as an aid to human annotators.",
        "This paper addresses a key task for unsupervised morphological analysis: word segmentation, segmenting words into their most basic meaningful constituents (substrings), called morphs (orthographic realizations of morphemes).",
        "We adopt the minimum description length (MDL) approach to word segmentation, which has been shown to be effective in recent work (notably (Goldsmith, 2001) and (Brent et al., 1995)).",
        "The minimum description length principle (Barron et al., 1998) is an information-theoretic criterion to prefer that model for observed data which gives a minimal length coding of the observed data set (given the model) together with the model itself."

        "Our key contribution is to show how a local formulation of description length (DL) for word segmentation enables an efficient algorithm (based on pattern-matching methods) for greedy morphological segmentation of the corpus.",
        "We thus provide a search framework method which avoids some restrictions needed in previous work for efficiency.",

        "The algorithm we have devised is generic, in that it may easily be applied to any local description length model.",
        "Early results of our method, as evaluated by examination of the morphs it extracts, show high accuracy in finding meaningful morphs based solely on orthographic considerations; in fact, we find that Model 1, which depends only on the number of morphs in the dictionary (and not on frequencies in the corpus at all) gives surprisingly good results, though Model 2 may generally be preferable (more experiments on varied and larger corpora still remain to be run).",
        "We see two immediate directions for future work.",
        "The first comprises direct improvements to the techniques presented here.",
        "Rather than segmenting prefixes and suffixes separately, the data structures and algorithms should be extended to segment both prefixes and suffixes in the current morph list, depending on which gives the best overall DL improvement.",
        "Related is the need to enable approximate matching of ‘boundary’ characters due to orthographic shifts such as - y to - i -, as well as incorporating other orthographic filters on possible morphs (such as requiring prefixes to contain a vowel).",

        "efficient beam-search algorithm (avoiding copying the entire data structure), which may improve accuracy over the current greedy search method.",
        "In addition, we will investigate the use of more sophisticated DL models, including, for example, semantic similarity between candidate affixes and stems, using the probability of occurrence of individual characters for coding, or using n-gram probabilities for coding the corpus as a sequence of morphs (instead of the unigram coding model used here and previously).",
        "The second direction involves integrating the current algorithm into a larger system for more comprehensive morphological analysis.",
        "As noted above, due to the greedy nature of the search, a recombination step may be needed to ’glue’ morphs that got incorrectly separated (such as un- and -der-).",
        "More fundamentally, we intend to use the algorithm presented here (with the above extensions) as a subroutine in a paradigm construction system along the lines of Goldsmith (2001).",
