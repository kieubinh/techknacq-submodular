        "Among the dependents of a verb, arguments are key participants in the event described by the verb, while adjuncts comprise secondary information concerning the ‘setting’ of the event (its context, location etc.).",

        "Therefore, a significant disproportion between the number of complements and non-complements (adjuncts and non-dependents) arises among the candidates (complements being significantly fewer).",
        "This disproportion causes a significant drop in the minority (or positive) class (i.e. complements) prediction accuracy.",
        "Henceforth by adjuncts we will mean non-complements.",
        "The problem of class imbalance has been dealt with in previous work in different ways: oversampling of the minority class until it consists of as many examples as the majority (or negative) class (Japkowicz 2000), undersampling of the majority class (either random or focused), their combination (Ling and Li 1998), the implementation of cost-sensitive classifiers (Domingos 1999), and the ROC convex hull method (Provost and Fawcett 2001).",
        "In general, undersampling the majority class leads to better classifier performances than oversampling the minority class (Chawla et al.",
        "2002).",
        "Therefore, we apply One-sided Sampling and Tomek links (Tomek 1976) to our training data to obtain a more balanced subset of the initial training set by pruning out noisy and redundant instances of the majority class.",
        "This approach has been used in the past in several domains such as image processing (Kubat and Matwin 1997), medicine (Laurikkala 2001), text categorization (Lewis and Gale 1994), and we apply it here for the first time to lexical acquisition.",
        "A novel variation in detecting Tomek links in this work is the metric used for calculating the distance between instance vectors.",
        "Features in our task take exclusively nominal values.",
        "We therefore experiment with the value difference metric (Stan-fill and Waltz 1986) besides the broadly used Euclidean distance.",
