        "Approaches to Machine Translation (MT) using Data-Oriented Parsing (DOP: (Bod, 1998; Bod et al., 2003)) require (source,target) tree fragments aligned at sentential and sub-sentential levels.",
        "In previous approaches to Data-Oriented Translation (DOT: (Poutsma, 2000; Hearne and Way, 2003)), such fragments were produced manually.",
        "This is time-consuming, error-prone, and requires considerable expertise of both source and target languages as well as how they are related.",
        "The obvious solution, therefore, is to automate the process of sub-sentential alignment.",
        "However, while there are many approaches to sentential alignment e.g. (Kay and R¨oscheisen, 1993; Gale & Church, 1993), no methods exist for aligning non-isomorphic phrase-structure (PS) tree fragments at sub-sentential level for use in MT.",
        "(Matsumoto et al., 1993) align (source,target) dependency trees, with a view to resolve parsing ambiguities, but their approach cannot deal with complex or compound sentences.",
        "Other researchers (Imamura, 2001) also use phrase-alignment in parsing but in DOT the translation fragments are already in the form of parse-trees.",
        "(Eisner, 2003) outlines a computationally expensive structural manipulation tool which he has used for intra-lingual translation but has yet to apply to interlingual translation.",
        "(Gildea, 2003) performs tree-to-tree alignment, but treats it as part of a generative statistical translation model, rather than a seperate task.",
        "The method of (Ding et al., 2003) can cope with a limited amount of non-isomorphism, but the algorithm is only suitable for use with dependency trees.",
        "We develop a novel algorithm which automatically aligns translationally equivalent tree fragments in a fast and consistent fashion, and which requires little or no knowledge of the language pair.",
        "Our approach is similar to that of (Menezes and Richardson, 2003), who use a best-first approach to align dependency-type tree structures.",
        "We conduct a number of experiments on the English-French section of the Xerox HomeCentre corpus.",
        "Using the manual alignment of (Hearne and Way, 2003) as a ‘gold standard’, we show that our algorithm identifies sub-structural translational equivalences with 73.7% precision and 67.84% recall.",
        "Furthermore, we replicate previous DOT experiments performed using manually aligned data.",
        "However, we use data aligned by our novel algorithm and evaluate the output translations.",
        "We demonstrate that while coverage decreases by 10%, the translations output are of comparable quality.",
        "These results indicate that our automatic alignment algorithm provides a serious alternative to manual alignment.",
