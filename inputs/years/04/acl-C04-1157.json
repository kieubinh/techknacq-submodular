        "Ellipsis is a linguistic phenomenon that has received considerable attention, mostly focusing on its interpretation.",
        "Most work on ellipsis (Fiengo and May, 1994; Lappin, 1993; Dalrym-ple et al., 1991; Kehler, 1993; Shieber et al., 1996) is aimed at discerning the procedures and the level of language processing at which ellipsis resolution takes place, or focuses on ambiguous and difficult cases.",
        "The detection of elliptical sentences or the identification of the antecedent and elided clauses within them are usually not dealt with, but taken as given.",
        "Noisy or missing input, which is unavoidable in NLP applications, is not dealt with, and neither is focusing on specific domains or applications.",
        "It therefore becomes clear that a robust, trainable approach is needed.",
        "An example of Verb Phrase Ellipsis (VPE), which is detected by the presence of an auxiliary verb without a verb phrase, is seen in example 1.",
        "VPE can also occur with semi-auxiliaries, as in example 2.",
        "(1) John3 {loves his3 wife}2.",
        "Bill3 does1 too.",
        "(2) But although he was terse, he didn’t {rage at me}2 the way I expected him to1.",
        "Several steps of work need to be done for ellipsis resolution : 1.",
        "Detecting ellipsis occurrences.",
        "First, elided verbs need to be found.",
        "2.",
        "Identifying antecedents.",
        "For most cases of ellipsis, copying of the antecedent clause is enough for resolution (Hardt, 1997).",
        "3.",
        "Resolving ambiguities.",
        "For cases where ambiguity exists, a method for generating the full list of possible solutions, and suggesting the most likely one is needed.",
        "This paper describes the work done on the first stage, the detection of elliptical verbs.",
        "First, previous work done on tagged corpora will be summarised.",
        "Then, new work on parsed corpora will be presented, showing the gains possible through sentence-level features.",
        "Finally, experiments using unannotated data that is parsed using an automatic parser are presented, as our aim is to produce a standalone system.",
        "We have chosen to concentrate on VP ellipsis due to the fact that it is far more common than other forms of ellipsis, but pseudo-gapping, an example of which is seen in example 3, has also been included due to the similarity of its resolution to VPE (Lappin, 1996).",
        "Do so/it/that and so doing anaphora are not handled, as their resolution is different from that of VPE (Kehler and Ward, 1999).",

        "To experiment with what gains are possible through the use of more complex data such as parse trees, the Penn Treebank is used for the second round of experiments.",
        "The results are presented as new features are added in a cumulative fashion, so each experiment also contains the data contained in those before it; the close to punctuation experiment contains the words and POS tags from the experiment before it, the next experiment contains all of these plus the heuristic baseline and so on.",
        "Words and POS tags The Treebank, besides POS tags and category headers associated with the nodes of the parse tree, includes empty category information.",
        "For the initial experiments, the empty category information is ignored, and the words and POS tags are extracted from the trees.",
        "The results in Table 2 are seen to be considerably poorer than those for BNC, despite the comparable data sizes.",
        "This can be accounted for by the coarser tagset employed.",
        "Close to punctuation A very simple feature, that checks for auxiliaries close to punctuation marks was tested.",
        "Table 3 shows the performance of the feature itself, characterised by very low precision, and results obtained by using it.",
        "It gives a 3% increase in F1 for GIS-MaxEnt, but a 1.5% decrease for L-BFGS-MaxEnt and 0.5% decrease for MBL.",
        "This brings up the point that the individual success rate of the features will not be in direct correlation with gains in overall results.",
        "Their contribution will be high if they have high precision for the cases they are meant to address, and if they produce a different set of results from those already handled well, complementing the existing features.",
        "Overlap between features can be useful to have greater confidence when they agree, but low precision in the feature can increase false positives as well, decreasing performance.",
        "Also, the small size of the development set can contribute to fluctuations in results.",
        "Heuristic Baseline A simple heuristic approach was developed to form a baseline using only POS data.",
        "The method takes all auxiliaries as possible candidates and then eliminates them using local syntactic information in a very simple way.",
        "It searches forwards within a short range of words, and if it encounters any other verbs, adjectives, nouns, prepositions, pronouns or numbers, classifies the auxiliary as not elliptical.",
        "It also does a short backwards search for verbs.",
        "The forward search looks 7 words ahead and the backwards search 3.",
        "Both skip ‘asides’, which are taken to be snippets between commas without verbs in them, such as : “... papers do, however, show ...”.",
        "This feature gives a 3.5 - 4.5% improvement (Table 4).",
        "Surrounding categories The next feature added is the categories of the previous branch of the tree, and the next branch.",
        "So in the example in Figure 1, the previous category of the elliptical verb is ADVP-PRD-TPC-2, and the next category NP-SBJ.",
        "The results of using this feature are seen in Table 5, giving a 1.6 - 3.5% boost.",
        "For auxiliary verbs parsed as verb phrases (VP), this feature checks if the final element in the VP is an auxiliary or negation.",
        "If so, no main verb can be present, as a main verb cannot be followed by an auxiliary or negation.",
        "This feature was used by Hardt (1993) and gives a 3.4 - 6% boost to performance (Table 6).",
        "VP which consists only of an empty element.",
        "This achieves 60% F1 on our development set.",
        "Our findings are in line with Hardt’s, who reports 48% F1, with the difference being due to the different sections of the Treebank used.",
        "It was observed that this search may be too restrictive to catch pseudo-gapping (Figure 2) and some examples of VPE in the corpus (Figure 3).",
        "We modify the search pattern to be ‘(VP (-NONE- *?",
        "*) ... )’, which is a VP that contains an empty element, but can contain other categories after it as well.",
        "This improves the feature itself by 10% in F1 and gives 10 - 14% improvement to the algorithms (Table 7).",
        "Empty categories Finally, empty category information is included completely, such that empty categories are treated as words, or leaves of the parse tree, and included in the context.",
        "Table 8 shows that adding this information results in 2.5 - 4.9% increase in F1.",
        "Cross-validation We perform cross-validation with and without the features developed to measure the improvement obtained through their use.",
        "The cross-validation results show a different ranking of the algorithms by performance than on the development set (Table 9), but consistent with the results for the BNC corpus.",
        "MBL shows consistent performance, L-BFGS-MaxEnt gets somewhat lower results and GIS-MaxEnt much lower.",
        "These results indicate that the confidence threshold settings of the maximum entropy models were over-optimized for the development data, and perhaps the smoothing for L-BFGS-MaxEnt was as well.",
        "MBL which was used as-is does not suffer these performance drops.",
        "The increase in F1 achieved by adding the features is similar for all algorithms, ranging from 17.9 to 19.8%."

        "Charniak’s parser combined with Johnson’s algorithm generates the empty VP feature with 32% F1.",
