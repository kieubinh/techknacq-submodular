        "The main hypothesis underlying the tasks in Lexical Acquisition is that it is possible to infer lexical properties from distributional evidence, taken as a generalisation of a word’s linguistic behaviour in corpora.",
        "The need for the automatic acquisition of lexical information arised from the so-called “lexical bottleneck” in NLP systems: no matter whether symbolic or statistical, all systems need more and more lexical information in order to be able to predict a word’s behaviour, and this information is very hard and costly to encode manually.",
        "In recent research in the field, the main effort has been to infer semantic classes for verbs, in English (Stevenson et al., 1999) and German (Schulte im Walde and Brew, 2002).",
        "In this paper, we concentrate on adjectives, which have received less attention (see though Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown (1993) and Lapata (2001)).",
        "Our aim is to establish semantic classes for adjectives in Catalan by means of clustering, using only shallow syntactic evidence.",
        "We compare the results with a set of adjectives classified by human judges according to semantic characteristics.",
        "Thus, we intend to induce semantic properties from syntactic distribution.",
        "We now justify each of the choices: why adjectives, why clustering, and why shallow features.",
        "Adjectives are predicates, equivalent to verbs when appearing in predicative environments.",
        "A broad semantic classification like the one we propose is a first step for characterising their meaning and argument structure.",
        "In their modifying function, they are crucial in restricting the referents of NPs.",
        "A good characterisation of their semantics can help identify referents in a given (con)text in dialog-based tasks, Question Answering systems, or even advanced Information Extraction tasks.",
        "We believe clustering, an unsupervised technique, to be particularly well suited for our task because there is no well-established classification we can rely on, so that data exploration is advisable for our task.",
        "In clustering, objects are grouped together according to their feature value distribution, not to a predefined classification (as is the case when using supervised techniques), so that we achieve a better guarantee that we are learning a structure already present in the data.",
        "Although adjectives are predicates, they have a much more limited distribution than verbs, and do not present long-distance dependencies.",
        "Therefore, we expect that shallow distributional features will be enough for our task.",
        "One of the purposes of the paper is to test whether this hypothesis is right.",
        "This would make adjective classification achievable for languages with less available resources than English, such as Catalan.",
        "The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 introduces the classification we are aiming at and the hypotheses that led to the experiments; Section 3 focuses on the methodology used to produce the classification; in Section 4 we discuss the results obtained so far; finally, Section 5 contains some conclusions and proposals for further work."

        "Standard descriptive grammars do propose broad-coverage classifications (see Picallo",
        "(2002) for Catalan), but these usually mix morphological, syntactic and semantic criteria.",
        "We therefore turned to classifications tailored for NLP systems, and defined two parameters largely inspired by Raskin and Nirenburg (1995): • unary or binary adjectives, according to whether they have one or two arguments.",
        "• basic, object or event adjectives, according to",
        "whether they denote non-decomposable properties, or it can be postulated that they have an object or event component in their meaning.",

        "This restriction also implies that they will have very low frequencies for predicative positions.",

        "This is probably due to the fact that most of them are deverbal and thus inherit part of the verbal argument structure.",
        "Thus, they tend to form larger constituents that are mostly placed in predicative position.",
        "For the same reason, they will appear in postnominal position when acting as modifiers.",

        "For both reasons, we modelled the data in terms of blind n-gram distribution and then selected the features.",

        "We have shown that for a part of speech with a limited syntactic distribution such as adjectives, this kind of information is enough to achieve a broad semantic classification.",
        "Our results also indicate that a semantic classification based on syntactic distribution is superior to one based on morphological class, mostly due to cases where the adjective has undergone diachronic change in meaning.",

        "The clustering only identifies those that are binary, thus simply overlapping with the first parameter.",
        "The remaining event adjectives seem to behave like basic ones.",
        "Therefore, the first task in future work will be to review the definition and characterisation of this class.",
        "Also, as the present analysis is based on a small sample of manually annotated adjectives, we intend to obtain a larger Gold Standard, in order to establish statistically more reliable results.",
        "This will also allow further analysis of the data, e.g. to check to what extent errors in the clustering results correspond to disagreement between human judges; or how far from the centroid are objects for which judges disagree.",
        "Further experiments with alternative modelling strategies and clustering algorithms should be also performed, so that a global analysis of the approach can be made.",
        "We would also like to investigate what are the limits of adjective classification using only shallow distributional features, and what kinds of information would be adequate to enrich the modelling.",
        "Last but not least, we have to work on the definition of polysemy within our task, so that we can achieve significant agreement scores among judges and integrate this parameter in the experiment."
