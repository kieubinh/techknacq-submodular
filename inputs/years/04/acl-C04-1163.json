        "Classification Hierarchies (CHs) are taxonomic structures used to organize large amounts of documents.",
        "Documents can be of many different types, depending on the characteristics and uses of the hierarchy itself.",
        "In file systems, documents can be any kind of file; in the directories of Web portals, documents are pointers to Web pages; in the marketplace, catalogs organize either product cards or service titles.",
        "CHs are now widespread as knowledge repositories and the problem of their integration is acquiring a high relevance from a scientific and commercial perspective.",
        "In this paper we present CTXMATCH, an algorithm that takes as input the labels attached to two nodes belonging to different partially overlapping CHs and returns a mapping relation (i.e. equivalence, more general, more specific) between them.",
        "Unlike previous approaches to interoperability, CTXMATCH does not consider the content of the documents classified in the CHs; rather, it relies both on the semantic interpretation of the labels describing the nodes, which is obtained through a linguistic analysis, and on the structure of the CH itself.",
        "The contribution of the paper is in two main directions: (i) we address the linguistic processing required for the semantic interpretation of CH labels; in our knowledge there are no previous attempts that systematically apply NLP tools and resources to this task; (ii) we report on a large-scale evaluation of the performance of such tools over real CHs.",
        "The results we obtained are a useful benchmark, available for future work in this area.",
        "In the attempt to carry out a semantic interpretation over CH nodes, at least the following issues seem to be crucial (examples are taken from Figure 1, in which a small subsection of Google Web Directories is reported): Splitting and contextual interpretation.",
        "Information is split on several levels; a single node provides only partial information, so that the interpretation process has to consider a larger scope.",
        "As an example, Players in Figure 1 refers to billiard players, not to players in general.",
        "Redundancy.",
        "Information can be partially repeated at different levels of a CH.",
        "For instance, if ACL-02 is placed under Papers-2002, the fact that ACL-02 refers to a conference of the year 2002 is implicitly represented at two levels.",
        "Linguistic complexity of the labels.",
        "Labels can be arbitrarily complex: they may include abbreviations, multiwords (e.g. United States in Figure 1), coordinated expressions, proper names (e.g. Comaneci, Nadia) ï¿½etc.",
        "Ambiguity and Synonymy.",
        "Labels may have different meanings and need to be disambiguated within their context.",
        "On the other hand, different labels may have the same meaning (e.g. Papers and Articles).",
        "In order to deal with these aspects of language we have used WORDNET as a repository of senses, and we have designed word sense disambiguation techniques specifically tuned for CHs.",
        "Lack of linguistic context.",
        "The interpretation of a label is necessarily based on a limited linguistic context.",
        "As a consequence, the application of NLP techniques (e.g. PoS-tagging, word sense disambiguation, etc.)",
        "opens up the prob-lein related to the use of tools usually developed for texts.",
        "For instance, we retrained the PoS-tagger on a specific CH corpus.",
        "Relation to world knowledge.",
        "CHs implicitly reflect the world knowledge of a specific domain, but they also reflect the subjective criteria adopted for organizing documents.",
        "World knowledge and subjective criteria may interact in subtle ways.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we review the relevant approaches to interoperability among CHs, outlining the main differences with respect to the semantic-based approach we propose.",
        "In Section 3 we describe the CTXMATCH algorithm.",
        "In Section 4 we report on the results of the evaluation experiments where CTXMATCH is applied to the Web Directories of Yahoo!",
        "and Google.",
        "Finally, in Section 5 we draw some conclusions.",
        "2 Approaches to CH Interoperability In our view, the problem of the interoperability among different CHs can be roughly stated in this way: given a node ors in a source CH and a node At in a target CH, the algorithm has to discover a relation between ors and At.",
        "Although there can be differences in the definition of the task itself (Agrawal and Srikant, 2001; Madhavan et al., 2002), and considering that this is a relatively new challenge, approaches to CH mapping can be grouped into four classes, according to the kind of information used: (i) approaches which consider the content of the documents belonging to the CH; (ii) approaches based on the classification of the documents; (iii) approaches that exploit the structure of the CH; and (iv) approaches that attempt a semantic interpretation of the CH labels.",
        "In the rest of this Section we will briefly review the first three approaches, while the semantic-based approach will be introduced in more detail in Section 3.",
        "Mapping based on document content.",
        "These approaches rely on the content of the documents classified in a CH.",
        "As an example, the GLUE system (Doan et al., 2002) employs machine learning techniques to discover mappings among CHs.",
        "The idea consists of training a classifier using documents of the source CH, and then apply that classifier to documents of the target CH, and vice-versa.",
        "The major drawback of this approach is that it requires textual documents, which prevents its usability when such documents are of a different nature (e.g. images) or they are not available at all.",
        "Mapping based on document classifications.",
        "An improvement with respect to the content-based approach has been proposed by Ichise et al.",
        "(2003), who address the mapping problein by coinputing a statistical inodel of the classification criteria of the CHs.",
        "Such a statistical model attempts to determine the degree of similarity between two categorization criteria considering the number of documents in common to nodes of different CHs.",
        "The advantage over the content-based approach is that the analysis of the documents is not necessary.",
        "However, it is required that the source and the target CHs share a certain amount of documents, which is hard to obtain in most of the concrete application scenarios.",
        "Mapping based on structural information.",
        "These approaches attempt to discover mappings independently of the number and the type of the classified documents.",
        "For instance, Daude et al.",
        "(2000) exploit a constraint satisfaction algorithm (i.e. relaxation labeling) for discovering relations among ontologies.",
        "It first selects candidate pairs using lexical similarities (i.e. concepts with the same label) and then considers a number of structural constraints among nodes (e.g. connections between their hypernyms) to increase or decrease the weights of the connection.",
        "Although the approach has been experimented and evaluated to map two versions of WORDNET, achieving high accuracy, our impression is that mapping CHs is a sensibly harder task, due to the highly idiosyncratic way in which CHs may organize their content.",
        "CTXMATCH is a particular implementation of an approach to semantic coordination recently proposed in Bouquet et al.",
        "(2003) and Magnini et al.",
        "(2003).",
        "The main difference between CTXMATCH and other approaches to schema matching (see Section 2) is that in order to interpret a node of a hierarchy it considers the implicit information derived from the context where the node occurs, i.e. the structural relations with the other nodes of the hierarchy.",
        "CTXMATCH consists of three main phases (see Figure 2): (i) linguistic analysis of the labels, (ii) context ualization, and (iii) computation of the logical relation.",
        "Linguistic analysis of the labels.",
        "In this phase, nodes are interpreted as stand alone objects, i.e. independently of their context and position in the hierarchy.",
        "Words in a label are first tokenized, lem-matized and tagged for Parts of Speech.",
        "We use TokenPro and LemmaPro, both developed at IRST, and the TNT tagger (Brants, 2000) with a tag set reduced to the four categories that are significant for accessing WORDNET (i.e. nouns, adjectives, adverbs, verbs), and a generic category `other'.",
        "Then, we access a multilingual version of WORDNET developed under the Meaning Project (Rigau et al., 2002).",
        "When a lemma is found, all the senses provided for the syntactic category selected by the PoS-tagger are attached to the lemma.",
        "In the case of United States in Figure 1, for instance, the WORDNET senses of both the adjective and the noun are added to the label (1).",
        "When a group of words in a label are contained in WORDNET as a single expression, the corresponding senses are selected and the senses of the single lemmas are replaced with those of the multiword.",
        "The multiword recognizes we have developed first retrieves the multiwords containing at least two adjacent words of a label and then selects those containing the highest number of words.",
        "For instance, `United States' is recognized as a WORDNET multiword, so this information is added to the label (2).",
        "(2 Then, we transform each label into a formula in description logic (Baader and Nutt, 2002) representing a first approximation of the meaning of the node, where the node is considered a stand alone object.",
        "As a general rule, a label consisting of more than one word is interpreted as the conjunction of its elements, since the documents classified under a node with a certain label should be concerned with all the words contained in that label; for instance, the label Laser Games found in Google Web Directories under Sports is interpreted as [laser* n game*].",
        "Other rules are based on the linguistic material provided in the labels: coordinating conjunctions and commas are interpreted as",
        "â¢ disjunction; prepositions are interpreted as â¢ conjunction; expressions denoting exclusion, like `except', are interpreted as negations.",
        "For example, Clubs and Schools in Figure 1 is interpreted as a disjunction (3), since under that node there might be both documents about clubs and documents about schools.",
        "(3) [club*n u school*n]",
        "Context ualization.",
        "In the second phase of CTXMATCH we contextualize the interpretation of a node, i.e. we take into consideration its ancestors in order to generate a logical form representing its meaning.",
        "Intuitively, we define the focus of a node as the part of the hierarchy that a user is required to visit in order to understand whether a document is under that node.",
        "More precisely, given a node A1j in a classification hierarchy H, the focus of A1j include all the ancestors of A1j and all their direct descendants in H. 'We use the following notation: state* denotes the disjunction of all the senses of `state' in WORDNET, while state#1 indicates sense number 1.",
        "The logical form of a node is built combining the logical form of the node with the logical form of its ancestors through intersection.",
        "For example, the logical form of the root of the CH in Figure 1 is simply [sport*], while the logical forms of Billiards and Players contain conjunctions, as shown in 4a and 4b respectively (the label attached to the node to which the logical form refers is highlighted in bold type) .",
        "(4a) [sport*] n [billiards] (4b) [sport*] n [billiards*] n [player*]",
        "The recognition of multiwords can also be performed on different contiguous levels.",
        "For instance, in WORDNET there is a multiword `billiard player', so in our example (4b), the intersection between billiards and player is substituted by the senses of the inultiword (5).",
        "(5) [sport*] n [billiard player*] The focus of a concept is taken into consideration to perform sense filtering: the senses of Nj that are not compatible given the senses belonging to its focus are deleted.",
        "As an exainple, two senses are attached to Arizona, denoting respectively a state in the USA and a snake, and two senses are attached to United-States; since there exists a part-of relation between Arizona#1 and United States#1, and United States#1 belongs to the focus of Arizona#1, Arizona#2 and United-States#2 can be discarded.",
        "The next step is sense composition, where we address possible inconsistencies between the hierarchical structure and the world knowledge provided in WORDNET.",
        "For example, Google Web Directories has Sociology and Science as sibling nodes under Academic Study of Soccer, which admits two conflicting interpretations: from the point of view of the world knowledge provided in WORDNET, sociology#1 is a second level hyponym of science#2 (which means that sociology is a science); on the other hand, from the point of view of the hierarchical structure, the sets of documents classified under the two nodes are disjoint.",
        "In order to combine the two information sources, Science has to be interpreted as if it were Science except Sociology.",
        "Computation of the logical relation.",
        "We check whether a mapping relation, i.e. an equivalence, a more general or a less general relation, holds between the logical forms k and P representing the meaning of the input nodes.",
        "To this aim, the task of finding a relation is transformed into a problem of propositional satisfiability (SAT ), and then computed via a standard SAT solver.",
        "The SAT problem is built in two steps.",
        "First, the algorithm selects the portion T of the background theory relevant to the two logical forms, namely the semantic relations involving the WORDNET senses that appear in them.",
        "Then, it computes some of the logical relations which are implied by T. The background theory T relevant for computing the relation between two formulas k and P is obtained by transforming the WORDNET hierarchical relations between senses appearing in k and P into a set of subsumptions in description logic according to the following rules:",
        "- c#i c#j (if c#i is a hyponyin of c#j); - c#j c#i (if c#i is a hypernym of c#j); - c#i - c#j (if c#i and c#j are synonyms).",
        "The equivalence relation between k and V (and thus between the nodes whose meanings are represented by the logical forms) is checked by verifying that k C_ V and V C_ k are both iinplied by T. Similarly, the less [more] general relation between k and V is checked by verifying that k C_ V [k' C_ k] is implied by T. For example, the mapping between the source node Clubs and Schools in Figure 1 and the target node schools classified under athleticslacrobaticslartistic in a different CH is one of inclusion.",
        "The logical forms of the nodes (6, 7.)",
        "and the logical relations implied by the background theory (8, 9) are given to SAT.",
        "(6) [sport#1] n [gymnastics#1] n F1 [artistic#1] n [club#2 LJ school#1] (7) [athletics#1] n [acrobatics#1] n F1 [artistic#1] n [club#2] (8) sport#1 - athletics#1 (9) acrobatics#1 â ï¿½ gymnastics#1",
        "Through SAT we check for satisfiability the union of all the propositions (e.g. 8 and 9) and the negation of the iinplication between the logical forms 6 and 7.",
        "Since the check fails, a more general relation is computed between the two nodes; otherwise a similar procedure is followed for the other mapping relations.",
        "4 Evaluation of CtxMatch In this Section we present an experiment performed on the Web Directories of Yahoo!",

        "Polysemic lemmas (both single words and multiwords) have on average between 3.6 and 5.2 senses, which makes the need for word sense disambiguation very important.",
