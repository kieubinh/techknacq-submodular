        "In recent years, considerable progress has been invested in developing the conceptual bases for building technology that allows knowledge reuse and sharing.",
        "As information exchangeability and communication becomes increasingly global, multilingual lexical resources that can provide transnational services are becoming increasingly important.",
        "On the other hand, multilingual ontology is very important for natural language processing, such as machine translation (MT), web mining (Oyama et al.",
        "2004) and cross language information retrieval (CLIR).",
        "Generally, a multilingual ontology maps the keyword set of one language to another language, or compute the co-occurrence of the words among languages.",
        "In addition, a key merit for multilingual ontology is that it can increase the relation and structural information coverage by aligning two or more language-dependent ontologies with different semantic features.",
        "Over the last few years, significant effort has been made to construct the ontology manually according to the domain expert’s knowledge.",
        "Manual ontology merging using conventional editing tools without intelligent support is difficult, labor intensive and error prone.",
        "Therefore, several systems and frameworks for supporting the knowledge engineer in the ontology merging task have recently been proposed (Noy and Musen 2000).",
        "To avoid the reiteration in ontology construction, the algorithm of ontology merging (UMLS http://umlsks.nlm.nih.gov/) (Langkilde and Knight 1998) and ontology alignment (Vossen and Peters 1997) (Weigard and Hoppenbrouwers 1998) (Asanoma 2001) were invested.",
        "The final ontology is a merged version of the original ontologies.",

        "Alignment usually is performed when the ontologies cover domains that are complementary to each other.",

        "Finding the authoritative evaluation for ontology is becoming a critical issue.",
        "Some evaluations are integrated into the ontology tools to detect and prevent the mistakes.",
        "The mistakes that might be made in developing taxonomies with frames are described in (Gómez-Pérez 2001).",
        "They defined three mainly types of mistakes: Inconsistency, Incompleteness, and redundancy.",
        "To deal with these mistakes and carry out the validation and verification of ontology, some ontology checkers, validators and parsers were developed.",
        "These tools provide the efficacious appraisal of correctness when developing the new ontology.",
        "However, they are disappointing in ontology integration, especial when the original ontologies are well defined.",
        "For other approaches (Maedche and Staab 2002), the similarity measures are proposed in the earlier stage of the evaluation.",
