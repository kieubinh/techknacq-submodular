        "Moreover, the translation module of a speech translation system, a natural offspring of text-input based translation system, usually takes a single-best recognition hypothesis transcribed in text and performs standard text-based translation.",
        "Lots of supplementary information available from speech recognition, such as N-best recognition recognition hypotheses, likelihoods of acoustic and language models, is not well utilized in the translation process.",
        "The information can be effective for improving translation quality if employed properly.",
        "The supplementary information can be exploited by a tight coupling of speech recognition and machine translation (Ney, 1999) or keeping the cascaded structure unchanged but using an integration model, log-linear model, to rescore the translation hypotheses.",
        "In this study the last approach was used due to its explicitness.",
        "In this paper we intended to improve speech translation by exploiting these information.",
        "Moreover, a number of advanced features from the machine translation module were also added in the models.",
        "All the features from the speech recognition and machine translation module were combined by the log-linear models seamlessly.",
        "In order to test our results broadly, we used four automatic translation evaluation metrics: BLEU, NIST, multiple word error rate and position independent word error rate, to measure the translation improvement.",
