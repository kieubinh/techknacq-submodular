        "The framework of Advanced Question Answering (QA) systems, including cooperative QA answering, as described in a recent road map (Voorees 2003), raises new challenges for language generation since answers are often produced via dedicated inference mechanisms operating over various knowledge sources, including conceptual ontologies.",
        "Producing well-formed and informative responses gives a whole new insight to language generation, and in particular to the difficult problem of lexicalisation.",
        "For example, the question: A bungalow in Meg`eve for 15 persons ?",
        "has the response: There are no bungalows in Meg`eve, we can propose you 2 close-by chalets or a country cottage for 15 persons in Meg`eve, or a 15 person bungalow in les Houches (8kms) or in Acacias (12kms), where closely related alternatives are proposed on: (1) sister concepts of bungalow (the question focus): a country cottage or 2 close-by chalets (assuming a chalet capacity does not exceed 10 persons) in the same village or (2) sister concepts of the Meg`eve village (the strongest constraint on the focus): close-by villages where bungalows meet the 15 person constraint.",
        "The response involves evaluating village proximity and sorting responses, e.g. by increasing distance from Meg`eve.",
        "The first part of the response There are no bungalows in Meg`eve is the direct response, which corrects the user false presupposition, while the remainder of the response reflects the cooperative know-how of the responder.",
        "Cooperative know-how involves several forms of responses that include relaxations, intensional calculus, expression of restrictions, of warnings and conditional responses (Benamara et al.",
        "2004).",
        "This simple example shows that, if a direct response cannot be found, several forms of knowledge and reasoning schemas need to be used and that the NL form of the response requires adequate and subtle lexicalisations, often directed by the reasoning schemas.",
        "Lexicalisation is the operation that associates a word or an expression to a concept.",
        "It is a major parameter in response production (Reiter et Dale, 1997), (a good synthesis can be found in (Cahill, 1999)).",
        "Lexicalisation is often decomposed into two different stages: lexical choice, which occurs during content determination, where the lexical term chosen, which may still be underspecified, is dependent on reasoning procedures, the knowledge base contents, and grammatical constraints; and lexical variation which is the choice of a particular word or form among possible synonyms or paraphrases.",
        "Lexical variation occurs in the surface realizer, and may have some pragmatic connotations, for example an implicit evaluation via the language level chosen (e.g. argotic entails low evaluation).",
        "In this project note, we show the different facets of lexicalisation in advanced QA, where the two stages, lexical choice and variation, play crucial and very distinct roles in the different parts of the response.",
        "Our model is based on a detailed analysis of QA pairs, and on annotation tasks, from which a model emerged, suitable for NLG."

        "The ontology on which our project is based is basically a conceptual ontology where nodes are associated with concept lexicalizations and essential properties, as it is now often the case in restricted domain ontologies (http://www.daml.org/ontologies/).",
        "In our implementation, each node is represented by the predicate : onto-node(concept, lex, prop) where concept has properties prop, represented as attribute-value pairs, and lexicalisations lex.",
        "Most lexicalisations are entries in the lexicon, where morphological and grammatical aspects are described.",
        "For example, for hotel, we have (coded in Prolog):",
        "There are several well-designed public domain ontologies on the net.",
        "Our ontology is a synthesis of two existing French ontologies, that we customized: TourinFrance (www.tourinfrance.net) and the bilingual (French and English) thesaurus of tourism and leisure activities (www.iztzg.hr/indokibiblioteka/THESAUR.PDF) which includes 2800 French terms.",
        "We manually integrated these ontologies in WEBCOOP (Benamara et al.",
        "2004a) and added ourselves most properties by hand.",
        "We also revised slightly the ontology by removing concepts which are either too specific (i.e. too low level), such as some basic aspects of ecology or rarely considered, as e.g. the economy of tourism.",
        "We also removed quite surprising classifications such as sanatorium under tourist accommodation.",
        "We finally reorganized some concept hierarchies, so that they ‘look’ more intuitive for a large public.",
        "Finally, we found that some hierarchies are a little bit odd, for example, we found at the same level accommodation capacity and tourist accommodation whereas, in our case, we consider that capacity is a property of the concept tourist accommodation.",
        "We have, at the moment, 1000 concepts in our tourism ontology which describe the different aspects of accommodation and transportation and a few other satellite elements (geography, health, immigration).",
        "Besides the traditional ’isa’ relation, we also coded the ’part-of’ relation and the opposition.",
        "We also have a few proportional series in order to encode graduality.",
        "In the tourism domain there is a reasonable number of part-of pairs, and a small number of opposites and proportional series.",
        "Synonymy is encoded via the list of lexicalizations.",
        "Encoding these relations is straightforwardly realized by introducing facts, which operate at the concept level, not at the lexicalization one: part-of(journey, trip).",
        "As shall be seen below, this ontology is futher annotated for lexicalization tasks.",
        "Finally, in (Benamara et al.",
        "2004), we define a conceptual metrics that determines the distance between two concepts, evaluated in terms of distance in the hierarchy between the two concepts and property differences (nature of properties and values associated)."

        "Most of the efforts in these studies and systems focussed on the foundations and on the implementation of reasoning procedures (Gal, 1988), (Minock et ali., 1996), while little attention was paid to question analysis and NL response generation.",
        "An overview of these systems can be found in (Gasterland et al., 1994) and in (Webber et ali., 2002), based on works by (Hendrix et ali., 1978), (Kaplan, 1982), (Mays et ali., 1982), among others.",
        "These systems include e.g. the identification of false presuppositions and various types of misunderstandings found in questions.",

        "Intensional reasoning schemas can also be used to generalize over lists of basic responses or to construct summaries.",
        "The framework of Advanced Reasoning for Question Answering (QA) systems, as described in a recent road map, raises new challenges since answers can no longer be only directly extracted from texts (as in TREC) or databases, but require the use of a domain knowledge base, including a conceptual ontology, and dedicated inference mechanisms.",
        "Such a perspective, obviously, reinforces and gives a whole new insight to cooperative answering.",

        "It reflects the know-how of the cooperative system, going beyond the cooperative statements given in the first part.",
        "It is based on intensional description techniques and on intelligent relaxation procedures going beyond classical generalization methods used in AI.",
        "This component also includes additional dedicated cooperative rules that make a thorough use of the domain ontology and of general knowledge.",

        "This latter subclass is much more difficult to characterize, it often indicates a form of insistence or stress, or the desire to make information more explicit (e.g. international is really from all the countries in the world),",
        "• Opposites (OPP): used on a limited scale to account e.g. for the differences in point of view between the questioner and the responder (e.g. lend / borrow, pay/charge, stay/leave) (Cruse 1986).",
        "• Subtypes (SUB): often subtypes in the ontology (accommodation → hotel, motel, bungalow, country cottage, etc.)",
        "or enumerations of basic terms (e.g. different types of credit cards).",
        "We have the following main subtypes: SUB(a) lower-level elements in an ontology (possibly terminal elements), SUB(b) focuses on sub-events or sub-activities of the larger event lexicalised in the question, or (simple) procedure description instead of the procedure name, and SUB(c) subtyping via modification (official guide, mountain guide).",
        "• Sisters (SIS) are used when the response introduces minor superficial corrections to the terms used in the question (not as important as false presuppositions), often related to ‘lexical approximations’ (e.g. bungalow used instead of hut, cabin in a camping), these should not be confused with SYN(b).",
        "SIS is also useful in negative responses, where the correct response is a sister of the concept used in the query (is my metro ticket valid on the bus ?",
        "no, you need to buy a bus ticket).",
        "• Generalizations (GEN): their main use is in intensional answers, where generalizations are",
        "realized to make the answer more compact.",
        "Generalizations can also be used e.g. to insist on a certain facet of the term (castle /building), or to provide a certain form of help (where is the Dominican Republic ?",

        "• Fuzzy term interpretation (FTI): close interpreted as 50 meters.",

        "These lexicalisations require a quite advanced domain model, necessary for the development of cooperative functions, in particular a rich ontology.",
        "These functions have been tested in the WEBCOOP prototype, that cooperatively responds to queries on the WEB, on the tourism domain (accommodation and transportation).",
        "This study can be applied to open generation, on a purely conceptual representation basis, or to more restricted forms of generation, such as underspecified templates with calls to lexicalisation.",
        "Acknowledgements We thank the CNRS GDR TCAN and V´eronique Moriceau for providing us corpora and for helpful discussions.",
        "We also thank the three reviewers for their useful comments."
