        "What is represented in a text has originally a network structure, in which several concepts have tight relations with each other.",
        "However, because of the linear constraint of texts, most of them disappear in the normal form of texts.",
        "Automatic reproduction of such relations can be regarded as the first step of “text understanding”, and surely benefits NLP applications such as machine translation, automatic abstraction, and question answering.",
        "One of such latent relationship is indirect anaphora, functional anaphora, or bridging reference, such as the following examples.",
        "(1) I bought a ticket.",
        "The price was 20 dollars.",
        "(2) There was a house.",
        "The roof was white.",
        "Here, “the price” means “the price of a ticket” and “the roof” means “the roof of a house.” Most nouns have their indispensable or requisite entities: “price” is a price of some goods or service, “roof” is a roof of some building, “coach” is a coach of some sport, and “virus” is a virus causing some disease.",
        "The relation between a noun and its indispensable entity is parallel to that between a verb and its arguments or obligatory cases.",
        "In this paper, we call indispensable entities of nouns obligatory cases.",
        "Indirect anaphora resolution needs a comprehensive information or dictionary of obligatory cases of nouns.",
        "In case of verbs, syntactic structures such as subject/object/PP in English or case markers such as ga, wo, ni in Japanese can be utilized as a strong clue to distinguish several obligatory cases and adjuncts (and adverbs), which makes it feasible to construct case frames from large corpora automatically (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997; Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2002).",
        "(Kawahara and Kurohashi, 2004) then utilized the automatically constructed case frames to Japanese zero pronoun resolution.",
        "On the other hand, in case of nouns, obligatory cases of noun Nh appear, in most cases, in the single form of noun phrase “Nh of Nm” in English, or “Nm no Nh” in Japanese.",
        "This single form can express several obligatory cases, and furthermore optional cases, for example, “rugby no coach” (obligatory case concerning what sport), “club no coach” (obligatory case concerning which institution), and “kyonen ‘last year’ no coach” (optional case).",
        "Therefore, the key issue to construct nominal case frames is to analyze “Nh of Nm” or “Nm no Nh” phrases to distinguish obligatory case examples and others.",
        "Work which addressed indirect anaphora in English texts so far restricts relationships to a small, relatively well-defined set, mainly part-of relation like the above example (2), and utilized hand-crafted heuristic rules or hand-crafted lexical knowledge such as WordNet (Hahn et al., 1996; Vieira and Poesio, 2000; Strube and Hahn, 1999).",
        "(Poesio et al., 2002) proposed a method of acquiring lexical knowledge from “Nh of Nm” phrases, but again concentrated on part-of relation.",
        "In case of Japanese text analysis, (Murata et al., 1999) proposed a method of utilizing “Nm no Nh” phrases for indirect anaphora resolution of diverse relationships.",
        "However, they basically used all “Nm no Nh” phrases from corpora, just excluding some prefixed stop words.",
        "They confessed that an accurate analysis of “Nm no Nh” phrases is necessary for the further improvement of indirect anaphora resolution.",
        "As a response to these problems and following the work in (Kurohashi and Sakai, 1999), we propose a method to construct Japanese nominal case frames from large corpora, based on an accurate analysis of “Nm no Nh” phrases using an ordinary dictionary and a thesaurus.",
        "To examine the practical usefulness of the constructed nominal case frames, we also built a system of indirect anaphora resolution based on the case frames."

        "The main purpose of using this dictionary is to calculate the similarity between two words.",
        "Suppose the word x and y have a semantic feature sx and sy, respectively, their depth is dx and dy in the semantic tree, and the depth of their lowest (most specific) common node is dc, the similarity between x and y, sim(x, y), is calculated as follows:",
        "If sx and sy are the same, the similarity is 1.0, the maximum score based on this criteria.",

        "Based on such an observation, (Kurohashi and Sakai, 1999) proposed a semantic analysis method of “Nm no Nh”, consisting of the two modules: dictionary-based analysis (abbreviated to DBA hereafter) and semantic feature-based analysis (abbreviated to SBA hereafter).",

        "A case frame should be constructed for each meaning (definition) of Nh, and groups starting with “[... ]” or “<...>” in Table 2 are possible case slots.",
        "The problem is how to arrange the analysis results of DBA and SBA and how to distinguish obligatory cases and others.",
        "The following sections explain how to handle these problems.",
        "One obligatory case might be separated in preliminary case frames, since the definition sentence is sometimes too specific or too detailed.",
        "For example, in the case of hisashi ‘eaves/visor’ in Table 2, [house], [window], and <place> have very similar examples that mean building or part of building.",
        "Therefore, case slots are merged if similarity of two case slots is more than 0.5 (case slots in different definition sentences are not merged in any case).",
        "Similarity of two case slots is the average of top 25% similarities of all possible pairs of examples.",
        "In the case of Table 2, the similarity between [house] and [window] is 0.80, and that between [house] and <place> is 0.67, so that these three case slots are merged into one case slot.",
        "4.3 Obligatory case selection Preliminary case frames contain both obligatory cases and optional cases for the head word.",
        "Since we can expect that an obligatory case co-occurs with the head word in the form of noun phrase frequently, we can take frequent case slots as obligatory case of the head word.",
        "However, we have to be careful to set up the frequency thresholds, because case slots detected by DBA or <obligatory case> by SBA are more likely to be obligatory; on the other hand case slots of <modification> or <time> should be always optional.",
        "Considering these tendencies, we set thresholds for obligatory cases as shown in Table 3.",
        "In the case of hisashi ‘eaves/visor’ in Table 2, [house-window]-<place> slot and [cap] slot are chosen as the obligatory cases.",
        "If a case slot of <obligatory case> by SBA or <other> is not merged into case slots in definition sentences, it can be considered that it indicates a meaning of Nh which is not covered in the dictionary.",
        "Therefore, such a case slot constitutes an independent case frame.",
        "On the other hand, when other case slots by SBA such as <belonging> and <possessive> are remaining, we have to treat them differently.",
        "The reason why they are remaining is that they are not always described in the definition sentences, but their frequent occurrences indicate they are obligatory cases.",
        "Therefore, we add these case slots to the case frames derived from definition sentences.",
        "Table 4 shows several examples of resultant case frames.",
        "Hyoujou ‘expression’ has a case frame containing two case slots.",
        "Hisashi ‘eaves/visor’ has two case frames according to the two definition sentences.",

        "4.5 Point of nominal case frame construction The point of our method is the integrated use of a dictionary and example phrases from large corpora.",
        "Although dictionary definition sentences are informative resource to indicate obligatory cases of nouns, it is difficult to do indirect anaphora resolution by using a dictionary as it is, because all nouns in a definition sentence are not an obligatory case, and only the frequency information of noun phrases tells us which is the obligatory case.",
        "Furthermore, sometimes a definition is too specific or detailed, and the example phrases can adjust it properly, as in the example of hisashi in Table 2.",
        "On the other hand, a simple method that just collects and clusters “Nm no Nh” phrases (based on some similarity measure of nouns) can not construct comprehensive nominal case frames, because of polysemy and multiple obligatory cases.",
