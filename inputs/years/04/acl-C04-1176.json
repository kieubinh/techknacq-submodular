        "“Loan words” in Japanese are usually written by a phonogram type of Japanese character set, KATAKANA.",
        "Because of loan words, the transliteration causes several variations of spelling.",
        "Therefore, Japanese KATAKANA words sometimes have several different orthographies for each original word.",
        "For example, we found at least six different spellings of “spaghetti” in 38 years of Japanese newspaper articles, such as “ ,” “ ,”■ “,” “,” “ ,” and “.",
        "” The different expression causes problems when we use search engines, question answering systems, and so on (Yamamoto et al., 2003).",
        "For example, when we input “ ” as a query for a search engine or a query for a question answering system, we may not be able to find the web pages or the answers for which we are looking, if a different orthography for “ ” is used.",
        "We investigated how many documents were retrieved by Google 1 when each Japanese KATAKANA variant of “spaghetti” was used as a query.",
        "The result is shown as Table 1.",
        "For example, when we inputted “■ ■ ” as a query of Google, 104,000 documents were retrieved and the percentage was 34.6%, calculated by 104,000 divided by 300,556.",
        "From Table 1, we see that each of six variants appears frequently and thus we may not be able to find the web pages for which we are looking.",
        "Although we can manually create Japanese KATAKANA variant list, it is a labor-intensive task.",
        "In order to solve the problem, we propose an automatic method to construct Japanese KATAKANA variant list from large corpus.",
        "we inputted each Japanese KATAKANA variant of “spaghetti” as a query of Google.",
        "Our method consists of three steps.",
        "First, we collect Japanese KATAKANA words from large corpus.",
        "Then, we collect candidate pairs of KATAKANA variants based on a spelling similarity from the collected Japanese KATAKANA words.",

        "There are some related work for the problems with Japanese spelling variations.",
        "In (Shishi-bori and Aoe, 1993), they have proposed a method for generating Japanese KATAKANA variants by using replacement rules, such as ■ (be) ↔ ■ (ve) and ■ (chi) ↔ ■ (tsi).",
        "Here, “↔” represents “substitution.” For example, when we apply these rules to “■ (Venezia),” three different spellings are generated as variants, such as “ ,” “■ ■ ,”and “.” Kubota et al.",
        "have extracted Japanese KATAKANA variants by first transforming KATAKANA words to directed graphs based on rewrite rules and by then checking whether the directed graphs contain the same labeled path or not (Kubota et al., 1993).",
        "A part of their rewrite rules is shown in Table 2.",
        "For example, when applying these rules to “■ (Kuwait),” “ aαc,” “ bαc,” “ dαc” are generated as variants.",
        "In (Shishibori and Aoe, 1993) and (Kubota et al., 1993), they only paid attention to applying their replacement or rewrite rules to words themselves and didn’t pay attention to their contexts.",
        "Therefore, they wrongly decide that “ ” is a variant of “ .” Here, “■ ■ ” represents “wave” and “ ” represents “web.” In our method, we will decide if “ ■ ” and “ ” convey the same meaning or not using a semantic similarity based on their contexts."

        "We divided sentences of the articles into words using JUMAN2 (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1999) which is the Japanese morphological analyzer, and then extracted content words which consist of nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and unknown words except stopwords.",
