        "Modeling context and its effects on interpretation may once have seemed to call for an open-ended investigation of people’s knowledge of the common-sense world (Hobbs et al., 1993).",
        "But research on the semantics of practical dialogue (Allen et al., 2001) now approaches dimensions of context systematically, through increasingly lightweight, factored models.",
        "The evolving state of real-world activity proceeds predictably according to background plans and principles of coordination (Rich et al., 2001).",
        "The status of the dialogue itself is defined by circumscribed obligations to ground prior utterances, follow up open issues, and advance real-world negotiation (Larsson and Traum, 2000).",
        "Finally, the evolving state of the linguistic context is a direct outgrowth of the linguistic forms interlocutors use and the linguistic relationships among successive utterances (Ginzburg and Cooper, 2001; Asher and Lascarides, 2003).",
        "These compatible models combine directly to characterize an aggregate information state that provides a general background for interpretation (Bunt, 2000).",
        "We argue in this paper that such integrated models enable systems to calculate useful, fine-grained utterance interpretations from radically underspecified semantic forms.",
        "We focus in particular on vague scalar predicates like small or long.",
        "These predicates typify qualitative linguistic expression of quantitative information, and are thus both challenging and commonplace.",
        "Building on a multidimensional treatment of dialogue context, we develop and implement a theoretically-motivated model of vagueness which is unique in treating vague predicates as genuinely vague and genuinely context-sensitive, yet amenable to general processes of contextual and interpretive inference."

        "We can set the standard from the default size of an eye, from the default size of a mouth (larger), or from the default size of a head (larger still).1 Because each standard allows all smaller objects to be created next, these standards lead to 1, 3, and 6 interpretations, respectively.",
        "So we recover the standard from the eye, which results in a unique interpretation.2",

        "It can set the standard from an actual eye or from the two eyes together; and it can set the standard from the default mouth or head.",

        "It is particularly attractive that the approach requires minimal lexical knowledge and training data.",
        "This means adding new vague words to an interface is a snap.",
        "Overall, our new model offers three contributions.",
        "Most importantly, of course, we have developed a computational model of vagueness in terms of underspecified quantitative constraints.",
        "But we have also presented a new demonstration of the importance and the feasibility of using multidimensional representations of dialogue context in understanding descriptions of quantitative domains.",
        "And we have introduced an architecture for resolving underspecification through uniform pragmatic mechanisms based on context-dependent collaboration.",
        "Together, these developments allow us to circumscribe possible resolutions for underspecified utterances, to zero in on those that the speaker and hearer could adopt consistently and collaboratively, and so to constrain the speaker’s intended meaning to within a natural range."
