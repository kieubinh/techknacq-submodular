        "Pioneering research by MIT and CMU as well as more recent work by the IBM Watch-me-Read project has demonstrated human language technologies can play an effective role in systems designed to improve children’s reading abilities (McCandless, 1992; Mostow et al., 1994; Zue et al., 1996).",
        "In CMU’s Project LISTEN, for example, the tutor operates by prompting children to read individual sentences out loud.",
        "The tutor listens to the child using speech recognition and extracts features that can be used to detect oral reading miscues (Mostow et al., 2002; Tam et al.",
        "2003).",
        "The most common miscues that children make while reading out loud are word substitutions, repetitions, and self-corrections with word omissions and insertions being less frequent (Fogarty et al.",
        "2001).",
        "Upon detecting such reading errors, the tutor must provide appropriate feedback to the child.",
        "While the type of feedback and level of feedback is the current subject of much debate within the research community, recent results have shown that automated reading tutors can improve student achievement (Mostow et al., 2003).",

        "(2004) to incorporate improved acoustic and language modeling strategies.",
        "When tested on 106 children (ages 9-11) who were asked to read one of a number of short age-appropriate stories, a final system word error rate of 8.0% was demonstrated.",
        "While reporting raw word error rate is useful for comparison purposes to prior research, we point out that it does not provide any diagnostic information which can be used to understand factors that contribute to speech recognition error within such children’s literacy tutor programs.",
        "Therefore, this paper extends our earlier work in two important ways.",
        "First, in order to understand where future improvements can be obtained, we provide a novel “event” labeling of our children’s speech corpus and examine the performance of the current speech recognition system under each labeled event condition.",
        "Second, we describe the construction of an automated classifier which can detect reading miscues in children’s speech.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "First, Section 2 provides an introduction and overview of the Colorado Literacy Tutor project.",
        "Section 3 describes the audio corpus used in the experiments",

        "In some cases the child catches his/her error before finishing the word and thus creating a partial word, however, since it is a conscious act by the child the word is marked as a repetition assuming he/she did repeat it to self correct.",
        "Other important factors to be tracked by the recognizer are over-articulations (OA), hesitations (HS), non-speech segments (NS) and background noises (BN).",

        "Furthermore the alignment of the human-based transcription against the story text is needed in the classification / evaluation process to determine where reading miscues actually occur (i.e., transcription-target alignment).",
        "We define a reading miscue event as any instance in which the child inserts, deletes or substitutes a word during oral reading.",
        "Therefore each word spoken by the child is associated with an event label (insertion, deletion or substitution) or non-event (i.e., correct word).",
        "Given this word-level miscue labeling of the data we can propose a detection problem.",
        "Here, each recognized word is submitted to a classifier.",

        "By thresholding the classifier output we can determine a detection rate for a given false alarm rate and therefore describe a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC).",

        "Rather, we wish to design an indicator that can accurately report the detection of a miscue event whenever the text was not read correctly.",
        "In order to be able to map one alignment to the other, the two alignments need to be synchronized.",

        "If the word was replaced with another word in the hypothesis or transcription, the wrong word will be aligned with the actual target word, if a word is left out, no word from the hypothesis or transcription will be aligned with the specific deleted target word.",

        "To our knowledge, previous work has not considered such a detailed word error analysis on a children’s speech corpus.",
        "We then provided our initial framework for detecting oral reading miscues.",
        "Using a simple linear classifier and using features derived from a speech recognizer, we demonstrated that 67% of reading miscues can be detected at a false alarm rate of 3%.",
        "While this system appears to outperform the previous results presented in Tam et al.",
        "(2003), we point out that there is currently no standardized test set available to directly compare those systems.",
        "Therefore, the audio corpus and event labeling presented in this paper will be made available to researchers to promote community-wide benchmarking.",
        "In the future we plan to correlate the miscue detection performance with the event labeling strategy outlined in Section 5 of the paper.",
        "We expect that such an error analysis will continue to provide insight to areas for system development."
