        "The Text REtrieval Conference Series (TREC) has greatly encouraged Question Answering (QA) research in the recent years.",
        "The QA main task in the recent TREC-12 involved retrieving short concise answers to factoid and list questions, and answer nuggets for definition questions (Voorhees, 2003).",
        "The list task in TREC-12 required systems to assemble a set of distinct and complete exact answers as responses to questions like “What are the brand names of Belgian chocolates?”.",
        "Unlike the questions in previous TREC conferences, TREC-12 list questions did not specify a target number of instances to return but expected all answers contained in the corpus.",
        "Current QA systems (Harabagiu et al., 2003; Katz et al., 2003) usually extract a ranked list of factoid answers from the top returned documents by retrieval engines.",
        "This is actually the traditional way to find factoid answers.",
        "The only difference between answering list questions and factoid questions here is that list QA systems allow for multiple answers, whose scores are above a cut-off threshold.",
        "An analysis of the results of TREC-12 list QA systems (Voorhees, 2003) reveals that many of them severely suffer from two general problems: low recall and non-distinctive answers.",
        "The median average F1 performance of list runs was only 21.3% while the best performer could only achieve 39.6% (Table 1).",
        "This unsatisfactory performance exposes the limitation of using only traditional Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing techniques to find an exhaustive set of factoid answers as compared to only one.",
        "In contrast to the traditional techniques, the Web is used extensively in systems to rally round factoid questions.",
        "QA researchers have explored a variety of uses of the Web, ranging from surface pattern mining (Ravichandran et al., 2002), query formulation (Yang et al., 2003), answer validation (Magnini et al., 2002), to directly finding answers on the Web by data redundancy analysis (Brill et al., 2001).",
        "These systems demonstrated that with the help of the Web they could generally boost baseline performance by 25%-30% (Lin 2002).",
        "The well-known redundancy-based approach identifies the factoid answer as an N-gram appearing most frequently on the Web (Brill et al.",
        "2001).",
        "This idea works well on factoid questions because factoid questions require only one instance and web documents contains a large number of repeated information about possible answers.",
        "However, when dealing with list questions, we need to find all distinct instances and hence we cannot ignore the less frequent answer candidates.",
        "The redundancy-based approach fails to spot novel or unexpectedly valuable information in lower ranked web pages with few occurrences.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel framework to employ the Web to support list question answering.",
        "Based on the observations that multiple answer instances often appear in the list or table of a single web page while multiple web pages may also contain information about the same instance, we differentiate these two types of web pages.",
        "For the first category, which we call Collection Page (CP), we need to extract table/list content from the web page.",
        "For the second category, which we call Topic Page (TP), we need to find distinct web pages relating to different answer instances.",
        "We will demonstrate that the resulting system, FADA (Find All Distinct Answers), could achieve effective list question answering in the TREC corpus.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as following.",
        "Section 2 gives the design considerations of our approach.",
        "Section 3 details our question analysis and web query formulation.",
        "Section 4 describes the web page classification and web document features used in FADA.",

        "Our goal is to find as many distinct exact answers on the Web as possible.",
        "This requires us to:",
        "• perform effective and exhaustive search; and • extract distinct answers.",
        "In order to perform effective search, we employ question transformation to get effectual web queries.",
        "However, this is not a trivial task.",
        "If the query is too general, too many documents may be retrieved and the system would not have sufficient resources to scan through all of them.",
        "If the query is too specific, no pages may be retrieved.",
        "Given millions of web pages returned by search engines, our strategy is to divide-and-conquer by first identify Collection Pages (CP) that contain a list of answer instances.",
        "For example, for the question “What breeds of dog have won the \"Best in Show\" award at the Westminster Dog Show?”, we can find a Collection Page as shown in Figure 1 (top).",
        "Such a web page is a very good resource of answers.",
        "In general, we observe that there is a large number of named entities of the type desired appearing in a Collection Page, typically in a list or table.",
        "Our intuition is that if we can find a Collection Page that contains almost all the answers, then the rest of the work is simply to extract answers from it or related web pages by wrapper rule induction.",
        "Another kind of “good” web page is a Topic Page, that contains just one answer instance (Figure 1, bottom).",
        "It typically contains many named entities, which correspond to our original query terms and some other named entities of the answer target type.",
        "Given the huge amount of web data, there will be many Topic Pages that refer to the same answer instance.",
        "There is hence a need to group the pages and to identify a pertinent and distinctive page in order to represent a distinct answer."

        "Based on the above considerations, we propose a general framework to find list answers on the Web using the following steps:",

        "Related work could also be found in Kwok et al.",
        "(2001) where the user’s question is processed by a parser to learn its syntactic structure and various query modulation techniques are applied to the initial questions to get high quality results for later answer extraction.",
        "FADA performs question parsing to identify key question words and the expected answer type.",
        "It extracts several sets of words from the original question and identifies the detailed question classes.",

        "Both parsers are very efficient and usually parse 300 words within a second.",
        "The procedure of query parsing is as follows: a) Remove head words.",
        "The head words in a question could be wh-question words and leading verbs.",
        "The list of head words includes “who, what, when, where, which, how, how much, how many, list, name, give, provide, tell”, etc.",
        "Removing them enables us to get the correct subject/object relation and verb in the question.",
        "For example, for question “What breeds of dog have won the ‘Best in Show’ award at the Westminster Dog Show?”, after removing the head word, the question becomes “breeds of dog have won the ‘Best in Show’ award at the Westminster Dog Show”.",
        "b) Detect subject and object for the remaining question segments by shallow parsing.",
        "For example, after parsing the above question, we get:",
        "From the parsed sentence, we want to get the logical subject as the sentence subject or its immediate modifiers.",
        "Here we have the logical subject-“breeds of dog”, verb-“won”, and logical object-“the best in show award”.",
        "If the resulting logical subject/object is the term “that” as in the following parsed query for “U.S.",
        "entertainers that later became politicians”:",
        "we get the noun or noun phrase before the clause as the logical subject/object.",
        "Hence, we have the logical subject-“entertainers”, action-“became”, and logical object-“politician”.",
        "c) Extract all the noun phrases as potential descriptions from the remaining question segments, which are usually prepositional phrases or clauses.",
        "For the “dog breeds” example, we get the descriptions “Westminster Dog Show”.",
        "d) Apply named entity recognition to the resulting description phrases by using NEParser, a fine-grained named entity recognizer used in our TREC-12 system (Yang et al., 2003).",
        "It assigns tags like “person”, “location”, “time”, “date”, “number”.",
        "For the “dog breed” example, “Westminster” gets the location tag.",
        "After the above analysis, we obtain all the known facets provided in the original question.",
        "We then make use of this knowledge to form web queries to get the right set of pages.",
        "This is a crucial task in dealing with the Web.",
        "One of the query transformation rules is given as follows: (list |directoty|category|top|favorite )?",

        "<object>?",
        "<description1>?",

        "In the above pattern, “?” denotes optional, “...” omit, and “|” alternative.",
        "For example, for the “dog breed” question, we form queries “breed of dog won best in show Westminster Dog Show”, “directory breed of dog best in show Westminster Dog Show”, and “list breed of dog won best in show” etc.",

        "We have presented the techniques used in FADA, a system which aims to find complete and distinct answers on the Web using question parsing, web page classification/clustering and content extraction.",
        "By using the novel approach, we can achieve a recall of 0.422 and F1 of 0.464, which is significantly better than the top performing systems in the TREC-12 List QA task.",
        "The method has been found to be effective.",
        "Our future work includes discovering answers on non-text web information, such as images.",
        "Much text information is stored as images on the web, and hence, cannot be accessed by our approach, and some do contain valuable information."
