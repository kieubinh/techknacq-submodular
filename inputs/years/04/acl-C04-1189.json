        "In this paper we describe the analytic question answering system HITIQA (High-Quality Interactive Question Answering) which has been developed over the last 2 years as an advanced research tool for information analysts.",
        "HITIQA is an interactive open-domain question answering technology designed to allow analysts to pose complex exploratory questions in natural language and obtain relevant information units to prepare their briefing reports.",
        "The system uses novel data-driven semantics to conduct a clarification dialogue with the user that explores the scope and the context of the desired answer space.",
        "The system has undergone extensive hands-on evaluations by a group of intelligence analysts.",
        "This evaluation validated the overall approach in HITIQA but also exposed limitations of the current prototype."

      "text": [
        "Our objective in HITIQA is to allow the user to submit exploratory, analytical questions, such as “What has been Russia’s reaction to the U.S. bombing of Kosovo?” The distinguishing property of such questions is that one cannot generally anticipate what might constitute the answer.",
        "While certain types of things may be expected (e.g., diplomatic statements), the answer is heavily conditioned by what information is in fact available on the topic.",
        "From a practical viewpoint, analytical questions are often underspecified, thus casting a broad net on a space of possible answers.",
        "Questions posed by professional analysts are aimed to probe the available data along certain dimensions.",
        "The results of these probes determine follow up questions, if necessary.",
        "Furthermore, at any stage clarifications may be needed to adjust the scope and intent of each question.",
        "Figure 1 shows a fragment of an analytical session with HITIQA; note that these questions are not aimed at factoids, despite their simple form.",

      "heading": "2 Factoid vs. Analytical QA",
      "text": [
        "There are significant differences between factoid, or fact-finding, and analytical question answering.",
        "A factoid question is normally understood to seek a piece of information that would make a corresponding statement true (i.e., it becomes a fact): “How many states are in the U.S.?” / “There are X states in the U.S.” In this sense, a factoid question usually has just one correct answer that can generally be judged for its truthfulness with respect to some information source.",
        "As noted by Harabagiu et al.",
        "(1999), factoid questions display a distinctive “answer type”, which is the type of the information item needed for the answer, e.g., “person” or “country”, etc.",
        "Most existing factoid QA systems deduct this expected answer type from the form of the question using a finite list of possible answer types.",
        "For example, “Who was the first man in space” expects a “person” as the answer type.",
        "This is generally a very good strategy that has been exploited successfully in a number of automated QA systems, especially in the context of TREC QA1 evaluations.",
        "Given the excellent results posted by the best systems and an adequate performance attained even by some entry-level system, we believe that the process of factoid question answering is now fairly well understood (Harabagiu et al., 2002; Hovy et al., 2000; Prager at al., 2001, Wu et al., 2003).",
        "In contrast to a factoid question, an analytical question has a virtually unlimited variety of syntactic forms with only a loose connection between their syntax and the expected answer.",
        "Given the many possible forms of analytical questions, it would be counter-productive to restrict them to a predefined number of question/answer types.",
        "Therefore, the formation of an answer in analytical QA should instead be guided by the user’s intended interest expressed in the question, as well as through any follow up dialogue with the system.",
        "This clearly involves user's intentions (the speech acts) and how they evolve with respect to the overall information strategy they are pursuing.",
        "In this paper we argue that the semantics (though not necessarily the intent) of an analytical question is more likely to be deduced from the information that is considered relevant to the question than through a detailed analysis of its particular form.",
        "We noted that the questions analysts ask, while clearly part of a strategy, are generally quite flexible and “forgiving”, in the sense that there is always a strong possibility that the answer may not arrive in the expected form, and thus a change of strategy, and even the initial expectations, may be warranted.",
        "This suggests strongly that a solution to analytic QA must involve a dialogue that combines information seeking and problem solving strategies."

        "to obtain perhaps 200 “relevant”",
        "documents from a database.",
        "This gives us an initial information space to work on in order to determine the scope and complexity of the answer, but we are nowhere near the answer yet.",

      "text": [
        "In HITIQA we use a text framing technique to delineate the gap between the possible meaning of the user’s question and the system “understanding” of this question.",
        "We can approximate the meaning of the question by extracting references to known concepts in it, including named entities.",
        "The information retrieved from the database may well lead to other interpretations of the question, and we need to determine which of these are “correct”.",
        "The framing process imposes a partial structure on the text passages that allows the system to systematically compare different passages against each other and against the question.",
        "Framing is not attempting to capture the entire meaning of the passage; it needs to be just sufficient enough to communicate with the user about the differences in their question and the returned text.",
        "In particular, the framing process may uncover topics or aspects within the answer space which the user has not explicitly asked for, and thus may be unaware of their existence.",
        "If these topics or aspects align closely with the user’s question, (i.e., matching many of the salient attributes) we may want to make the user aware of them and let him/her decide if they should be included in the answer.",
        "Frames are built from the retrieved data, after clustering it into several topical groups.",
        "Passages are clustered using a combination of hierarchical clustering and n-bin classification (Hardy et al., 2002a).",
        "Each cluster represents a topic theme within the retrieved set: usually an alternative or complimentary interpretation of the user’s question.",
        "Since clusters are built out of small text passages, we initially associate a frame with each passage that serves as a seed of a cluster.",
        "We subsequently merge passages and their associated frames to arrive at one or more combined frames for the cluster.",
        "HITIQA starts text framing by building a general frame on the seed passages of the clusters and any of the top N (currently N=10) scored passages that are not already in a cluster.",
        "The general frame represents an event or a relation involving any number of entities, which make up the frame’s attributes, such as LOCATION, PERSON, ORGANIZATION, DATE, etc.",
        "Attributes are extracted from text passages by BBN’s Identifinder, which tags 24 types of named entities.",
        "The event/relation itself could be pretty much anything, e.g., accident, pollution, trade, etc.",
        "and it is captured into the TOPIC attribute from the central verb or noun phrase of the passage.",
        "In the general frame, attributes have no assigned roles; they are loosely grouped around the TOPIC (Figure 2).",
        "We have also defined three slightly more specialized typed frames by assigning roles to selected attributes in the general frame.",
        "These three “specialized” frames are: (1) a Transfer frame with three roles including FROM, TO and OBJECT; (2) a two-role Relation frame with AGENT and OBJECT roles; and (3) an one-role Property frame.",
        "These typed frames represent certain generic events/relationships, which then map into more specific event types in each domain.",
        "Other frame types may be defined if needed, but we do not anticipate there will be more than a handful all together.2 For example, another 3-role frame may be State-Change frame with AGENT, OBJECT and INSTRUMENT roles, etc.3"

        "A single text passage may invoke one or more typed frames, or none at all.",
        "When no typed frame is invoked, the general frame is used as default.",
        "If a typed frame is invoked, HITIQA will attempt to identify the roles, e.g. FROM, TO, OBJECT, etc.",

        "The domain-adapted frames were used for sessions with intelligence analysts working with the WMD Domain (see below).",

        "(Humphreys et al., 1998).",
        "What we’re trying to do here is to “fit” a frame over a text passage.",
        "This also means that multiple frames can be associated with a text passage, or to be exact, with a cluster of passages.",
        "Since most of the passages that undergo the framing process are part of some cluster of very similar passages, the added redundancy helps to reinforce the most salient features for extraction.",
        "This makes the framing process potentially less error-prone than MUC-style template filling.",
        "A very similar framing process is applied to the user’s question, resulting in one or more Goal frames, which are subsequently compared to the data frames obtained from retrieved text passages.",
        "A Goal frame can be a general frame or any of the typed frames.",

        "The main advantage of the AMITIES model is its reliance on data-driven semantics which allows for spontaneous and mixed initiative dialogue to occur.",
        "By contrast, the major approaches to implementation of dialogue systems to date rely on systems of functional transitions that make the resulting system much less flexible.",
        "In the grammar-based approach, which is prevalent in commercial systems, such as in various telephony products, as well as in practically oriented research prototypes (e.g., DARPA Communicator; Seneff and Polifoni, 2000; Ferguson and Allen, 1998), a complete dialogue transition graph is designed to guide the conversation and predict user responses, which is suitable for closed domains only.",
        "In the statistical variation of this approach, a transition graph is derived from a large body of annotated conversations (e.g., Walker, 2000; Litman and Pan, 2002).",
        "This latter approach is facilitated through a dialogue annotation process, e.g., using Dialogue Act Markup in Several Layers (DAMSL) (Allen and Core, 1997), which is a system of functional dialogue acts.",
        "Nonetheless, an efficient, spontaneous dialogue cannot be designed on a purely functional layer.",
        "Therefore, here we are primarily interested in the semantic layer, that is, the information exchange and information building effects of a conversation.",
