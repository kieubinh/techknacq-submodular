        "Although empirical results with supervised KPCA models demonstrate significantly better accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art achieved by either na¨ıve Bayes or maximum entropy models on Senseval-2 data, we identify specific sparse data conditions under which supervised KPCA models deteriorate to essentially a most-frequent-sense predictor.",

        "Experiments performed on the Senseval2 English lexical sample data show that KPCA-based word sense disambiguation method is capable of outperforming other widely used WSD models including na¨ıve Bayes, maximum entropy, and SVM models.",
        "Despite the excellent performance of the supervised KPCA-based WSD model on average, though, our further error analysis investigations have suggested certain limitations.",
        "In particular, the supervised KPCA-based model often appears to perform poorly when it encounters target words whose contexts are highly dissimilar to those of any previously seen instances in the training set.",
        "Empirically, the supervised KPCA-based model nearly always disambiguates target words of this kind to the most frequent sense.",
        "As a result, for this particular subset of test instances, the precision achieved by the KPCA-based model is essentially no higher than the precision achieved by the most-frequent-sense baseline model (which simply always selects the most frequent sense for the target word).",
        "The work reported in this paper stems from a hypothesis that the most-frequent-sense",
        "strategy can be bettered for this category of errors.",
        "This is a case of data sparseness, so the observation should not be very surprising.",
        "Such behavior is to be expected from classifiers in general, and not just the KPCA-based model.",
        "Put another way, even though KPCA is able to generalize over combinations of dependent features, there must be a sufficient number of training instances from which to generalize.",
        "The nature of KPCA, however, suggests a strategy that is not applicable to many of the other conventional WSD models.",
        "We propose a model in this paper that takes advantage of unsupervised training using large quantities of unannotated corpora, to help compensate for sparse data.",
        "Note that although we are using the WSD task to explain the model, in fact the proposed model is not limited to WSD applications.",
        "We have hypothesized that the KPCA-based method is likely to be widely applicable to other NLP tasks; since data sparseness is a common problem in many NLP tasks, a weakly-supervised approach allowing the KPCA-based method to compensate for data sparseness is highly desirable.",

Suppose Φ is a nonlinear mapping from the input space Rn to the feature space F.
