        "Our extraction can thus be done directly on the semantic output of the parser.",

        "We are parsing the definition sentences using an HPSG Japanese grammar and parser and treebanking the results into the Hinoki treebank (Bond et al., 2004).",
        "We then train a statistical model on the treebank and use it to parse the remaining definition sentences, and extract an ontology from them.",
        "In the next phase, we will sense tag the definition sentences and use this information and the thesaurus to build a model that combines syntactic and semantic information.",
        "We will also produce a richer ontology – by combining information for word senses not only from their own definition sentences but also from definition sentences that use them (Dolan et al., 1993), and by extracting selectional preferences.",
        "Once we have done this for the core vocabulary, we will look at ways of extending our lexicon and ontology to less familiar words.",

        "Currently, just over 80% of the sentences can be parsed.",
        "An MRS consists of a bag of labeled elementary predicates and their arguments, a list of scoping constraints, and a pair of relations that provide a hook into the representation – a label, which must outscope all the handles, and an index (Copestake et al., 2001).",

        "Although the actual hypernym is in very different positions in the Japanese and English definition sentences, it is the hook in both the semantic representations.",
        "For some definition sentences (around 20%), further parsing of the semantic representation is necessary.",
        "The most common case is where the index is linked to a coordinate construction.",
        "In that case, the coordinated elements have to be extracted, and we build two relationships.",

        "We also extract information not explicitly labeled, such as the domain of the word, as in Figure 3.",
        "Here the adpositional phrase representing the domain has wide scope – in effect the definition means “In golf, [a driver3 is] a club for playing long strokes”.",

        "To parse this, we added a construction to the grammar that allows an NP fragment heading an utterance to have an adpositional modifier.",
