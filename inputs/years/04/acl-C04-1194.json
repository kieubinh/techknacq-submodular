        "Semantic resources have proved to be useful in information retrieval and information extraction for applications such as query expansion (Voor-hees, 1998), text summarization (Harabagiu and Maiorano, 2002) or question/answering (Paşca and Harabagiu, 2001).",
        "But this work has also shown that these resources must be used with caution: they bring on an improvement of results only if word sense disambiguation is performed with a great accuracy.",
        "These findings bring one of the first roles of a semantic resource to light: discriminating and characterizing the senses of a set of words.",
        "The main semantic resources with a wide coverage that can be exploited by computers are lexico-semantic networks such as WordNet.",
        "Because of the way they were built, mainly by hand, these networks are not fundamentally different from traditional dictionaries.",
        "Hence, it is not very surprising that they were criticized, as in (Harabagiu et al., 1999), for not being suitable for Natural Language Processing.",
        "They were criticized both about the nature of the senses they discriminate and the way they characterize them.",
        "Their senses are considered as too fine-grained but also incomplete.",
        "Moreover, they are generally defined through their relations with synonyms, hyponyms and hyperonyms but not by elements that describe the contexts in which they occur.",
        "One of the solutions for solving this problem consists in automatically discovering the senses of words from corpora.",
        "Each sense is defined by a list of words that is not restricted to synonyms or hyperonyms.",
        "The work done in this area can be divided into three main trends.",
        "The first one, represented by (Pantel and Lin, 2002), is not focused on the problem of discovering word senses: its main objective is to build classes of equivalent words from a distributionalist viewpoint, hence to gather words that are mainly synonyms.",
        "In the case of (Pantel and Lin, 2002), the discovering of word senses is a side effect of the clustering algorithm, Cluster By Committee, used for building classes of words: as a word can belong to several classes, each of them can be considered as one of its senses.",
        "The second main trend, found in (Schütze, 1998), (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997) and (Puran-dare, 2003), represents each instance of a target word by a set of features that occur in its neighborhood and applies an unsupervised clustering algorithm to all its instances.",
        "Each cluster is then considered as a sense of the target word.",
        "The last trend, explored by (Véronis, 2003), (Dorow and Widdows, 2003) and (Rapp, 2003), starts from the cooccurrents of a word recorded from a corpus and builds its senses by gathering its cooccurrents according to their similarity or their dissimilarity.",
        "Our work takes place in this last trend."

        "The starting point of the method we present in this article is a network of lexical cooccurrences, that is a graph whose vertices are the significant words of a corpus and edges represent the cooccurrences between these words in the corpus.",
        "The discovering of word senses is performed word by word and the processing of a word only relies on the subgraph that contains its cooccurrents.",
        "The first step of the method consists in building a matrix of similarity between these cooccurrents by exploiting their relations in the subgraph.",
        "An unsupervised clustering algorithm is then applied for grouping these cooccurrents and giving rise to the senses of the considered word.",
        "This method, as the ones presented in (Véronis, 2003), (Dorow and Widdows, 2003) and (Rapp, 2003), relies on the following hypothesis: in the subgraph gathering the cooccurrents of a word, the number of relations between the cooccurrents defining a sense is higher than the number of relations that these cooccurrents have with those defining the other senses of the considered word.",
        "The clustering algorithm that we use is an adaptation of the Shared Nearest Neighbors (SNN) algorithm presented in (Ertöz et al., 2001).",
        "This algorithm particularly fits our problem as it automatically determines the number of clusters, in our case the number of senses of a word, and does not take into account the elements that are not representative of the clusters it builds.",

        "Hence, two networks of lexical cooccurrences were built: one for French, from the Le Monde newspaper (24 months between 1990 and 1994), and one for English, from the L.A. Times newspaper (2 years, part of the TREC corpus).",
        "The size of each corpus was around 40 million words.",
        "The building process was the same for the two networks.",
        "First, the initial corpus was preprocessed in order to characterize texts by their topically significant words.",
        "Thus, we retained only the lemmatized form of plain words, that is, nouns, verbs and adjectives.",
        "Cooccurrences were classically extracted by moving a fixed-size window on texts.",
        "Parameters were chosen in order to catch topical relations: the window was rather large, 20- word wide, and took into account the boundaries of texts; moreover, cooccurrences were indifferent to word order.",
        "As (Church and Hanks, 1990), we adopted an evaluation of mutual information as a cohesion measure of each cooccurrence.",
        "This measure was normalized according to the maximal mutual information relative to the considered corpus.",
        "After filtering the less significant cooccurrences (cooccurrences with less than 10 occurrences and cohesion lower than 0.1), we got a network with approximately 23,000 words and 5.2 million cooccurrences for French, 30,000 words and 4.8 million cooccurrences for English."

        "But this possibility is implicitly limited by the similarity measure used for comparing the elements to cluster.",
        "In our case, the elements to cluster are the cooccurrents in the network of lexical cooccurrences of the word whose senses have to be discriminated.",
        "Within the same framework, we tested two measures for evaluating the similarity between the cooccurrents of a word in order to get word senses with different levels of granularity.",
        "The first measure corresponds to the cohesion measure between words in the cooccurrence network.",
        "If there is no relation between two words in the network, the similarity is equal to zero.",
        "This measure has the advantage of being simple and efficient from an algorithmic viewpoint but some semantic relations are difficult to catch only from cooccurrences in texts.",
        "For instance, we experimentally noticed that there are few synonyms of a word among its cooccurrents1.",
        "Hence, we can expect that some senses that are discriminated by the algorithm actually refer to one sense.",
        "To overcome this difficulty, we also tested a measure that relies not only on first order cooccurrences but also on second order cooccurrences, which are known to be “less sparse and more robust” than first order ones (Schütze, 1998).",
        "This measure is based on the following principle: a vector whose size is equal to the number of cooccurrents of the considered word is associated to each of its cooccurrents.",
        "This vector contains the cohesion values between this cooccurrent and the other ones.",
        "As for the first measure, a null value is taken when there is no relation between two words in the cooccurrence network.",

        "this step only consists in replacing, in the spar-sified graph, the value of each edge by the number of direct neighbors shared by the two cooccurrents linked by this edge.",

        "Its aim is to help finding the seeds of the senses, i.e. the cooccurrents that are the most representative of a set of cooccurrents.",
        "This step is also a means for discarding the cooccurrents that have no relation with the other ones.",
        "More precisely, two cooccurrents are considered as strongly linked if the number of the neighbors they share is higher than a fixed threshold.",
        "The higher than a fixed threshold.",
        "The number of strong links of each cooccurrent is then computed.",
        "4. identification of the sense seeds and filtering of noise: the sense seeds and the cooccurrents to discard are determined by comparing their number of strong links with a fixed threshold.",
        "5. building of senses: this step mainly consists in associating to the sense seeds identified by the previous step the remaining cooccurrents that are the most similar to them.",
        "The result is a set of clusters that each represents a sense of the target word.",
        "For associating a cooccurrent to a sense seed, the strength of the link between them must be higher than a given threshold.",

        "We can notice that a significant percentage of words do not have any sense, even with second order cooccurrences.",
        "This comes from the fact that their cooccurrents are weakly linked to each other in the cooccurrence network they are part of, which probably means that their senses are not actually represented in this network.",
        "We can also notice that the use of second order cooccurrence actually leads to have a smaller number of senses by word, hence to have senses with a larger definition.",

        "For word senses, the WordNet-like lexico-semantic networks can be considered as such a standard.",
        "Using this kind of networks for evaluating the word senses that we find is of course criticizable as our aim is to overcome their insufficiencies.",
        "Nevertheless, as these networks are carefully controlled, such an evaluation provides at least a first judgment about the reliability of the discovered senses.",
        "We chose to take up the evaluation method proposed in (Pantel and Lin, 2002).",
        "This method relies on WordNet and shows a rather good agreement between its results and human judgments (88% for Pantel and Lin).",
        "As a consequence, our evaluation was done only for English, and more precisely with WordNet 1.7.",
        "For each considered word, the evaluation method tries to map one of its discovered senses with one of its synsets in WordNet by applying a specific similarity measure.",
        "Hence, only the precision of the word sense discovering algorithm is evaluated but Pantel and Lin indicate that recall is not very significant in this context: a discovered sense may be correct and not present in WordNet and conversely, some senses in WordNet are very close and should be joined for most of the applications using WordNet.",
        "They define a recall measure but only for ranking the results of a set of systems.",
        "Hence, it cannot be applied in our case.",
        "The similarity measure between a sense and a synset used for computing precision relies on the Lin’s similarity measure between two synsets:",
        "where s is the most specific synset that subsumes s1 and s2 in the WordNet hierarchy and P(s) represents the probability of the synset s estimated from a reference corpus, in this case the SemCor corpus.",
        "We used the implementation of this measure provided by the Perl module WordNet ::Similarity v0.06 (Patwardhan and Pedersen, 2003).",
        "The similarity between a sense and a synset is more precisely defined as the average value of the similarity values between the words that characterize the sense, or a subset of them, and the synset.",
        "The similarity between a word and a synset",
        "is equal to the highest similarity value among those between the synset and the synsets to which the word belongs to.",

        "A sense is mapped to the synset that is the most similar to it, providing that the similarity between them is higher than a fixed threshold (equal to 0.25 as in (Pantel and Lin, 2002)).",
        "Finally, the precision for a word is given by the proportion of its senses that match one of its synsets.",
        "Table 4 gives the results of the evaluation of our algorithm for the words of the English cooccurrence network that are nouns only and for which at least one sense was discovered.",
        "As Pantel and Lin, we only take into account for evaluation 4 words of each sense, whatever the number of words that define it.",
        "But, because of the way our senses are built, we have not a specific measure of the similarity between a word and the words that characterize its senses.",

        "A clear difference can be noted between the two variants.",
        "With the optimal choice of the four words, we get results that are similar to those of Pantel and Lin: their precision is equal to 60.8 with an average number of words defining a sense equal to 14.",
        "On the other hand, Table 4 shows that the words selected on the basis of their number of strong links are not strongly linked in WordNet (according to Lin’s measure) to their target word.",
        "This does not mean that the selected words are not interesting for describing the senses of the target word but more probably that the semantic relations that they share with the target word are different from hyperonymy.",
        "The results of Pantel and Lin can be explained by the fact that their algorithm is based on the clustering of similar words, i.e. words that are likely to be synonyms, and not on the clustering of the cooccurrents of a word, which are not often synonyms of that word.",
        "Moreover, their initial corpus is much larger (around 144 millions words) than ours and they make use of more elaborated tools, such as a syntactic analyzer.",
        "As expected, the results obtained with first order cooccurrences (LAT-1.no), which produce a higher number of senses by word, are lower than the results obtained with second order cooccurrences (LAT-2.no).",
        "However, without a recall measure, it is difficult to draw a clear conclusion from this observation: some senses of LAT-1.no probably result from the artificial division of an actual word sense but the fact to have more homogeneous senses in LAT-2.no also facilitates in this case the mapping with WordNet’s synsets."
