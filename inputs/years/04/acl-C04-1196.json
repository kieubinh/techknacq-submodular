        "The Geometry Cognitive Tutor is designed to help high school and middle school students learn geometry.",
        "As a kind of Cognitive Tutor (Anderson et al.",
        "1995), the system is based on an underlying cognitive model, implemented as an ACT-R production system (Anderson and Lebiere 1998), of both novice and ideal student knowledge.",
        "This model is used to monitor student performance and to provide assistance just when students need it and in a context that demands it.",
        "Currently the Geometry Cognitive Tutor is in regular use (two days per week) in about 350 schools around the US.",
        "The tutor proposes problems to students and checks their solutions step by step.",
        "It can also provide context-sensitive hints at each step in solving the problem, as needed.",
        "The students are asked to compute various elements of the problem (mostly angle measures) by applying the theorems and definitions they have learned.",
        "In case the results are correct, the students are also asked to provide a justification for their results.",
        "In the version of the tutor that is currently in use in schools, the justification consists in choosing the right theorem or definition out of a menu.",
        "The choice is accepted or rejected by the tutor, accordingly.",
        "The use of this tutor in combination with classroom instruction has been shown to lead to improvements in studentsÕ test scores over traditional classroom instruction alone (Koedinger et al.",
        "1997).",
        "Experiments have also shown that the use of menu-based justifications help students learn with greater understanding over a tutor that does not ask for justifications (Aleven and Koedinger 2002).",
        "However there is room for improvement.",
        "Classroom observation shows that some students try to game the system by choosing each item in the menu in turn, until one is accepted.",
        "Even when this is not the case, it is possible that simply recognizing the name of the correct theorem or definition out of a menu does not imply that the student is fully knowledgeable about the actual content of the theorem involved.",
        "Thus it is plausible that asking the students to express the content of these theorems and definitions in their own words as a form of self-explanation could lead to a deeper level of their understanding.",
        "To verify this hypothesis we are currently developing the Geometry Explanation Tutor.",
        "This version is based on the Geometry Cognitive Tutor, with the modification that the justification consists of a natural language sentence that expresses the content of the theorem or definition used to derive the result, in free form.",
        "The tutor checks the semantic content of the explanation and provides feedback on its correctness and completeness.",
        "In case the explanation quality is deemed not good enough, the student is allowed to refine it, until it becomes acceptable.",
        "Thus, one of the main problems that the Geometry Explanation Tutor faces is to determine with accuracy the semantic content of studentsÕ utterances.",
        "There are many different ways to express the same semantic content, which have to be recognized as being equivalent.",
        "The determination of equivalence relations has to work reliably over variation of syntactic structure, variation of content words, or a combination of both.",
        "For example, the sentences below all express the same geometry theorem, about the measures of angles formed by other angles.",
        "An angle formed by adjacent angles is equal to the sum of these angles.",
        "The measure of an angle formed by other angles is equal to the sum of the measures of those adjacent angles.",
        "An angle's measure is equal to the sum of the two adjacent angles that form it.",
        "The sum of the measures of two adjacent angles is equal to the measure of the angle formed by the two angles.",
        "The measure of an angle formed by two adjacent angles is equal to the sum of the measures of the two angles.",
        "If adjacent angles form an angle, its measure is their sum.",
        "When an angle is formed by adjacent angles, its measure is equal to the sum of those angles.",
        "The process has also to be consistent, so no unwarranted conclusions are derived from the text, and robust, in an environment of imprecise or ungrammatical language, as uttered more often than not by high school students.",
        "Many times this content equivalence relies on inferences specific to the domain of discourse.",
        "Our hypothesis is that such a high-precision recognition process needs to be based on contextual information about the domain of discourse modeled in a logic system."

        "It also passes the results back to the tutor.",
        "The chart parser is the main engine of the system.",
        "It uses linguistic knowledge about the target natural language from the unification grammar and the lexicon.",
        "The parser used currently is LCFlex, a left-corner active-chart parser developed at the University of Pittsburgh (Rose and Lavie 1999).",
        "The parser calls the feature structure unifier in order to process restrictions attached to grammar rules and build feature structures for each phrase successfully recognized.",
        "These feature structures store lexical, syntactic, and semantic properties of corresponding words and phrases.",
        "The parser uses an active chart that serves as a storage area for all valid phrases that could be built from the word sequence it received up to each point in the process.",
        "Some of the restrictions in the grammar are directives to the description logic system, currently Loom (MacGregor 1991).",
        "The logics system relies on a model of the domain of discourse, encoded as concepts, relations, and production rules, in the two knowledge bases.",

        "Based on this knowledge base, the logic system builds compositionally a model-theoretic semantic representation for the sentence, as a set of instances of various concepts connected through various relations.",

        "The logic system performs forward-chaining classification of resulting instances, and also ensures semantic coherence of the semantic representation.",
