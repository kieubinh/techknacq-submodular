        "Since the introduction of the TREC QA track (Voorhees, 2001), question answering systems for document collections have attracted a lot of attention.",
        "The goal is to return from the collection text snippets (eg., 50 or 250 characters long) or exact answers (e.g., names, dates) that answer natural language questions submitted by users.",
        "A typical system first classifies the question into one of several categories (questions asking for locations, persons, etc.",
        "), producing expectations of types of named entities that must be present in the answer (location names, person names, etc.).",
        "Using the question terms as a query, an information retrieval (IR) system identifies possibly relevant passages in the collection, often after query expansion (e.g., adding synonyms).",
        "Snippets of these passages are then selected and ranked, based on criteria such as whether or not they contain the expected types of named entities, the percentage of question words in each snippet, the percentage of words that also occur in other candidate snippets, etc.",
        "The system reports the most highly-ranked snippets, or, in the case of exact answers, named entities of the required type therein.",
        "Unfortunately, the approach highlighted above falls short with questions that do not generate expectations of particular types of named entities and contain very few non-stop-words.",
        "Definition questions (e.g. “What is a nanometer?”, “Who was Duke Ellington?”) have both properties, and are particularly common.",
        "In TREC-2001, where the distribution of question types reflected that of real user logs, 27% of the questions were requests for definitions.",
        "Hence, techniques to handle this category of questions are very important.",
        "We propose a new method to answer definition questions, that combines and extends the technique of Prager et al.",
        "(2001, 2002), which relied on WordNet hypernyms, and that of Joho et al.",
        "(2001, 2002), which relied on manually crafted lexical patterns, sentence position, and word co-occurrence across candidate answers.",
        "We train an SVM (Schölkopf and Smola, 2002) on vectors whose attributes include the verdict of Prager et al.’s method, the attributes of Joho et al., and additional phrasal attributes that we acquire automatically.",
        "The SVM is then used to identify and rank 250-character snippets, each intended to contain a standalone definition of a given term, much as in TREC QA tasks prior to 2003.",
        "In TREC-2003, the answers to definition questions had to be lists of complementary snippets (Voorhees, 2003), as opposed to single-snippet definitions.",
        "Here, we focus on the pre-2003 task, for which TREC data were publicly available during our work.",
        "We believe that this task is still interesting and of practical use.",
        "For example, a list of single-snippet definitions accompanied by their source URLs can be a good starting point for users of search engines wishing to find definitions.",
        "Single-snippet definitions can also be useful in information extraction, where the templates to be filled in often require short entity descriptions; see Radev and McKeown (1997).",
        "Experiments indicate that our method clearly outperforms the techniques it builds upon in the task we considered.",
        "We sketch in section 6 how we plan to adapt our method to the post-2003 TREC task."

        "(2001, 2002) observe that definition questions can often be answered by hypernyms; for example, “schizophrenia” is a “mental illness”, where the latter is a hypernym of the former in WordNet.",
        "Deciding which hypernym to report, however, is not trivial.",
        "To use an example of Prager et al., in “What is a meerkat?” WordNet provides hypernym synsets such as {“viverrine”, “viverrine mammal”} (level 1), {“carnivore”} (level 2), {“placental”, ...} (level 3), {“mammal”} (level 4), up to {“entity”, “something”} (level 9).",
        "In a neutral context, the most natural response is arguably “mammal” or “animal”.",
        "A hypernym on its own may also not be a satisfactory answer.",
        "Responding that an amphibian is an animal is less satisfactory than saying it is an animal that lives both on land and in water.",
        "Prager et al.",
        "identify the best hypernyms by counting how often they co-occur with the definition term in two-sentence passages of the document collection.",
        "They then short-list the passages that contain both the term and any of the best hypernyms, and rank them using measures similar to those of Radev et al.",
        "(2000).",
        "More precisely, given a term to define, they compute the level-adapted count (LAC) of each of its hypernyms, defined as the number of two-sentence passages where the hypernym co-occurs with the term divided by the distance between the term and the hypernym in WordNet’s hierarchy.",
        "They then retain the hypernym with the largest LAC, and all the hypernyms whose LAC is within a 20% margin from the largest one.",
        "To avoid very general hypernyms (e.g., {“entity”, “something”}), Prager et al.",
        "discard the hypernyms of the highest 1 or 2 levels in WordNet’s trees, if the distance from the top of the tree to the definition term is up to 3 or 5, respectively; if the distance is longer, they discard the top three levels.",
        "This ceiling is raised gradually if no co-occurring hypernym is found.",
        "Prager et al.’s method performed well with the definition questions and documents of TREC-9 (Prager et al., 2001).",
        "In 20 out of the 24 definition questions they considered (83.3%), it managed to return at least one correct response in the five most highly ranked two-sentence passages; in all 20 questions, the correct response was actually the highest ranked.",
        "In TREC-2001, however, where there were more definition questions mirroring more directly real user queries, this percentage dropped to 46% (Prager et al., 2002).",
        "In 44 of the 130 definition questions (33.8%) they considered, WordNet did not help at all, because it either did not contain the term whose definition was sought, or none of its hypernyms were useful even as partial definitions.",
        "Even when WordNet contained a hypernym that constituted a self-contained definition, it was not always selected.",
        "In work that led to an alternative method, Hearst (1998) sketched a method to identify patterns that signal particular lexical semantic relations, in effect a bootstrapping approach.",
        "Applying this process by hand, Hearst was able to identify four high precision hyponym–hypernym patterns that are common across text genres.",
        "The patterns are shown below in the slightly modified form of Joho and Sanderson (2000).",
        "Here, qn (query noun) and dp (descriptive phrase) are phrases containing hyponyms and hypernyms, respectively.",
        "(1) (dp such |such dp) as qn e.g., “injuries such as broken bones” (2) qn (and |or) other dp e.g., “broken bones and other injuries” (3) dp especially qn e.g., “injuries especially broken bones” (4) dp including qn",
        "e.g., “European countries including England, France, and Spain” Compared to Prager et al.’s method, Hearst’s patterns have the advantage that they may identify hyponym –hypernym relations that are not present in WordNet, which is often the case with domain-specific terminology and proper names.",
        "Joho and Sanderson (2000) observe that co-occurrences of hyponyms and hypernyms are often indicative of contexts that define the hyponyms.",
        "Instead of using WordNet, they identify hyponym– hypernym contexts using Hearst’s patterns, to which they add the following ones.1 Here, qn is the term to define, and dp is a phrase that contains a definition of qn; dp no longer necessarily contains a hypernym of qn.",
        "Each pattern is assigned a weight, which is its precision on a training set (the number of sentences it correctly identifies as containing a definition, over the number of sentences it matches).",
        "(5) qn “(” dp “)” |“(” dp “)” qn e.g., “MP (Member of Parliament)” (6) qn (is |was |are |were) (a |an |the) dp e.g., “Tony Blair is a politician” (7) qn , (a |an |the) dp e.g., “Tony Blair, the politician” (8) qn , which (is |was |are |were) dp e.g., “bronchitis, which is a disease of...” (9) qn , dp , (is |was |are |were)",
        "e.g., “Blair, Prime Minister of Britain, is...” Joho and Sanderson first locate all the sentences of the document collection that contain the term to define, and then rank them using three attributes.",
        "The first one (KPW) is the weight of the pattern the sentence matched, if any.",
        "The second attribute (SN) is the ordinal number of the sentence in its document, ignoring sentences that do not contain the term; sentences that mention first the term in a document are more likely to define it.",
        "The third attribute (WC) shows how many of the words that 1 We ignore a variant of (7) that ends in “.”, “?” or “!”.",
        "are common across candidate answers are present in the sentence.",
        "More precisely, to compute WC, Joho and Sanderson retrieve the first sentence of each document that contains the definition term, and retain the 20 most frequent words of these sentences after applying a stop-list and a lemmatizer.",
        "WC is the percentage of these words that are present in the sentence being ranked.",
        "The sentences are ranked using the weighted sum of the three attributes, after hand-tuning the weights of the sum on a training set.",
        "In Joho et al.",
        "(2001), this method was evaluated with 50 definition questions and the top 600 documents that Google returned for each definition term.",
        "It returned a correct definition in the five top-ranked sentences in 66% of the questions.2 As with Prager et al.’s method, then, there is scope for improvement."

        "Joho et al.’s technique does not rely on a predetermined ontology, which makes it less vulnerable to domain-specific terminology and proper names.",
        "Its limited pattern set, however, cannot capture definitions that are phrased in less typical ways, and the fact that the weights of the three attributes are hand-tuned raises doubts as to whether they are optimal.",
        "Our method overcomes these limitations by combining the two approaches in a common machine learning framework, and by using a larger attribute set.",
        "We assume that a question processing module that separates definition from other types of questions is available, and that in each definition question it also identifies the term to be defined.",
        "When such a module is not available, the user can be asked to specify explicitly the question type and the term to be defined, via a form-based interface as in Buchholtz and Daelemans (2001).",

        "(We have experimented with higher degree polynomial kernels, but there was no sign of improvement.)",

        "The SVM is trained on these vectors to predict the category of new, unseen vectors from their attributes.",
        "The SVM implementation we used actually returns confidence scores, showing how probable it is that a particular vector belongs to each category.4 Using a classifier that returns confidence scores instead of binary decisions is crucial, because the training vectors that correspond to definitions are much fewer than the vectors for non-definitions (3004 vs. 15469 in our dataset of section 4).",
        "As a result, the induced classifier is biased towards non-definitions, and, hence, most unseen vectors receive higher confidence scores for the category of non-definitions than for the category of definitions.",
        "We do not compare the two scores.",
        "We pick the five vectors whose confidence score for the category of definitions is highest, and report the corresponding snippets; in effect, we use the SVM as a ranker, rather than a classifier; see also Ravichandran et al.",
        "(2003).",
        "The imbalance between the two categories can be reduced by considering (during both training and classification) only the first three snippets of each document, which discards mostly non-definitions.",
        "In the first configuration of our learning-based approach, the attributes of the vectors are roughly those of Joho et al.",
        ": two numeric attributes for SN and WC (section 2), and a binary attribute for each one of patterns (1)–(9) showing if the pattern is satisfied.",

        "This configuration can be seen as an approximation of Joho et al.’s method, although it is actually an improvement, because of the extra attributes and the fact that it uses an SVM learner",
        "instead of a weighted sum with hand-tuned weights to combine the attributes.",
        "The second configuration is identical to the first one, except that it adds an extra binary attribute showing if the snippet contains one of its best hypernyms, as returned by the baseline.",
        "This is essentially a combination of the approaches of Prager et al.",
        "and Joho et al.",
        "Unlike simple voting (Chu-Carroll et al., 2003), the two methods contribute attributes to the instance representations (vectors) of an overall learner (the SVM).",
        "This allows the overall learner to assess their reliability and adjust their weights accordingly.",
        "The third configuration adds m extra binary attributes, each corresponding to an automatically acquired pattern.",
        "(In the experiments of section 4, m ranges from 100 to 300.)",
        "Observing that most of the previously proposed patterns are anchored at the term to define, we collect from the documents that the IR engine returns for the training questions all the n-grams (n ∈ {1, 2, 3}) of tokens that occur immediately before or after the definition term.",
        "The n-grams that are encountered at least 10 times are considered candidate patterns.",
        "From these, we select the m patterns with the highest precision scores, where precision is defined as in section 2, but for snippets instead of sentences.",
        "In our experiments, this pattern acquisition process rediscovered several of the patterns (1)– (13) or sub-expressions of them, namely [dp such as qn], [qn and other dp], [qn “(“ dp], [dp “)” qn], [qn is (a |an |the) dp], [qn (are |were) dp], [qn , (a |an |the) dp), [qn , which is dp], [qn , dp], [qn or dp], [qn can dp], [dp called qn], [dp known as qn].",
        "It also discovered some reasonable variations of patterns (1)–(13); e.g, [qn is one dp], [dp , (a |an) qn] (as in “A sudden health problem, a heart attack or ...”), [dp , qn], [qn , or dp].",
        "We include dp, the phrase that defines qn, in the acquired patterns to make them easier to compare to patterns (1)–(13).",
        "The acquired patterns, however, do not predict the position of dp in a snippet.",
        "Many of the acquired patterns at first look odd, but under a closer examination turn out to be reasonable.",
        "For example, definition sentences often start with the term they define, as in “Amphibians are...”, “An alligator is...”, sometimes with the term quoted, which is how patterns like [.",
        "qn], [.",
        "An qn], [.",
        "' ' qn] arise.",
        "Many of the questions in our data set were about diseases, and, hence, several of the acquired patterns were expressions (e.g,, “people with”, “symptoms of”) that co-occur frequently with definitions of diseases in snippets.",
        "This suggests that automatic pattern acquisition would allow domain-specific question answering systems (e.g., systems for medical documents) to exploit domain-specific indicators of definitions.",
        "The pattern acquisition process also produced many patterns (e.g., “the hallucinogenic drug”, “President Rafael”) that do not seem to provide any useful information in general, although they occurred frequently in definition snippets of our training data.",
        "Since we did not filter manually the automatically acquired patterns, patterns of the latter kind gave rise to irrelevant attributes that carried noise.",
        "This is a common problem in machine learning, which most learning algorithms are designed to cope with.",
        "Our experimental results indicate that the SVM learner benefits from the n-gram attributes, despite the noise they introduce.",
        "We also experimented with keeping both high and low precision patterns, hoping to acquire both n-grams that are indicative of definitions and n-grams that are indicative of contexts that do not constitute definitions.",
        "The experimental results, however, were inferior, and manual inspection of the low precision n-grams indicated that they carried mostly noise, suggesting that it is difficult to identify frequent n-grams whose presence rules out definitions reliably.",
        "The reader may wonder why we rely only on precision, rather than selecting also attributes with high recall.",
        "(Here, recall is the number of snippets the pattern correctly identifies as containing a definition, over the total number of snippets that contain a definition.)",
        "In multi-source document collections, like the Web or the TREC documents, one can expect to find several definitions of the same term, phrased in different ways.",
        "Unlike traditional document retrieval tasks, we are not interested in obtaining all the definitions; a single correct one suffices.",
        "Furthermore, as the number of snippets that can be reported is limited, we need to be confident that the snippets we return are indeed definitions.",
        "Hence, we need to rely on high-precision indicators.",
        "Preliminary experiments we performed using the F-measure (with β=1), a combination of recall and precision, instead of precision led to inferior results, confirming that attribute recall is not helpful in this task.",
        "We have also experimented with information gain.",
        "In that case, one selects the n-grams with the m highest IG(C,X) scores, defined below, where C and X are random variables denoting the category of a snippet and the value of the n-gram’s binary attribute, respectively, and H(C) and H(C|X) are the entropy and conditional entropy of C. By selecting the attributes with the highest information gain scores, one selects the attributes that carry most information about the value of C.",
        "Although information gain is one of the best attribute selection measures in text categorization (Yang and Pedersen, 1997), in our case it led to very few attributes with non-zero IG(C,X) scores (around 90 attributes from the entire dataset of section 4).",
        "This is because most of the n-grams are very rare (i.e., P(X=0) is very large), and their absence (X=0) provides very little information about C (i.e., H(C) ≈ H(C |X = 0)).",
        "For example, not encountering [dp such as qn] provides very little information on whether or not the snippet is a definition.",
        "The experiments we performed with the resulting attributes led to inferior results, compared to those that we got via precision.",
        "The fourth configuration is identical to the third one, except that it does not use the attribute that shows if the snippet contains one of the best hypernyms of Prager et al.",
        "(The attribute is present in configurations 2 and 3).",
