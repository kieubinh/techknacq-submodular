        "Several developers have already utilized the platform for a variety of applications, including conversation programs and an artificial personal assistant, tools for automatic analysis of rhyme and meter in Turkish folk poems, a prototype sentence-level translator between Albanian, Turkish, and English, natural language interfaces for generating SQL queries and JAVA code, as well as a text tagger used for collecting statistics about Turkish morpheme order for a speech recognition algorithm.",

        "The obvious potential of natural language processing technology for economic, social and cultural progress can be realized more comprehensively if NLP techniques applicable to a wider selection of the languages of the world are developed.",
        "Before the full-scale treatment of a new language can start, a considerable amount of effort has to be invested to computerize the lexical, morphological and syntactic specifics of that language, which would be required by any nontrivial application.",
        "We built an open-source software platform intended to serve as a common infrastructure that can be of use in the development of new applications involving the processing of Turkish.",
        "The platform, named TOY (Çetinoglu 2001), is essentially a big set of predicates in the logic programming language Prolog.",
        "The choice of Prolog, which was designed specifically with computational linguistics applications in mind, as the implementation language for our software has natural consequences for the knowledge representation setup to be used by other programs built on our platform.",
        "Prolog is based on first-order predicate calculus, it allows knowledge items to be represented in terms of logic-style facts and rules, and a built-in theorem prover drives the execution of Prolog queries.",
        "The TOY program’s internal organization into source files reflects the three different levels (see Figure 1) on which text-based NLP applications can be based.",
        "In terms of that figure, processing at a “deeper” level necessitates all components of “shallower” levels.",
        "In this paper, we describe this infrastructure and how it was adapted to a variety of applications.",

        "A complete lexicon is supposed to contain entries for all morphemes (meaningful units that make up words) for the language in question.",
        "There are two kinds of morphemes: roots and affixes.",
        "In Turkish, all affixes follow the root, that is, they are suffixes.",
        "Our lexicon contains entries for over 29000 roots and 157 suffixes.",
        "A single morpheme may have more than one entry, corresponding to its different allomorphs.",
        "A morpheme definition example for the word “ çocuk” (“child”) is shown in Figure 2.",
        "The semantic representation slot gives a description of the contribution of the morpheme to the meaning of full-size sentences in which it appears: Since the meanings of sentences are represented by predicate logic formulas in our setup, roots contribute “partial” versions of such formulas, with “holes” to be filled by the contributions of the other words of the sentence.",
        "For instance, the semantic representation entry of the noun “ çocuk” is çocuk(_).",
        "In the sentence “Ali çocuktur” (“Ali is a child”), the value of the missing argument is supplied by the name Ali, resulting in the formula çocuk( 'Ali') for the overall sentence.",
        "For noun entries, the commonsense knowledge slot contains a pointer to the location of the thing described by this noun in the taxonomy tree (see Figure 4) used by the program.",
        "(The entry for “ çocuk”, for instance, indicates that it can be reached by descending from the root along the “concrete entity”-“animate-“human being” arcs.)",
        "For verbs, this slot contains a set of restrictions on the various argument slots of the verb.",
        "As an example, the agent of the verb “ye-” (“eat”) is restricted to be a living thing, and its theme is restricted to be a solid."

        "In the infrastructure, possible legal orderings of Turkish morphemes are represented by a large finite state diagram, a small part of which can be seen in Figure 3.",
        "The morphological component of the platform is a finite state transducer that makes use of the lexicon for traversing the arcs of the diagram (adopted, with changes, from Kemal Oflazer’s work on Turkish morphology (Oflazer 1993)) to associate a character string with the list of meaning contributions of its morphemes.",
        "This traversal is complicated by the vowel harmony constraint of Turkish morphology.",
        "This rule means that, when adding a suffix to a word, the allomorph to be added is a function of the last vowel of the word to be extended.",
        "For instance, the plural suffix has the two allomorphs “- ler” and “-lar”.",
        "The Turkish word for “children” is “ çocuklar”, while “olives” is “zeytinler”, since “back vowels” like “a” and “u” require a back vowel in the suffix, whereas “front vowels” like “e” and “i” require a front vowel there.",
        "The program keeps track of the vowels during the transduction to enforce these constraints.",
        "Words of foreign origin which violate vowel harmony are flagged appropriately in the lexicon.",
        "Like most Prolog predicates the morphological component is reversible, that is, the same piece of code can be used both to analyze a given word to obtain its underlying constituents, and to generate a word when given a list of such constituents.",
        "Another built-in feature of Prolog makes it very easy for the program to compute all results associated with a particular input when more than one legal output is possible, as in the case of the analysis of the morphologically ambiguous word “yedi”, where our morphological parser produces, through backtracking, two alternative analyses: the third-person/singular past tense inflection of the verb “ye” (“eat”), and the Turkish number word for “seven”."

        "We encoded a subset of the syntax rules of Turkish in Prolog’s DCG notation.",
        "The DCG formalism allows the computation of the meaning formula of a constituent to be performed in parallel with its syntactic parsing; each DCG rule is written to indicate how the partial meanings of the elements on its right-hand side fit together to produce the semantic expression for the constituent on the left-hand side.",
        "Certain language constructs correspond naturally to the notion of quantification in predicate calculus.",
        "For instance, the sentence “Bir çocuk zeytin yedi.” (“A child ate (an/some) olive(s)”) can be represented by the logical formula",
        "In the Prolog program, existentially quantified expressions like this one have the form some(X,Restrictor,Scope), where X is the quantified variable, and Restrictor and Scope are the two sides of the conjunction (Covington, 1994) some(X, çocuk(X), some(Y, zeytin(Y),ye(EventMarker, X, Y,Location, Time, Goal, Source,Instrument, definite_past, none, positive))) The successful DCG parsing of a sentence also results in a field being instantiated to a symbol representing the sentence’s mood.",
        "Possible values for the mood field are “statement,” “yes_no_question,” and “wh_question.” This component of the program is also designed to be reversible, that is, it can produce the corresponding sentence when given a logical formula, but yet another peculiarity of the language complicates the solution: Turkish word order is (almost) free, which basically means that the sentence constituents can be shuffled around without changing the meaning.",
        "Therefore, a single semantic formula usually corresponds to several different sentences, even without taking synonymity of words into account.",
