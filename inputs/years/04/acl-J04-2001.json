        "Centering mechanisms are designed to model the coherence of discourse by characterizing transitions between utterances in terms of their inferential load and hence their naturalness.",
        "These characterizations are intended to capture intuitions about the “flow” (Chafe 1979) or the “ongoing process of meaning” (Halliday 1994) in discourse.",
        "In this work, we examine a corpus of Japanese email to investigate the mechanisms by which coherence is achieved.",
        "Because this corpus contains a high number of discourse elements that are inferable from the discourse context, we have an opportunity to examine the interplay between standard centering transition definitions and the presence of inferable discourse entities.",
        "We claim on the basis of intuitions of native speakers that the actual level of coherence in the corpus is much higher than the centering account implies, primarily by virtue of the fact that transitions involving inferable entities are often difficult to specify.",
        "We conclude that the standard centering account cannot accurately model the coherence in this corpus.",
        "Detailed analysis reveals that one major problem lies in the requirement of identity of discourse elements in adjacent utterances in order for those elements to contribute to coherence.",
        "We describe this problem and propose two additions to the usual repertoire of transitions that enable a more authentic account of coherence in this corpus, while remaining within a centering framework.",
        "The article is organized as follows.",

        "The central intuitions of centering concern the relationships among the discourse entities appearing or represented in adjacent utterances in a discourse (Walker, Joshi, and Prince 1998).",
        "Each utterance Ui in a discourse is considered to contain a set of discourse entities called forward-looking centers, or Cfs.",
        "These entities are ranked in the Cf list for each utterance according to language-specific ranking principles.",
        "We follow, in general, the ordering principles for Japanese given in Walker, Iida, and Cote (1994) (with some adjustments for possessive phrases as noted in example (1)): Cf ranking for Japanese: (Grammatical OR ∅) topic > empathy > subject > object2 > object > others A special member of the Cf list, the backward-looking center, or Cb, represents the “topic”1 of Ui and is the highest-ranked Cf on the Cf list of Ui−1 which is realized in Ui.",
        "In addition, the preferred center of Ui, or Cp, is the highest-ranked Cf in Ui.",
        "Given Ui and Ui−1, then, there are four different ways in which their Cbs and Cps may be related; each of these is defined as a type of transition state (Table 1).",
        "There are two rules in a centering approach:",
        "Rule 2 captures the centering intuitions concerning coherence: Utterances that CONTINUE the topic of a previous utterance in a prominent position impose a lower inferential load, and are thus more coherent, than utterances which relegate the topic to less prominent positions or which change the topic.",
        "The vast majority of the sentences in our corpus are complex sentences.",
        "Thus, the question of how to interpret centering principles in complex sentences cannot be ignored.",
        "We will consider the basic utterance unit of centering to be the tensed clause",
        "Transition definitions.",
        "and will assume that these clauses form a flat, linear sequence of discourse units, such that the centering output of the first clause in the sentence is the input to the next, and so on, in the spirit of Kameyama (1998) and Suri and McCoy (1994).2 Because the notion of backward-looking center will be critical to the discussion that follows, we look at this notion in greater detail here.",
        "According to Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein (1986, quoted in Walker, Joshi, and Prince [1998]), a center is realized in an utterance U if it “is an element of the situation described by U or the semantic interpretation of some subpart of U” (page 4).",
        "As Walker, Joshi, and Prince (1998) point out, this covers “pronouns, zero pronouns, explicitly realized discourse entities, and... entities inferable from the discourse situation” (page 4).",
        "The definition proposed by Grosz, Joshi, and Weinstein allows inferable entities, that is, entities that are not expressed at the surface level of the utterance or immediately recoverable from the subcategorization properties of the verb (as, for example, zero pronouns are) to constitute centers of an utterance.",

        "The first step in this procedure was to run the corpus through a morphological analyzer, ALT-JAWS (Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation 1996), which rendered all word forms in their canonical (usually kanji [Chinese character]) form.",
        "This is a necessary and standard preprocessing step for most computational analyses of Japanese text, which contains no spaces between word forms to indicate their morphological structure.",
        "In addition, writers of email may use hiragana or katakana (the two syllabaries used for writing primarily function words and foreign words, respectively) even for words that have standard kanji forms (Fais and Yamura-Takei 2003).",
        "These words need to be rendered in kanji as well.",
        "The results of this analysis were checked and corrected by native speakers of Japanese in order to eliminate cases in which the analyzer chose the incorrect kanji form for a homophonous hiragana representation.",

        "This step substantiates the notion that the central factors in the centering approach are the discourse entities of utterances (we will return to this in Section 5.3).",

        "Antecedents were determined by a native speaker of Japanese.",
        "The same native speaker assisted in dividing the text into clauses.",
        "Both of these steps, identifying antecedents and parsing sentences into clauses, can be completed, in theory, by automatic, computational methods (Huls, Bos, and Claassen 1995; Nakaiwa and Shirai 1996; Paul and Sumita 2001; Yamura-Takei et al.",

        "4.6.3 Evaluation of the Use of Semantic Similarity.",
        "We assessed in three ways how well semantic similarity can define COHESIVE transitions and thus contribute to the characterization of coherence in the text.",
        "First, in the 66 clauses with full coverage by the Gainen Base, we examined the 18 instances of what we had, on the basis of intuitive human judgment, designated COHESIVE transitions.",
        "In particular, we focused",
        " on the noun(s) we had singled out in our revised hand-tabulation of the corpus (Table 5) as providing the lexical cohesion in these transitions.1 4 Using results from the individual measures of semantic similarity (the second method described earlier), we determined the noun in Ui with the highest level of semantic similarity to the nouns in Ui−1.",
        "We then compared the nouns picked out by human judgment as providing lexical cohesion with those determined computationally to see if they matched.",
        "We eliminated three cases in which there was only one noun in Ui and thus only one possible choice for the lexically cohering entity, which would, by default, have had the highest semantic similarity to the preceding utterance.",
        "Out of the 15 remaining examples of COHESIVE transitions, in 13 cases, or 87% of the time, the human judgments and the computationally determined choices matched.",
        "The other two assessments of the results are based on centering claims for the relative ease of processing of the different transitions, claims captured in rule 2: CONTINUE transitions impose the lowest inferential load on processors, ROUGH SHIFTs the highest.",
        "Since COHESIVE transitions act like CONTINUE transitions but replace the identity condition on Cbs with a similarity condition, we conjecture that they place only a slightly higher load on processing than CONTINUE transitions.",
        "Likewise, since COMPLETE SHIFTs represent an even greater discontinuity than ROUGH SHIFTs (there being not only no Cb in the utterance, but also no entity even similar to entities in the previous utterance), we conjecture that COMPLETE SHIFTs impose a higher processing load than ROUGH SHIFTs.",
        "We reason that greater semantic similarity corresponds to a lower processing load.15 Granted this assumption, then, utterances that are connected by CONTINUE transitions have the highest semantic similarity, since CONTINUE represents the lowest processing load; those connected by COMPLETE SHIFTs, the lowest semantic similarity, since COMPLETE SHIFT has the highest processing load.",
        "Although the particular ranking of RETAIN, SMOOTH, ROUGH, and COHESIVE transitions is problematic, we are saved from having to make an exact determination by the fact that, among the 66 clauses with full coverage, only CONTINUE, COHESIVE, and COMPLETE SHIFT transitions are well-represented (we simply note the results for the two RETAIN transitions, since this is hardly a large enough sample to be meaningful).",
        "Our reasoning then predicts that CONTINUE transitions have the highest semantic similarity measures, followed by COHESIVE SHIFTs, followed by COMPLETE SHIFTs.",
        "16 In our first assessment of this prediction, we averaged semantic measures for each transition type over the 66 clauses with full coverage by the Gainen Base.",
        "Table 6 gives the averages obtained for both the groupwise and individual analyses.",
        "These results support the ranking of transitions for processing load predicted on the basis of similarity measures.",
        "However, averaging over all messages provides only a gross approximation of the values for each transition type.",
        "To get a more detailed look at this claim, we examined the semantic distances between entities involved in each type of transition within messages.",
        "The 66 clauses with full coverage include six messages with only one clause and four messages with only one transition type represented; this resulted in the elimination",
        "of 19 clauses (since it is impossible to determine relative values of transitions in either of these cases), leaving us with a total of 47 clauses grouped into 12 messages.",
        "We sorted the types of transitions to these clauses within each message by similarity measure.",
        "For each transition, we ascertained whether it fulfilled the prediction for ranking transitions by inferential load that was made on the basis of our earlier assumptions concerning semantic distance.",
        "We assigned two scores for each transition: whether it was appropriately positioned with respect to the preceding transition and with respect to the following transition in the sort.",
        "Those transitions with the highest and the lowest semantic measures were scored only with respect to the following and the preceding transitions, respectively, and thus received just one score.",
        "Two consecutive identical transitions were scored “correct.” Table 7 gives an example of how this scoring was performed for the clauses from one representative message that have full coverage in the Gainen Base.",
        "It lists the type of transition to each clause, the semantic distance to the previous clause, and the scores designating whether that transition is appropriately positioned with respect to the previous and following transitions.",
        "(Recall that the predicted order is CONTINUE, COHESIVE, COMPLETE.)",
        "So, for example, the CONTINUE transition to clause 235 fulfills the ranking prediction with respect to both the previous and the following clauses; its semantic measure is lower than that of only one other clause, which is also a CONTINUE, and is higher than that of a COHESIVE transition.",
        "The COMPLETE SHIFT to clause 227, on the other hand, fulfills the prediction vis-`a-vis the previous transition on the list",
        "aSince we make no claim as to whether the placement of RETAIN is correct or not, we do not count it in these totals.",
        "(i.e., its semantic measure is lower than that of a COHESIVE transition) but violates the prediction with respect to the following transition (i.e., its semantic measure is higher than that of another COHESIVE transition).",
        "For 47 clauses over 12 messages, then, the total number of such scores was 70: 24 scores for the transitions having the highest and lowest measures in each message, and two each for the remaining 23 transitions, one for their positions relative to the transitions above, and the other for their positions relative to the transitions below them.",
        "Recall that we determined similarity in two different ways: first, for the group of nouns in Ui−1 and the group of nouns in Ui, and second, for the group of nouns in Ui−1 and each individual noun in Ui.17 Table 8 reports the total number and percentage of correct and incorrect scores for each transition type in both the groupwise and the individual analyses (the measure taken for Ui in the latter case is the maximum similarity measure out of the measures for all the nouns in Ui).",
        "The results in this table suggest that similarity scores can accurately represent relative coherence as characterized by the transitions in this small sample.",
        "That is, the similarity scores we have examined here reflect the relative load on processing imposed by each type of transition with between 86% and 100% accuracy, with groupwise scores being slightly more accurate than those based on the highest individual score.",
        "In addition, similarity measures never predict a CONTINUE transition with a higher processing load (i.e., lower similarity score) than a COMPLETE SHIFT.",
        "That is, the relative positions of CONTINUE and COMPLETE SHIFT are always correct.",
        "We examined the cases in which similarity scores make an incorrect prediction about relative placement in the scale of processing load.",
        "The one incorrect prediction concerning a CONTINUE (in the individual-analysis method) involves an example in which Ui−1 contains eight nouns; the similarity of each individual noun in Ui to the group of nouns in Ui−1 is “diluted” by the high number of nouns in Ui in this case (the average number of nouns per clause in the corpus is 2.3).",
        "The remaining incorrect predictions involve the assignment of lower similarity scores to COHESIVE transitions than to COMPLETE SHIFTs.",
        "Some of these lower scores for COHESIVE transitions are the result of the fact that world knowledge is necessary to infer a connection between the two clauses.",
        "This is the case, for example, in (7):",
        "drinking party time for TOP exact right “Even if it’s far we can come back to Tokyo just the right time for a drinking party.”",
        "It requires world knowledge to understand that there is a connection between how far away something is and the time that it will take to travel there.",
        "Although humans can make this inference intuitively, that understanding is not represented in the Gainen Base.",

        "As noted in Section 4.3.1, however, in all of these approaches, only a small subset of examples of bridging relations can be handled, because they all attempt to identify some particular relation existing between two elements.",
        "This is a necessary move for resolving bridging references and building text understanding systems, but neither of those is our aim here.",
        "We merely need to identify the level of semantic closeness or similarity between Cfs in Ui and Cfs in Ui−1.",
        "Utilizing instead the more general semantic-distance measure proposed here, then, has several advantages over the explicit choice of particular relation labels.",
        "First, it avoids the need to make choices about which relations can or cannot, should or should not be included, as well as the difficulties with interlabeler reliability that Poesio et al.",

        "This is actually closely tied to another advantage: There is no need to limit the types of semantic relationships into which the Cfs can enter.",

        "The writers of the messages in this corpus made 146 paragraphs (see Table 2); although we know that there is no guarantee that writers’ paragraphing will coincide with shifts in cohesion, this number at least gives us a general estimation of a possible maximal number of COMPLETE SHIFTs (we would expect writers to err on the side of more paragraphs than topics rather than on the side of more topics than paragraphs).",
        "The number of COMPLETE SHIFTs is comfortably within that range.",
        "But there are two confounding factors that make this number higher than is actually appropriate for the nature of the corpus.",

        "Kozima (1993) provides an algorithm for determining where, on the graph of semantic cohesion values of words in a text, likely topic breaks occur and validates that determination against human judgment.",
        "We would say, then, that once a chain breaks or a significant dip in the semantic cohesion value graph occurs, the utterance following such a break is considered the first utterance of a new discourse segment.",

        "Once again, “sufficiently” must be defined; in light of the preliminary results we saw previously, we conjecture that the definition of “low” will be relative to the measures for similarity in the message under scrutiny and not an absolute value (see Section 5.4).",
        "In addition, examination of the particular entities contributing to high levels of semantic similarity might also allow us to characterize the notion of “global topic,” albeit in a differentiated way.",
        "That is, if we determine not just one semantic distance measure for the sets of entities in two adjacent utterances, but the individual distances for each combination of those entities (as briefly described in note 13), we can determine those entities that are contributing the greatest amount of semantic similarity to the measure and identify a cluster of entities that can be taken to represent a global topic.",
        "This concept is worth examining more closely, since it bears on some of the very foundations of centering theory.",
        "The Cb of an utterance “represents the discourse entity that the utterance Ui most centrally concerns, similar to what is elsewhere called the ‘topic’” (Walker, Joshi, and Prince 1998, page 3).",
        "The presence of a Cb is taken to be both a necessary and a sufficient condition for topic coherence.",
        "However, in our account, utterances that have a coherent relationship to the immediate context of discourse may nonetheless have no Cb; that is, the presence of a Cb is, in our approach, only a sufficient condition.",
        "Our claim, then, is that this more accurately reflects the nature of how coherence is maintained in discourse: not only through the explicit repetition of a central entity, but also through the successive use of entities that are closely related semantically.",
        "In our account, Cbs are recognized and function just as in standard centering theory, but their absence, a common situation in at least some kinds of discourse, does not signal a breakdown in coherence.",
        "Coherence may be maintained as well by semantically similar entities, which can become Cbs in their own right, as match-up information and boxing do in (6).",

        "Upon subjecting a corpus of Japanese email data to a centering analysis, it became clear that a centering description of these messages had to rely heavily on inferable centers and was not adequate to capture the coherence this corpus displays.",
        "We couched the notion of connectedness that inferable centers were intended to capture in terms of the more principled and explicit relation of lexical relatedness.",
        "We used this relation, then, to supplement the standard inventory of transitions with well-defined transition types that more accurately characterize the nature of coherence in this corpus and demonstrated the computational feasibility of this approach in a preliminary implementation.",
        "The proposed transition types provide a characterization of a previously unaccounted-for situation in centering theory, namely, the coherence of sequences of utterances containing inferable Cbs.",
        "This is a crucial improvement over the standard model because of the high number of nonexplicit Cbs in this corpus (and others; see Passonneau 1998).",
        "The inclusion of a COHESIVE transition and COMPLETE SHIFT allows us to characterize the 76% of the corpus in which nonexplicit Cbs play a part, a portion of the corpus undescribed in the standard approach, while maintaining the standard operation of the usual transition states of centering theory in cases in which explicit Cbs are present.",
        "It may be the case that lexical cohesion and the notion of a COHESIVE transition can make other contributions to discourse analysis as well, such as allowing us to characterize coherence in a discourse while still recognizing referentially distinct discourse elements.",
        "Further, these notions can augment the definition of the topic of a discourse segment by virtue of the semantic information contained in a cohesion analysis.",
        "Finally, such an analysis can provide clues to discourse segment boundaries.",
        " The incorporation of the notion of lexical cohesion has been shown to be crucial to the characterization of the coherence in this corpus.",
        "In addition, it can make a variety of further contributions to discourse analysis.",
