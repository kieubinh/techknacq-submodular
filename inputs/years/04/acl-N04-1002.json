        "Coreference analysis refers to the process of determining whether or not two mentions of entities refer to the same person (Kibble and Deemter, 2000).",
        "For example, consider the following short passage of text: John Smith was appointed chair of the committee.",
        "Because of his past experience, Mr. Smith seemed the perfect choice.",
        "His good friend John, however, was not considered.",
        "Coreference analysis attempts to decide whether John Smith and Mr. Smith refer to the same person, and whether John is also the same person.",
        "The task is often extended to include references such as his or even his good friend, though we do not explore that extension in this study.",
        "Addressing this problem is important to support systems such as those that search for, extract, and process mentions of “people of interest” in news or transcripts (BBN 2001), or for other information organization tasks that might benefit from precise knowledge of how names occur, such as Topic Detection and Tracking (Allan 2002).",
        "Cross-document coreference analysis pushes the task into considering whether mentions of a name in different documents are the same.",
        "The problem becomes more complex because documents might come from different sources, will probably have different authors and different writing conventions and styles(Bagga and Baldwin,1998), and may even be in different languages.",
        "There has been little published work on cross-document coreference analysis and that has generally been evaluated on a small corpus of documents.",
        "A major contribution of this work is to develop a substantially larger (more than two orders of magnitude) corpus for evaluation.",
        "We show that the previous approach is effective but that a variation on it, agglomerative vector space, provides improved and much more stable results.",
        "We begin in Section 2 by describing how cross-document coreference analysis is evaluated.",
        "We sketch prior work in Section 3 and describe our two evaluation corpora in Section 4.",
        "Section 5 discusses the three algorithms that we explore for this task and then Section 6 describes our experimental results on both corpora.",
        "In Section 7 we provide some additional analysis that attempts to explain some surprising results.",
        "We conclude in Section 8 with a description of our plans for future work."

        "Given a collection of named entities from documents, the coreferencing task is to put them into equivalence classes, where every mention in the same class refers to the same entity (person, location, organization, and so on).",
        "The classes are referred to as “coreference chains” because the entities are chained together.",
        "To evaluate the coreference chains emitted by a system, we need truth data: the chains of entities that are actually referring to the same person.",
        "Evaluation then proceeds by comparing the true chains to the system’s hypothesized chains.",
        "We use the B-CUBED scoring algorithm (Bagga and Baldwin 1998) because it is the one used in the published research.",
        "The algorithm works as follows.",
        "For each entity mention e in the evaluation set, we first locate the truth chain TC that contains that mention (it can be in only one truth chain) and the system’s hypothesized chain HC that contains it (again, there can be only one hypothesis chain).",
        "We then compute a precision and recall score for those two chains.",
        "Precision is the proportion of mentions in HC that are also in TC and recall is the proportion of mentions in TC that are also in HC.",
        "If the chains match perfectly, recall and precision will both be one.",
        "If the hypothesis chain contains only the single mention e, then its precision will be one, and its recall will be 1/|TC|, the inverse of the size of the truth chain.",
        "Note that it is not possible to have a precision or recall of zero since entity e is always in common between the two chains.",
        "Our implementation of the B-CUBED algorithm is used specifically to evaluate an existing set of coreference chains and does not utilize any smoothing to handle system output which contains no entities.",
        "Overall precision and recall values are determined by averaging the individual values over all mentions in the evaluation set.",
        "These are the primary evaluation measures for cross-document coreference analysis."

        "Since the task of annotating documents is time consuming, we used a different technique to create a large test set with different entities of the same name.",
        "The technique used to construct this corpus is similar to the well known technique of creating artificial sense tagged corpora.",
        "Artificial sense tagged corpora is used to evaluate word sense disambiguation algorithms and is created by adding ambiguity to a corpus.",
        "Similarly, we consider the task of coreferencing multiple occurrences of “John Smith” to be similar to coreferencing multiple occurrences of “person-x”, where the occurrences of “person-x” are a disguise of multiple named entities such as “George Bush” and “Saddam Hussein”.",
        "This approach simplifies the task of looking for a large collection of “John Smith” articles and obtaining the actual coreference links between the many “John Smith” entities.",
        "It also allows us to create a vastly larger corpus of documents mentioning the “same person.” We first obtained from 10,000 to 50,000 unique documents from the TREC 1, 2 and 3 volumes using the Inquery search engine from UMass Amherst for each of the following subjects: art, business, education, government, healthcare, movies, music, politics, religion, science and sports.",
        "Then, we ran the documents through Identifinder, a named entity extraction system developed by BBN, to tag the named entities in the documents.",
        "Next, we selected one person entity randomly from each document.",

        "We replaced the occurrences of the selected entity in each document with “person-x” as follows: In the late 1970s, the company hired producers <enamex type=\"person\">jon peters</enamex> and <enamex type=\"person\">peter guber </enamex> to start a studio from scratch.",

        "We now have a large set of documents containing a reference to “Person X” and we know for each document “which” person entity it is referring to.",
        "We actually verified that names of the same name were the same entity, though with the large number of entities, the task was potentially overwhelming.",

        "These mappings from “Person X” to their true names will serve as our evaluation/true coreference chains.",
        "Since we know the name that “Person X” replaced, we assume that if those names are identical, they refer to the same person.",
        "So all references to “Person X” that correspond to, say, “Bill Clinton,” will be put into the same coreference chain.",

        "Our intent with the incremental vector space model is to approximate the work reported by Bagga and Baldwin (1998).",
        "Their system takes as input properly formatted documents and uses the University of Pennsylvania’s CAMP system to perform within-document coreference resolution, doing more careful work to find additional mentions of the entity in the document.",
        "It then extracts all sentences that are relevant for each entity of interest based on the within-document coreference chains produced by CAMP.",
        "The sentences extracted form a summary that represents the entity (in contrast to our 55-word snippets).",
        "The system then computes the similarity of that summary with each of the other summaries using the vector space model.",
        "If the similarity computed is above a predefined threshold, then the two summaries are considered to be coreferent.",
        "Each of the summaries was stored as a vector of terms.",
        "The similarity between two summaries S1 and S2 is computed as by the cosine of the angle between their corresponding vectors.",
        "Terms are weighted by a tf-idf weight as tf·log(N/df), where tf is the number of times that a term occurs in the summary, N is the total number of documents in the collection, and df is the number of documents that contain the term.",
        "Because we did not have the same within-document coreference tools, we opted for a simpler variation on Bagga and Baldwin’s approach.",
        "In our implementation, we represent snippets (combined 55-word sections of text) as vectors and use this model to represent each entity.",
        "We calculated term weights and similarity in the same way, however.",

        "The estimated running time for the agglomerative vector space experiment on the large corpus was approximately 3 times longer than that of the incremental vector space and KL-Divergence.",
        "The runtimes of incremental approaches are linear whereas the runtime of our agglomerative vector space approach is O(n2).",
        "Is the improvement in our results worth the difference in runtime?",
        "The noticeable run time difference in our experiment is caused by the need to cluster a large number of Person-x entities (34,404 entities).",
        "In reality, it would be rare to find such a large number of entities across documents with the same name.",
        "In the analysis of our reasonably large corpus, less than 16% of entities occur more than 10 times.",
        "If the mean size of entities to be disambiguated is relatively small, then there will not be a significant degrade in runtime on the agglomerative approach.",
        "Thus,",
        "our conclusion is that the tradeoff between coreference quality versus runtime in our agglomerative approach is definitely worthwhile if the number of same-named entities to be disambiguated is relatively small.",
        "8.",
        "Conclusion and Future Work We were able to compare and contrast our results directly with previous work of Bagga and Baldwin by using the same corpus and evaluation technique.",
        "In order to perform a careful excursion into the limited work on cross document coreferencing, we deployed different information retrieval techniques for entity disambiguation and clustering.",
        "In our experiments, we have shown that the agglomerative vector space clustering algorithm consistently yields better precision and recall throughout most of the tests.",
        "It outperforms the incremental vector space disambiguation model and is much more stable with respect to the decision threshold.",
        "Both vector space approaches outperform KL divergence except when the entities to be clustered belong to the same genre.",
        "We are pleased that our snippet approach worked well on the task of cross document coreferencing since it was easier than running a within document coreference analyzer first.",
        "It was also interesting to discover that previous techniques that worked well on a smaller corpus did not show the same promising recall and precision tradeoff on a larger corpus.",
        "We are interested in continuing these evaluations in two ways.",
        "First, colleagues of ours are working on a more realistic corpus that is not just large but also contains a much richer set of marked up entities.",
        "We look forward to trying out techniques on that data when it is available.",
        "Second, we intend to extend our work to include new comparison and clustering approaches.",
        "It appears that sentence-based snippets and within-document coreference information may provide a small gain.",
        "And the subject information has apparently value in some cases, so we hope to determine how to use the information more broadly."
