        "Reading and understanding text is a task that requires the ability to disambiguate at several levels, abstracting away details and using background knowledge in a variety of ways.",
        "One of the difficulties that humans resolve instantaneously and unconsciously is that of reading names.",
        "Most names of people, locations, organizations and others, have multiple writings that are used freely within and across documents.",
        "The variability in writing a given concept, along with the fact that different concepts may have very similar writings, poses a significant challenge to progress in natural language processing.",
        "Consider, for example, an open domain question answering system (Voorhees, 2002) that attempts, given a question like: “When was President Kennedy born?” to search a large collection of articles in order to pinpoint the concise answer: “on May 29, 1917.” The sentence, and even the document that contains the answer, may not contain the name “President Kennedy”; it may refer to this entity as “Kennedy”, “JFK” or “John Fitzgerald Kennedy”.",
        "Other documents may state that “John F. Kennedy, Jr. was born on November 25, 1960”, but this fact refers to our target entity’s son.",
        "Other mentions, such as “Senator Kennedy” or “Mrs.",
        "Kennedy” are even “closer” to the writing of the target entity, but clearly refer to different entities.",
        "Even the statement “John Kennedy, born 5-29-1941” turns out to refer to a different entity, as one can tell observing that the document discusses Kennedy’s batting statistics.",
        "A similar problem exists for other entity types, such as locations, organizations etc.",
        "Ad hoc solutions to this problem, as we show, fail to provide a reliable and accurate solution.",
        "This paper presents the first attempt to apply a unified approach to all major aspects of this problem, presented here from the perspective of the question answering task: (1) Entity Identity - do mentions A and B (typically, occurring in different documents, or in a question and a document, etc.)",
        "refer to the same entity?",
        "This problem requires both identifying when different writings refer to the same entity, and when similar or identical writings refer to different entities.",
        "(2) Name Expansion - given a writing of a name (say, in a question), find other likely writings of the same name.",
        "(3) Prominence - given question “What is Bush’s foreign policy?”, and given that any large collection of documents may contain several Bush’s, there is a need to identify the most prominent, or relevant “Bush”, perhaps taking into account also some contextual information.",
        "At the heart of our approach is a global probabilistic view on how documents are generated and how names (of different entity types) are “sprinkled” into them.",
        "In its most general form, our model assumes: (1) a joint distribution over entities, so that a document that mentions “President Kennedy” is more likely to mention “Oswald” or “ White House” than “Roger Clemens”; (2) an “author” model, that makes sure that at least one mention of a name in a document is easily identifiable, and then generates other mentions via (3) an appearance model, governing how mentions are transformed from the “representative” mention.",
        "Our goal is to learn the model from a large corpus and use it to support robust reading - enabling “on the fly” identification and tracing of entities.",
        "This work presents the first study of our proposed model and several relaxations of it.",
        "Given a collection of documents we learn the models in an unsupervised way; that is, the system is not told during training whether two mentions represent the same entity.",
        "We only assume the ability to recognize names, using a named entity recognizer run as a preprocessor.",
        "We define several inferences that correspond to the solutions we seek, and evaluate the models by performing these inferences against a large corpus we annotated.",
        "Our experimental results suggest that the entity identity problem can be solved accurately, giving accuracies (F1) close to 90%, depending on the specific task, as opposed to 80% given by state of the art ad-hoc approaches.",
        "Previous work in the context of question answering has not addressed this problem.",
        "Several works in NLP and Databases, though, have addressed some aspects of it.",
        "From the natural language perspective, there has been a lot of work on the related problem of corefer-ence resolution (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2003; Kehler, 2002) - which aims at linking occurrences of noun phrases and pronouns within a document based on their appearance and local context.",
        "(Charniak, 2001) presents a solution to the problem of name structure recognition by incorporating coreference information.",
        "In the context of databases, several works have looked at the problem of record linkage - recognizing duplicate records in a database (Cohen and Richman, 2002; Hernandez and Stolfo, 1995; Bilenko and Mooney, 2003).",
        "Specifically, (Pasula et al., 2002) considers the problem of identity uncertainty in the context of citation matching and suggests a probabilistic model for that.",
        "Some of very few works we are aware of that works directly with text data and across documents, are (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998; Mann and Yarowsky, 2003), which consider one aspect of the problem – that of distinguishing occurrences of identical names in different documents, and only ofpeople.",
