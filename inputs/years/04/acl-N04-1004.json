        "In face to face communication, speakers frequently use gesture to supplement speech (Chovil, 1992), using the additional modality to provide unique, non-redundant information (McNeill, 1992).",
        "In the context of pen/speech user interfaces, Oviatt finds that “multimodal ... language is briefer, syntactically simpler, and less disfluent than users’ unimodal speech.” (Oviatt, 1999) One of the simplest and most direct ways in which gesture can supplement verbal communication is by grounding references, usually through deixis.",
        "For example, it is impossible to extract the semantic content of the verbal utterance “I’ll take this one” without an accompanying pointing gesture indicating the thing that is desired.",
        "The problem of gesture-speech alignment involves choosing the appropriate gesture to ground each verbal utterance.",
        "This paper describes a novel technique for this problem.",
        "We evaluate our system on a corpus of multimodal monologues with no fixed grammar or vocabulary."

        "Discussion of multimodal user interfaces begins with the seminal “Put-That-There” system (Bolt, 1980), which allowed users to issue natural language commands and use deictic hand gestures to resolve references from speech.",
        "Commands were subject to a strict grammar and alignment was straightforward: keywords created holes in the semantic frame, and temporally-aligned gestures filled the holes.",
        "More recent systems have extended this approach somewhat.",
        "Johnston and Bangalore describe a multimodal parsing algorithm that is built using a 3-tape, finite state transducer (FST) (Johnston and Bangalore, 2000).",
        "The speech and gestures of each multimodal utterance are provided as input to an FST whose output is a semantic representation conveying the combined meaning.",
        "A similar system, based on a graph-matching algorithm, is described in (Chai et al., 2004).",
        "These systems perform mutual disambiguation, where each modality helps to correct errors in the others.",
        "However, both approaches restrict users to a predefined grammar and lexicon, and rely heavily on having a complete, formal ontology of the domain.",
        "In (Kettebekov et al., 2002), a co-occurrence model relates the salient prosodic features of the speech (pitch variation and pause) to characteristic features of gesticulation (velocity and acceleration).",

        "One approach to anaphora resolution is to assign a salience value to each noun phrase that is a candidate for acting as a grounding referent, and then to choose the noun phrase with the greatest salience (Lappin and Leass, 1994).",

        "Instead, we identify keywords that are likely to require gestural referents for resolution.",
        "Our goal is to produce an alignment – a set of bindings – that match at least some of the identified keywords with one or more gestures.",
        "There are several things that are known to contribute to the salience of candidate gesture-speech bindings:",
        "• The relevant gesture is usually close in time to the keyword (Oviatt et al., 1997; Cohen et al., 2002) • The gesture usually precedes the keyword (Oviatt et al., 1997).",
        "• A one-to-one mapping is preferred.",

        "Other gestures (i.e., beats) do not carry this type of semantic content, and instead act to moderate turn taking or indicate emphasis.",
        "These gestures are unlikely to take part in keyword bindings (Cas-sell, 1998).",
        "• Some keyword/gesture combinations may be particularly likely; for example, the keyword “this” and a deictic pointing gesture.",
        "These rules mirror the salience weighting features employed by the anaphora resolution methods described in the previous section.",
        "We define a parameterizable penalty function that prefers alignments that adhere to as many of these rules as possible.",

        "By blending some of the benefits of empirical and knowledge-based approaches, our system can learn from a large corpus of data, but degrades gracefully when limited data is available.",
        "Obviously, alignment is only one small component of a comprehensive system for recognizing and understanding multimodal communication.",
        "Putting aside the issue of gesture recognition, there is still the problem of deriving semantic information from aligned speech-gesture units.",
        "The solutions to this problem will likely have to be specially tailored to the application domain.",
        "While our evaluation indicates that our approach achieves what appears to be a high level of accuracy, the true test will be whether our system can actually support semantic information extraction from multimodal data.",
        "Only the construction of such a comprehensive end-to-end system will reveal whether the algorithm and features that we have chosen are sufficient, or whether a more sophisticated approach is required."
