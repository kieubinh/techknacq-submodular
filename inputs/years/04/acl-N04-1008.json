        "The Question Answering (QA) task has received a great deal of attention from the Computational Linguistics research community in the last few years (e.g., Text RE-trieval Conference TREC 2001-2003).",
        "The definition of the task, however, is generally restricted to answering factoid questions: questions for which a complete answer can be given in 50 bytes or less, which is roughly a few words.",
        "Even with this limitation in place, factoid question answering is by no means an easy task.",
        "The challenges posed by answering factoid question have been addressed using a large variety of techniques, such as question parsing (Hovy et al., 2001; Moldovan et al., 2002), question-type determination (Brill et al., 2001; Ittycheraih and Roukos, 2002; Hovy et al., 2001; Moldovan et al., 2002), WordNet exploitation (Hovy et al., 2001; Paşca and Harabagiu, 2001; Prager et al., 2001), Web exploitation (Brill et al., 2001; Kwok et al., 2001), noisy-channel transformations (Echihabi and Marcu, 2003), semantic analysis (Xu et al., 2002; Hovy et al., 2001; Moldovan et al., 2002), and inferencing (Moldovan et al., 2002).",
        "The obvious limitation of any factoid QA system is that many questions that people want answers for are not factoid questions.",
        "It is also frequently the case that non-factoid questions are the ones for which answers cannot as readily be found by simply using a good search engine.",
        "It follows that there is a good economic incentive in moving the QA task to a more general level: it is likely that a system able to answer complex questions of the type people generally and/or frequently ask has greater potential impact than one restricted to answering only factoid questions.",
        "A natural move is to recast the question answering task to handling questions people frequently ask or want answers for, as seen in Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) lists.",
        "These questions are sometimes factoid questions (such as, “What is Scotland's national costume?”), but in general are more complex questions (such as, “How does a film qualify for an Academy Award?”, which requires an answer along the following lines: “A feature film must screen in a Los Angeles County theater in 35 or 70mm or in a 24-frame progressive scan digital format suitable for exhibiting in existing commercial digital cinema sites for paid admission for seven consecutive days.",
        "The seven day run must begin before midnight, December 31, of the qualifying year.",
        "[ ... ]”).",
        "In this paper, we make a first attempt towards solving a QA problem more generic than factoid QA, for which there are no restrictions on the type of questions that are handled, and there is no assumption that the answers to be provided are factoids.",
        "In our solution to this problem we employ learning mechanisms for question-answer transformations (Agichtein et al., 2001; Radev et al., 2001), and also exploit large document collections such as the Web for finding answers (Brill et al., 2001; Kwok et al., 2001).",
        "We build our QA system around a noisy-channel architecture which exploits both a language model for answers and a transformation model for answer/question terms, trained on a corpus of 1 million question/answer pairs collected from the Web.",
        "Our evaluations show that our system achieves reasonable performance in terms of answer accuracy for a large variety of complex, non-factoid questions."

        "One of the first challenges to be faced in automatic question answering is the lexical and stylistic gap between the question string and the answer string.",
        "For factoid questions, these gaps are usually bridged by question reformulations, from simple rewrites (Brill et al., 2001), to more sophisticated paraphrases (Hermjakob et al., 2001), to question-to-answer translations (Radev et al., 2001).",
        "We ran several preliminary trials using various question reformulation techniques.",
        "We found out that in general, when complex questions are involved, reformulating the question (using either simple rewrites or question-answer term translations) more often hurts the performance than improves on it.",
        "Another widely used technique in factoid QA is sentence parsing, along with question-type determination.",
        "As mentioned by Hovy et al.",
        "(2001), their hierarchical QA typology contains 79 nodes, which in many cases can be even further differentiated.",
        "While we acknowledge that QA typologies and hierarchical question types have the potential to be extremely useful beyond factoid QA, the volume of work involved is likely to exceed by orders of magnitude the one involved in the existing factoid QA typologies.",
        "We postpone such work for future endeavors.",
        "The techniques we propose for handling our extended QA task are less linguistically motivated and more statistically driven.",
        "In order to have access to the right statistics, we first build a question-answer pair training corpus by mining FAQ pages from the Web, as described in Section 3.",
        "Instead of sentence parsing, we devise a statistical chunker that is used to transform a question into a phrase-based query (see Section 4).",
        "After a search engine uses the formulated query to return the N most relevant documents from the Web, an answer to the given question is found by computing an answer language model probability (indicating how similar the proposed answer is to answers seen in the training corpus), and an answer/question translation model probability (indicating how similar the proposed answer/question pair is to pairs seen in the training corpus).",
        "In Section 5 we describe the evaluations we performed in order to assess our system’s performance, while in Section 6 we analyze some of the issues that negatively affected our system’s performance."

      "text": [
        "In order to employ the learning mechanisms described in the previous section, we first need to build a large training corpus consisting of question-answer pairs of a broad lexical coverage.",
        "Previous work using FAQs as a source for finding an appropriate answer (Burke et al., 1996) or for learning lexical correlations (Berger et al., 2000) focused on using the publicly available Usenet FAQ collection and other non-public FAQ collections, and reportedly worked with an order of thousands of question-answer pairs.",
        "Our approach to question/answer pair collection takes a different path.",
        "If one poses the simple query “FAQ” to an existing search engine, one can observe that roughly 85% of the returned URL strings corresponding to genuine FAQ pages contain the substring “faq”, while virtually all of the URLs that contain the substring “faq” are genuine FAQ pages.",
        "It follows that, if one has access to a large collection of the Web’s existent URLs, a simple pattern-matching for “faq” on these URLs will have a recall close to 85% and precision close to 100% on returning FAQ URLs from those available in the collection.",
        "Our URL collection contains approximately 1 billion URLs, and using this technique we extracted roughly 2.7 million URLs containing the (uncased) string “faq”, which amounts to roughly 2.3 million FAQ URLs to be used for collecting question/answer pairs.",
        "The collected FAQ pages displayed a variety of formats and presentations.",
        "It seems that the variety of ways questions and answers are usually listed in FAQ pages does not allow for a simple high-precision high-recall solution for extracting question/answer pairs: if one assumes that only certain templates are used when presenting FAQ lists, one can obtain clean question/answer pairs at the cost of losing many other such pairs (which happen to be presented in different templates); on the other hand, assuming very loose constraints on the way information is presented on such pages, one can obtain a bountiful set of question/answer pairs, plus other pairs that do not qualify as such.",
        "We settled for a two-step approach: a first recall-oriented pass based on universal indicators such as punctuation and lexical cues allowed us to retrieve most of the question/answer pairs, along with other noise data; a second precision-oriented pass used several filters, such as language identification, length constrains, and lexical cues to reduce the level of noise of the question/answer pair corpus.",
        "Using this method, we were able to collect a total of roughly 1 million question/answer pairs, exceeding by orders of magnitude the amount of data previously used for learning question/answer statistics."

        "It has the disadvantage that it contains not only the keywords a search engine normally expects, but also a lot of extraneous “details” as part of its syntactic and discourse constraints, plus an inherently underspecified unit-segmentation problem, which can all confuse the search engine.",
        "To counterbalance some of these disadvantages, we build a statistical chunker that uses a dynamic programming algorithm to chunk the question into chunks/phrases.",

        "We call the extraction algorithm that uses this model M1e-AE, and the top score of 0.38 was obtained by M1e-AE when trained on 1 million question/answer pairs.",
        "Note that the learning curve of algorithm M1e-AE in Figure 7 indeed indicates that this answer extraction procedure is well informed about the distribution probabilities of various answer terms (it has the same steepness in the learning curve as for M1-AE), while at the same time uses a better distribution of the probability mass for each answer term compared to M1-AE (it outperforms M1AE by roughly a constant amount for each training set size in the evaluation)."

        "Previous work on question answering has focused almost exclusively on building systems for handling factoid questions.",
        "These systems have recently achieved impressive performance (Moldovan et al., 2002).",
        "The world beyond the factoid questions, however, is largely unexplored, with few notable exceptions (Berger et al., 2001; Agichtein et al., 2002; Girju 2003).",
        "The present paper attempts to explore the portion related to answering FAQ-like questions, without restricting the domain or type of the questions to be handled, or restricting the type of answers to be provided.",
        "While we still have a long way to go in order to achieve robust non-factoid QA, this work is a step in a direction that goes beyond restricted questions and answers.",
        "We consider the present QA system as a baseline on which more finely tuned QA architectures can be built.",
        "Learning from the experience of factoid question answering, one of the most important features to be added is a question typology for the FAQ domain.",
        "Efforts towards handling specific question types, such as causal questions, are already under way (Girju 2003).",
        "A carefully devised typology, correlated with a systematic approach to fine tuning, seem to be the lessons for success in answering both factoid and beyond factoid questions."
