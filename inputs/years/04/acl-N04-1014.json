        "Much of natural language work over the past decade has employed probabilistic finite-state transducers (FSTs) operating on strings.",
        "This has occurred somewhat under the influence of speech recognition, where transducing acoustic sequences to word sequences is neatly captured by left-to-right stateful substitution.",
        "Many conceptual tools exist, such as Viterbi decoding (Viterbi, 1967) and forward-backward training (Baum and Eagon, 1967), as well as generic software toolkits.",
        "Moreover, a surprising variety of problems are attackable with FSTs, from part-of-speech tagging to letter-to-sound conversion to name transliteration.",
        "However, language problems like machine translation break this mold, because they involve massive reordering of symbols, and because the transformation processes seem sensitive to hierarchical tree structure.",
        "Recently, specific probabilistic tree-based models have been proposed not only for machine translation (Wu, 1997; Alshawi, Bangalore, and Douglas, 2000; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Gildea, 2003; Eisner, 2003), but also for This work was supported by DARPA contract F49620-001-0337 and ARDA contract MDA904-02-C-0450.",

        "It is useful to understand generic algorithms that may support all these tasks and more.",
        "(Rounds, 1970) and (Thatcher, 1970) independently introduced tree transducers as a generalization of FSTs.",
        "Rounds was motivated by natural language.",
        "The Rounds tree transducer is very similar to a left-to-right FST, except that it works top-down, pursuing subtrees in parallel, with each subtree transformed depending only on its own passed-down state.",
        "This class of transducer is often nowadays called R, for “Root-to-frontier” (Gécseg and Steinby, 1984).",
        "Rounds uses a mathematics-oriented example of an R transducer, which we summarize in Figure 1.",
        "At each point in the top-down traversal, the transducer chooses a production to apply, based only on the current state and the current root symbol.",
        "The traversal continues until there are no more state-annotated nodes.",
        "Non-deterministic transducers may have several productions with the same left-hand side, and therefore some free choices to make during transduction.",
        "An R transducer compactly represents a potentially-infinite set of input/output tree pairs: exactly those pairs (T1, T2) for which some sequence of productions applied to T1 (starting in the initial state) results in T2.",
        "This is similar to an FST, which compactly represents a set of input/output string pairs, and in fact, R is a generalization of FST.",
        "If we think of strings written down vertically, as degenerate trees, we can convert any FST into an R transducer by automatically replacing FST transitions with R productions.",
        "and state-based record keeping.",
        "It can copy whole sub-trees, and transform those subtrees differently.",
        "It can also delete subtrees without inspecting them (imagine by analogy an FST that quits and accepts right in the middle of an input string).",
        "Variants of R that disallow copying and deleting are called RL (for linear) and RN (for nondelet-ing), respectively.",
        "One advantage of working with tree transducers is the large and useful body of literature about these automata; two excellent surveys are (Gécseg and Steinby, 1984) and (Comon et al., 1997).",
        "For example, R is not closed under composition (Rounds, 1970), and neither are RL or F (the “frontier-to-root” cousin of R), but the non-copying FL is closed under composition.",
        "Many of these composition results are first found in (Engelfriet, 1975).",
        "R has surprising ability to change the structure of an input tree.",
        "For example, it may not be initially obvious how an R transducer can transform the English structure S(PRO, VP(V, NP)) into the Arabic equivalent S(V, PRO, NP), as it is difficult to move the subject PRO into position between the verb V and the direct object NP.",
        "First, R productions have no lookahead capability – the left-hand-side of the S production consists only of q S(x0, x1), although we want our English-to-Arabic transformation to apply only when it faces the entire structure q S(PRO, VP(V, NP)).",
        "However, we can simulate lookahead using states, as in these productions:",
        "- q S(x0, x1) --+ S(qpro x0, qvp.v.np x1) - qpro PRO--+ PRO - qvp.v.np VP(x0, x1) --+ VP(qv x0, qnp x1)",
        "By omitting rules like qpro NP – > ..., we ensure that the entire production sequence will dead-end unless the first child of the input tree is in fact PRO.",
        "So finite lookahead is not a problem.",
        "The next problem is how to get the PRO to appear in between the V and NP, as in Arabic.",
        "This can be carried out using copying.",
        "We make two copies of the English VP, and assign them different states:",
        "While general properties of R are understood, there are many algorithmic questions.",
        "In this paper, we take on the problem of training probabilistic R transducers.",
        "For many language problems (machine translation, paraphrasing, text compression, etc.",
        "), it is possible to collect training data in the form of tree pairs and to distill linguistic knowledge automatically.",
        "Our problem statement is: Given (1) a particular transducer with productions P, and (2) a finite training set of sample input/output tree pairs, we want to produce (3) a probability estimate for each production in P such that we maximize the probability of the output trees given the input trees.",
        "As organized in the rest of this paper, we accomplish this by intersecting the given transducer with each input/output pair in turn.",
        "Each such intersection produces a set of weighted derivations that are packed into a regular tree grammar (Sections 3-5), which is equivalent to a tree substitution grammar.",
        "The inside and outside probabilities of this packed derivation structure are used to compute expected counts of the productions from the original, given transducer (Sections 6-7).",

        "State t means “translate this word,” and we have a production for every pair of co-occurring English and Japanese words: - t car--+ kuruma - tcar--+wa - t car--+ *e* This follows (Yamada and Knight, 2001) in also allowing English words to disappear, or translate to epsilon.",
        "Every production in the xRS transducer has an associated weight and corresponds to exactly one of the model parameters.",
        "There are several benefits to this xRS formulation.",
        "First, it clarifies the model, in the same way that (Knight and Al-Onaizan, 1998; Kumar and Byrne, 2003) elucidate other machine translation models in easily-grasped FST terms.",
        "Second, the model can be trained with generic, off-the-shelf tools – versus the alternative of working out model-specific re-estimation formulae and implementing custom training software.",
        "Third, we can easily extend the model in interesting ways.",
        "For example, we can add productions for multilevel and lexical re-ordering: - r NP(x0:NP, PP(IN(of), x1:NP)) --+ q x1, no, q x0 We can add productions for phrasal translations: - r NP(JJ(big), NN(cars)) --+ ooki, kuruma This can now include crucial non-constituent phrasal translations: - r S(NP(PRO(there),VP(VB(are), x0:NP) --+ q x0, ga, arimasu We can also eliminate many epsilon word-translation rules in favor of more syntactically-controlled ones, e.g.: - r NP(DT(the),x0:NN) --+ q x0 We can make many such changes without modifying the training procedure, as long as we stick to tree automata."
