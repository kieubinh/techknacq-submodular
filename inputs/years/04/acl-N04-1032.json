        "We investigated each of these features in Chinese; some acted quite similarly to English, while others showed interesting differences.",
        "Features that acted similarly to English include the target verb, the phrase type, the syntactic category of the constituent.",
        "(NP, PP, etc), and the subcategorization of the target verb.",
        "The sub-categorization feature represents the phrase structure rule for the verb phrase containing the target verb (e.g., VP -> VB NP, etc).",
        "Five features (path, position, governing category, headword, and voice) showed interesting patterns that are discussed below.",
        "feature represents the path from a constituent to the target verb in the syntactic parse tree, using \"^\" for ascending a parse tree, and \"!\" for descending.",
        "This feature manifests the syntactic relationship between the constituent and the target verb.",
        "For example the path “NP^IP!VP!VP!VV” indicates that the constituent is an “NP” which is the subject of the predicate verb.",
        "In general, we found the path feature to be sparse.",
        "In our test set, 60% of path types and 39% of path tokens are unseen in the training.",
        "The distributions of paths are very uneven.",
        "In the whole corpus, paths for roles have an average frequency of 14.5 while paths for non-roles have an average of 2.7.",
        "Within the role paths, a small number of paths account for majority of the total occurrences; among the 188 role path types, the top 20 paths account for 86% of the tokens.",
        "Thus, although the path feature is sparse, its sparsity may not be a major problem in role recognition.",
        "Of the 291 role tokens in our test set, only 9 have unseen paths, i.e., most of the unseen paths are due to non-roles.",
        "feature indicates that a constituent is before or after the target verb.",
        "In our corpus, 69% of the roles are before the verb while 31% are after the verb.",
        "As in English, the position is a useful cue for role identity.",
        "For example, 88% of arg0s are before the verb, 67% of arg 1 s are after the verb and all the arg2 s are after the verb.",
        "Adjuncts have even a stronger bias.",
        "Ten of the adjunct types can only occur before the verb, while three are always after the verb.",
        "The two most common adjunct roles, argM-LOC and argM-TMP are almost always before the verb, a sharp difference from English.",

        "feature is only applicable for NPs.",
        "In the original formulation for English in Gildea and Jurafsky (2002), it answers the question: Is the NP governed by IP or VP?",
        "An NP governed by an IP is likely to be a subject, while an NP governed by a VP is more likely to be an object.",
        "For Chinese, we added a third option in which the governing category of an NP is neither IP nor VP, but an NP.",
        "This is caused by the “DE” construction, in which a clause is used as a modifier of an NP.",

        "Since the “DE” construction caused us to modify the feature for Chinese, we conducted several experiments to test whether the governing category feature is useful or whether it is redundant with the path and position features.",

        "It is immediately clear from Table 11 that using similar verbs, the same amount of data, the same classifier, the same number of roles, and the same features, the results from English are much worse than those for Chinese.",

        "We first investigated whether the differences between English and Chinese could be attributed to particular semantic roles.",
        "We found that this was indeed the case.",
        "The great bulk of the error rate difference between English and Chinese was caused by the 4 adjunct classes argM-ADV, argM-LOC, argM-MNR, and argM-TMP, which together account for 19.6% of the role tokens in our English corpus.",
        "The average F-score in English for the four roles is 36.7, while in Chinese the F-score for the four roles is 78.6.",
        "Why should these roles be so much more difficult to identify in English than Chinese?",
        "We believe the answer lies in the analysis of the position feature in section 3.2.2.",
        "This is repeated, with error rate information in Table 12.",
        "We see there that adjuncts in English have no strong preference for occurring before or after the verb.",
        "Chinese adjuncts, by contrast, are well-known to have an extremely strong preference to be preverbal, as Table 12 shows.",
        "The relatively fixed word order of adjuncts makes it much easier in Chinese to map these roles from surface syntactic constituents than in English.",
        "If the average F-score of the four adjuncts in English is raised to the level of that in Chinese, the overall F-score on English would be raised from 71.5 to 79.7, accounting for 8.2 of the 11.6 difference in F-scores between the two languages.",
        "We next investigated the one feature from our original English-specific feature set that we had dropped in our Chinese system: passive.",
        "Recall that we dropped this feature because marked passives are extremely rare in Chinese.",
        "When we added this feature back into our English system, the performance rose from P/R/F=84.1/62.2/71.5 to 86.4/65.1/74.3.",
        "As might be expected, this effect of voice is mainly reflected in an improvement on arg0 and arg1, as Table 13 shows below:",
        "A third source of English-Chinese differences is the distribution of roles; the Chinese data has proportionally more adjuncts (ARGMs), while the English data has proportionally more oblique arguments (ARG2, ARG3, ARG4).",
        "Oblique arguments are more difficult to process than other arguments, as was discussed in section 3.4.",
        "This difference is most likely to be caused by labeling factors rather than by true structural differences between English in Chinese.",
        "In summary, the higher performance in our Chinese system is due to 3 factors: the importance of passive in English; the strict word-order constraints of Chinese adverbials, and minor labeling differences."

        "Second, the features that we extracted for English semantic parsing worked well when applied to Chinese.",
        "Many of these features required creating an automatic parse; in doing so we showed that the Collins (1999) parser when ported to Chinese achieved the best reported performance on Chinese syntactic parsing.",
        "Finally, we showed that semantic parsing is significantly easier in Chinese than in English.",
        "We show that this counterintuitive result seems to be due to the strict constraints on adjunct ordering in Chinese, making adjuncts easier to find and label."
