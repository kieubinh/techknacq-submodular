        "The last several years has seen a number of works that use weight-based systems (trained either manually or via supervised learning) for pronoun interpretation, in addition to others that have addressed the broader task of entity-level coreference (see Mitkov (2002) for a useful survey).",
        "These systems typically rely on a variety of morphosyntactic factors that have been posited in the literature to affect the interpretation of pronouns in naturally-occurring discourse, including gender and number agreement, the distance between the pronoun and antecedent, the grammatical positions of the pronoun and antecedent, and the linguistic form of the antecedent, among others.",
        "A common refrain is that the performance of systems that rely on such features is plateauing, and that further progress will require the use of world knowledge and inference (ibid., Ch.",
        "9, inter alia).",
        "World knowledge, after all, would seem to play a role in determining that the referent of it in example (1) is the entity denoted by his industry rather than Glendening’s initiative or the edge.",
        "(1) He worries that Glendening’s initiative could push his industry over the edge, forcing it to shift operations elsewhere.",
        "Of course, no well-suited knowledge base and accompanying inference procedure exists that can deliver such a capability robustly in an open domain.",
        "In lieu of this capability, previous authors have suggested that what can be viewed as a more superficial form of semantic information – predicate-argument statistics mined from naturally-occurring data – could be used to capture certain selectional regularities.",
        "For instance, such statistics might reveal that forcing industry is a more likely verb-object combination in naturally-occurring data than forcing initiative or forcing edge.",
        "Assuming that such statistics imply that industries are more likely to be forced in the real world than are initiatives or edges, this information could be taken to establish a preference for his industry as the antecedent of it in (1).",
        "While there will always be cases that require arbitrarily deep knowledge for their interpretation, the empirical question of how far one can go by relying on this sort of selectional information remains.",
        "Our point of departure is the work of Lappin and Leass (1994, henceforth L&L) and Dagan et al.",
        "(1995).",
        "(See also Dagan and Itai (1990).)",
        "L&L demonstrated with a system called RAP that a (manually-tuned) weight-based scheme for integrating pronoun interpretation preferences can achieve high performance on real data, in their case, 86% accuracy on a corpus of computer training manu-als.' Dagan et al.",
        "(1995) then developed a postprocessor based on predicate-argument statistics that was used to override RAP’s decision when it failed to express a clear preference between two or more antecedents, which resulted in a modest rise in per-'Kennedy and Boguraev (1996, henceforth, K&B) adapted L&L’s algorithm to rely on far less syntactic analysis (noun phrase identification and rudimentary grammatical role marking), with performance in the 75% range on mixed genres.",
        "formance (2.5%).2 Because RAP is symbolic, the two systems were necessarily coupled in a black-box manner.",
        "They noted, however, that if one had a statistically-driven pronoun interpretation system, co-occurrence information could be modeled alongside morphosyntactic information: “A promising direction for future research is the development of an empirically based model for salience criteria analogous to the one that we constructed for lexical preference.",
        "The integration of these models using a probabilistic decision procedure will hopefully yield an optimized integrated system for anaphora resolution.” (p. 643) In this work we set out to evaluate Dagan et al.’s proposal.",
        "Indeed, the weight-combination scheme of L&L is suggestive of a particular approach to supervised learning – maximum entropy (MaxEnt) – in which such a system of weights is inferred from maximum likelihood counts on annotated data.",
        "Using MaxEnt, we trained a system based on an optimized set of morphosyntactic features and augmented it with predicate-argument statistics in two scenarios: (i) one mimicking the Dagan et al.",
        "postprocessor, and (ii) one in which the predicate-argument statistics were represented as features alongside the morphosyntactic features.",

        "The desired values for these parameters are obtained by maximizing the likelihood of the training data with respect to the model.3 Thus, whereas L&L’s RAP system uses an additive system of weights that is trained manually, the MaxEnt system learns a multiplicative system of weights automatically.",
        "One can view the MaxEnt system as yielding a probabilistic notion of antecedent salience: The salience value assigned to a potential antecedent of a given pronoun is just the probability that Maxent assigns to the outcome of coreference.",

        "Example (4), on the other hand, is a case in which the statistics merely strengthened the bias to the wrong antecedent: (4) The dancers were joined by about 70 supporters as they marched around a fountain not far from the mayor’s office, chanting: “Giuliani scared of sex!",
        "Who’s he going to censor next?” The model preferred the supporters as the antecedent of they (salience value: 0.54) over the correct antecedent the dancers (salience value: 0.45).",
        "Statistics support the same conclusion, with unnormalized and normalized counts of 2283 and 1.18 x 10-3 for supporters marched and its variants, and of 334 and 1.72 x 10-4 for dancers marched and its variants.",
        "The analysis of this sample therefore suggests that predicate-argument statistics are unlikely to be of much help when used in a model trained with a state-of-the-art set of morphosyntactic features, even if robust counts were available.",
        "While the statistical preferences for our data sample were split down the middle, it is important to understand that the cases for which statistics hurt are potentially more damning than those for which they helped.",
        "In the cases in which statistics reinforced a wrong answer, no (reasonable) manipulation of statistical features or filters can rescue the prediction.",
        "On the other hand, for the cases in which statistics could help, their successful use will depend on the existence of a formula that can capture these cases without changing the predictions for examples that the model currently classifies correctly.",
        "Although our informal analysis admittedly has certain limits – the web counts we collected are only approximations of true counts, and the size of our manually-inspected corpus ended up being fairly small – our experience leads us to believe that predicate-argument statistics are a poor substitute for world knowledge, and more to the point, they do not offer much predictive power to a state-of-the-art morphosyntactically-driven pronoun interpretation system.",
        "Indeed, crisp “textbook” examples such as (3) appear to be empirically rare; the help provided by statistics for several of the examples seemed to be more due to fortuity than the capturing of an actual world knowledge relationship.",
        "Consider (5): (5) Chung, as part of a plea bargain deal with the department, has claimed that then-DNC finance director Richard Sullivan personally asked him for a $125,000 donation in April 1995, the sources said.",
        "Sullivan took the money despite having previously voiced suspicions that Chung was acting as a conduit for illegal contributions from Chinese business executives, they added.",
        "Our system selected Chinese business executives as the antecedent of they (salience value: 0.34), over the correct the sources (salience value: 0.10).",
        "Predicate-argument statistics support sources (normalized and unnormalized values of 29662 and 5.78 x 10-4) over executives (2391 and 1.50 x 10-4), and thus this example was classified as one of the 10 for which statistics helped.",
        "In actuality, however, the correct antecedent is determined by unrelated factors, demonstrated by the fact that if the head nouns executives and sources were switched in (5), the preferred antecedent would be the executives, contrary to what predicate-argument statistics would predict."

        "In conclusion, our experimental results and error analysis suggest that predicate-argument statistics offer little predictive power to a pronoun interpretation system trained on a state-of-the-art set of morphosyntactic features.",
