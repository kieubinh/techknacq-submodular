        "Conditional Maximum Entropy (maxent) models have been widely used for a variety of tasks, including language modeling (Rosenfeld, 1994), part-of-speech tagging, prepositional phrase attachment, and parsing (Rat-naparkhi, 1998), word selection for machine translation (Berger et al., 1996), and finding sentence boundaries (Reynar and Ratnaparkhi, 1997).",
        "They are also sometimes called logistic regression models, maximum likelihood exponential models, log-linear models, and are even equivalent to a form of perceptrons/single layer neural networks.",
        "In particular, perceptrons that use the standard sigmoid function, and optimize for log-loss are equivalent to maxent.",
        "Multilayer neural networks that optimize log-loss are closely related, and much of the discussion will apply to them implicitly.",
        "Conditional maxent models have traditionally either been unregularized or regularized by using a Gaussian prior on the parameters.",
        "We will show that by using an exponential distribution as the prior, several advantages can be gained.",
        "We will show that in at least one case, an exponential prior experimentally better matches the actual distribution of the parameters.",
        "We will also show that it can lead to improved accuracy, and a simpler learning algorithm.",
        "In addition, the exponential prior inspires an improved version of Good Turing discounting with lower perplexity.",
        "Conditional maxent models are of the form",
        "where x is an input vector, y is an output, the f i are the so-called indicator functions or feature values that are true if a particular property of x, y is true, F is the number of such features, Λ represents the parameter set λ1 ... λn, and λi is a weight for the indicator f i.",
        "For instance, if trying to do word sense disambiguation for the word “bank”, x would be the context around an occurrence of the word; y would be a particular sense, e.g. financial or river; fi(x, y) could be 1 if the context includes the word “money” and y is the financial sense; and λi would be a large positive number.",
        "Maxent models have several valuable properties (Della Pietra et al.",
        "(1997) give a good overview.)",
        "The most important is constraint satisfaction.",
        "For a given f i, we can count how many times f i was observed in the training data with value y, observed[i] = Ej fi(xj, yj).",
        "For a model PA with parameters Λ, we can see how many times the model predicts that fi would be expected to occur: expected[i] = Ej,y PA(y|xj) fi(xj, y).",
        "Maxent models have the property that expected[i] = observed[i] for all i and y.",
        "These equalities are called constraints.",
        "The next important property is that the likelihood of the training data is maximized (thus, the name maximum likelihood exponential model.)",
        "Third, the model is as similar as possible to the uniform distribution (minimizes the Kullback-Leibler divergence), given the constraints, which is why these models are called maximum entropy models.",
        "This last property – similarity to the uniform distribution – is a form of regularization.",
        "However, it turns out to be an extremely weak one – it is not uncommon for models, especially those that use all or most possible features, to assign near-zero probabilities (or, if λs may be infinite, even actual zero probabilities), and to exhibit other symptoms of severe overfitting.",
        "There have been a number of approaches to this problem, which we will discuss in more detail in Section 3.",
        "The most relevant approach, however, is the work of Chen and Rosenfeld (2000), who implemented a Gaussian prior for maxent models.",
        "They compared this technique to most of the previously implemented techniques, on a language modeling task, and concluded that it was consistently the best.",
        "We thus use it as a baseline for our comparisons, and similar considerations motivate our own technique, an exponential prior.",
        "Chen et al.",
        "place a Gaussian prior with 0 mean and σ2 i variance on the model parameters (the λ is), and then find a model that maximizes the posterior probability of the data and the model.",
        "In particular, maxent models without priors use the parameters Λ that maximize",
        "where xj, yj are training data instances.",
        "With a Gaussian prior we find As we will describe, it is significantly simpler to perform this maximization than the Gaussian maximization.",
        "Furthermore, as we will describe, models satisfying Equation 2 will have the property that, for each λ i, either a) λi = 0 and expected[i] > observed[i] – αi or b) expected[i] = observed[i] – αi.",
        "In other words, we essentially just discount the observed counts by the constant αi (which is the reciprocal of the standard deviation), subject to the constraint that λi is non-negative.",
        "This is much simpler and more intuitive than the constraints with the Gaussian prior (Equation 1), since those constraints change as the values of λi change.",
        "Furthermore, as we will describe in Section 3, discounting by a constant is a common technique for language model smoothing (Ney et al., 1994; Chen and Goodman, 1999), but one that has not previously been well justified; the exponential prior gives some Bayesian justification.",
        "In Section 5 we will show that on two very different tasks – grammar checking and a collaborative filtering task – the exponential prior yields lower error rates than the Gaussian.",
        "In this case, a trained model does not satisfy the constraints expected[i] = observed[i], but, as Chen and Rosenfeld show, instead satisfies constraints",
        "That is, instead of a model that matches the observed count, we get a model matching the observed count minus Q2 i : in language modeling terms, this is “discounting.” We do not believe that all models are generated by the same process, and therefore we do not believe that a single prior will work best for all problem types.",
        "In particular, as we will describe in our experimental results section, when looking at one particular set of parameters, we noticed that it was not at all Gaussian, but much more similar to a 0 mean Laplacian, f (λi) = 20i exp ( – |0i|), or to an exponential distribution f (λi) = αi exp ( – αiλi), which is non-zero only for non-negative λi.",
        "In some cases, learned parameter distributions will not match the prior distribution, but in some cases they will, so it seemed worth exploring one of these alternate forms.",
        "Later, when we try to optimize our models, the parameter seach will turn out to be much simpler with an exponential prior, so we focus on that distribution.",
        "With an exponential prior, we maximize",
        "In this section we derive a learning algorithm for exponential priors, with provable convergence properties, and show that it leads to a simple discounting formula.",
        "Note that the simple learning algorithm is an important contribution: the algorithm for a Gaussian prior is quite a bit more complicated, and previous related work with the Laplacian prior (two-sided exponential) has had a difficult time finding learning algorithms; because the Laplacian does not have a continuous first derivative, and because the exponential prior is bounded at 0, standard gradient descent type algorithms may exhibit poor behavior.",
        "Williams (1995) devotes a full ten pages to describing a somewhat heuristic approach for solving this problem, and even this discussion concludes “In summary it is left to the reader to supply the algorithms for determining successive search directions and the initially preferred value of” the step size (page 130).1 We show that a very simple variation on a standard algorithm, Generalized Iterative Scaling (GIS) (Darroch and Ratcliff, 1972), solves this problem.",
        "In particular, as we will show, while GIS uses an update rule of the form",
        "Note that there are two different styles of model that one can use, especially in the common case that there are two outputs (values for y.)",
        "Consider a word sense disambiguation problem, trying to determine whether a word like “bank” means the river or financial sense, with questions like whether or not the word “water” occurs nearby.",
        "One could have a single indicator function f 1(x, y) = 1 if water occurs nearby and values in the range −∞ < λ1 < ∞.",
        "We call this style “double sided” indicators.",
        "Alternatively, one could have two indicator functions,",
        "this case, one could allow either −∞ < λ1, λ2 < ∞ or 0 ≤ λ1, λ2 < ∞ .",
        "We call the style with two indicators “single sided.” With a Gaussian prior, it does not matter which style one uses – one can show that by changing σ2, exactly the same results will be achieved.",
        "With a Laplacian (double sided exponential), one could also use either style.",
        "With an exponential prior, only positive values are allowed, so one must use the double sided style, so that one can learn that some indicators push towards one sense, and some push towards the other – that is, rather than having one weight which is positive or negative, we have two weights which are positive or zero, one of which pushes towards one answer, and the other pushing towards the other.",
        "We derive our constraints and learning algorithm by very closely following the derivation of the algorithm by Chen and Rosenfeld.",
        "It will be convenient to maximize the log of the expression in 2 rather than the expression itself.",
        "This leads to an objective function:",
        "Note that this objective function is convex (since it is the sum of two convex functions.)",
        "Thus, there is a global maximum value for this objective function.",
        "Now, we wish to find the maximum.",
        "Normally, we would do this by setting the derivative to 0, but the bound of λk ≥ 0 changes things a bit.",
        "The maximum can then occur at the discontinuity in the derivative (λ k = 0) or when λk > 0.",
        "We can explicitly check the value of the objective function at the point λk = 0.",
        "When there is a maximum with λk > 0 we know that the partial derivative with respect to λk will be 0.",
        "In other words, we discount the observed count by α k – the absolute discounting equation.",
        "Sometimes it is better for λk to be set to 0 – another possible optimal point is when λk = 0 and observed[k] − αk < expected[k].",
        "One of these two cases must hold at the optimum.",
        "Notice an important property of exponential priors (analogous to a similiar property for Laplace priors (Williams, 1995; Tibshirani, 1994)): they often favor parameters that are exactly 0.",
        "This leads to a kind of natural pruning for exponential priors, not found in Gaussian priors, which are only very rarely 0.",
        "(Note, however, that one should not increase the α’s in the exponential prior to control pruning, as this may lead to oversmoothing.",
        "If additional pruning is needed for speed or memory savings, feature selection techniques should be used, such as pruning small or infrequent parameters, instead of a strengthened prior.)",
        "Now, we can derive the update equations.",
        "The derivation is exactly the same as Chen and Rosenfeld’s (2000) with the minor change of an exponential prior instead of a Gaussian prior (we include it in the appendix.)",
        "Let f #(x, y) = Ei fi(x, y).",
        "Then, in the end, we get an update equation of the form",
        "Compare this equation to the corresponding equation with a Gaussian prior (Chen and Rosenfeld., 2000).",
        "With a Gaussian prior, one can derive an equation of the form",
        "and then solve for δk.",
        "There is no closed form solution: it must be solved using numerical methods, such as Newton’s method, making this update much more complex and time consuming than the exponential prior.",
        "One can also derive variations on this update.",
        "For instance, in the Appendix, we derive an update for Improved Iterative Scaling (Della Pietra et al., 1997) with an exponential prior.",
        "Perhaps more importantly, one can also derive updates for Sequential Conditional Generalized Iterative Scaling (SCGIS) (Goodman, 2002), which is several times faster than GIS.",
        "The SCGIS update for binary features withan exponential prior is simply",
        "One might wonder why we simply don’t use conjugate gradient (CG) methods, which have been shown to converge quickly for maxent.",
        "There has not been a formal comparison of SCGIS to conjugate gradient methods.",
        "In our own pilot studies, SCGIS is sometimes faster and sometimes slower.",
        "Also, some versions of CG use heuristics for the step size, and lose convergence guarantees.",
        "Finally, SCGIS is simpler to implement than conjugate gradient, and even for those with a conjugate gradient library, because of the parameter constraints (for an exponential prior) or discontinuous derivatives (for a Laplacian) standard conjugate gradient techniques need to be at least somewhat modified.",
        "Good-Turing discounting has been used or suggested for language modeling several times (Rosenfeld, 1994, page 38), (Lau, 1994).",
        "In particular, it has been suggested to use an update of the form",
        "where observed[k] ∗ is the Good-Turing discounted value of observed[k] .",
        "This update has a problem, as noted by its proponents: the constraints are probably now inconsistent – there is no model that can simultaneously satisfy them.",
        "We note that a simple variation on this update, inspired by the exponential prior, does not have these problems:",
        "In particular, this can be thought of as picking an αobserved[k] for each observed[k].",
        "This does not constitute a Bayesian prior, since the value is picked after the counts are observed, but it does lead to a convex objective function with a global maximum, and the update function will converge towards this maximum.",
        "Variations on the constraints of Equation 5 will apply for this modified objective function.",
        "Furthermore, in the experimental results section, we will see that on a language modeling task, this modified update function outperforms the traditional update.",
        "By using a well motivated approach inspired by exponential priors, we can find a simple variation that has better performance both theoretically and empirically."

        "As with the Gaussian prior, it is not clear how to maximize this function directly, so instead we use an auxiliary function, B(∆), with three important properties: first, we can maximize it; second, it bounds this function from below; third, it is larger than zero whenever Λ is not at a local optimum, i.e. does not satisfy the constraints in Equation 5.",
