      "heading": "1 Introduction",
      "text": [
        "The understanding of natural language text includes not only analysis of syntactic structure, but also of semantic content.",
        "Due to advances in statistical syntactic parsing techniques (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 2001), attention has recently shifted towards the harder question of analyzing the meaning of natural language sentences.",
        "A common lexical semantic representation in the computational linguistics literature is a frame-based model where syntactic arguments are associated with various semantic roles (essentially frame slots).",
        "Verbs are viewed as simple predicates over their arguments.",
        "This approach has its roots in Fillmore’s Case Grammar (1968), and serves as the foundation for two current large-scale semantic annotation projects: FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) and PropBank (Kingsbury et al., 2002).",
        "Underlying the semantic roles approach is a lexicalist assumption, that is, each verb’s lexical entry completely encodes (more formally, projects) its syntactic and semantic structures.",
        "Alternations in argument structure are usually attributed to multiple lexical entries (i.e., verb senses).",
        "Under the lexicalist approach, the semantics of the verb break might look something like this:",
        "(1) break(agent, theme) agent: subject theme: object break(agent, theme, instrument) agent: subject theme: object instrument: oblique(with) break(theme) theme: subject .",
        ".",
        ".",
        "The lexicon explicitly specifies the different subcate-gorization frames of a verb, e.g., the causative frame, the causative instrumental frame, the inchoative frame, etc.",
        "The major drawback of this approach, however, is the tremendous amount of redundancy in the lexicon – for example, the class of prototypical transitive verbs where the agent appears as the subject and the theme as the direct object must all duplicate this pattern.",
        "The typical solution to the redundancy problem is to group verbs according to their argument realization patterns (Levin, 1993), possibly arranged in an inheritance hierarchy.",
        "The argument structure and syntax-to-semantics mapping would then only need to be specified once for each verb class.",
        "In addition, lexical rules could be formulated to derive certain alternations from more basic forms.",
        "Nevertheless, the lexicalist approach does not capture productive morphological processes that pervade natural language, for example, flat.V – > flatten.ADJ or ham-mer.N – > hammer.V; most frameworks for computational semantics fail to capture the deeper derivational relationship between morphologically-related terms.",
        "For languages with rich derivational morphology, this problem is often critical: the standard architectural view of morphological analysis as a preprocessor presents difficulties in handling semantically meaningful affixes.",
        "In this paper, I present a computational implementation of Distributed Morphology (Halle and Marantz, 1993), a non-lexicalist linguistic theory that erases the distinction between syntactic derivation and morphological derivation.",
        "This framework leads to finer-grained semantics capable of better capturing linguistic generalizations."

        "It has previously been argued that representations based on a fixed collection of semantic roles cannot adequately capture natural language semantics.",
        "The actual inventory of semantic roles, along with precise definitions and diagnostics, remains an unsolved problem; see (Levin and Rappaport Hovav, 1996).",
        "Fixed roles are too coarse-grained to account for certain semantic distinctions – the only recourse, to expand the inventory of roles, comes with the price of increased complexity, e.g., in the syntax-to-semantics mapping.",
        "There is a general consensus among theoretical linguists that the proper representation of verbal argument structure is event structure – representations grounded in a theory of events that decompose semantic roles in terms of primitive predicates representing concepts such as causality and inchoativity (Dowty, 1979; Jackendoff, 1983; Pustejovsky, 1991b; Rappaport Hovav and Levin, 1998).",

        "(2) He sweeps the floor clean.",
        "[ [ DO(he, sweeps(the floor)) ] CAUSE [ BECOME [ clean(the floor) ] ] ] Dowty breaks the event described by (2) into two subevents, the activity of sweeping the floor and its result, the state of the floor being clean.",
        "A more recent approach, advocated by Rappaport Hovav and Levin (1998), describes a basic set of event templates corresponding to Vendler’s event classes (Vendler, 1957): (3) a.",
        "[ x ACT <MANNER> ] (activity)",
        "A process called Template Augmentation allows basic event templates to be freely “augmented” to any other event template.",

        "[ Phil ACT<SWEEP> floor ] b. Phil swept the floor clean.",
        "Following this long tradition of research, I propose a syntactically-based event representation specifically designed to handle alternations in argument structure.",

        "In Davidsonian terms, dynamic events introduce event arguments, whereas static situations do not.",
        "In (6b), the semantic argument that undergoes the change of state (ARGb) is introduced externally via the event argument.",
        "Considering that the only difference between flat.ADJ and flatten.V is the suffix -en, it must be the source of inchoativity and contribute the change of state reading that distinguishes the verb from the adjective.",
        "Here, we have evidence that derivational affixes affect the semantic representation of lexical items, that is, fragments of event structure are directly associated with derivational morphemes.",
        "We have the following situation:",
        "(7) Qflats = [state flat]",
        "In this case, the complete event structure of a word can be compositionally derived from its component morphemes.",
        "This framework, where the “semantic load” is spread more evenly throughout the lexicon to lexical categories not typically thought to bear semantic content, is essentially the model advocated by Pustejovsky (1991a), among many others.",
        "Note that such an approach is no longer lexicalist: each lexical item does not fully encode its associated syntactic and semantic structures.",
        "Rather, meanings are composed from component morphemes.",
        "In addition to -en, other productive derivational suffixes in English such as -er, -ize, -ion, just to name a few, can be analyzed in a similar way.",
        "In fact, we may view morphological rules for composing morphemes into larger phonological units the same way we view syntactic rules for combining constituents into higher-level projections, i.e., why distinguish VP – > V + NP from V – > Adj + -en?",
        "With this arbitrary distinction erased, we are left with a unified morpho-syntactic framework for integrating levels of grammar previously thought to be separate – this is indeed one of the major goals of Distributed Morphology.",
        "This theoretical framework translates into a computational model better suited for analyzing the semantics of natural language, particularly those rich in morphology.",
        "A conclusion that follows naturally from this analysis is that fragments of event structure are directly encoded in the syntactic structure.",
        "We could, in fact, further postulate that all event structure is encoded syntactically, i.e., that lexical semantic representation is isomorphic to syntactic structure.",
        "Sometimes, these functional elements are overtly realized, e.g., -en.",
        "Often, however, these functional elements responsible for licensing event interpretations are not phonologically realized.",
        "These observations and this line of reasoning has not escaped the attention of theoretical linguists: Hale and Keyser (1993) propose that argument structure is, in fact, encoded syntactically.",
        "They describe a cascading verb phrase analysis with multiple phonetically empty verbal projections corresponding to concepts such as inchoativity and agentivity.",

        "Although the study of event types can be traced back to Aristotle, it wasn’t until the twentieth century when philosophers and linguists developed classifications of events that capture logical entailments and the co-occurrence restrictions between verbs and other syntactic elements such as tenses and adverbials.",
        "Vendler’s (1957) four-way classification of events into states, activities, accomplishments, and achievements serves as a good starting point for a computational ontology of event types.",
        "Examples of the four event types are given below:",
        "Under Vendler’s classification, activities and states both depict situations that are inherently temporally unbounded (atelic); states denote static situations, whereas activities denote ongoing dynamic situations.",
        "Accomplishments and achievements both express a change of state, and hence are temporally bounded (telic); achievements are punctual, whereas accomplishments extend over a period of time.",
        "Tenny (1987) observes that accomplishments differ from achievements only in terms of event duration, which is often a question of granularity.",
