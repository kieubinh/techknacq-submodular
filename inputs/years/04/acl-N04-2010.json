        "Most state-of-the-art systems in speech and speaker recognition use mixtures of Gaussians when fitting a probability distribution to data.",
        "Reasons for this choice are the easily implementable estimation formulas and the modeling power of mixtures of Gaussians.",
        "For example, a mixture of diagonal Gaussians can still model dependencies on the global level.",
        "An established practice when applying mixtures of Gaussians is to use either full or diagonal covariances.",
        "However, imposing a structure may not be optimum and a more general methodology should allow for joint estimation of both the structure and parameter values.'.",
        "The first question we have to answer is what type of structure we want to estimate.",
        "For mixtures of Gaussians there are three choices.",
        "Covariances, inverse covariances or regression matrices.",
        "For all cases, we can see as selecting a structure by introducing zeros in the respective matrix.",
        "The three structures are distinctively different and zeros in one matrix do not, in general, map to zeros in another matrix.",
        "For example, we can have sparse covariance 'Here, we describe the Maximum Likelihood estimation methodology for both structure and parameters.",
        "One alternative is Bayesian estimation.",
        "but full inverse covariance or sparse inverse covariance and full regression matrix.",
        "There are no clear theoretical reasons why one choice of structure is more suitable than others.",
        "However, introducing zeros in the inverse covariance can be seen as deleting arcs in an Undirected Graphical Model (UGM) where each node represents each dimension of a single Gaussian (Bilmes, 2000).",
        "Similarly, introducing zeros in the regression matrix can be seen as deleting arcs in a Directed Graphical Model (DGM).",
        "There is a rich body of work on structure learning for UGM and DGM and therefore the view of a mixture of Gaussians as a mixture of DGM or UGM may be advantageous.",
        "Under the DGM framework, the problem of Gaussian parameter estimation can be cast as a problem of estimating linear regression coefficients.",
        "Since the specific problem of selecting features for linear regression has been encountered in different fields in the past, we adopt the view of a mixture of Gaussians as a mixture of DGM.",
        "In (Bilmes, 2000), the problem of introducing zeros in regression matrices of a mixture of Gaussians was presented.",
        "The approach taken was to set to zero the pairs with the lowest mutual information, i.e. bm = 0",
        "was tested for the task of speech recognition in a limited vocabulary corpus and was shown to offer the same performance with the mixture of full-covariance Gaussians with 30% less parameters.",
        "full covariances.",
        "One issue with the work in (Bilmes, 2000) is that the structure-estimation criterion that was used was not discriminative.",
        "For classification tasks, like speaker or speech recognition, discriminative parameter estimation approaches achieve better performance than generative ones, but are in general hard to estimate especially for a high number of classes.",
        "In this work, a number of discriminative structure-estimation criteria tailored for the task of speaker recognition are introduced.",
        "We avoid the complexities of discriminative parameter estimation by estimating a discriminative structure and then applying generative parameter estimation techniques.",
        "Thus, overall the models attempt to model the discriminability between classes without the numerical and implementation diffi",
        "culties that such techniques have.",
        "A comparison of the new discriminative structure-estimation criteria with the structural EM algorithm is also presented.",
        "This paper is structured as follows.",
        "In section 2, the view of a Gaussian as a directed graphical model is presented.",
        "In section 3, discriminative and generative structure-estimation criteria for the task of speaker recognition are detailed, along with a description of the structural EM algorithm.",
        "In section 4, the application task is described and the experiments are presented.",

        "First, it avoids inversion of matrices and instead solves V + 1 linear systems of d equations each where d = 1 : V + 1.",
        "If the number of components and dimensionality of input vectors are high, as it is usually the case in speech recognition applications, the amount of computations saved can be important.",
        "Second, the number of computations scale down with the number of regression coefficients set to zero.",
        "This is not true in the traditional formulation because introducing zeros in the covariance matrix may result in a non-positive definite matrix and iterative techniques should be used to guarantee consistency (Dempster, 1972).",
        "Third, for the traditional formulation, adapting a mixture of non-diagonal Gaussians with linear transformations leads to objective functions that cannot be maximized analytically.",
        "Instead, iterative maximization techniques, such as gradient descent, are used.",
        "With the new formulation even with arbitrary Gaussians, closed-form update equations are possible.",
        "Finally, the new formulation offers flexibility in tying mechanisms.",
        "Regression matrices B,,,, and variances D,,,, can be tied in different ways, for example all the components can share the same regression matrix but estimate a different variance diagonal matrix for each component.",
        "Similar schemes were found to be succesful for speech recognition (Gales, 1999) and this formulation can provide a model that can extend such tying schemes.",
        "The advantages of the new formulation are summarized in Table 1."

        "In general, structure learning in DGM is an NP-hard problem even when all the variables are observed (Chick-ering et al., 1994).",
        "Our case is further complicated by the fact that we have a hidden variable (the Gaussian index).",
        "Optimum structure-finding algorithms, like the one in (Meila and Jordan, 2000) assume a mixture of trees and therefore are making limiting assumptions about the space of possible structures.",
        "In this paper, no prior assumptions about the space ofpossible structures are made but this leads to absence of guarantee for an optimum structure.",
        "Two approaches for structure-learning are introduced.",
        "The first approach is to learn a discriminative structure, i.e. a structure that can discriminate between classes even though the parameters are estimated in an ML fashion.",
        "The algorithm starts from the fully connected model and deletes arcs, i.e. sets bi,j ,,,, = 0 d m = 1 : M (M is the number of Gaussian components in a mixture).",
        "After setting regression coefficients to zero, maximum likelihood parameter estimation of the sparse mixture is employed.",
        "A number of different structure-estimation criteria were tested for the speaker recognition task (at the right of each equation a shorthand for each criterion is defined):",
        "where I (Xi; Xj) is the mutual information between elements Xi and Xj of input vector X.",
        "The mutual informations are estimated by first fitting a mixture of 30 diagonal Gaussians and then applying the methods described in (Bilmes, 1999).",
        "All but MI and MIimp are discriminative criteria and all are based on finding the pairs (i, j) with the lowest values and zeroing the respective regression coefficients, for every component of the mixture.",
        "MIimp assigns the same speaker-independent structure for all speakers.",
        "For DMIconf target speaker k is the most confusable for target speaker s in terms of hits, i.e. when the truth is s, speaker k fires more than any other target speaker.",
        "We can see that different criteria aim at different goals.",
        "MI attempts to avoid the overfit-ting problem by zeroing regression coefficients between least marginally dependent feature elements.",
        "DMIimp attempts to discriminate against impostors, MIimp attempts to build a speaker-independent structure which will be more robustly estimated since there are more data to estimate the mutual informations and DMIconf attempts to discriminate against the most confusable target speaker.",
        "The most confusable target speaker k for a given target speaker s should be determined from an independent held-out set.",
        "There are three main drawbacks that are shared by all of the above criteria.",
        "First, they are limited by the fact that all Gaussians will have the same structure.",
        "Second, since we are estimating sparse regression matrices, it is known that the absence of an arc is equivalent to conditional independencies, yet the above criteria can only test for marginal independencies.",
        "Third, we introduce another free parameter (the number of regression coefficients to be set to zero) which can be determined from a held-out set but will require time consuming trial and error techniques.",
        "Nevertheless, they may lead to better discrimination between speakers.",
        "The second approach we followed was one based on an ML fashion which may not be optimum for classification tasks, but can assign a different structure for each component.",
        "We used the structural EM (Friedman, 1997), (Thiesson et al., 1998) and adopt it for the case of mixtures of Gaussians.",
        "Structural EM is an algorithm that generalizes on the EM algorithm by searching in the combined space of structure and parameters.",
        "One approach to the problem of structure finding would be to start from the full model, evaluate every possible combination of arc removals in every Gaussian, and pick the ones with the least decrease in likelihood.",
        "Unfortunately, this approach can be very expensive since every time we remove an arc on one of the Gaussians we have to re-estimate all the parameters, so the EM algorithm must be used for each combination.",
        "Therefore, this approach alternates parameter search with structure search and can be very expensive even if we follow greedy approaches.",
        "On the other hand, structural EM interleaves parameter search with structure search.",
        "Instead of following the sequence Estep – > Mstep – > structure search, structural EM follows Estep – > structure search – > Mstep.",
        "By treating expected data as observed data, the scoring of likelihood decomposes and therefore local changes do not influence the likelihood on other parameters.",

        "If M is the structure, O are the parameters and n is the iteration index, then the naive approach would be to do:",
        "If we replace M with H, i.e. the hidden variables or sufficient statistics, we will recognize the sequence of steps as the standard EM algorithm.",
        "For a more thorough discussion of structural EM, the reader is referred to (Friedman, 1997).",
        "The paper in (Friedman, 1997) has a general discussion on the structural EM algorithm for an arbitrary graphical model.",
        "In this paper, we introduced a greedy pruning algorithm with step size K for mixtures of Gaussians.",
        "The algorithm is summarized in Table 2.",
