        "The Columbia Newsblaster' system has been online and providing summaries of topically clustered news daily since late 2001 (McKeown et al., 2002).",
        "The goal of the system is to aid daily news browsing by providing an automatic, user-friendly access to important news topics, along with summaries and links to the original articles for further information.",
        "The system has six major phases: crawling, article extraction, clustering, sum-marization, classification, and web page generation.",
        "The focus of this paper is to present the entire multilingual Columbia Newsblaster system as a platform for multilingual multi-document summarization experiments.",
        "The phases in the multilingual version of Columbia Newsblaster have been modified to take language and character encoding into account, and a new phase, translation, has been added.",
        "Figure 1 depicts the multilingual Columbia Newsblaster architecture.",
        "We will describe the system, in particular a method using machine learning to extract article text from web pages that is applicable to different languages, and a baseline approach to multilingual multi-document summarization."

        "Previous work in multilingual document summarization, such as the SUMMARIST system (Hovy and Lin, 1999)",
        "extracts sentences from documents in a variety of languages, and translates the resulting summary.",
        "This system has been applied to Information Retrieval in the MuST System (Lin, 1999) which uses query translation to allow a user to search for documents in a variety of languages, summarize the documents using SUMMARIST, and translate the summary.",
        "The Keizei system (Ogden et al., 1999) uses query translation to allow users to search Japanese and Korean documents in English, and displays query-specific summaries focusing on passages containing query terms.",
        "Our work differs in the document clustering component – we cluster news to provide emergent topic structure from the data, instead of using an information retrieval model.",
        "This is useful in analysis, monitoring, and browsing settings, where a user does not have an a priori topic in mind.",
        "Our summarization strategy also differs from the approach taken by MuST in that we focus our effort on the summarization system, but only target a single language, shifting the majority of the multilingual knowledge burden to specialized machine translation systems.",
        "The Keizei system has the advantage of being able to generate query-specific summaries.",
        "Chen and Lin (Chen and Lin, 2000) describe a system that combines multiple monolingual news clustering components, a multilingual news clustering component, and a news summarization component.",
        "Their system clusters news in each language into topics, then the multilingual clustering component relates the clusters that are similar across languages.",
        "A summary is generated by linking sentences that are similar from the two languages.",
        "The system has been implemented for Chinese and English, and an evaluation over six topics is presented.",
        "Our clustering strategy differs here, as we translate documents before clustering, and cluster documents from all languages at the same time.",
        "This makes it easy to add support for additional languages by incorporating a new translation system for the language; no other changes need to be made.",
        "Our summarization model also provides summaries for documents from each language, allowing comparisons between them."

      "text": [
        "To move Columbia Newsblaster into a multilingual capable environment, we must be able to extract the “article text” from web pages in multiple languages.",
        "The article text is the portion of a web page that contains the actual news content of the page, as opposed to site navigation links, ads, layout information, etc.",
        "Our previous approach to extracting article text in Columbia Newsblaster used regular expressions that were hand-tailored to specific web sites.",
        "Adapting this approach to new web sites is difficult, and it is also difficult to adapt to foreign languages sites.",
        "We solved this problem by incorporating a new article extraction module using machine learning techniques.",
        "The new article extraction module parses HTML into blocks of text based on HTML markup and computes a set of 34 features based on simple surface characteristics of the text.",
        "We use features such as the percentage of text that is punctuation, the number of HTML links in the block, the percentage of question marks, the number of characters in the text block, and so on.",
        "Since the features are relatively language independent they can be computed for and applied to any language.",
        "Training data for the system is generated using a GUI that allows a human to annotate text candidates with one of fives labels: “ArticleText”, “Title”, “Caption”, “Image”, or “Other”.",
        "The “ArticleText” label is associated with the actual text of the article which we wish to extract.",
        "At the same time, we try to determine document titles, image caption text, and image blocks in the same framework.",
        "“Other” is a catch-all category for all other text blocks, such as links to related articles, navigation links, ads, and so on.",
        "The training data is used with the",
        "machine learning program Ripper (Cohen, 1996) to induce a hypothesis for categorizing text candidates according to the features.",
        "This approach has been trained on web pages from sites in English, Russian, and Japanese as shown in Table 1, but has been used with sites in English, Russian, Japanese, Chinese, French, Spanish, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Korean.",
        "The English training set was composed of 353 articles, collected from 19 web sites.",
        "Using 10-fold cross-validation, the induced hypothesis classify into the article text category with a precision of 89.1% and a recall of 90.7%.",
        "Performance over Russian data was similar, with a precision of 90.59% and recall of 95.06%.",
        "We evaluated the English hypothesis against the Russian data to observe whether the languages behave differently.",
        "As expected, the English hypothesis resulted in poor performance over the Russian data, and we saw comparable results for Japanese.",
        "The same English hypothesis performs adequately on other English sites not in the training set, so the differences between languages seem to be significant."

        "The article extraction component also determines a title for each document, and attempts to locate a publishing date for the articles.",
        "Title identification is important since in a cluster, sometimes with as many as 60 articles, the only information the user sees are the titles for the articles; if our system chooses poor titles, they will have a difficult time discriminating between the articles.",
        "If the article extraction component finds a title it is used.",
        "Unfortunately, this process is not always successful, so we have a variety of fall-back methods, including taking the title from the HTML TITLE tag, using heuristics to detect the title from the first text block, and using a portion of the first sentence.",
        "These approaches led to many uninformative titles extracted from the non-English sites, since they were developed for English news.",
        "We implemented a system to identify titles that are clearly non-descriptive, such as “Stock Market News”, that would apply to non-English text as well.",
        "We record the titles seen and rejected over time and use the list to reject titles with high frequency.",
        "A title with high frequency is assumed to be not descriptive enough to give a clear idea of the content of an article in a cluster of similar articles.",
        "To correctly extract dates for articles, we use heuristics to identify sequences of possible dates, weigh them, and choose the most likely date as the publication date.",
        "Regular expressions for Japanese date extraction were added to the system."

        "The Columbia Summarizer routes to one of two multi-document summarization systems based on the similarity of the documents in the cluster.",
        "If the documents are highly similar, the Multigen summarization system (McKeown et al., 1999) is used.",
        "Multigen clusters sentences based on similarity, and then parses and fuses information from similar sentences to form a summary.",
        "The second summarization system used is DEMS, the Dissimilarity Engine for Multi-document Summarization (Schiffman et al., 2002), which uses a sentence extraction approach to summarization.",
