        "The MiTAP prototype for SARS detection uses human language technology for detecting, monitoring, and analyzing potential indicators of infectious disease outbreaks and reasoning for issuing warnings and alerts.",
        "MiTAP focuses on providing timely, multilingual information access to analysts, domain experts, and decision-makers worldwide.",
        "Data sources are captured, filtered, translated, summarized, and categorized by content.",
        "Critical information is automatically extracted and tagged to facilitate browsing, searching, and scanning, and to provide key terms at a glance.",
        "The processed articles are made available through an easy-to-use news server and cross-language information retrieval system for access and analysis anywhere, any time.",
        "Specialized newsgroups and customizable filters or searches on incoming stories allow users to create their own view into the data while a variety of tools summarize, indicate trends, and provide alerts to potentially relevant spikes of activity."

        "Potentially catastrophic biological events that threaten US national security are steadily increasing in frequency.",
        "These events pose immediate danger to animals, plants, and humans.",
        "Current disease surveillance systems are inadequate for detecting indicators early enough to ensure the rapid response needed to combat these biological events and corresponding public reaction.",
        "Recent examples of outbreaks include both the HIV/AIDS and foot and mouth pandemics, the spread of West Nile virus to and across the US, the escape of Rift Valley Fever from Africa, SARS, and the translocation of both mad cow disease (BSE) and monkey pox to the United States.",
        "Biological surveillance systems in the United States rely most heavily on human medical data for signs of epidemic activity.",
        "These systems span multiple organizations and agencies, are often not integrated, and have no alerting capability.",
        "As a result, responders have an insufficient amount of lead time to prepare for biological events or catastrophes.",
        "Indications and Warnings (I&Ws) provide the potential for early alert of impending biological events, perhaps weeks to months in advance.",
        "Sources of I&Ws include transportation data, telecommunication traffic, economic indices, Internet news, RSS feeds (RSS) including weblogs, commerce, agricultural surveillance, weather, and other environmental data.",
        "Retrospective analyses of major infectious disease outbreaks (e.g., West Nile Virus and SARS) show that I&Ws were present weeks to months in advance, but these indicators were missed because data sources were difficult to obtain and hard to integrate.",
        "As a result, the available information was not utilized for appropriate national and international response.",
        "This illuminates a critical need in biodefense for an integrated system linking I&Ws for biological events from multiple and disparate sources with the response community."

        "MiTAP was initially created for tracking and monitoring infectious disease outbreaks and other biological threats as part of a DARPA Integrated Feasibility Experiment in biosecurity to explore the integration of synergistic TIDES language processing technologies applied to a real world domain.",
        "The system has since been expanded to other domains such as weapons of mass destruction, satellite monitoring, and suspect terrorist activity.",
        "In addition, researchers and analysts are examining hundreds of MiTAP data sources for differing perspectives on conflict and humanitarian relief efforts.",
        "Our newest MiTAP prototype explores the integration of outputs from operational data mining (anomaly detection), human language technology (information",
        "extraction, temporal tagging, machine translation, cross-language information retrieval), and visualization tools to detect SARS-specific I&Ws in Asia, with relevance to pathogen translocation to the United States.",
        "Using feeds from English and Chinese language newswire, weblogs, and other Internet data, the system translates Chinese text data and tracks keyword combinations thought to represent I&Ws specific to SARS outbreaks in China.",
        "Analysts can use cross-language information retrieval for retrospective analysis and improving the I&W model, save searches to use as filters on incoming data, view trends, and visualize the data along a time-line.",
        "Figure 1 shows an overview of the prototype.",
        "Warnings generated by this MiTAP prototype are intended to complement traditional biosurveillance and communications already in use by the international public health community.",

        "Consider the relative rates of words and phrases such as \"stay home from\" or \"pneumonia.” Geotem-poral location of non-seasonal spikes in relative rank of these strings can establish suspicion for further investigation by I&W experts."

        "The Human Language Indication Detector (HLID) performs data fusion on a number of disparate sources, compressing a large volume of information into a smaller but more significant set of alerts.",
        "HLID monitors a variety of sources including MiTAP articles, information events in RSS feeds, and other dynamically updated information on the World Wide Web.",
        "HLID analyzes events from these sources in real time and generates an estimate of significance for each, complete with an audit trail of supporting and negating evidence.",
        "This allows an analyst to direct a search for indicators towards interesting data while reducing the time spent investigating false alarms and insignificant events.",
        "HLID is composed of four major components.",
        "The first is an event collector, which monitors a data source and triggers action when an event is observed.",
        "These events are sent to the rule based reasoning engine, an expert system shell (JESS 2004) with hand authored rules.",
        "The engine performs vetting and initial investigation of each event by identifying correlated events, corroborating or invalidating evidence, and references to supporting information.",
        "The engine can also supplement its knowledge base by performing a directed search via the query management system, which allows retrieval of information from a wide variety of sources including databases and web pages.",
        "Lastly, the alerting mechanism disseminates the conclusions reached by the system and provides an interface that allows an analyst to launch a deeper search for indicators and warnings."
