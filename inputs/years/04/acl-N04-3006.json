        "The goal of the semantic parser is to analyze the semantic structure of a natural language sentence.",
        "Similar in spirit with the syntactic parser – whose goal is to parse a valid natural language sentence into a parse tree indicating how the sentence can be syntactically decomposed into smaller syntactic constituents – the purpose of the semantic parser is to analyze the structure of sentence meaning.",
        "Sentence meaning is composed by entities and interactions between entities, where entities are assigned semantic roles, and can be further modified by other modifiers.",
        "The meaning of a sentence is decomposed into smaller semantic units connected by various semantic relations by the principle of composi-tionality, and the parser represents the semantic structure – including semantic units as well as semantic relations, connecting them into a formal format.",
        "One major problem faced by many natural language understanding applications that rely on syntactic analysis of text, is the fact that similar syntactic patterns may introduce different semantic interpretations.",
        "Likewise, similar meanings can be syntactically realized in many different ways.",
        "The semantic parser attempts to solve this problem, and produces a syntax-independent representation of sentence meaning, so that semantic constituents can be accessed and processed in a more meaningful and flexible way, avoiding the sometimes rigid interpretations produced by a syntactic analyzer.",
        "For instance, the sentences I boil water and water boils contain a similar relation between water and boil, even though they have different syntactic structures.",
        "In this paper, we describe the main components of the semantic parser, and illustrate the basic procedures involved in parsing semantically open text.",
        "Our semantic parser departs from current approaches in statistics-based annotations of semantic structures.",
        "Instead, we are using publicly available lexical resources (FrameNet and WordNet) as a starting point to derive rules for a rule-based semantic parser."

      "heading": "2 Semantic Structure",
      "text": [
        "Semantics is the denotation of a string of symbols, either a sentence or a word.",
        "Similar to a syntactic parser, which shows how a larger string is formed by smaller strings from a formal point of view, the semantic parser shows how the denotation of a larger string – sentence, is formed by denotations of smaller strings – words.",
        "Syntactic relations can be described using a set of rules about how a sentence string is formally generated using word strings.",
        "Instead, semantic relations between semantic constituents depend on our understanding of the world, which is across languages and syntax.",
        "We can model the sentence semantics as describing entities and interactions between entities.",
        "Entities can represent physical objects, as well as time, places, or ideas, and are usually formally realized as nouns or noun phrases.",
        "Interactions, usually realized as verbs, describe relationships or interactions between participating entities.",
        "Note that a participant can also be an interaction, which can be regarded as an entity nominalized from an interaction.",
        "We assign semantic roles to participants and their semantic relations are identified by the case frame introduced by their interaction.",
        "In a sentence, participants and interactions can be further modified by various modifiers, including descriptive modifiers that describe attributes such as drive slowly, restrictive modifiers that enforce a general denotation to become more specific such as musical instrument, referential modifiers that indicate particular instances such as the pizza I ordered.",
        "Other semantic relations can also be identified, such as coreference, complement, and others.",
        "Based on the principle of compositionality, the sentence semantic structure is recursive, similar to a tree.",
        "Note that the semantic parser analyzes shallow-level semantics, which is derived directly from linguistic knowledge, such as rules about semantic role assignment, lexical semantic knowledge, and syntactic-semantic mappings, without taking into account any context or common sense knowledge.",
        "Hence, the parser can be used as an intermediate semantic processing level before higher levels of text understanding."
