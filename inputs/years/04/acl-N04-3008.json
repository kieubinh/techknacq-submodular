        "SenseClusters is a freely available word sense discrimination system that takes a purely unsupervised clustering approach.",

        "Most words in natural language have multiple possible meanings that can only be determined by considering the context in which they occur.",
        "Given instances of a target word used in a number of different contexts, word sense discrimination is the process of grouping these instances into clusters that refer to the same word meaning.",
        "Approaches to this problem are often based on the strong contextual hypothesis of (Miller and Charles, 1991), which states that two words are semantically related to the extent that their contextual representations are similar.",
        "Hence the problem of word sense discrimination reduces to that of determining which contexts of a given target word are related or similar.",
        "SenseClusters creates clusters made up of the contexts in which a given target word occurs.",
        "All the instances in a cluster are contextually similar to each other, making it more likely that the given target word has been used with the same meaning in all of those instances.",
        "Each instance normally includes 2 or 3 sentences, one of which contains the given occurrence of the target word.",
        "SenseClusters was originally intended to discriminate among word senses.",
        "However, the methodology of clustering contextually (and hence semantically) similar instances of text can be used in a variety of natural language processing tasks such as synonymy identification, text summarization and document classification.",
        "SenseClusters has also been used for applications such as email sorting and automatic ontology construction.",
        "In the sections that follow we will describe the basic functionality supported by SenseClusters.",
        "In general processing starts by selecting features from a corpus of text.",
        "Then these features are used to create an appropriate representation of the contexts that are to be clustered.",
        "Thereafter the actual clustering takes place, followed by an optional evaluation stage that compares the discovered clusters to an existing gold standard (if available)."

      "text": [
        "SenseClusters distinguishes among the different contexts in which a target word occurs based on a set of features that are identified from raw corpora.",
        "SenseClusters uses the Ngram Statistics Package (Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003), which is able to extract surface lexical features from large corpora using frequency cutoffs and various measures of association, including the log–likelihood ratio, Pearson’s Chi–Squared test, Fisher’s Exact test, the Dice Coefficient, Pointwise Mutual Information, etc.",
        "SenseClusters currently supports the use of unigram, bigram, and co-occurrence features.",
        "Unigrams are individual words that occur above a certain frequency cutoff.",
        "These can be effective discriminating features if they are shared by a minimum of 2 contexts, but not shared by all contexts.",
        "Very common non-content words are excluded by providing a stop–list.",
        "Bigrams are pairs of words that occur above a given frequency cutoff and that have a statistically significant score on a test of association.",
        "There may optionally be intervening words between them that are ignored.",
        "Co– occurrences are bigrams that include the target word.",
        "In effect co–occurrences localize the scope of the unigram features by selecting only those words that occur within some number of positions from the target word.",
        "SenseClusters allows for the selection of lexical features either from a held out corpus of training data, or from the same data that is to be clustered, which we refer to as the test data.",
        "Selecting features from separate training data is particularly useful when the amount of the test data to be clustered is too small to identify interesting features.",
        "The following is a summary of some of the options provided by SenseClusters that make it possible for a user to customize feature selection to their needs: –training FILE A held out file of training data to be used to select features.",
        "Otherwise, features will be selected from the data to be clustered.",
        "–token FILE A file containing Perl regular expressions that defines the tokenization scheme.",
        "–stop FILE A file containing a user provided stoplist.",
        "–feature STRING The feature type to be selected.",
        "Valid options include unigrams, bigrams, and co-occurrences.",
        "–remove N Ignore features that occur less N times.",
        "–window M Allow up to M-2 words to intervene between pairs of words when identifying bigram and co-occurrence features.",
        "–stat STRING The statistical test of association to identify bigram and co–occurrence features.",

      "heading": "3 Context Representation",
      "text": [
        "Once features are selected, SenseClusters creates a vector for each test instance to be discriminated where each selected feature is represented by an entry/index.",
        "Each vector shows if the feature represented by the corresponding index occurs or not in the context of the instance (binary vectors), or how often the feature occurs in the context (frequency vectors).",
        "This is referred to as a first order context vector, since this representation directly indicates which features make up the contexts.",
        "Here we are following (Pedersen and Bruce, 1997), who likewise took this approach to feature representation.",
        "(Sch¨utze, 1998) utilized second order context vectors that represent the context of a target word to be discriminated by taking the average of the first order vectors associated with the unigrams that occur in that context.",
        "In SenseClusters we have extended this idea such that these first order vectors can also be based on co–occurrence or bigram features from the training corpus.",
        "Both the first and second order context vectors represent the given instances as vectors in a high dimensional word space.",
        "This approach suffers from two limitations.",
        "First, there may be synonyms represented by separate dimensions in the space.",
        "Second, and conversely, a single dimension in the space might be polysemous and associated with several different underlying concepts.",
        "To combat these problems, SenseClusters follows the lead of LSI (Deerwester et al., 1990) and LSA (Landauer et al., 1998) and allows for the conversion of word level feature spaces into a concept level semantic space by carrying out dimensionality reduction with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).",
        "In particular, the package SVDPACK (Berry et al., 1993) is integrated into SenseClusters to allow for fast and efficient SVD."

        "The first or second order vector representations of contexts can be directly clustered using vector space methods provided in CLUTO.",
        "As an alternative, each context vector can be represented as a point in similarity space such that the distance between it and any other context vector reflects the pairwise similarity of the underlying instances.",

        "To carry out evaluation of the discovered clusters, SenseClusters finds the mapping of gold standard senses to discovered clusters that would result in maximally accurate discrimination.",
        "The problem of assigning senses to clusters becomes one of reordering the columns of the confusion matrix to maximize the diagonal sum.",
        "Thus, each possible reordering shows one assignment scheme and the sum of the diagonal entries indicates the total number of instances in the discovered clusters that would be in their correct sense given that alignment.",

        "This particular visualization illustrates the case when the gold–standard data has fewer senses (6) than the actual number requested (10).",
        "CLUTO and SenseClusters both require that the desired number of clusters be specified prior to clustering.",
        "In this example we requested 10, and the mountain view reveals that there were really only 5 to 7 actual distinct senses.",
        "In unsupervised word sense discrimination, the user will usually not know the actual number of senses ahead of time.",
        "One possible solution to this problem is to request an arbitrarily large number of clusters and rely on such visualizations to discover the true number of senses.",
