        "The statistical machine translation framework (SMT) formulates the problem of translating a sentence from a source language S into a target language T as the maximization problem of the conditional probability:",
        "where p(SIT) is called a translation model (TM), representing the generation probability from T into S, p(T) is called a language model (LM) and represents the likelihood of the target language (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "The TM and LM probabilities are trained automatically from a parallel text corpus (parameter estimation).",
        "They represent the general translation knowledge used to map a sequence of words from the source language into the target language.",
        "During the translation process (decoding) a statistical score based on the probabilities of the translation and the language models is assigned to each translation candidate and the one with the highest TM-LM score is selected as the translation output.",
        "However, the system might not be able to find a good translation due to parameter estimation problems of the statistical models (due to data sparseness during the estimation of the model probabilities) and search errors",
        "during the translation process.",
        "Moreover, conventional SMT approaches use words as the translation unit.",
        "Therefore, the optimization is carried out locally generating the translation word-by-word.",
        "In the framework of example-based machine translation (EBMT), however, a parallel text corpus is used directly to obtain the translation (Nagao, 1984).",
        "Given an input sentence, translation examples from the corpus that are best matched to the input are retrieved and adjusted to obtain the translation.",
        "Thus the translation unit used in EBMT approaches is a complete sentence, providing a larger context for the generation of an appropriate translation.",
        "However, this approach requires appropriate translation examples to achieve an accurate translation.",
        "A combination of statistical and example-based MT approaches shows some promising perspectives for overcoming the shortcomes of each approach.",
        "In this paper, we propose an example-based rescoring method (EBRS) for selecting translation candidates generated by a statistical decoder, as illustrated in Figure 1."
