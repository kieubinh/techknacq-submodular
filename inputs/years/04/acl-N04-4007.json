        "Pioneering research by MIT and CMU as well as more recent work by the IBM Watch-me-Read Project have demonstrated that speech recognition can play an effective role in systems designed to improve children’s reading abilities (Mostow et al., 1994; Zue et al., 1996).",
        "In CMU’s Project LISTEN, for example, the tutor operates by prompting children to read individual sentences out loud.",
        "The tutor listens to the child using speech recognition and extracts features that can be used to detect oral reading miscues (Mostow et al., 2002; Tam et al.",
        "2003).",
        "Upon detecting reading miscues, the tutor provides appropriate feedback to the child.",
        "Recent results",
        "show that such automated reading tutors can improve student achievement (Mostow et al., 2003).",

        "A key component of this program is the Interactive Book, which combines real-time speech recognition, facial animation, and natural language understanding capabilities to teach children to read and comprehend text.",
        "Interactive Books are designed to improve student achievement by helping students to learn to read fluently, to acquire new knowledge through deep understanding of what they read, to make connections to other knowledge, and to express their ideas concisely through spoken or written summaries.",
        "Transcribed spoken summaries can be graded automatically to provide feedback to the student about their comprehension.",
        "During reading out loud activities in Interactive Books, the goal is to design a computer interface and speech recognizer that combine to teach the student to read fluently and naturally.",
        "Here, speech recognition is used to track a child’s position within the text during read-aloud sessions in addition to providing timing and confidence information which can be used for reading assessment.",
        "The speech recognizer must follow the students verbal behaviors accurately and quickly, so the cursor (or highlighted word) appears at the right place and right time when the student is reading fluently, and pauses when the student hesitates to sound out a word.",
        "The recognizer must also score mispronounced words accurately so that the student can revisit these words and receive feedback about their pronunciation after completing a paragraph or page (since highlighting hypothesized mispronounced words when reading out loud may disrupt fluent reading behavior).",
        "In this paper we focus on the problem of speech recognition to track and provide feedback during reading out loud and to transcribe spoken summaries of text.",
        "Specifically, we describe several new methods for incorporating language modeling knowledge into the read aloud task.",
        "In addition, through use of speaker adaptation, we also demonstrate the potential for significant gains in recognition accuracy.",
        "Finally, we leverage improvements in speech recognition for read aloud tracking to improve performance for spoken story summarization.",

        "The recognizer implements an efficient time-synchronous, beam-pruned Viterbi token-passing search through a static re-entrant lexical prefix tree while utilizing continuous density mixture Gaussian HMMs.",
        "For children’s speech, the recognizer has been trained on 46 hours of data from children in grades K through 9 extracted from the CU Read and Prompted speech corpus (Hagen et al., 2003) and the OGI Kids’ speech corpus (Shobaki et al., 2000).",
        "Further, the baseline system utilizes PMVDR cepstral coefficients (Yapanel and Hansen, 2003) for improved noise robustness.",
        "During read-aloud operation, the speech recognizer models the story text using statistical n-gram language models.",
        "This approach gives the recognizer flexibility to insert/delete/substitute words based on acoustics and to provide accurate confidence information from the word-lattice.",
        "The recognizer receives packets of audio and automatically detects voice activity.",
        "When the child speaks, the partial hypotheses are sent to a reading tracking module.",
        "The reading tracking module determines the current reading location by aligning each partial hypothesis with the book text using a Dynamic Programming search.",
        "In order to allow for skipping of words or even skipping to a different place within the text, the search finds words that when strung together minimize a weighted cost function of adjacent word-proximity and distance from the reader's last active reading location.",
        "The Dynamic Programming search additionally incorporates constraints to account for boundary effects at the ends of each partial phrase."

        "There are many different ways in which speech recognition can be used to serve children.",
        "In computer-based literacy tutors, speech recognition can be used to measure children's ability to read fluently and pronounce words while reading out loud, to engage in spoken dialogues with an animated agent to assess and train comprehension, or to transcribe spoken summaries of stories that can be graded automatically.",
        "Because of the variety of ways of using speech recognition systems, it is critically important to establish common metrics that are used by the research community so that progress can be measured both within and across systems.",
        "For this reason, we argue that word error rate calculations using the widely accepted NIST scoring software provides the most widely accepted, easy to use and highly valid metric.",
        "In this scoring procedure, word error rate is computed strictly by comparing the speech recognizer output against a known human transcription (or the text in a book).",
        "Of course, authors are free to define and report other measures, such as detection/false alarm curves for useful events such as reading miscues.",
        "However, such analyses should always supplement reports of word error rates using a single standardized measure.",
        "Adopting this strategy enables fair and balanced comparisons within and across systems for any speech data given a known word-level transcription."

        "During token-passing search, the initial word-history tokens are modified to account for the fact that the incoming sentence may be either the beginning of a new sentence or a direct extension of the previous utterance’s word-end history.",

        "Dynamic n-gram Language Modeling: During story reading we can anticipate words that are likely to be spoken next based upon the words in the text that are currently being read aloud.",

        "For each partition, we construct an n-gram language model by using the entire normalized story text in addition to a 10x weighting of text within the partition.",
        "Each position-sensitive language model therefore contains the entire story vocabulary.",
        "We also compute a general language model estimated solely from the entire story text (similar to Table 1(C)).",
        "At run-time, the recognizer implements a word-history buffer containing the most recent 15 recognized words.",
        "After decoding each utterance, the probability of the text within the word history buffer is computed using each of the position-sensitive language models.",
        "The language model with the highest probability is selected for the first-pass decoding of the subsequent utterance.",
