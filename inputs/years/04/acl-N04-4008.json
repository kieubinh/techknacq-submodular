        "Since the early 90’s, automatic alignment of bilingual documents and sentences based on lexical and syntactic information has been a major focus of the statistical NLP community as their results are a valuable resource for statistical machine translation, cross-lingual question answering, and other bilingual or cross-lingual tasks.",
        "Recently, there has been an increasing trend of using semantic information for these tasks spurred by the availability of various ontology databases such as WordNet, FrameNet, PropBank, etc.",
        "Among these, the Berkeley FrameNet database is a semantic lexical resource consisting of frame-semantic descriptions of more than 7000 English lexical items, together with example sentences annotated with semantic roles (Baker et al., 1998).",
        "The current version of FrameNet has been applied successfully to English question answering systems (Gildea, 2002).",
        "However, the manual development of FrameNet in other languages has been on a small scale (e.g. German, Spanish, Japanese) or unfinished (e.g. Chinese).",
        "Since manually annotation is rather time consuming, the main objective of our work is to automatically create multilingual FrameNet to enable semantic analysis in multiple languages rather than in English.",
        "Another objective is to quantify the mapping between semantic structures across language pairs for statistical NLP systems.",
        "Our basic idea is to coerce the English FrameNet into another language using existing semantic resources and a bilingual lexicon.",
        "Our initial target language is Chinese.",
        "However, we expect that our technique is applicable to other languages as well.",
        "There are two Chinese semantic resources available today--Cilin (tong2yi4ci2ci2lin2) (Mei et al., 1982) and HowNet (Dong and Dong, 2000).",
        "Much like WordNet, Cilin is a thesaurus with a hierarchical structure of word clusters, but it does not describe any semantic relationship between words and categories.",
        "HowNet, on the other hand, is an ontology with a graph structure of inter-concept relations and inter-attribute relations.",
        "In addition, HowNet has been widely used in resolving NLP problems, such as word sense disambiguation (Dang et al., 2002) and machine translation (Dorr et al., 2002).",
        "For our work, we choose to align HowNet concepts to lexical entries in FrameNet in order to construct the English-Chinese bilingual FrameNet.",
        "(Dorr et al., 2002) describes a technique for the construction of a Chinese-English verb lexicon based on HowNet and an English verb database called the LCS Verb Database (LVD).",
        "They created links between Chinese concepts in HowNet and English verb classes in LVD using both statistics and a manually constructed “seed mapping” of thematic classes between HowNet and LVD.",
        "Ngai et al.",
        "(2002) employed a word-vector based approach to create the alignment between WordNet and HowNet classes without any manual annotation.",
        "In this paper, we present a fully automatic approach to create links between FrameNet semantic frames and HowNet concepts.",
        "We also plan to release an on-line demonstration for the community to access the bilingual FrameNet we built."

An annotated sentence of lexical entry “beat.v”: [agent I] lay down on him and beat [victim at him] [means with my fists].",
        "HowNet is a Chinese ontology with a graph structure of word senses called “concepts”, and each concept contains 7 fields including lexical entries in Chinese, English gloss, POS tags for the word in Chinese and English, and a definition of the concept including its category and semantic relations (Dong and Dong, 2000).",
