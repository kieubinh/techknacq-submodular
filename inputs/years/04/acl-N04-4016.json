        "In a dialog system, speech recognition errors are inevitable and often make smooth communication between a user and a system difficult.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of a dialog between a user and a system which illustrates a system error.",
        "The system misrecognized “Tokyo” in the user’s utterance (U1) as “Kyoto” (S3).",
        "If the system correctly recognized the user’s utterance, the user could answer “yes” at U3 and the weather is reported (S6).",
        "However, in this case, the user must correct the error at U3 and the turns from S4 to U5 are required to recover from the error.",
        "The dialog system must recognize the user’s response to the system error (correction utterance).",
        "Otherwise, more turns (or a",
        "complete restart) will be required to correct the error.",
        "Therefore, an error handling method which corrects a system error and returns to the normal dialog flow smoothly is an important requirement for practical dialog systems.",
        "Recent work related to error handling in speech dialog systems has mainly focused on error detection.",

        "They also tried to detect system errors by using these parameters as input to machine learning methods.",
        "However, the issue of error recovery is not addressed.",
        "Danieli (1996) and LuperFoy & Duff (1996) proposed error detection methods based on plan matching.",

        "They also proposed a method to improve the recognition accuracy for correction utterances by selecting a speech recognition grammar according to the results of the error detection.",
        "The previous studies assumed that the rules for speech recognition or natural language processing of correction utterances were prepared in advance (Danieli , 1996; LuperFoy & Duff, 1996).",
        "These rules are indispensable because the correction utterance often includes the information required to correct the error.",
        "The correction utterance depends on the dialog context, especially on the user’s utterances prior to the system error.",
        "Therefore it is difficult for the system designer to prepare these rules in advance when the dialog flow becomes complex.",
        "To solve this problem, a method that can automatically create the rules to interpret correction utterances is desirable.",
