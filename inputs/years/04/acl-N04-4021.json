        "Pronunciation variation in spontaneous speech has been cited as a serious obstacle for automatic speech recognition (McAllester et al., 1998).",
        "Typical pronunciation models approach this problem by augmenting a phonemic dictionary with additional pronunciations, often resulting from the application of phone substitution, insertion, and deletion rules.",
        "By carefully constructing a rule set (Hazen et al., 2002), or by deriving rules or variants from data (Riley and Ljolje, 1996), many phenomena can be accounted for.",
        "However, the recognition improvement over a phonemic dictionary is typically modest, and some types of variation remain awkward to represent.",
        "These observations have motivated approaches to speech recognition based on multiple streams of linguistic features rather than a single stream of phones (e.g., King et al.",
        "(1998); Metze and Waibel (2002); Livescu et al.",
        "(2003)).",
        "Most of this work, however, has focused on acoustic modeling, i.e. the mapping between the features and acoustic observations.",
        "The pronunciation model is typically still phone-based, limiting the feature values to the target configurations of phones and forcing them to behave as a synchronous “bundle”.",
        "Some approaches have begun to relax these constraints.",
        "For example, Deng et al.",
        "(1997) and Richardson et al.",
        "(2000) model asynchronous feature trajectories using hidden Markov models (HMMs), with each state corresponding to a vector of feature values.",
        "This approach is powerful, but it cannot represent independencies between features.",
        "Kirchhoff (1996), in contrast, models the feature streams as independent, except for a requirement that they synchronize at syllable boundaries.",
        "As pointed out by Ostendorf (2000), such independence assumptions may allow for too much variability.",
        "In this paper, we propose a more general feature-based pronunciation model implemented using dynamic Bayesian networks (Dean and Kanazawa, 1989), which allow us to take advantage of inter-feature independen-cies while avoiding overly strong independence assumptions.",
        "In the following sections, we describe the model and present proof-of-concept experiments using phonetic transcriptions of utterances from the Switchboard conversational speech corpus (Greenberg et al., 1996)."

        "To help ground the discussion, we first present several examples of pronunciation variation.",
        "One common phenomenon is the nasalization of vowels preceding nasal consonants.",
        "This is a result of asynchrony: The velum is lowered before the oral closure is made.",
        "In more extreme cases, the nasal consonant is entirely absent, leaving only a nasalized vowel, as in can’t – > [ k ae n t ] 1.",
        "All of the feature values are still correct, although phonetically, this would be described as a deletion.",
        "Another example, taken from the Switchboard corpus, is several – > [s eh r v ax l].",
        "In this case, the tongue and lips have desynchronized to the point that the tongue 'Here and throughout, we use the ARPAbet phonetic symbol set with additional diacritics, such as “ n” for nasalization.",
        "retroflexion for [r] starts and ends before the lip narrowing gesture for [v].",
        "Again, all of the feature streams are produced correctly, but there is an apparent exchange of two phones, which cannot be represented via single-phone confusions conditioned on phonemic context.",
        "A final example from Switchboard is everybody – > [eh r uw ay].",
        "It is difficult to imagine a set of phonetic transformations that would predict this pronunciation without allowing a host of other impossible pronunciations.",
        "However, when viewed in terms of features, the transformation from [eh v r iy bcl b ah dx iy] to [eh r uw ay] is fairly simple.",
        "The tongue and lips desynchronize, causing the lips to start to close for the [bcl] during the previous vowel.",
        "In addition, the lip constrictions for [bcl] and [v], and the tongue tip gesture for [dx], are reduced.",

        "A feature-based pronunciation model is one that explicitly models the evolution of multiple underlying linguistic feature streams to predict the allowed realizations of a word and their probabilities.",
        "Our approach begins with the usual assumption that each word has one or more target phonemic pronunciations, or baseforms.",
        "Each base-form is converted to a table of underlying feature values.",
        "Table 1 shows what part of this table might look like for the word everybody.",
        "The table may include “unspecified” values (‘*’ in the table).",
        "More generally, each table entry can be a distribution over the range of feature values.",
        "For now, we assume that all of the features go through the same sequence of indices (and therefore the same number of targets) in a given word; e.g., in Table 1, LIP-OPEN goes through the same indices as TT- LOC, although it has the same target value for indices 2 and 3.",
        "In the first time frame of speech, all of the features begin in index 0; in subsequent frames, each feature can either stay in the same index or transition to the next one with some probability.",
        "The surface feature values – i.e., the ones that are actually produced by the speaker – can stray from the underlying pronunciation in two ways, typically because of articulatory inertia: substitution, in which a feature fails to reach its target underlying value; and asynchrony, in which different features proceed through their sequences of indices at different rates.",
        "We define the degree of asynchrony between two sets of features as the difference between the average index of one set relative to the average index of the second.",
        "The degree of asynchrony is constrained: More “synchronous” configurations are more probable (soft constraints), and we make the further simplifying assumption that there is an upper bound on the degree of asynchrony (hard constraints).",
        "A natural framework for such a model is provided by dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs), because of their index 0 1 2 3 ... phoneme eh v r iy ... LIP-OPEN wide critical wide wide ... TT-LOC alv.",

        "... ... ... ... ... ... ...",
        "ability to efficiently implement factored state representations.",
        "Figure 1 shows one frame of the type of DBN used in our model (simplified somewhat for clarity of presentation).",
        "This example DBN assumes a feature set with three features.",
        "The variables at time frame t are as follows: lexEntryt – entry in the lexicon corresponding to the current word and baseform.",
        "Words with multiple base-forms have one entry per baseform.",
        "lexEntryt’s parents are lexEntryt-1 and wdTrt_1 indjt – index of feature j into the underlying pronunciation, as in Table 1. indj0 = 0; in subsequent frames indjt is conditioned on lexEntryt_1, indjt_1, and wdTrt_ 1 (defined below).",
        "Ujt – underlying value of feature j.",
        "Its distribution p(Ujt IlexEntryt, indjt) is determined by the target feature table of lexEntryt.",
        "Sjt – observed surface value of feature j. p(Sjt Ujt) encodes allowed feature substitutions.",
        "wdTrt – binary variable indicating whether this is the last frame of the current word.",
        "– binary variable that enforces a synchrony constraint between subsets A and B of the feature set.",
        "It is observed with value 1; its distribution is con",
        "structed in such a way as to force its parent ind variables to obey the desired constraint.",
        "For example, to enforce a constraint between the average index of features 1 and 2 and the index of feature 3, we would have P(synct,2;3 = 1I ind1t , ind2t , ind3t) = 0 whenever ind1t, ind2t, indt3 violate the constraint.",
        "In an end-to-end recognizer, the acoustic observations would depend on the Sit, which would be unobserved.",
        "However, to facilitate quick experimentation and isolate the pronunciation model, we begin by testing how well we can do when given observed surface feature values."

        "We have performed a pilot experiment using the following feature set, based on the vocal tract variables of articulatory phonology (Browman and Goldstein, 1992): degree of lip opening; tongue tip location and opening degree; tongue body location and opening degree; velum state; and glottal (voicing) state.",
        "We imposed the following synchrony constraints: (1) All four tongue features are completely synchronized; (2) the lips can desynchronize from the tongue by up to one index; and (3) the glottis and velum are synchronized, and their index must be within 2 of the mean index of the tongue and lips.",
        "We used the Graphical Models Toolkit (Bilmes and Zweig, 2002) to implement the model.",
        "The distributions p(Sit IUit) were constructed by hand based on linguistic considerations, e.g. that features tend to go from more “constricted” values to less constricted ones, but not vice versa.",

        "For each word, we converted its transcription to a sequence of feature vectors, one vector per 10 ms frame.",
        "For this purpose, we divided diphthongs and stops into pairs of feature configurations.",
        "Given the input feature sequences, we computed a Viterbi score for each lexical entry in a 3000+-word (5500+-lexEntry) vocabulary, by “observing” the lexEntry variable and finding the most likely settings of all remaining variables.",
        "The most likely variable settings can be thought of as a mul-tistream alignment between the surface and underlying feature streams.",
        "Finally, we output the word corresponding to the highest-scoring lexical entry.",
        "We performed this procedure on a development set of 165 word transcriptions, which was used to tune settings such as synchronization constraints, and a test set of 236 transcriptions 2.",
        "We compared the performance of several models, measured in terms of word error rate (WER) and failure rate (FR), the percentage of inputs that had no Viterbi alignment with the correct word.",
        "To get a sense of the effect of feature asynchrony, we compared our asynchronous model with a version in which all features are forced to be synchronized, so that only feature substitution is allowed.",
        "This uses the same DBN, but with degenerate distributions for the synchronization variables.",
        "Also, since the Si values are derived from phonetic transcriptions, and are therefore constant over several frames at a time, we also built a variant of the DBN in which Si is allowed to change value with non-zero probability only when indi changes (by adding parents indit, indit_1, Sit_1 to Sit); we refer to this DBN as “segment-based”, and to the original as “frame-based”.",
        "We compared four variants, differing along the “synchronous vs. asynchronous” and “frame-based vs. segment-based” dimensions.",
