      "text": [
        "Our initial approach to the study of optimal queries employed a conditional maximum entropy model.",
        "This model exhibited some problematic behavior, which motivated the development of the weight search algorithm described here.",
        "The maximum entropy model is used as follows.",
        "It is given a set of relevant and non-relevant documents and a vector of terms (the query).",
        "For any document, the model predicts the probability of relevance for that document based on the Okapi term frequency (tf) scores (Robertson and Walker, 1994) for the query terms within it.",
        "Queries are developed by starting with the best possible one-term query and adding individual terms from a candidate set chosen according to a mutual information criterion.",
        "As each term is added, the model coefficients are set to maximize the probability of the empirical data (the document set plus relevance judgments), as described in Section 4.",
        "Treating the model coefficients as term weights yields a weighted query.",
        "This query produces a retrieval status value (RSV) for each document that is a monotonically increasing function of the probability of relevance, in accord with the probability ranking principle (Robertson, 1977).",
        "We can then calculate the average precision of the document set as ordered by these RSVs.",
        "As each additional query term represents another degree of freedom, one would expect model performance to improve at each step.",
        "However, we noted that the addition of a new term would occasionally result in a decrease in average precision – despite the fact that the model could have chosen a zero weight for the newly added term.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of this phenomenon for one TREC topic.",
        "This is the result of what might be called “metric divergence”.",
        "While we use average precision to evaluate the queries, the maximum entropy model maximizes the likelihood of the training data.",
        "These two metrics occasionally disagree in their evaluation of particular weight vectors.",
        "In particular, maximum entropy modeling may favor increasing the estimation of documents lower in the ranking at the expense of accuracy in the prediction of highly ranked documents.",
        "This can increase training data likelihood yet have a detrimental effect on average precision.",
        "The metric divergence problem led us to consider an alternative approach for setting term weights which would hill-climb on average precision directly.",
        "In particular, we were interested in evaluating the results produced by the maximum entropy approach – how much was the maximization of likelihood affecting the ultimate performance as measured by average precision?",
        "The algorithm described in the following section was developed to this end."

        "The general behavior of the weight search algorithm is similar to the maximum entropy modeling described in Section 2 – given a document corpus and a term vector, it seeks to maximize average precision by choosing a weight vector that orders the documents optimally.",
        "Unlike the maximum entropy approach, the weight search algorithm hill-climbs directly on average precision.",
        "The core of the algorithm is an exhaustive search of a single direction in weight space.",
        "Although each direction is continuous and unbounded, we show that the search can be performed with a finite amount of computation.",
        "This technique arises from a natural geometric interpretation of changes in document ordering and how they affect average precision.",
        "At the top level, the algorithm operates by cycling through different directions in weight space, performing an exhaustive search for a maximum in each direction, until convergence is reached.",
        "Although a global maximum is found in each direction, the algorithm relies on a greedy assumption of unimodality and, as with the maximum entropy model, is not guaranteed to find a global maximum in the multidimensional space."

        "Each term is, as the name suggests, an individual word or phrase that might occur in the document corpus.",
        "Every term ti has a weight Ai determining its “importance” relative to the other terms of the query.",
        "These weights form a weight vector A = (A1 A2 • • • AN).",
        "Further, given a document corpus A, for each document d j E A we have a “value vector” vj = (vj1 vj2 ••• vjN), where each “value” vji Est gives some measure of term ti within document dj – typically the frequency of occurrence or a function thereof.",
        "In the case of the standard tf-idf formula, vji is the term frequency and Ai the inverse document frequency.",
        "If the document corpus and set of terms is held fixed, the average precision calculation can be considered a function f :stN – > [0, 1] mapping A to a single average precision value.",

        "as they are in the tf-idf formula, we can exhaustively search in a single direction of the weight space in an efficient manner.",
        "This potentially yields better solutions and potentially converges more quickly than a general hill-climbing heuristic.",
        "The insight behind the algorithm is as follows.",
        "Given a direction w in weight space and a starting point 7r, the score of each document is a linear function of the scale µ along w from 7r:",
        "i.e. document di’s score, plotted against µ, is a line with slope w • viand y-intercept 7r • vj .",
        "Consider the graph of lines for all documents, such as the example in Figure 2.",
        "Each vertical slice of the graph, at some point 0 on the x axis, represents the order of the documents when µ _ 0; specifically, the order of the documents is given by the order of the intersections of the lines with the vertical line at x _ 0.",
        "Now consider the set of intersections of the document lines.",
        "Given two documents dr and ds, their intersection, if it exists, lies at point Lrs _ (Lxrs, Lyr s) where",

        "Let IF be the set of all such document intersection points for a given direction, document set and term vector.",

        "Therefore, the document ordering changes at and only at these points of intersection; in other words, the points in IF x partition the range of µ into at most M(M – 1)/2 +1 regions, where M is the total number of documents.",
        "Within a given region, document ordering is invariant and hence average precision is constant.",
        "As we can calculate the boundaries of, and the document ordering and average precision within, each region, we now have a way of finding the maximum across the entire space by evaluating a finite number of regions.",
        "Each of the O(M2) regions requires an O (M log M) sort, yielding a total computational bound of O(M3 log M).",
        "In fact, we can further reduce the computation by exploiting the fact that the change in document ordering between any two regions is known and is typically small.",
        "The weight search algorithm functions in this manner.",
        "It sorts the documents completely to determine the ordering in the leftmost region.",
        "Then, it traverses the regions from left to right and updates the document ordering in each, which does not require a sort.",
