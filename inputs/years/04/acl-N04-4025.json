        "Performance predicting the tags automatically was 15% below human agreement.",
        "These tagged statements are then used to predict team performance.",
        "The second approach measures the semantic content of the dialogue of the team as a whole and accurately predicts the team's performance on a simulated military mission."

        "The growing complexity of tasks frequently surpasses the cognitive capabilities of individuals and thus, often necessitates a team approach.",
        "Teams play an increasingly critical role in complex military operations in which technological and information demands require a multi-operator environment.",
        "The ability to automatically predict team performance would be of great value for team training systems.",
        "Verbal communication data from teams provides a rich indication of cognitive processing at both the individual and the team level and can be tied back to both the team's and each individual team member's abilities and knowledge.",
        "The current manual analysis of team communication shows promising results, see for example, Bowers et al.",
        "(1998).",
        "Nevertheless, the analysis is quite costly.",
        "Hand coding for content is time consuming and can be highly subjective.",
        "Thus, what is required are techniques for automatically analyzing team communications in order to categorize and predict performance.",
        "In the research described in this paper we apply Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), to measure free-form verbal interactions among team members.",
        "Because it can measure and compare the semantic information in these verbal interactions, it can be used to characterize the quality and quantity of information expressed.",
        "This can be used to determine the semantic content of any utterance made by a team member as well as to measure the semantic similarity of an entire team's communication to another team.",
        "In this paper we describe research on developing automated techniques for analyzing the communication and predicting team performance using a corpus of communication of teams performing simulated military missions.",
        "We focus on two applications of this approach.",
        "The first application is to automatically predict the categories of discourse for each utterance made by team members during a mission.",
        "These tagged statements can then be used to predict overall team performance.",
        "The second application is to automatically predict the effectiveness of a team based on an analysis of the entire discourse of the team during a mission.",
        "We then conclude with a discussion of how these techniques can be applied for automatic communications analysis and integrated into training."

        "CERTT's UAV-STE is a three-team member task in which each team member is provided with distinct, though overlapping, training; has unique, yet interdependent roles; and is presented with different and overlapping information during the mission.",
        "The overall goal is to fly the UAV to designated target areas and to take acceptable photos at these areas.",
        "The 67 team-at-mission transcripts in the UAV-Corpus contain approximately 2700 minutes of spoken dialogue, in 20545 separate utterances or turns.",
        "There are approximately 232,000 words or 660 KB of text.",

        "1998), which includes tags for: acknowledgement, action, factual, planning, response, uncertainty, and non-task related utterances.",
        "The three annotators had each tagged 26 or 27 team-at-missions so that 12 team-at-missions were tagged by two annotators.",

        "We computed Cohen's Kappa to be 0.62 (see Section 4 and Table 1).",
        "In addition to the moderate level inter-coder agreement, tagging was done at the turn level, where a turn could range from a single word to several utterances by a single speaker, and the number of tags that taggers assigned to a given turn might not agree.",
        "We hope to address these limitations in the data set with a more thorough annotation study in the near future."

        "We used the union of the sets of tags assigned by the taggers as the \"corrected tag\".",
        "The union, rather than the intersection, was used since taggers sometimes missed relevant tags within a turn.",

        "However the focus of this study was on identifying the existence of relevant discourse, not on its order within the turn.",
        "Then, for each of the 12 team-at-mission transcripts, we automatically assigned \"most probable\" tags to each turn, based on the corrected tags of the \"most similar\" turns in the other 11 team-at-missions.",
        "For a given turn, T, the algorithm proceeds as follows: Find the turns in the other 11 team-at-mission transcripts, whose vectors in the semantic space have the largest cosines, when compared with T's vector in the semantic space.",

        "The corrected tags for these \"most similar\" turns are retrieved.",
        "The sum of the cosines for each tag that appears is computed and normalized to give a probability that the tag is the corrected tag.",
        "Finally, we determine the predicted tag by applying a cutoff (0.3 and 0.4 seem to produce the best results): all of the tags above the cutoff are chosen as the predicted tag.",
        "If no tag has a probability above the cutoff, them the single tag with the maximum probability is chosen as the predicted tag.",
        "We also computed the average cosine similarity of T to its 10 closest tags as a measure of certainty of categorization.",
        "For example, if T is not similar to any previously categorized turns, then it would have a low certainty.",
        "This permits the flagging of turns that the algorithm is not likely to tag as reliability.",
        "In order to improve our results, we considered ways to incorporate simple discourse elements into our predictions.",
        "We added two discourse features to our algorithm: for any turn with a question mark, \"?\", we increased to probability that uncertainty, \"U\", would be one of the tags in its predicted tag; and for any turn following a turn with a question mark, \"ï¿½\", we increased to probability that response, \"R\", would be one of the tags in its predicted tag.",

        "We realize that training our system on tags where humans had only moderate agreement is not ideal.",
        "Our failure analyses indicated that the distinctions our algorithm has difficulty making are the same distinctions that the humans found difficult to make, so we believe that improved agreement among human annotators would result in similar improvements for our algorithm.",

        "While the approach is not quite as accurate as human taggers, LSA is able to tag an hour of transcripts in under a minute.",

        "Measuring Agreement.",
        "The C-value measures the proportion of inter-coder agreement, but does not take into account agreement by chance.",

        "We generate the predicted team performance scores was as follows: Given a subset of transcripts, S, with known performance scores, and a transcript, t, with unknown performance score, we can estimate the performance score for t by computing its similarity to each transcript in S. The similarity between any two transcripts is measured by the cosine between the transcript vectors in the UAV-Corpus semantic space.",
        "To compute the estimated score for t, we take the average of the performance scores of the 10 closest transcripts in S, weighted by cosines.",
        "A holdout procedure was used in which the score for a team's transcript was predicted based on the transcripts and scores of all other teams (i.e. a team's score was only predicted by the similarity to other teams).",
        "Our results indicated that the LSA estimated performance scores correlated strongly with the actual team performance scores (r = 0.76, p < 0.01), as shown in Figure 1.",

        "Overall, the results of the study show that LSA can be used for tagging content as well as predicting team performance based on team dialogues.",
        "Given the limitations of the manual annotations, the results from the tagging portion of the study are still comparable to other efforts of automatic discourse tagging using different methods and different corpora (Stolcke et al., 2000), which found performance within 15% of the performance of human taggers.",
        "We plan to conduct a more rigorous manual annotation study.",
        "We expect that improved human inter-coder reliability would eliminate the need for \"corrected tags\" and allow for sequential analysis of tags within turns.",
        "It is also anticipated that incorporating additional methods that account for syntax and discourse turns should further improve the overall performance, see also Serafin et al.",
        "(2003).",
        "Even with the limitations of the discourse tagging, our LSA-based approach demonstrates it can be applied as a method for doing automated measurement of team performance.",
        "Using automatic methods we were able to duplicate some of the results of Bowers, and colleagues, (1998) who analyzed the sequence of content categories occurring in communication in a flight simulator task.",
        "They found that high team effectiveness was associated with consistent responding to uncertainty, planning, and fact statements with acknowledgments and responses.",
        "The LSA-predicted team performance scores correlated strongly with the actual team performance measures.",
        "This demonstrates that analyses of discourse can automatically measure how well a team is performing on a mission.",
        "This has implications both for automatically determining what discourse characterizes good and poor teams as well as developing systems for monitoring team performance in near real-time.",
        "We are currently exploring two promising avenues to predict performance in real time: integration of speech recognition technology, and inter-turn tag sequences.",
        "Research into team discourse is a new but growing area.",
        "However, up to recently, the large amounts of transcript data have limited researchers from performing analyses of team discourse.",
        "The results of this study show that applying NLP techniques to team discourse can provide accurate predictions of performance.",
        "These automated tools can help inform theories of team performance and also aid in the development of more effective automated team training systems."
