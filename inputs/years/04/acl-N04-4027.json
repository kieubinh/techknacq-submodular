        "In this paper, we discuss work on summarizing email threads, i.e., coherent exchanges of email messages among several participants.' Email is a written medium of asynchronous multi-party communication.",
        "This means that, unlike for example news stories but as in face-to-face spoken dialog, the email thread as a whole is a collaborative effort with interaction among the discourse participants.",
        "However, unlike spoken dialog, the discourse participants are not physically co-present, so that the written word is the only channel of communication.",
        "Furthermore, replies do not happen immediately, so that responses need to take special precautions to identify relevant elements of the discourse context (for example, by citing previous messages).",
        "Thus, email is a distinct linguistic genre that poses its own challenges to summarization.",
        "In the approach we propose in this paper, we follow the paradigm used for other genres of summarization, namely sentence extraction: important sentences are extracted from the thread and are composed into a summary.",
        "Given the special characteristics of email, we predict that certain email-specific features can help in identifying relevant sentences for extraction.",
        "In addition, in presenting the extracted summary, special “wrappers” ensure that ' The work reported in this paper was funded under the KDD program.",
        "We would like to thank three anonymous reviewers for very insightful and helpful comments.",
        "the reader can reconstruct the interactional aspect of the thread, which we assume is crucial for understanding the summary.",
        "We acknowledge that other techniques should also be explored for email summarization, but leave that to separate work."

        "This approach works best when the subject of the root email best describes the “issue” of the thread, and when the root email does not discuss more than one issue.",
        "In our work, we do not make any assumptions about the nature of the email, and learn sentence extraction strategies using machine learning.",
        "Newman and Blitzer (2003) also address the problem of summarizing archived discussion lists.",
        "They cluster messages into topic groups, and then extract summaries for each cluster.",
        "The summary of a cluster is extracted using a scoring metric based on sentence position, lexical similarity of a sentence to cluster centroid, and a feature based on quotation, among others.",
        "While the approach is quite different from ours (due to the underlying clustering algorithm and the absence of machine learning to select features), the use of email-specific features, in particular the feature related to quoted material, is similar.",

        "The expanded message is passed to a document summarizer which is used as a black box to generate summaries.",
        "Our work, in contrast, aims at summarizing the whole thread, and we are precisely interested in changing the summarization algorithm itself, not in using a black box summarizer.",
        "In addition, there has been some work on summarizing meetings.",
        "As discussed in Section 1, email is different in important respects from (multi-party) dialog.",
        "However, some important aspects are related.",
        "Zechner (2002), for example, presents a meeting summarization system which uses the MMR algorithm to find sentences that are most similar to the segment and most dissimilar to each other.",
        "The similarity weights in the MMR algorithm are modified using three features, including whether a sentence belongs to a question-answer pair.",
        "The use of the question-answer pair detection is an interesting proposal that is also applicable to our work.",

      "text": [
        "Our corpus consists of 96 threads of email sent during one academic year among the members of the board of the student organization of the ACM at Columbia University.",
        "The emails dealt mainly with planning events of various types, though other issues were also addressed.",
        "On average, each thread contained 3.25 email messages, with all threads containing at least two messages, and the longest thread containing 18 messages.",
        "Two annotators each wrote a summary of the thread.",
        "We did not provide instructions about how to choose content for the summaries, but we did instruct the annotators on the format of the summary; specifically, we requested them to use the past tense, and to use speech-act verbs and embedded clauses (for example, Dolores reported she’d gotten 7 people to sign up instead of Dolores got 7 people to sign up).",
        "We requested the length to be about 5% to 20% of the original text length, but not longer than 100 lines.",
        "Writing summaries is not a task that competent native speakers are necessarily good at without specific training.",
        "Furthermore, there may be many different possible summary types that address different needs, and different summaries may satisfy a particular need.",
        "Thus, when asking native speakers to write thread summaries we cannot expect to obtain summaries that are similar.",
        "We then used the handwritten summaries to identify important sentences in the threads in the following manner.",
        "We used the sentence-similarity finder SimFinder (Hatzivassiloglou et al., 2001) in order to rate the similarity of each sentence in a thread to each sentence in the corresponding summary.",
        "SimFinder uses a combination of lexical and linguistic features to assign a similarity score to an input pair of texts.",
        "We excluded sentences that are being quoted, as well as signatures and the like.",
        "For each sentence in the thread, we retained the highest similarity score.",
        "We then chose a threshold; sentences with SimFinder scores above this threshold are then marked as “Y”, indicating that they should be part of a summary, while the remaining sentences are marked “N”.",
        "About 26% of sentences are marked “Y”.",
        "All sentences from the email threads along with their classification constitutes our data.",
        "For annotator DB, we have 1338 sentences, of which 349 are marked “Y”, for GR (who has annotated a subset of the threads that DB has annotated) there are 1296 sentences, of which 336 are marked “Y”.",
        "Only 193 sentences are marked “Y” using the summaries of both annotators, reflecting the difference in the summaries written by the two annotators.",
        "The kappa for the marking of the sentences is 0.29 (recall that this only indirectly reflects annotator choice).",
        "Thus, our expectation that human-written summaries will show great variation was borne out; we discuss these differences further in Section 5."

        "All results using Ripper improve on this baseline.",
        "If we perform exactly the same experiments on the summaries written by annotator GR, we obtain the results shown in the bottom half of Figure 1.",
        "The results are much worse, and the centroid-based baseline outperforms all but the full feature set.",
        "We leave to further research an explanation of why this may be the case; we speculate that GR,as an annotator, is less consistent in her choice of material than is DB when forming a summary.",
        "Thus, the machine learner has less regularity to learn from.",
        "However, we take this difference as evidence for the claim that one should not expect great regularity in human-written summaries.",
        "Finally, we investigated what happens when we combine the data from both sources, DB and GR.",
        "Using SimFinder, we obtained two scores for each sentence, one that shows the similarity to the most similar sentence in DB’s summary, and one that shows the similarity to the most similar sentence in GR’s summary.",

        "Both ways of combining the scores result in worse scores than either annotator on his or her own; the average is worse than the maximum (see Figure 2).",
