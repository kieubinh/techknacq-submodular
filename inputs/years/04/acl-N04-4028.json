        "Information extraction usually consists of tagging a sequence of words (e.g. a Web document) with semantic labels (e.g. PERSONNAME, PHONENUMBER) and depositing these extracted fields into a database.",
        "Because automated information extraction will never be perfectly accurate, it is helpful to have an effective measure of the confidence that the proposed database entries are correct.",
        "There are at least three important applications of accurate confidence estimation.",
        "First, accuracy-coverage trade-offs are a common way to improve data integrity in databases.",
        "Efficiently making these trade-offs requires an accurate prediction of correctness.",
        "Second, confidence estimates are essential for interactive information extraction, in which users may correct incorrectly extracted fields.",
        "These corrections are then automatically propagated in order to correct other mistakes in the same record.",
        "Directing the user to the least confident field allows the system to improve its performance with a minimal amount of user effort.",
        "Kristjannson et al.",
        "(2004) show that using accurate confidence estimation reduces error rates by 46%.",
        "Third, confidence estimates can improve performance of data mining algorithms that depend upon databases created by information extraction systems (McCallum and Jensen, 2003).",
        "Confidence estimates provide data mining applications with a richer set of “bottom-up” hypotheses, resulting in more accurate inferences.",
        "An example of this occurs in the task of citation co-reference resolution.",
        "An information extraction system labels each field of a paper citation (e.g.",
        "AUTHOR, TITLE), and then co-reference resolution merges disparate references to the same paper.",
        "Attaching a confidence value to each field allows the system to examine alternate labelings for less confident fields to improve performance.",
        "Sound probabilistic extraction models are most conducive to accurate confidence estimation because of their intelligent handling of uncertainty information.",
        "In this work we use conditional random fields (Lafferty et al., 2001), a type of undirected graphical model, to automatically label fields of contact records.",
        "Here, a record is an entire block of a person’s contact information, and a field is one element of that record (e.g. COMPANYNAME).",
        "We implement several techniques to estimate both field confidence and record confidence, obtaining an average precision of 98% for fields and 87% for records."

        "Conditional random fields (Lafferty et al., 2001) are undirected graphical models to calculate the conditional probability of values on designated output nodes given values on designated input nodes.",
        "In the special case in which the designated output nodes are linked by edges in a linear chain, CRFs make a first-order Markov independence assumption among output nodes, and thus correspond to finite state machines (FSMs).",
        "In this case CRFs can be roughly understood as conditionally-trained hidden Markov models, with additional flexibility to effectively take advantage of complex overlapping features.",
        "Let o = (o1, o2, ...oT) be some observed input data sequence, such as a sequence of words in a document (the values on T input nodes of the graphical model).",

        "Let s = (s1,s2,...sT) be some sequence of states (the values on T output nodes).",
        "CRFs define the conditional probability of a state sequence given an input sequence as",

        "Z. is efficiently calculated using dynamic programming.",
        "Inference (very much like the Viterbi algorithm in this case) is also a matter of dynamic programming.",

        "We have shown that CFB is a mathematically and empirically sound confidence estimator for finite state information extraction systems, providing strong correlation with correctness and obtaining an average precision of 97.6% for estimating field correctness.",
        "Unlike methods margin maximization methods such as SVMs and M3Ns (Taskar et al., 2003), CRFs are trained to maximize conditional probability and are thus more naturally appropriate for confidence estimation.",
        "Interestingly, reranking by MAXENT does not seem to improve performance, despite the benefit Collins (2000) has shown discriminative reranking to provide generative parsers.",
        "We hypothesize this is because CRFs are already discriminative (not joint, generative) models; furthermore, this may suggest that future discriminative parsing methods will also have the benefits of discriminative reranking built-in directly."
