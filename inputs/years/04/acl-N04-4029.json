        "Spoken input based user interfaces can be broadly categorized as dialogue-based interfaces and menu-selection interfaces.",
        "In dialogue-based interfaces, the system engages in a dialogue with the user in an attempt to determine the user’s intention.",
        "In menu-based interfaces users traverse a tree of menus, each node of which presents a list of possible choices for the user.",
        "In both kinds of interfaces, the speech recognizer must typically convert the user’s speech to an unambiguous text string, which is then used by the UI to determine the action it must take next.",
        "Both kinds of interfaces eventually respond to the user with a unique output.",
        "In this paper we advocate a third, and different approach to spoken user interfaces.",
        "We note that in a majority of applications for which speech interfaces may be used, the goal of the interaction between the user and the system is to evoke a specific response from a limited set of possible responses.",
        "In our approach, we view the set of possible responses as documents in an index, and the task of obtaining a specific response as that of retrieval from the set.",
        "Spoken input from the user is treated as a query, which is used to retrieve a list of potentially valid responses that are displayed to the user.",
        "The user must then make the final selection from the returned list.",
        "We call spoken user interfaces based on this approach “Speech-In List-Out” or SILO interfaces.",
        "While much has been written on text-based retrieval of spoken or multimedia documents, the topic of information retrieval (IR) using spoken queries has not been addressed much.",
        "The usual approach to spoken query based IR has been to use the recognizer as a speech-to-text convertor that generates a text string (Chang et.",
        "al, 2002; Chen et.",
        "al., 2000) or a phoneme sequence (Kupiec et.",
        "al.",
        "1994) which is used to query the index.",
        "This approach is critically dependent on accurate recognition of the spoken query.",
        "In our system, however, we do not require direct conversion of the spoken input to an unambiguous text string.",
        "Instead, the spoken query is converted to a probabilistically scored “bag of words” derived from the entire hypothesis space of the recognizer, that serves as the query to the index.",
        "This system is able to perform effectively even when the actual text string output by the recognizer is erroneous.",
        "The proposed SILO approach has several advantages over dialogue-based or menu-based interfaces.",
        "The latter require users to know or guess what to say at each stage in an interaction.",
        "Interactions typically follow a sequence of steps, and the allowed responses from the user vary with the state of the interaction.",
        "On the other hand, since the SILO interface essentially performs information retrieval based on the query, restrictions on the allowed language are few, if any.",
        "Additionally, the SILO interface responds in a single step to the user, without requiring repeated refinement of the request.",
        "This simplicity of operation makes the SILO interface measurably simpler to use than menu-based interfaces.",
        "Speech recognition systems often make mistakes, especially under noisy recording conditions.",
        "Recognition errors can result in incorrect responses from user interfaces.",
        "To improve the robustness of the UI to recognition errors, dialogue and menu-based systems use various techniques such as rejection, confirmatory responses and error-correcting dialogues.",
        "SILO interfaces do not use such techniques, and are more reliant on getting the responses right in the first place.",
        "This is possible in SILO interfaces because the spoken query based IR technique used in them is inherently robust to recognition errors.",
        "The rest of this paper is arranged as follows: in Section 2 we describe the basic operation of the SILO interface.",
        "In Section 3 we describe the spoken query based IR algorithm used by the SILO interface.",
        "In Section 4 we describe some example applications that use the SILO interface and present experiments evidence of the effectiveness of SILO.",
        "Finally in Section 5 we present our conclusions."

        "The user initiates the interaction typically using a push-to-talk or press-to-talk button.",
        "Thereafter the system goes through a cycle of processing speech",
        "the user’s spoken input, and responding to it in some manner, either with a menu, or some intermediate response of a dialogue.",
        "After a number of cycles through this loop, the system eventually responds with the desired action.",
        "Conventional interfaces are predicated on the theory that it is advantageous to obtain information about the desired final response in an incremental manner, through controlled exchanges in which the number of possible interpretations of the user’s input is limited.",
        "In addition, dialogue-based interfaces also attempt to make the interaction between the user and the system conversational.",
        "The design of the SILO interface, on the other hand, is based on the following premises: a) when the set of possible responses by the system is limited and can be enumerated, simple information retrieval techniques are sufficient to shortlist the possible final responses to the user.",
        "The shortlist may bear no resemblance to the structured lists that are derived by a menu or dialogue-based system, but will nevertheless contain the desired response provided the IR technique used is sufficiently robust.",
        "b) It is best to push the final choice of response from such a list back to the user.",

        "shows the operation of the SILO interface.",
        "The user initiates the interaction using a push-to-talk button.",
        "The system then records the user’s spoken input and returns a ranked list of plausible responses based on the input.",
        "The user finally selects the desired response through a secondary selection, which may be performed using buttons, or even by voice.",
        "The entire operation is performed in two steps, one in which the system retrieves a list of choices, and the other in which the user selects from the list."

        "At the heart of the SILO interface is the MERL Spoken-Query information retrieval engine (Wolf and Raj, 2002).",
        "The standard approach to spoken query based IR requires the unambiguous conversion of the spoken input to text by the recognizer, and is likely to fail if the recognizer makes errors, especially in recognizing keywords that identify the desired documents.",
        "The SpokenQuery IR engine used in the SILO interface, however, does not require unambiguous speech-to-text conversion.",
        "Spoken queries need not conform to any grammar and are permitted to be free form.",
        "Textual descriptions of the responses required from the system are stored as documents in a document index.",
        "The descriptions must uniquely identify the response.",
        "For example, in a digital music retrieval system, the documents might be the descriptive meta data associated with the music.",
        "For a command and control system, they might be a text description of possible actions to be taken by the application.",
        "Documents are represented in this index as word-count vectors.",
        "Each entry in the vector represents the frequency of occurrence of a specific word in the document.",
        "This representation ignores the order in which words occur in the documents, retaining information only about their frequency of occurrence.",
        "This particular representation is related to the absence of linguistic constraints applied to spoken queries.",
        "Since queries are permitted to be free form, word order cannot be a consideration in the formation of the query, and consequently in the document index.",
        "Spoken queries are converted to a data structure that is similar to the structures used to represent documents in the index.",
        "The query structure is a vector of normalized expected word counts in the spoken query.",
        "The expected count for a word is simply the statistical expectation of the number of times the word occurred in the spoken query and is computed from the entire set of word sequence hypotheses considered by the recognizer, not just the single text string finally output by the recognizer.",
        "The recognizer represents the set of all considered hypotheses as a graph that is commonly known as a word lattice.",
        "Nodes in the graph represent words and arcs represent valid transitions between words.",
        "The scores associated with nodes and arcs are the probabilities of the corresponding words and transitions.",
        "The best-choice transcript generated by the recognizer is the most likely path through this lattice (i.e. the path with the best score).",
        "The a posteriori probability of any node in the word lattice is the ratio of the total probability scores of all paths through the lattice that pass through that node, to the total probability of all paths through the lattice and can be computed through a forward-backward algorithm.",
        "Multiple nodes in the word lattice may represent the same word.",
        "The normalized expected count for a word is simply the total of the a posteriori probabilities of all instances of that word in the lattice.",
        "We call these “normalized” counts since the expected counts of all words sum to 1.0.",
        "A useful feature of speech recognition systems is that the actual words spoken by the user are usually included in the recognition lattice for the utterance, often with high probability, even when they are not included in the recognizer’s final output.",
        "As a result, the true query word usually have non-zero, and often relatively high, expected word counts, regardless of their inclusion in the final recognizer output.",
        "For retrieval, the dot product of the document word-count vectors and the expected word count vectors derived from the spoken query is computed.",

        "count vectors for documents and stores them in an index.",
        "For retrieval, spoken queries are converted to a recognition lattice by a recognizer.",
        "Normalized expected word count vectors are computed from the lattice.",
        "Documents are ranked by the dot product of their word count vectors and the query vector, and retrieved in the order of their ranking.",
        "The vocabulary of the speech recognizer used for query construction minimally includes all keywords in the documents.",
        "In addition to these, the recognizer may include all the rest of the words in the documents as well, or may replace them with a smaller set of garbage words.",
        "Since queries may be free form, the recognizer cannot use constrained grammars that impose strict restrictions on word order.",
        "Instead, it uses an N-gram language model that highlights the keywords and key phrases, but does not strictly disallow any particular sequence of words."

        "Four were non-native speakers and all but one were regular automobile drivers.",
