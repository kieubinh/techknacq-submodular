        "Currently, information architects create meta-data category hierarchies manually.",

        "Human-readable hierarchies of category metadata are needed for a wide range of information-centric applications, including information architectures for web sites (Rosenfeld and Morville, 2002) and metadata for browsing image and document collections (Yee et al., 2003).",
        "In the information architecture community, methods for creation of content-oriented metadata tend to be almost entirely manual (Rosenfeld and Morville, 2002).",
        "The standard procedure is to gather lists of terms from existing resources, and organize them by selecting, merging and augmenting the term lists to produce a set of hierarchical category labels.",
        "Usually the metadata categories are used as labels which are assigned manually to the items in the collection.",
        "We advocate instead a nearly-automated approach to building hierarchical subject category metadata, where suggestions for metadata terms are automatically generated and grouped into hierarchies and then presented to information architects for limited pruning and editing.",
        "To be truly useful, these suggested groupings should be close to the final product; if the results are too scattered, a simple list of the most well-distributed terms is probably more useful (a similar phenomenon is seen in machine-aided translation systems (Church and Hovy, 1993)).",
        "More specifically, we aim to develop algorithms for generating category sets that (a) are intuitive to the target audience who will be browsing a web site or collection, (b) reflect the contents of the collection, and (c) allow for (nearly) automated assignment of the categories to the items in the collection.",
        "For a category system to be intuitive, modern information science practice finds that it should consist of a set of IS-A (hypernym) hierarchies1, from which multiple labels can be selected and assigned to an item, following the tenants of faceted classification (Rosenfeld and Morville, 2002; Yee et al., 2003).",
        "For example, a medical journal article will often simultaneously have terms assigned to it from anatomy, disease, and drug category hierarchies.",
        "Furthermore, usability studies suggest that the hierarchies should not be overly deep nor overly wide, and preferably should have concave structure (meaning broader at the root and leaves, narrower in the middle) (Bernard, 2002).",
        "Previous work on automated methods has primarily focused on using clustering techniques, which have the advantage of being automated and data-driven.",
        "However, a major problem with clustering is that the groupings show terms that are associated with one another, rather than hierarchical parent-child relations.",
        "Studies indicate that users prefer organized categories over associational clusters (Chen et al., 1998; Pratt et al., 1999).",
        "We have tested several approaches, including K-means clustering, subsumption (Sanderson and Croft, 1999), computing lexical co-occurrences (Schütze, 1993) and building on the WordNet lexical hierarchy (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "We have found that the latter produces by far the most intuitive groupings that would be useful for creation of a re-usable, human-readable category structure.",
        "Although the idea of using a resource like WordNet for this type of application seems rather obvious, to our knowledge it has not been used to create subject-oriented metadata for browsing.",
        "This may be in part because it is very",
        "large and the word senses are assumed to be too fine-grained (Mihalcea and Moldovan, 2001), or its structure is assumed to be inappropriate.",
        "However, we have found that, for some collections, starting with the assumption that there will be a small amount of hand-editing done after the automated processing, combined with a bottom-up approach that extracts out those parts of the hypernym hierarchy that are relevant to the collection, and a compression algorithm that simplifies the hierarchical structure, we can produce a structure that is close to the target goals.",
        "Below we describe related work, the method for converting WordNet into a more usable form, and the results of using the algorithm on a test collection."

        "There has been surprisingly little work on precisely the problem that we tackle in this paper.",
        "The literature on automated text categorization is enormous, but assumes that a set of categories has already been created, whereas the problem here is to determine the categories of interest.",
        "There has also been extensive work on finding synonymous terms and word associations, as well as automatic acquisition of IS-A (or genus-head) relations from dictionary definitions and glosses (Klavans and Whitman, 2001) and from free text (Hearst, 1992; Caraballo, 1999).",
        "Sanderson and Croft (1999) propose a method called subsumption for building a hierarchy for a set of documents retrieved for a query.",
        "For two terms x and y, x is said to subsume y if the following conditions hold: .",
        "The evaluation consisted of asking people to define the relation that holds between the pairs of words shown; only 23% of the pairs were found to hold a parent-child relation; 49% were found to fall into a more general related-to category.",
        "For a set of medical texts, the top level consisted of the terms: disease, post polio, serious disease, dengue, infection control, immunology, etc.",
        "This kind of listing is not systematic enough to appear on a navigation page for a website.",
        "Lawrie et al.",
        "(2001) use language models to produce summaries of text collections.",
        "The results are also associational; for example, the top level for a query on “Abuses of Email” are abuses, human, States Act, and Nursing Home Abuses, and the second level under abuses is e-mail, send, Money, Fax, account, address, Internet, etc.",
        "These again are too scattered to be appropriate for a human-readable index into a document collection.",
        "Hofmann (1999) uses probabilistic document clustering to impose topic hierarchies.",
        "For a collection of articles from the journal Machine Learning, the top level cluster is labeled learn, paper, base, model, new, train and the second level clusters are labeled process, experi, knowledge, develop, inform, design and algorithm, function, present, result, problem, model.",
        "We would prefer something more like the ACM classification hierarchy.",
        "The Word Space algorithm (Schütze, 1993) uses linear regression on term co-occurrence statistics to create groups of semantically related words.",
        "For every word, a context vector is computed for every position at which it occurs in text.",
        "A vector is defined as the sum of all four-grams in a window of 1001 fourgrams centered around the word.",
        "Cosine distance is used to compute the similarity between word vectors.",
        "Probably the closest work to that described here is the SONIA system (Sahami et al., 1998) which used a combination of unsupervised and supervised methods to organize a set of documents.",
        "The unsupervised method (document clustering) imposes an initial organization on a personal information collection which the user can then modify.",
        "The resulting organization is then used to train a supervised text categorization algorithm which automatically classifies new documents."
