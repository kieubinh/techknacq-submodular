        "In general, smoothing techniques are applied to lessen the curse of dimensionality.",
        "Among all methods, modified Kneser-Ney smoothing (Chen and Goodman, 1998) is widely used because of its good performance.",
        "Modeling conversational language is a particularly difficult task.",
        "Even though conventional techniques work well on read or prepared speech, situations such as telephone conversations or multi-person meetings pose great research challenges due to disfluencies, and odd syntactic/discourse patterns.",
        "Other difficulties include false starts, interruptions, and poor or unrepresented grammar.",
        "Most state-of-the-art language models consider word streams individually and treat different phrases independently.",
        "In this work, we introduce multi-speaker language modeling (MSLM), which models the effects on a speaker of words spoken by other speakers participating in the same conversation or meeting.",
        "Our new model achieves initial perplexity reductions of 6.2% on Switchboard-I, 5.8% on Switchboard Eval-2003, and 10.3% on ICSI Meeting data.",

        "In a conversational setting, such as during a meeting or telephone call, the words spoken by one speaker are affected not only by his or her own previous words but also by other speakers.",
        "Such inter-speaker dependency, however, is typically ignored in standard n-gram language models.",
        "In this work, information (i.e., word tokens) from other speakers (A) is used to better predict word tokens of the current speaker (W).",
        "When predicting wt, instead of using P(wtIw0, • • • , wt-1), the form P(wtIw0, • • • , wt 1; a0, • • • , at) is used.",
        "Here at represents a word spoken by some other speaker with appropriate starting time (Section 3).",
        "A straightforward implementation is to extend the normal trigram model as:",
        "Figure 1 shows an example from Switchboard (a) and one from a meeting (b).",
        "In (a), only two speakers are involved and the words from the current speaker, W, are affected by the other speaker, A.",
        "At the beginning of a conversation, the response to “Hi” is likely to be “Hi” or “Hello.” At the end of the phone call, the response to “Take care” might be “Bye”, or “You too”, etc.",
        "In (b), we show a typical meeting conversation.",
        "Speaker C2 is interrupting C3 when C3 says “Sunday”.",
        "Because “Sunday” is a day of the week, there is a high probability that C2’s response is also a day of the week.",
        "In our model, we only consider two streams at a time, W and A.",
        "Therefore, when considering the probability of C2’s words, it is reasonable to collapse words from all other speakers (C0,C1,C3,C4, and C5) into one stream A as shown in the figure.",
        "This makes available to C2 the rest of the meeting to potentially condition on, although it does not distinguish between different speakers.",
        "Our model, Equation 1, is different from most language modeling systems since our models condition on both previous words and another potential factor A.",
        "Such a model is easily represented using a factored language model (FLM), an idea introduced in (Bilmes and Kirchhoff, 2003; Kirchhoff et al., 2003), and incorporated into the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).",
        "Note that a form of cross-side modeling was used by BBN (Schwartz, 2004), where in a multi-pass speech recognition system the output of a first-pass from one speaker is used to prime words in the language model for the other speaker."

        "We evaluate MSLMs on three corpora: Switchboard-I, Switchboard Eval-2003, and ICSI Meeting data.",
        "In Switchboard-I, 6.83% of the words are overlapped in time, where we define w1 and w2 as being overlapped if s(w1) < s(w2) < e(w1) or s(w2) < s(w1) < e(w2), where s(•) and e(•) are the starting and ending time of a word.",
        "The ICSI Meeting Recorder corpus (Janin et al., 2003) consists of a number of meeting conversations with three or more participants.",
        "The data we employed has 32 conversations, 35,000 sentences and 307,000 total words, where 8.5% of the words were overlapped.",
        "As mentioned previously, we collapse the words from all other speakers into one stream A as a conditioning set for W. The data consists of all speakers taking their turn being W. To be used in an FLM, the words in each stream need to be aligned at discrete time points.",
        "Clearly, at should not come from wt’s future.",
        "Therefore, for each wt, we use the closest previous A word in the past for at such that s(wt-1) < s(at) < s(wt).",
        "Therefore, each at is used only once and no constraints are placed on at’s end time.",
        "This is reasonable since one can often predict a speaker’s word after it starts but before it completes.",
        "We score using the model P(wt I wt-1, wt-2, at).1 Different back-off strategies, including different back-off paths as well as combination methods (Bilmes and Kirchhoff, 2003), were tried and here we present the best results.",
        "The backoff order (for Switchboard-I and Meeting) first dropped at, then wt-2, wt-1, ending with the uniform distribution.",
        "For Switchboard eval-2003, we used a generalized parallel backoff mechanism.",
        "In all cases, modified Kneser-Ney smoothing (Chen and Goodman, 1998) was used at all back-off points.",
        "Results on Switchboard-I and the meeting data employed 5-fold cross-validation.",
        "Training data for Switchboard eval-2003 consisted of all of Switchboard-I.",
        "In Switchboard eval-2003, hand-transcribed time marks are unavailable, so A was available only at the beginning of utterances of W.2 Results (mean perplexities and standard deviations) are listed in Table 1 (Switchboard-I and meeting) and the IV I column in Table 3.",
        "In Table 1, the first column shows data set names.",
        "The second and third columns show our best baseline trigram and four-gram perplexities, both of which used interpolation and modified Kneser-Ney at every back-off point.",
        "The trigram outperforms the four-gram.",
        "The fourth column shows the perplexity results with MSLMs and the last column shows the MSLM’s relative perplexity reduction over the (better) trigram baseline.",
        "This positive reduction indicates that for both data sets, the utilization of additional information from other speakers can better predict the words of the current speaker.",

        "When this ratio is large and positive, conditioning on at significantly increases the probability of wt in the context of wt-1 and wt-2.",
        "The opposite is true when the ratio is large and negative.",
        "To ensure the significance of our results, we define “large” to mean at least 101.5 ,: 32, so that using at makes wt at least 32 times more (or less) probable.",
        "We chose 32 in a data-driven fashion, to be well above any spurious probability differences due to smoothing of different models.",
        "At the first word of a phrase spoken by W, there are a number of cases of A words that significantly increase the probability of a W word relative to the trigram alone.",
        "This includes (in roughly decreasing order of probability) echos (e.g., when A says “Friday”, W repeats it), greetings/partings (e.g., a W greeting is likely to follow an A greeting), paraphrases (e.g., “crappy” followed by “ugly”, or “Indiana” followed by “Purdue”), is-a relationships (e.g., A saying “corporation” followed by W saying “dell”, A-”actor” followed by W-”Swayze”, A-”name” followed by W-”Patricia”, etc.",
        "), and word completions.",
        "On the other hand, some A contexts (e.g., laughter) significantly decrease the probability of many W words.",
        "Within a W phrase, other patterns emerge.",
        "In particular, some A words significantly decrease the probability that W will finish a commonly-used phrase.",
        "For example, in a trigram alone, p(biggerIand, bigger), p(forthIand, back), and p(easyIand, quick), all have high probability.",
        "When also conditioning on A, some A words significantly decrease the probability of finishing such phrases.",
        "For example, we find that p(easyIand, quick, “uh-hmm”) « p(easyIand, quick).",
        "A similar phenomena occurs for other commonly used phrases, but only when A has uttered words such as “yeah”, “good”, “ok”, “[laughter]”, “huh”, etc.",
        "While one possible explanation of this is just due to decreased counts, we found that for such phrases p(wtI wt-1, wt-2, at) « minwt_3�Sp4(wtIwt-1,wt-2,wt-3) where p4 is a four-gram, S = {w : C(wt, wt-1, wt-2, w) > 01, and C is the 4-gram word count function for the switchboard training and test sets.",
        "Therefore, our hypothesis is that when W is in the process of uttering a predictable phrase and A indicates she knows what W will say, it is improbable that W will complete that phrase.",

        "This model can be further improved when class-based cross-speaker information is employed.",
        "We also presented two different criteria for this clustering.",
        "The more complex criteria gives similar results to the simple one, presumably due to data sparseness.",
        "Even though Switchboard and meeting data are different in terms of topic, speaking style, and speaker number, one might more robustly learn cross-speaker information by training on the union of these two data sets.",
        "There are a number of ways to extend this work.",
        "First, our current approach is purely data driven.",
        "One can imagine that higher level information (e.g., a dialog or other speech act) about the other speakers might be particularly important.",
        "Latent semantic analysis of stream A might also be usefully employed here.",
        "Furthermore, more than one word from stream A can be included in the context to provide additional predictive ability.",
        "With the meeting data, there may be a benefit to controlling for specific speakers based on their degree of influence.",
        "Alternatively, an MSLM might help identify the most influential speaker in a meeting by determining who most changes the probability of other speakers’ words.",
        "Moreover, the approach clearly suggests that a multi-speaker decoder in an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system might be beneficial.",
        "Once time marks for each word are provided in an N-best list, our MSLM technique can be used for rescoring.",
        "Additionally, such a decoder can easily be specified using graphical models (Bilmes and Zweig, 2002) in first-pass decodings.",
