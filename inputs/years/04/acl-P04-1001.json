        "Multimodal systems provide a natural and effective way for users to interact with computers through multiple modalities such as speech, gesture, and gaze (Oviatt 1996).",
        "Since the first appearance of “Put-That-There” system (Bolt 1980), a variety of multimodal systems have emerged, from early systems that combine speech, pointing (Neal et al., 1991), and gaze (Koons et al., 1993), to systems that integrate speech with pen inputs (e.g., drawn graphics) (Cohen et al., 1996; Wahlster 1998; Wu et al., 1999), and systems that engage users in intelligent conversation (Cassell et al., 1999; Stent et al., 1999; Gustafson et al., 2000; Chai et al., 2002; Johnston et al., 2002).",
        "One important aspect of building multimodal systems is multimodal interpretation, which is a process that identifies the meanings of user inputs.",
        "In a multimodal conversation, the way users communicate with a system depends on the available interaction channels and the situated context (e.g., conversation focus, visual feedback).",
        "These dependencies form a rich set of constraints from various aspects (e.g., semantic, temporal, and contextual).",
        "A correct interpretation can only be attained by simultaneously considering these constraints.",
        "In this process, two issues are important: first, a mechanism to combine information from various sources to form an overall interpretation given a set of constraints; and second, a mechanism that achieves the best interpretation among all the possible alternatives given a set of constraints.",
        "The first issue focuses on the fusion aspect, which has been well studied in earlier work, for example, through unification-based approaches (Johnston 1998) or finite state approaches (Johnston and Bangalore, 2000).",
        "This paper focuses on the second issue of optimization.",
        "As in natural language interpretation, there is strong evidence that competition and ranking of constraints is important to achieve an optimal interpretation for multimodal language processing.",

        "In a multimodal conversation, the way a user interacts with a system is dependent not only on the available input channels (e.g., speech and gesture), but also upon his/her conversation goals, the state of the conversation, and the multimedia feedback from the system.",
        "In other words, there is a rich context that involves dependencies from many different aspects established during the interaction.",
        "Interpreting user inputs can only be situated in this rich context.",
        "For example, the temporal relations between speech and gesture are important criteria that determine how the information from these two modalities can be combined.",
        "The focus of attention from the prior conversation shapes how users refer to those objects, and thus, influences the interpretation of referring expressions.",
        "Therefore, we need to simultaneously consider the temporal relations between the referring expressions and the gestures, the semantic constraints specified by the referring expressions, and the contextual constraints from the prior conversation.",
        "It is important to have a mechanism that supports competition and ranking among these constraints to achieve an optimal interpretation, in particular, a mechanism to allow constraint violation and support soft constraints.",
        "We use temporal constraints as an example to illustrate this viewpoint1.",
        "The temporal constraints specify whether multiple modalities can be combined based on their temporal alignment.",
        "In earlier work, the temporal constraints are empirically determined based on user studies (Oviatt 1996).",
        "For example, in the unification-based approach (Johnston 1998), one temporal constraint indicates that speech and gesture can be combined only when the speech either overlaps with gesture or follows the gesture within a certain time frame.",
        "This is a hard constraint that has to be satisfied in order for the unification to take place.",
        "If a given input does not satisfy these hard constraints, the unification fails.",
        "In our user studies, we found that, although the majority of user temporal alignment behavior may satisfy predefined temporal constraints, there are",
        "some exceptions.",
        "Table 1 shows the percentage of different temporal relations collected from our user studies.",
        "The rows indicate whether there is an overlap between speech referring expressions and their accompanied gestures.",
        "The columns indicate whether the speech (more precisely, the referring expressions) or the gesture occurred first.",
        "Consistent with the previous findings (Oviatt et al., 1997), in most cases (85% of time), gestures occurred before the referring expressions were uttered.",
        "However, in 15% of the cases the speech referring expressions were uttered before the gesture occurred.",
        "Among those cases, 8% had an overlap between the referring expressions and the gesture and 7% had no overlap.",
        "Furthermore, as shown in (Oviatt et al., 2003), although multimodal behaviors such as sequential (i.e., non-overlap) or simultaneous (e.g., overlap) integration are quite consistent during the course of interaction, there are still some exceptions.",
        "Figure 1 shows the temporal alignments from seven individual users in our study.",
        "User 2 and User 6 maintained a consistent behavior in that User 2’s speech referring expressions always overlapped with gestures and User 6’s gesture always occurred ahead of the speech expressions.",
        "The other five users exhibited varied temporal alignment between speech and gesture during the interaction.",
        "It will be difficult for a system using predefined temporal constraints to anticipate and accommodate all these different behaviors.",

        "As in natural language interpretation addressed by Optimality Theory, the idea of optimizing constraints is beneficial and there is evidence in favor of competition and constraint ranking in multimodal language interpretation.",
        "We developed a graph-based approach to address optimization for multimodal interpretation; in particular, interpreting multimodal references.",
        "Our approach simultaneously applies temporal, semantic, and contextual constraints together and achieves the best interpretation among all alternatives.",
        "Although currently the referent graph corresponds to gesture input and conversation context, it can be easily extended to incorporate other modalities such as gaze inputs.",
        "We have only taken an initial step to investigate optimization for multimodal language processing.",
        "Although preliminary studies have shown the effectiveness of the optimization approach based on graph matching, this approach also has its limitations.",
        "The graph-matching problem is a NP complete problem and it can become intractable once the size of the graph is increased.",
        "However, we have not experienced the delay of system responses during real-time user studies.",
        "This is because most user inputs were relatively concise (they contained no more than four referring expressions).",
        "This brevity limited the size of the graphs and thus provided an opportunity for such an approach to be effective.",
        "Our future work will address how to extend this approach to optimize the overall interpretation of user multimodal inputs."
