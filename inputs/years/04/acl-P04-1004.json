        "However, little is known about the use of natural language in dialog setting in formal domains, such as mathematics, due to the lack of empirical data.",

        "These phenomena motivate the need for deep syntactic and semantic analysis in order to ensure correct mapping of the surface input to the underlying proof representation.",
        "An additional methodological desideratum is to provide a uniform treatment of the different degrees of verbalization of the mathematical content.",
        "By designing one grammar which allows a uniform treatment of the linguistic content on a par with the mathematical content, one can aim at achieving a consistent analysis void of example-based heuristics.",
        "We present such an approach to analysis here.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, we summarize relevant existing approaches to input analysis in (tutorial) dialog systems on the one hand and analysis of mathematical discourse on the other.",
        "Their shortcomings with respect to our setting become clear in Section 3 where we show examples of language phenomena from our dialogs.",

        "However, the language in our dialogs is more informal: natural language and symbolic mathematical expressions are mixed more freely, there is a higher degree and more variety of verbalization, and mathematical objects are not properly introduced.",
        "Moreover, both above approaches rely on typesetting and additional information that identifies mathematical symbols, formulae, and proof steps, whereas our input does not contain any such information.",

        "Based on experimentally collected tutorial dialogs on mathematical proofs, we argued for the use of deep syntactic and semantic analysis.",
        "We presented an approach that uses multimodal CCG with hybrid logic dependency semantics, treating natural and symbolic language on a par, thus enabling uniform analysis of inputs with varying degree of formal content verbalization.",
        "A preliminary evaluation of the mathematical expression parser showed a reasonable result.",
        "We are incrementally extending the implementation of the deep analysis components, which will be evaluated as part of the next Wizard-of-Oz experiment.",
        "One of the issues to be addressed in this context is the treatment of ill-formed input.",
        "On the one hand, the system can initiate a correction subdialog in such cases.",
        "On the other hand, it is not desirable to go into syntactic details and distract the student from the main tutoring goal.",
        "We therefore need to handle some degree of ill-formed input.",
        "Another question is which parts of mathematical expressions should have explicit semantic representation.",
        "We feel that this choice should be motivated empirically, by systematic occurrence of natural language references to parts of mathematical expressions (e.g., “the left/right side”, “the parenthesis”, and “the inner parenthesis”) and by the syntactic contexts in which they occur (e.g., the partitioning <[x][EA]> seems well motivated in “B contains no xEA”; [x E] is a constituent in “x E of complement of B.”) We also plan to investigate the interaction of modal verbs with the argumentative structure of the proof.",
        "For instance, the necessity modality is compatible with asserting a necessary conclusion or a prerequisite condition (e.g., “A und B muessen dis-junkt sein.” [A and B must be disjoint.]).",
        "This introduces an ambiguity that needs to be resolved by the domain reasoner."
