        "Language modeling for speech could well be the first real problem for which syntactic techniques are useful.",

        "One reason that we expect syntactic models to perform well is that they are capable of modeling long-distance dependencies that simple n-gram ∗ This research was supported in part by NSF grants 9870676 and 0085940. models cannot.",
        "For example, the model presented by Chelba and Jelinek (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998; Xu et al., 2002) uses syntactic structure to identify lexical items in the left-context which are then modeled as an n-gram process.",
        "The model presented by Charniak (Charniak, 2001) identifies both syntactic structural and lexical dependencies that aid in language modeling.",
        "While there are n-gram models that attempt to extend the left-context window through the use of caching and skip models (Goodman, 2001), we believe that linguistically motivated models, such as these lexical-syntactic models, are more robust.",
        "Figure 1 presents a simple example to illustrate the nature of long-distance dependencies.",
        "Using a syntactic model such as the the Structured Language Model (Chelba and Jelinek, 1998), we predict the word fork given the context {ate, with} where a trigram model uses the context {with, a}.",
        "Consider the problem of disambiguating between ... plate with a fork and ... plate with effort.",
        "The syntactic model captures the semantic relationship between the words ate andfork.",
        "The syntactic structure allows us to find lexical contexts for which there is some semantic relationship (e.g., predicate-argument).",
        "Unfortunately, syntactic language modeling techniques have proven to be extremely expensive in terms of computational effort.",
        "Many employ the use of string parsers; in order to utilize such techniques for language modeling one must preselect a set of strings from the word-lattice and parse each of them separately, an inherently inefficient procedure.",
        "Of the techniques that can process word-lattices directly, it takes significant computation to achieve the same levels of accuracy as then –best rerank-ing method.",

        "In this paper we propose a variation of a probabilistic word-lattice parsing technique that increases",
        "efficiency while incurring no loss of language modeling performance (measured as Word Error Rate – WER).",
        "In (Hall and Johnson, 2003) we presented a modular lattice parsing process that operates in two stages.",
        "The first stage is a PCFG word-lattice parser that generates a set of candidate parses over strings in a word-lattice, while the second stage rescores these candidate edges using a lexicalized syntactic language model (Charniak, 2001).",
        "Under this paradigm, the first stage is not only responsible for selecting candidate parses, but also for selecting paths in the word-lattice.",
        "Due to computational and memory requirements of the lexicalized model, the second stage parser is capable of rescoring only a small subset of all parser analyses.",
        "For this reason, the PCFG prunes the set of parser analyses, thereby indirectly pruning paths in the word lattice.",
        "We propose adding a meta-process to the first-stage that effectively shifts the selection of word-lattice paths to the second stage (where lexical information is available).",
