        "A concatenative speech synthesis system (Hunt and Black, 1996; Beutnagel et al., 1999a) consists of three components.",
        "The first component, the text-analysis frontend, takes text as input and outputs a sequence of feature vectors that characterize the acoustic signal to synthesize.",
        "The first element of each of these vectors is the predicted phone or half-phone; other elements are features such as the phonetic context, acoustic features (e.g., pitch, duration), or prosodic features.",
        "The second component, unit selection, determines in a set of recorded acoustic units corresponding to phones (Hunt and Black, 1996) or half-phones (Beutnagel et al., 1999a) the sequence of units that is the closest to the sequence of feature vectors predicted by the text analysis frontend.",
        "The final component produces an acoustic signal from the unit sequence chosen by unit selection using simple concatenation or other methods such as PSOLA (Moulines and Charpentier, 1990) and HNM (Stylianou et al., 1997).",
        "Unit selection is performed by defining two cost functions: the target cost that estimates how the features of a recorded unit match the specified feature vector and the concatenation cost that estimates how well two units will be perceived to match when appended.",
        "Unit selection then consists of finding, given a specified sequence of feature vectors, the unit sequence that minimizes the sum of these two costs.",
        "The target and concatenation cost functions have traditionally been formed from a variety of heuristic or ad hoc quality measures based on features of the audio and text.",
        "In this paper, we follow a different approach: our goal is a system based purely on statistical modeling.",
        "The starting point is to assume that we have a training corpus of utterances labeled with the appropriate unit sequences.",
        "Specifically, for each training utterance, we assume available a sequence of feature vectors f = f i ... f,,, and the corresponding units u = ui ... u,,, that should be used to synthesize this utterance.",
        "We wish to estimate from this corpus two probability distributions, P(f |u) and P(u).",
        "Given these estimates, we can perform unit selection on a novel utterance using:",
        "Equation 1 states that the most likely unit sequence is selected given the probabilistic model used.",
        "Equation 2 follows from the definition of conditional probability and that P(f ) is fixed for a given utterance.",
        "The two terms appearing in Equation 2 can be viewed as the statistical counterparts of the target and concatenation costs in traditional unit selection.",
        "The statistical framework just outlined is similar to the one used in speech recognition (Jelinek, 1976).",
        "We also use several techniques that have been very successfully applied to speech recognition.",
        "For instance, in this paper, we show how – log P(u) (the concatenation cost) can be accurately estimated using a statistical n-gram language model over units.",
        "Two questions naturally arise.",
        "(a) How can we collect a training corpus for building a statistical model?",
        "Ideally, the training corpus could be human-labeled, as in speech recognition and other natural language processing tasks.",
        "But this seemed impractical given the size of the unit inventory, the number of utterances needed for good statistical estimates, and our limited resources.",
        "Instead, we chose to use a training corpus generated by an existing high-quality unit selection system, that of the AT&T Natural Voices Product.",
        "Of course, building a statistical model on that output can, at best, only match the quality of the original.",
        "But, it can serve as an exploratory trial to measure the quality of our statistical modeling.",
        "As we will see, it can also result in a synthesis system that is significantly faster and modular than the original since there are well-established algorithms for representing and optimizing statistical models of the type we will employ.",
        "To further simplify the problem, we will use the existing traditional target costs, providing statistical estimates only of the concatenation costs ( – log P(u)).",
        "(b) What are the benefits of a statistical modeling approach?",
        "(1) High-quality cost functions.",
        "One issue with traditional unit selection systems is that their cost functions are the result of the following compromise: they need to be complex enough to have a perceptual meaning but simple enough to be computed efficiently.",
        "With our statistical",
        "modeling approach, the labeling phase could be performed offline by a highly accurate unit selection system, potentially slow and complex, while the runtime statistical system could still be fast.",
        "Moreover, if we had audio available for our training corpus, we could exploit that in the initial labeling phase for the design of the unit selection system.",
        "(2) Weighted finite-state transducer representation.",
        "In addition to the already mentioned synthesis speed and the opportunity of high-quality measures in the initial offline labeling phase, another benefit of this approach is that it leads to a natural representation by weighted transducers, and hence enables us to build a unit selection system using general and flexible representations and methods already in use for speech recognition, e.g., those found in the FSM (Mohri et al., 2000), GRM (Allauzen et al., 2004) and DCD (Allauzen et al., 2003) libraries.",
        "Other unit selection systems based on weighted transducers were also proposed in (Yi et al., 2000; Bulyko and Ostendorf, 2001).",
        "(3) Unit selection algorithms and speed-up.",
        "We present a new unit selection system based on statistical modeling.",
        "We used weighted automata and transducers for the representation of the components of the system and designed a new and efficient composition algorithm making use of string potentials for their combination.",
        "The resulting statistical unit selection is shown to be about 2.6 times faster than the last release of the AT&T Natural Voices Product while preserving the same quality, and offers much flexibility for the use and integration of new and more complex components."

        "We introduced a statistical modeling approach to unit selection in speech synthesis.",
        "This approach is likely to lead to more accurate unit selection systems based on principled learning algorithms and techniques that radically depart from the heuristic methods used in the traditional systems.",
        "Our preliminary experiments using a training corpus generated by the AT&T Natural Voices Product demonstrates that statistical modeling techniques can be used to build a high-quality unit selection system.",
        "It also shows other important benefits of this approach: a substantial increase of efficiency and a greater modularity and flexibility."
