        "Spoken dialog systems have traditionally been difficult to instantiate because of the extensive efforts required for configuring each component from the natural language (NL) understanding to the domain-specific context tracking and dialog engines.",
        "This task is particularly involved when building systems that empower users with greater flexibility at the spoken input via mixed-initiative interaction (Zue et al., 2000; Ferguson and Allen, 1998), and systems that enable querying across large and frequently changing databases.",
        "The goal of this work is to assemble natural spoken dialog interfaces that enable flexible interactions through mixed initiative dialog and cooperative responses.",
        "Such interfaces aim to help users navigate large information spaces such as on-line databases.",
        "Conventional systems generally guide the users through a series of scripted prompts, either through This research is sponsored in part by SPAWAR SSC-SD.",

        "questions in an attempt to solicit more constraints from the user, with the goal of obtaining a small data subset from the database.",
        "The system responses are generated from a set of rules that only anticipate one of a handful of situations: (1) when the set of entries returned is too large, (2) the set of entries is adequately small to enumerate, and (3) no available entries have been returned.",
        "A more flexible scenario would allow the user to browse the content by specifying one or more constraints in any order.",
        "The system should then return a succinct summary of the content upon user specification of each constraint.",
        "This would provide improved feedback to the user about the available choices so far, guards against stilted conversations with a fixed number of dialog turns for every interaction, and mitigates against repeated scenarios where user queries return no items.",
        "However, much effort is then required in configuring the numerous scenarios for users to make sequences of queries in various orders.",
        "User queries are likely to differ if the database contents shift over time, changing the frequency and availability of certain entries.",
        "Furthermore, there remains the well-known “chicken-and-egg” problem of obtaining real-user data.",
        "With no real examples of human-computer interactions, it is difficult for developers to instantiate and configure a robust system.",
        "Yet without a reasonably operational system, it is equally difficult to convince real users to generate dialogs, particularly those which achieve successful completion.",
        "Hence, the usual development process consists of multiple iterations of expensive data collections and incremental system improvements.",
        "This paper presents an alternative paradigm for designing such a spoken dialog system.",
        "Our methodology employs simulations to reduce the time and effort required to build the system.",
        "Simulations facilitate prototyping and testing of an initial version of the system that automatically produces cooperative responses to user queries.",
        "We advocate the use of a suite of simulation techniques to create large numbers of synthetic user interactions with the system, including both typed and spoken inputs, where the speech is generated using a speech synthesizer.",
        "The resulting dialogs can be used to (1) diagnose the system for any problematic interactions, (2) enable a developer to examine system responses for large numbers of possible user queries, and (3) create an initial corpus for training the language models and probabilistic NL grammar.",
        "Thus, the initial phase of development comprises simulating hundreds of dialogs and iterative refinements prior to real-user data collection.",
        "In the next sections, we first describe our spoken dialog system architecture.",
        "This is followed by a description of a simulator, which operates in concert with a language generation system to output synthetic user queries.",
        "We elaborate on how the architecture can simulate coherent dialogs, and can be tuned to simulate a cooperative or uncooperative user.",
        "Then, methods for generating cooperative responses for a restaurant information domain are described.",

        "In (Scheffler and Young, 2000), extensive simulations incorporating user modeling were used to train a system to select dialog strategies in clarification sub-dialogs.",
        "These simulations required collecting real-user data to build the user model.",
        "Other researchers have used simulations for the evaluation of dialog systems (Hone and Baber, 1995; Araki and Doshita, 1997; Lin and Lee, 2001).",
        "In (Lopez et al., 2003), recorded utterances with additive noise were used to run a dialog system in simulation-mode.",
        "This was used to test alternate confirmation strategies under various recognition accuracies.",
        "Their methods did require the recording of scripted user utterances, and hence were limited in the variations of user input.",
        "Our specific goals have dealt with creating more cooperative and flexible responses in spoken dialog.",
        "The issues of mismatch between user queries and database contents have been addressed by others in database systems (Gaasterland et al., 1992), while the potential for problems with dead-end dialogs caused by over-constrained queries have also been recognized and tackled in (Qu and Green, 2002)."

        "The use of a simulator has greatly facilitated the development of our dialog system, with the availability of thousands of artificial dialogs.",
        "Even relatively restricted synthetic dialogs have already accelerated development.",
        "In the next phase, real user data collection will be conducted, along with full-scale evaluation.",
        "We plan to compare the efficacy of our language models built from simulated data with those trained from real user data.",
        "Future research will address issues of graceful recovery from recognition error.",
        "We believe that the framework of using simulated dialogs possibly with synthesized speech input augmented with controlled levels of additive noise can be an effective way to develop and evaluate error recovery strategies.",
        "Current methods for simulating dialogs are quite rudimentary.",
        "The text only produces certain variants that have been observed but does not respect corpus statistics, nor, in the case of synthetic speech, do they account for spontaneous speech phenomena.",
        "Improved simulations could use a set of indexed real speech waveforms invoked by the core simulator to create more realistic input.",
        "The main functionalities in the simulator software are now customizable from an external file.",
        "The simulator is domain independent and can be tailored for development of similar spoken dialog systems for browsing and navigating large databases.",
        "However further work is needed to incorporate greater configurability to the dialog flow.",
        "Increased flexibility for customizing the model of the dialog is needed to enable the software to be applied to the development of other kinds of dialog systems."
