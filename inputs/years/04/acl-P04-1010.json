        "Yet few researchers have made use of a large body of human-human telephone calls, on which to form the basis of a data-driven automated system.",
        "The Amitiés project seeks to develop novel technologies for building empirically induced dialogue processors to support multilingual human-computer interaction, and to integrate these technologies into systems for accessing information and services (http://www.dcs.shef.ac.",

        "Sponsored jointly by the European Commission and the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Amitiés Consortium includes partners in both the EU and the US, as well as financial call centers in the UK and France.",
        "A large corpus of recorded, transcribed telephone conversations between real agents and customers gives us a unique opportunity to analyze and incorporate features of human-human dialogues into our automated system.",
        "(Generic names and numbers were substituted for all personal details in the transcriptions.)",
        "This corpus spans two different application areas: software support and (a much smaller size) customer banking.",
        "The banking corpus of several hundred calls has been collected first and it forms the basis of our initial multilingual triaging application, implemented for English, French and German (Hardy et al., 2003a); as well as our prototype automatic financial services system, presented in this paper, which completes a variety of tasks in English.",
        "The much larger software support corpus (10,000 calls in English and French) is still being collected and processed and will be used to develop the next Amitiés prototype.",
        "We observe that for interactions with structured data – whether these data consist of flight information, spare parts, or customer account information – domain knowledge need not be built ahead of time.",
        "Rather, methods for handling the data can arise from the way the data are organized.",
        "Once we know the basic data structures, the transactions, and the protocol to be followed (e.g., establish caller’s identity before exchanging sensitive information); we need only build dialogue models for handling various conversational situations, in order to implement a dialogue system.",
        "For our corpus, we have used a modified DAMSL tag set (Allen and Core, 1997) to capture the functional layer of the dialogues, and a frame-based semantic scheme to record the semantic layer (Hardy et al., 2003b).",
        "The “frames” or transactions in our domain are common customer-service tasks: VerifyId, ChangeAddress, InquireBalance, Lost/StolenCard and Make Payment.",
        "(In this context “task” and “transaction” are synonymous.)",

        "We also utilized utterances from the Amitiés banking corpus (Hardy et al., 2002) in which the customer specifies his/her desired task, as well as utterances which constitute common, domain-independent speech acts such as acceptances, rejections, and indications of non-understanding.",

        "Given an utterance from the user, the NLU unit produces both a list of tokens for detecting dialogue acts, an important research goal inside this project, and a frame with the possible named entities specified by our application.",
        "We are interested particularly in account numbers, credit card numbers, person names, dates, amounts of money, locations, addresses and telephone numbers.",
        "In order to recognize these, we have updated the gazetteer, which works by explicit lookup tables of potential candidates, and modified the rules of the transducer engine, which attempts to match new instances of named entities based on local grammatical context.",
        "There are some significant differences between the kind of prose text more typically associated with information extraction, and the kind of text we are expecting to encounter.",
        "Current models of IE rely heavily on punctuation as well as certain orthographic information, such as capitalized words indicating the presence of a name, company or location.",
        "We have access to neither of these in the output of the ASR engine, and so had to retune our processors to data which reflected that.",
        "In addition, we created new processing resources, such as those required to spot number units and translate them into textual representations of numerical values; for example, to take “twenty thousand one hundred and fourteen pounds”, and produce “£20,114”.",

        "The preliminary evaluation reported here indicates promise for an automated dialogue system such as ours, which incorporates robust techniques for information extraction, record matching, task identification, dialogue act classification, and an overall data-driven strategy.",
        "Task duration and number of turns per dialogue both appear to indicate greater efficiency and corresponding user satisfaction than many other similar systems.",
        "In the DARPA Communicator evaluation, for example, between 60 and 79 calls were made to each of 8 participating sites (Walker, et al., 2001, 2002).",
        "A sample scenario for a domestic round-trip flight contained 8 concepts (airline, departure city, state, date, etc.).",
        "The average duration for such a call was over 300 seconds; whereas our overall average was 104 seconds.",
        "ASR accuracy rates in 2001 were about 60% and 75%, for airline itineraries not completed and completed; and task completion rates were 56%.",
        "Our average number of user words per turn, 6.89, is also higher than that reported for Communicator systems.",
        "This number seems to reflect lengthier responses to open prompts, responses to system requests for multiple attributes, and greater user initiative.",
        "We plan to port the system to a new domain: from telephone banking to information-technology support.",
        "As part of this effort we are again collecting data from real human-human calls.",
        "For advanced speech recognition, we hope to train our ASR on new acoustic data.",
        "We also plan to expand our dialogue act classification so that the system can recognize more types of acts, and to improve our classification reliability."
