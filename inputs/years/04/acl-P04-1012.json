        "The recommendations are realized as three types of explicitness in the system responses.",
        "The system monitors the user’s competence with the help of parameters that describe e.g. the success of the user’s interaction with the system.",

        "Adaptive functionality in spoken dialogue systems is usually geared towards dealing with communication disfluencies and facilitating more natural interaction (e.g. Danieli and Gerbino, 1995; Litman and Pan, 1999; Krahmer et al., 1999; Walker et al., 2000).",
        "In the AthosMail system (Turunen et al., 2004), the focus has been on adaptivity that addresses the user’s expertise levels with respect to a dialogue system’s functionality, and allows adaptation to take place both online and between the sessions.",
        "The main idea is that while novice users need guidance, it would be inefficient and annoying for experienced users to be forced to listen to the same instructions every time they use the system.",
        "For instance, already (Smith, 1993) observed that it is safer for beginners to be closely guided by the",
        "system, while experienced users like to take the initiative which results in more efficient dialogues in terms of decreased average completion time and a decreased average number of utterances.",
        "However, being able to decide when to switch from guiding a novice to facilitating an expert requires the system to be able to keep track of the user's expertise level.",
        "Depending on the system, the migration from one end of the expertise scale to the other may take anything from one session to an extended period of time.",
        "In some systems (e.g. Chu-Carroll, 2000), user inexperience is countered with initiative shifts towards the system, so that in the extreme case, the system leads the user from one task state to the next.",
        "This is a natural direction if the application includes tasks that can be pictured as a sequence of choices, like choosing turns from a road map when navigating towards a particular place.",
        "Examples of such a task structure include travel reservation systems, where the requested information can be given when all the relevant parameters have been collected.",
        "If, on the other hand, the task structure is flat, system initiative may not be very useful, since nothing is gained by leading the user along paths that are only one or two steps long.",
        "Yankelovich (1996) points out that speech applications are like command line interfaces: the available commands and the limitations of the system are not readily visible, which presents an additional burden to the user trying to familiarize herself with the system.",
        "There are essentially four ways the user can learn to use a system: 1) by unaided trial and error, 2) by having a pre-use tutorial, 3) by trying to use the system and then asking for help when in trouble, or 4) by relying on advice the system gives when concluding the user is in trouble.",
        "Kamm, Litman & Walker (1998) experimented with a pre-session tutorial for a spoken dialogue email system and found it efficient in teaching the users what they can do; apparently this approach could be enhanced by adding items 3 and 4.",
        "However, users often lack enthusiasm towards tutorials and want to proceed straight to using the system.",
        "Yankelovich (1996) regards the system prompt design at the heart of the effective interface design which helps users to produce well-formed spoken input and simultaneously to become familiar with the functionality that is available.",
        "She introduced various prompt design techniques, e.g. tapering which means that the system shortens the prompts for users as they gain experience with the system, and incremental prompts, which means that when a prompt is met with silence (or a timeout occurs in a graphical interface), the repeated prompt will be incorporated with helpful hints or instructions.",
        "The system utterances are thus adapted online to mirror the perceived user expertise.",
        "The user model that keeps track of the perceived user expertise may be session-specific, but it could also store the information between sessions, depending on the application.",
        "A call service providing bus timetables may harmlessly assume that the user is always new to the system, but an email system is personal and the user could presumably benefit from personalized adaptations.",
        "If the system stores user modelling information between sessions, there are two paths for adaptation: the adaptations take place between sessions on the basis of observations made during earlier sessions, or the system adapts online and the resulting parameters are then passed from one session to another by means of the user model information storage.",
        "A combination of the two is also possible, and this is the chosen path for AthosMail as disclosed in section 3.",
        "User expertise has long been the subject of user modelling in the related fields of text generation, question answering and tutorial systems.",
        "For example, Paris (1988) describes methods for taking the user's expertise level into account when designing how to tailor descriptions to the novice and expert users.",
        "Although the applications are somewhat different, we expect a fair amount of further inspiration to be forthcoming from this direction also.",
        "In this paper, we describe the AthosMail user expertise model, the Cooperativity Model, and discuss its effect on the system behaviour.",
        "The paper is organised as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we will first briefly introduce the AthosMail functionality which the user needs to familiarise herself with.",
        "Section 3 describes the user expertise model in more detail.",
        "We define the three expertise levels and the concept of DASEX (dialogue act specific explicitness), and present the parameters that are used to calculate the online, session-specific DASEX values as well as offline, between-the-sessions DASEX values.",
        "We also list some of the system responses that correspond to the system's assumptions about the user expertise.",
        "In Section 4, we report on the evaluation of the system’s adaptive responses and user errors.",
        "In Section 5, we provide conclusions and future work."

        "The research goal is to investigate adaptivity in spoken dialogue systems in order to enable users to interact with the speech-based systems in a more flexible and natural way.",
        "The practical goal of AthosMail is to give an option for visually impaired users to check their email by voice commands, and for sighted users to access their email using a mobile phone.",
        "The functionality of the test prototype is rather simple, comprising of three main functions: navigation in the mailbox, reading of messages, and deletion of messages.",
        "For ease of navigation, AthosMail makes use of automatic classification of messages by sender, subject, topic, or other relevant criteria, which is initially chosen by the system.",
        "The classification provides different \"views\" to the mailbox contents, and the user can move from one view to the next, e.g. from Paul's messages to Maria's messages, with commands like \"next\", \"previous\" or \"first view\", and so on.",
        "Within a particular view, the user may navigate from one message to another in a similar fashion, saying \"next\", \"fourth message\" or \"last message\", and so on.",
        "Reading messages is straightforward, the user may say \"read (the message)\", when the message in question has been selected, or refer to another message by saying, for example, \"read the third message\".",
        "Deletion is handled in the same way, with some room for referring expressions.",
        "The user has the option of asking the system to repeat its previous utterance.",
        "The system asks for a confirmation when the user's command entails something that has more potential consequences than just wasting time (by e.g. reading the wrong message), namely, quitting and the deletion of messages.",
        "AthosMail may also ask for clarifications, if the speech recognition is deemed unreliable, but otherwise the user has the initiative.",
        "The purpose of the AthosMail user model is to provide flexibility and variation in the system utterances.",
        "The system monitors the user’s actions in general, and especially on each possible system act.",
        "Since the user may master some part of the system functionality, while not be familiar with all commands, the system can thus provide responses tailored with respect to the user’s familiarity with individual acts.",

        "The user model consists of different subcomponents, such as Message Prioritizing, Message Categorization and User Preference components (Jokinen et al., 2004).",
        "The Cooperativity Model utilizes two parameters, explicitness and dialogue control (i.e. initiative), and the combination of their values then guides utterance generation.",

        "AthosMail uses a three-level user expertise scale to encode varied skill levels of the users.",
        "The common assumption of only two classes, experts and novices, seems too simple a model which does not take into account the fact that the user's expertise level increases gradually, and many users consider themselves neither novices nor experts but something in between.",
        "Moreover, the users may be experienced with the system selectively: they may use some commands more often than others, and thus their skill levels are not uniform across the system functionality.",
        "A more fine-grained description of competence and expertise can also be presented.",
        "For instance, Dreyfus and Dreyfus (1986) in their studies about whether it is possible to build systems that could behave in the way of a human expert, distinguish five levels in skill acquisition: Novice, Advanced beginner, Competent, Proficient, and Expert.",
        "In practical dialogue systems, however, it is difficult to maintain subtle user models, and it is also difficult to define such observable facts that would allow fine-grained competence levels to be distinguished in rather simple application tasks.",
        "We have thus ended up with a compromise, and designed three levels of user expertise in our model: novice, competent, and expert.",
        "These levels are reflected in the system responses, which can vary from explicit to concise utterances depending on how much extra information the system is to give to the user in one go.",
        "As mentioned above, one of the goals of the Cooperativity model is to facilitate more natural interaction by allowing the system to adapt its utterances according to the perceived expertise level.",
        "On the other hand, we also want to validate and assess the usability of the three-level model of user expertise.",
        "While not entering into discussions about the limits of rule-based thinking (e.g. in order to model intuitive decision making of the experts according to the Dreyfus model), we want to study if the designed system responses, adapted according to the assumed user skill levels, can provide useful assistance to the user in interactive situations where she is still uncertain about how to use the system.",
        "Since the user can always ask for help explicitly, our main goal is not to study the decrease in the user's help requests when she becomes more used to the system, but rather, to design the system responses so that they would reflect the different skill levels that the system assumes the user is on, and to get a better understanding whether the expertise levels and their reflection in the system responses is valid or not, so as to provide the best assistance for the user."

        "Most first-order parameters are tuned to spot incoherence between new information and the current user model (see below).",
