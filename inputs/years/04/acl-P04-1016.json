        "Over the past few years, many machine learning methods have been successfully applied to tasks in natural language processing (NLP).",
        "Especially, state-of-the-art performance can be achieved with kernel methods, such as Support Vector Machine (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995).",
        "Examples include text categorization (Joachims, 1998), chunking (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002) and parsing (Collins and Duffy, 2001).",
        "Another feature of this kernel methodology is that it not only provides high accuracy but also allows us to design a kernel function suited to modeling the task at hand.",
        "Since natural language data take the form of sequences of words, and are generally analyzed using discrete structures, such as trees (parsed trees) and graphs (relational graphs), discrete kernels, such as sequence kernels (Lodhi et al., 2002), tree kernels (Collins and Duffy, 2001), and graph kernels (Suzuki et al., 2003a), have been shown to offer excellent results.",
        "These discrete kernels are related to convolution kernels (Haussler, 1999), which provides the concept of kernels over discrete structures.",
        "Convolution kernels allow us to treat structural features without explicitly representing the feature vectors from the input object.",
        "That is, convolution kernels are well suited to NLP tasks in terms of both accuracy and concept.",
        "Unfortunately, experiments have shown that in some cases there is a critical issue with convolution kernels, especially in NLP tasks (Collins and Duffy, 2001; Cancedda et al., 2003; Suzuki et al., 2003b).",
        "That is, the over-fitting problem arises if large “substructures” are used in the kernel calculations.",
        "As a result, the machine learning approach can never be trained efficiently.",
        "To solve this issue, we generally eliminate large substructures from the set of features used.",
        "However, the main reason for using convolution kernels is that we aim to use structural features easily and efficiently.",
        "If use is limited to only very small structures, it negates the advantages of using convolution kernels.",
        "This paper discusses this issue of convolution kernels, and proposes a new method based on statistical feature selection.",
        "The proposed method deals only with those features that are statistically significant for kernel calculation, large significant substructures can be used without over-fitting.",
        "Moreover, the proposed method can be executed efficiently by embedding it in an original kernel calculation process by using substructure mining algorithms.",
        "In the next section, we provide a brief overview of convolution kernels.",
        "Section 3 discusses one issue of convolution kernels, the main topic of this paper, and introduces some conventional methods for solving this issue.",
        "In Section 4, we propose a new approach based on statistical feature selection to offset the issue of convolution kernels using an example consisting of sequence kernels.",
        "In Section 5, we briefly discuss the application of the proposed method to other convolution kernels.",
