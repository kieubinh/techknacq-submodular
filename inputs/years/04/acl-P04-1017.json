        "In recent years, supervised machine learning approaches have been widely explored in reference resolution and achieved considerable success (Ge et al., 1998; Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002; Strube and Muller, 2003; Yang et al., 2003).",
        "Most learning-based pronoun resolution systems determine the reference relationship between an anaphor and its antecedent candidate only from the properties of the pair.",
        "The knowledge about the context of anaphor and antecedent is nevertheless ignored.",
        "However, research in centering theory (Sidner, 1981; Grosz et al., 1983; Grosz et al., 1995; Tetreault, 2001) has revealed that the local focusing (or centering) also has a great effect on the processing of pronominal expressions.",
        "The choices of the antecedents of pronouns usually depend on the center of attention throughout the local discourse segment (Mitkov, 1999).",
        "To determine the salience of a candidate in the local context, we may need to check the coreferential information of the candidate, such as the existence and properties of its antecedents.",
        "In fact, such information has been used for pronoun resolution in many heuristic-based systems.",
        "The S-List model (Strube, 1998), for example, assumes that a co-referring candidate is a hearer-old discourse entity and is preferred to other hearer-new candidates.",
        "In the algorithms based on the centering theory (Brennan et al., 1987; Grosz et al., 1995), if a candidate and its antecedent are the backward-looking centers of two subsequent utterances respectively, the candidate would be the most preferred since the CONTINUE transition is always ranked higher than SHIFT or RETAIN.",
        "In this paper, we present a supervised learning-based pronoun resolution system which incorporates coreferential information of candidates in a trainable model.",
        "For each candidate, we take into consideration the properties of its antecedents in terms of features (henceforth backward features), and use the supervised learning method to explore their influences on pronoun resolution.",
        "In the study, we start our exploration on the capability of the model by applying it in an ideal environment where the antecedents of the candidates are correctly identified and the backward features are optimally set.",
        "The experiments on MUC-6 (1995) and MUC-7 (1998) corpora show that incorporating coreferential information of candidates boosts the system performance significantly.",
        "Further, we apply our model in the real resolution where the antecedents of the candidates are provided by separate noun phrase resolution modules.",
        "The experimental results show that our model still outperforms the baseline, even with the low recall of the non-pronoun resolution module.",

        "In pronoun resolution, the center of attention throughout the discourse segment is a very important factor for antecedent selection (Mitkov, 1999).",
        "If a candidate is the focus (or center) of the local discourse, it would be selected as the antecedent with a high possibility.",
        "See the following example, <s> Gitano1 has pulled off a clever illusion2 with its3 advertising4.",
        "<s> <s> The campaign5 gives its6 clothes a youthful and trendy image to lure consumers into the store.",

        "In the above text, the pronoun “its6” has several antecedent candidates, i.e., “Gitano1”, “a clever illusion2”, “its3”, “its advertising4” and “The campaign5”.",
        "Without looking back, “The campaign5” would be probably selected because of its syntactic role (Subject) and its distance to the anaphor.",
        "However, given the knowledge that the company Gitano is the focus of the local context and “its3” refers to “Gitano1”, it would be clear that the pronoun “its6” should be resolved to “its3” and thus “Gitano1”, rather than other competitors.",
        "To determine whether a candidate is the “focus” entity, we should check how the status (e.g. grammatical functions) of the entity alternates in the local context.",
        "Therefore, it is necessary to track the NPs in the coreferential chain of the candidate.",
        "For example, the syntactic roles (i.e., subject) of the antecedents of “its3” would indicate that “its3” refers to the most salient entity in the discourse segment.",
        "In our study, we keep the properties of the antecedents as features of the candidates, and use the supervised learning method to explore their influence on pronoun resolution.",
        "Actually, to determine the local focus, we only need to check the entities in a short discourse segment.",
        "That is, for a candidate, the number of its adjacent antecedents to be checked is limited.",
        "Therefore, we could evaluate the salience of a candidate by looking back only its closest antecedent instead of each element in its coreferential chain, with the assumption that the closest antecedent is able to provide sufficient information for the evaluation."

        "However, for an entity, the coreferential length only reflects its global salience in the whole text(s), instead of the local salience in a discourse segment which is nevertheless more informative for pronoun resolution.",
        "Moreover, during resolution, the found coreferential length of an entity is often incomplete, and thus the obtained length value is usually inaccurate for the salience evaluation.",
        "In this paper we have proposed a model which incorporates coreferential information of candidates to improve pronoun resolution.",
        "When evaluating a candidate, the model considers its adjacent antecedent by describing its properties in terms of backward features.",
        "We first examined the effectiveness of the model by applying it in an optimal environment where the closest antecedent of a candidate is obtained correctly.",
        "The experiments show that it boosts the success rate of the baseline system for both MUC-6 (4.7%) and MUC-7 (3.5%).",
        "Then we proposed how to apply our model in the real resolution where the antecedent of a non-pronoun is found by an additional non-pronoun resolution module.",
        "Our model can still produce Success improvement (4.7% for MUC-6 and 1.8% for MUC-7) against the baseline system, despite the low recall of the non-pronoun resolution module.",
        "In the current work we restrict our study only to pronoun resolution.",
        "In fact, the coreferential information of candidates is expected to be also helpful for non-pronoun resolution.",
        "We would like to investigate the influence of the coreferential factors on general NP reference resolution in our future work."
