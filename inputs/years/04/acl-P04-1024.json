        "Multilingual processing in the real world often involves dealing with proper names.",
        "Translations of names, however, are often missing in bilingual resources.",
        "This absence adversely affects multilingual applications such as machine translation (MT) or cross language information retrieval (CLIR) for which names are generally good discriminating terms for high IR performance (Lin et al., 2003).",
        "For language pairs with different writing systems, such as Japanese and English, and for which simple string-copying of a name from one language to another is not a solution, researchers have studied techniques for transliteration, i.e., phonetic translation across languages.",
        "For example, European names are often transcribed in Japanese using the syllabic",
        "such as EDICT 1, improves CLIR results.",
        "Transliteration of names between alphabetic and syllabic scripts has also been studied for languages such as Japanese/English (Fujii & Ishikawa, 2001), English/Korean (Jeong et al., 1999), and English/Arabic (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002).",
        "In work closest to ours, Meng et al. (2001), working in cross-language retrieval of phonetically transcribed spoken text, studied how to transliterate names into Chinese phonemes (though not into Chinese characters).",
        "Given a list of identified names, Meng et al.",
        "first separated the names into Chinese names and English names.",
        "Romanized Chinese names were detected by a left-to-right longest match segmentation method, using the Wade-Giles2 and the pinyin syllable inventories in sequence.",
        "If a name could be segmented successfully, then the name was considered a Chinese name.",
        "As their spoken document collection had already been transcribed into pinyin, retrieval was based on pinyin-to-pinyin matching; pinyin to Chinese character conversion was not addressed.",
        "Names other than Chinese names were considered as foreign names and were converted into Chinese phonemes using a language model derived from a list of English-Chinese equivalents, both sides of which were represented in phonetic equivalents.",
        "The above English-to-Japanese or English-to-Chinese transliteration techniques, however, only solve a part of the name translation problem.",
        "In multilingual applications such as CLIR and Machine Translation, all types of names must be translated.",
        "Techniques for name translation from Latin scripts into CJK scripts often depend on the origin of the name.",
        "Some names are not transliterated into a nearly deterministic syllabic script but into ideograms that can be associated with a variety of pronunciations.",
        "For example, Chinese, Korean and Japanese names are usually written using Chinese characters (or kanji) in Japanese, while European names are transcribed using katakana characters, with each character mostly representing one syllable.",
        "In this paper, we describe a method for converting a Japanese name written with a Latin alphabet (or romanji), back into Japanese kanji3.",
        "Transcribing into Japanese kanji is harder than transliteration of a foreign name into syllabic katakana, since one phoneme can correspond to hundreds of possible kanji characters.",
        "For example, the sound “kou” can be mapped to 670 kanji characters.",
        "Our method for back-transliterating Japanese names from English into Japanese consists of the following steps: (1) language identification of the origins of names in order to know what language-specific transliteration approaches to use, (2) generation of possible transliterations using sound and kanji mappings from the Unihan database (to be described in section 3.1) and then transliteration validation through a three-tier filtering process by filtering first through a set of attested bigrams, then through a set of attested terms, and lastly through the Web.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we describe and evaluate our name origin identifier; section 3 presents in detail the steps for back transliterating Japanese names written in Latin script into Japanese kanji representations; section 4 presents the evaluation setup and section 5 discusses the evaluation results; we conclude the paper in section 6."

        "In cross-language applications such as English to Japanese retrieval, dealing with a romaji name that is missing in the bilingual lexicon should involve (1) identifying the origin of the name for selecting the appropriate language-specific mappings, and (2) automatically generating the back-transliterations of the name in the right orthographic representations (e.g., Katakana representations for foreign Latin-origin names or kanji representations for native Japanese names).",
        "To further improve precision and recall, one promising technique is fuzzy matching (Meng et al., 2001) for dealing with phonological transformations in name generation that are not considered in our current approach (e.g., “matsuda” vs “matsuta”).",
        "Lastly, we will explore whether the proposed romanji to kanji back-transliteration approach applies to other types of names such as place names and study the effectiveness of the approach for back-transliterating romanji names of Chinese origin and Korean origin to their respective kanji representations."
