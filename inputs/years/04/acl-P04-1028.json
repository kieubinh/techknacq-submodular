        "Availability of large-scale corpora has made it possible to mine specific knowledge from free or semi-structured text, resulting in what many consider by now a reasonably mature NLP technology.",
        "Extensive research in Information Extraction (IE) techniques, especially with the series of Message Understanding Conferences of the nineties, has focused on tasks such as creating and updating databases of corporate join ventures or terrorist and guerrilla attacks, while the ACQUILEX project used similar methods for creating lexical databases using the highly structured environment of machine-readable dictionary entries and other resources.",
        "Gathering knowledge from unstructured text often requires manually crafting knowledge-engineering rules both complex and deeply dependent of the domain at hand, although some successful experiences using learning algorithms have been reported (Fisher et al., 1995; Chieu et al., 2003).",
        "Although mining specific semantic relations and subcategorization information from free-text has been successfully carried out in the past (Hearst, 1999; Manning, 1993), automatically extracting lexical resources (including terminological definitions) from text in special domains has been a field less explored, but recent experiences (Klavans et al., 2001; Rodríguez, 2001; Cartier, 1998) show that compiling the extensive resources that modern scientific and technical disciplines need in order to manage the explosive growth of their knowledge, is both feasible and practical.",
        "A good example of this NLP-based processing need is the MedLine abstract database maintained by the National Library of Medicine1 (NLM), which incorporates around 40,000 Health Sciences papers each month.",
        "Researchers depend on these electronic resources to keep abreast of their rapidly changing field.",
        "In order to maintain and update vital indexing references such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) resources, the MeSH and SPECIALIST vocabularies, the NLM staff needs to review 400,000 highly-technical papers each year.",
        "Clearly, neology detection, terminological information update and other tasks can benefit from applications that automatically search text for information, e.g., when a new term is introduced or an existing one is modified due to data or theory-driven concerns, or, in general, when new information about sublanguage usage is being put forward.",
        "But the usefulness of robust NLP applications for special-domain text goes beyond glossary updates.",
        "The kind of categorization information implicit in many definitions can help improve anaphora resolution, semantic typing or acronym identification in these corpora, as well as enhance “semantic rerendering” of special-domain ontologies and thesaurii (Pustejovsky et al., 2002).",
        "In this paper we describe and evaluate the MOP2 IE system, implemented to automatically create Metalinguistic Information Databases (MIDs) from large collections of special-domain",
        "research papers.",
        "Section 2 will lay out the theory, methodology and the empirical research grounding the application, while Section 3 will describe the first phase of the MOP tasks: accurate location of good candidate metalinguistic sentences for further processing.",
        "We experimented both with manually coded rules and with learning algorithms for this task.",
        "Section 4 focuses on the problem of identifying and organizing into a useful database structure the different linguistic constituents of the candidate predications, a phase similar to what are known in the IE literature as Named-Entity recognition, Element and Scenario template fill-up tasks.",
        "Finally, Section 5 discusses results and problems of our experiments, as well as future lines of research."

        "Preliminary empirical work to explore how researchers modify the terminological framework of their highly complex conceptual systems, included manual review of a corpus of 19 sociology articles (138,183 words) published in various British, American and Canadian academic journals with strict peer-review policies.",
        "We look at how term manipulation was done as well as how metalinguistic activity was signaled in text, both by lexical and paralinguistic means.",
        "Some of the indicators found included verbs and verbal phrases like called, known as, defined as, termed, coined, dubbed, and descriptors such as term and word.",
        "Other non-lexical markers included quotation marks, apposition and text formatting.",
        "A collection of potential metalinguistic patterns identified in the exploratory Sociology corpus was expanded (using other verbal tenses and forms) to 116 queries sent to the scientific and learned domains of the British National Corpus.",
        "The resulting 10,937 sentences were manually classified as metalinguistic or otherwise, with 5,407 (49.6% of total) found to be truly metalinguistic sentences.",
        "The presence of three components described below (autonym, informative segment and markers/operators) was the criteria for classification.",
        "Reliability of human subjects for this task has not been reported in the literature, and was not evaluated in our experiments.",
        "Careful analysis of this extensive corpus presented some interesting facts about what we have termed “Explicit Metalinguistic Operations” (or EMOs) in specialized discourse: A) EMOs usually do not follow the genus-diferentia scheme of aristotelian definitions, nor conform to the rigid and artificial structure of dictionary entries.",
        "More often than not, specific information about language use and term definition is provided by sentences such as: (1) This means that they ingest oxygen from the air via fine hollow tubes, known as tracheae, in which the term trachea is linked to the description fine hollow tubes in the context of a globally non-metalinguistic sentence.",
        "Partial and heterogeneous information, rather that a complete definition, are much more common.",
        "B) Introduction of metalinguistic information in discourse is highly regular, regardless of the specific domain.",
        "This can be credited to the fact that the writer needs to mark these sentences for special processing by the reader, as they dissect across two different semiotic levels: a metalanguage and its object language, to use the terminology of logic where these concepts originate.3 Its constitutive markedness means that most of the times these sentences will have at least two indicators present, for example a verb and a descriptor, or quotation marks, or even have preceding sentences that announce them in some way.",
        "These formal and cognitive properties of EMOs facilitate the task of locating them accurately in text.",
        "C) EMOs can be further analyzed into 3 distinct components, each with its own properties and linguistic realizations: i) An autonym (see note 3): One or more self-referential lexical items that are the logical or grammatical subject of a predication that needs not be a complete grammatical sentence.",
        "3 At a very basic semiotic level natural language has to be split (at least methodologically) into two distinct systems that share the same rules and elements: a metalanguage, which is a language that is used to talk about another one, and an object language, which in turn can refer to and describe objects in the mind or in the physical world.",
        "The two are isomorphic and this accounts for reflexivity, the property of referring to itself, as when linguistic items are mentioned instead of being used normally in an utterance.",
        "Rey-Debove (1978) and Carnap (1934) call this condition autonymy.",
        "ii) An informative segment: a contribution of relevant information about the meaning, status, coding or interpretation of a linguistic unit.",
        "Informative segments constitute what we state about the autonymical element.",
        "iii) Markers/Operators: Elements used to mark or made prominent whole discourse operation, on account of its non-referential, metalinguistic nature.",
        "They are usually lexical, typographic or pragmatic elements that articulate autonyms and informative segments into a predication.",
        "Thus, in a sentence such as (2), the [autonym] is marked in square brackets, the {informational segment} in curly brackets and the <markeroperators> in angular brackets: (2) {The bit sequences representing quanta of knowledge} <will be called “>[Kenes]<”>, {a neologism intentionally similar to 'genes'}."

        "The 5,400 metalinguistic sentences from our BNC-based test corpus (henceforth, the EMO corpus) reflect an important aspect of scientific sublanguages, and of the scientific enterprise in general.",
        "Whenever scientists and scholars advance the state of the art of a discipline, the language they use has to evolve and change, and this build-up is carried out under metalinguistic control.",
        "Previous knowledge is transformed into new scientific common ground and ontological commitments are introduced and defended when semantic reference is established.",
        "That is why when we want to structure and acquire new knowledge we have to go through a resource-costly cognitive process that integrates, within coherent conceptual structures, a considerable amount of new and very complex lexical items and terms.",
        "It has to be pointed out that non-specialized language is not abundant4 in these kinds of metalinguistic exchanges because (unless in the context of language acquisition) we usually rely on a lexical competence that, although subsequently modified and enhanced, reaches the plateau of a generalized lexicon relatively early in our adult life.",
        "Technical terms can be thought of as semantic anomalies, in the sense that they are ad hoc",
        "4 Our study shows that they represent between 1 and 6% of all sentences across different domains.",
        "constructs strongly bounded to a model, a domain or a context, and are not, by definition, part of the far larger linguistic competence from a first native language.",
        "The information provided by EMOs is not usually inferable from previous one available to the speaker’s community or expert group, and does not depend on general language competence by itself, but nevertheless is judged important and relevant enough to warrant the additional processing effort involved.",
        "Conventional resources like lexicons and dictionaries compile established meaning definitions.",
        "They can be seen as repositories of the default, core lexical information of words or terms used by a community (that is, the information available to an average, idealized speaker).",
        "A Metalinguistic Information Database (MID), on the other hand, compiles the real-time data provided by metalanguage analysis of leading-edge research papers, and can be conceptualized as an anti-dictionary: a listing of exceptions, special contexts and specific usage, of instances where meaning, value or pragmatic conditions have been spotlighted by discourse for cognitive reasons.",
        "The non-default and highly relevant information from MIDs could provide the material for new interpretation rules in reasoning applications, when inferences won’t succeed because the states of the lexico-conceptual system have changed.",
        "When interpreting text, regular lexical information is applied by default under normal conditions, but more specific pragmatic or discursive information can override it if necessary, or if context demands so (Lascari-des & Copestake, 1995).",
        "A neologism or a word in an unexpected technical sense could stump a NLP system that assumes it will be able to use default information from a machine-readable dictionary."

        "When implementingan IE application to mine metalinguistic information from text, the first issue to tackle is how to obtain a reliable set of candidate sentences from free text for input into the next phases of extraction.",
        "From our initial corpus analysis we selected 44 patterns that showed the best reliability for being EMO indicators.",
        "We start our processing5 by tokenizing text, which then is 5 Our implementation is Python-based, using the run through a cascade of finite-state devices based on identification patterns that extract a candidate set for filtering.",
        "Our filtering strategies in effect distinguish between useful results such as (3) from non-metalinguistic instances like (4):",
        "(3) Since the shame that was elicited by the coding procedure was seldom explicitly mentioned by the patient or the therapist, Lewis called it unacknowledged shame.",
        "(4) It was Lewis (1971;1976) who called attention",
        "to emotional elements in what until then had been construed as a perceptual phenomenon .",
        "For this task, we experimented with two strategies: First, we used corpus-based collocations to discard non-metalinguistic instances, for example the presence of attention in sentence (4) next to the marker called.",
        "Since immediate co-text seems important for this classification task, we also implemented learning algorithms that were trained on a subset from our EMO corpus, using as vectors either POS tags or word forms, at 1, 2, and 3 positions adjacent before and after our markers.",
        "These approaches are representative of wider paradigmatic approaches to NLP: symbolic and statistic techniques, each with their own advantages and limitations.",
        "Our evaluations of the MOP system are based on test runs over 3 document sets: a) our original exploratory corpus of sociology research papers [5581 sentences, 243 EMOs]; b) an online histology textbook [5146 sentences, 69 EMOs] ; and c) a small sample from the MedLine abstract database [1403 sentences, 10 EMOs].",
        "Using collocational information, our first approach fared very well, presenting good precision numbers, but not so encouraging recall.",
        "The sociology corpus, for example, gave 0.94 precision (P) and 0.68 recall (R), while the histology one presented 0.9 P and 0.5 R. These low recall numbers reflect the fact that we only selected a subset of the most reliable and common metalinguistic patterns, and our list is not exhaustive.",
        "Example (5) shows one kind of metalinguistic sentence (with a copulative structure) attested in corpora, NLTK toolkit (nltk.sf.net) developed by E. Loper and S. Byrd at the University of Pennsylvania, although we have replaced stochastic POS taggers with an implementation of the Brill algorithm by Hugo Liu at MIT.",
        "Our output files follow XML standards to ensure transparency, portability and accessibility but that the system does not attempt to extract or process: (5) “Intercursive” power , on the other hand , is power in Weber's sense of constraint by an actor or group of actors over others.",
        "In order to better compare our two strategies, we decided to also zoom in on a more limited subset of verb forms for extraction (namely, calls, called, call), which presented ratios of metalinguistic relevance in our MOP corpus, ranging from 100% positives (for the pattern so called + quotation marks) to 77% (called, by itself) to 31% (call).",
        "Restricted to these verbs, our metrics show precision and recall rates of around 0.97, and an overall F-measure of 0.97.6 Of 5581 sentences (96 of which were metalinguistic sentences signaled by our cluster of verbs), 83 were extracted, with 13 (or 15.6% of candidates) filtered-out by collocations.",
        "For our learning experiments (an approach we have called contextual feature language models), we selected two well-known algorithms that showed promise for this classification task.",
        "The naive Bayes (NB) algorithm estimates the conditional probability of a set of features given a label, using the product of the probabilities of the individual features given that label.",
        "The Maximum Entropy model establishes a probability distribution that favors entropy, or uniformity, subject to the constraints encoded in the feature-label correlation.",
        "When training our ME classifiers, Generalized (GISMax) and Improved Iterative Scaling (IIS-Max) algorithms are used to estimate the optimal maximum entropy of a feature set, given a corpus.",
        "1,371 training sentences were converted into labeled vectors, for example using 3 positions and POS tags: ('VB WP NNP', 'calls', 'DT NN NN') /'YES'@[102].",
        "The different number of positions considered to the left and right of the markers in our training corpus, as well as the nature of the features selected (there are many more word-types than POS tags) ensured that our 3-part vector introduced a wide range of features against our 2 possible YES-NO labels for processing by our algorithms.",
        "Although our test runs using only collocations showed initially that structural regulari",
        "ties would perform well, both with our restricted lemma cluster and with our wider set of verbs and markers, our intuitions about improvement with more features (more positions to the right of left of the markers) or a more controlled and grammatically restricted environment (a finite set of surrounding POS tags), turned out to be overly optimistic.",
        "Nevertheless, stochastic approaches that used short range features did perform very well, in line with the hand-coded approach.",
        "The results of the different algorithms, restricted to the lexeme call, are presented in Table 1, while Figures 1 and 2 present best results in the learning experiments for the complete set of patterns used in the collocation approach, over two of our evaluation corpora.",
        "Both Knowledge-Engineering and supervised learning approaches can be adequate for extraction of metalinguistic sentences, although learning algorithms can be helpful when procedural rules have not been compiled; they also allow easier transport of systems to new thematic domains.",
        "We plan further research into stochastic approaches to fine tune them for the task.",
        "One issue that merits special attention is why some of the algorithms and features work well with one corpus, but not so well with another.",
        "This fact is in line with observations in Nigam et al.",
        "(1999) that naive Bayes and Maximum Entropy do not show fundamental baseline superiorities, but are dependent on other factors.",
        "A hybrid approach that combines hand-crafted collocations with classifiers customized to each pattern’s behavior and morpho-syntactic contexts in corpora might offer better results in future experiments.",

        "Next, a predicate processing phase selects the most likely surface realization of informational segments, autonyms and makers-operators, and proceeds to fill the templates in our databases.",

        "As mentioned earlier, informational segments present many realizations that distance them from the clarity, completeness and conciseness of lexicographic entries.",
        "In fact, they may show up as full-fledged clauses (6), as inter or intra-sentential anaphoric elements (7 and 8, the first one a relative clause), supply a categorization descriptor (9), or even (10) restrict themselves semantically to what we could call a sententiallyunrealized “existential variable” (with logical x)form indicating only that certain discourse entity is being introduced.",

        "To better reflect overall performance in all template slots, we introduced a threshold of similarity of 65% for comparison between a golden standard slot entry and the one provided by the application.",
        "Thus, if the autonym or the informational segment is at least 2/3 of the correct response, it is counted as a positive, in many cases leveling the field for the expected errors in the prepositional phrase or acronym-attachment algorithms, but accounting for a (basically) correct selection of superficial sentence segments.",

        "MOP focuses on leading-edge research papers that present the less predictable informational templates of highly technical language.",

        "Taking into account the above-mentioned differences between the two systems’ methods and goals, MOP compares well with the 0.8 Precision and 0.75 Recall of DEFINDER.",
        "While the resulting MOP “definitions” generally do not present high readability or completeness, these informational segments are not meant to be read by laymen, but used by domain lexicographers reviewing existing glossaries for neological change, or, for example, in machine-readable form by applications that attempt automatic categorization for semantic rerendering of an expert ontology, since definitional contexts provide sortal information as a natural part of the process of precisely situating a term or concept against the meaning network of interrelated lexical items.",
        "The Metalinguistic Information Databases in their present form are not, in full justice, lexical knowledge bases comparable with the highly-structured and sophisticated resources that use inheritance and typed features, like LKB (Co-pestake et al., 1993).",
        "MIDs are semi-structured resources (midway between raw corpora and structured lexical bases) that can be further processed to convert them into usable data sources, along the lines suggested by Vossen and Copesta-ke (1993) for the syntactic kernels of lexicographic definitions, or by Pustejovsky et al.",
        "(2002) using corpus analytics to increase the semantic type coverage of the NLM UMLS ontology.",
        "Another interesting possibility is to use a dynamically-updated MID to trace the conceptual and terminological evolution of a discipline.",
        "We believe that low recall rates in our tests are in part due to the fact that we are dealing with the wider realm of metalinguistic information, as opposed to structured definitional sentences that have been distilled by an expert for consumer-oriented documents.",
        "We have opted in favor of exploiting less standardized, non-default metalinguistic information that is being put forward in text because it can’t be assumed to be part of the collective expert-domain competence (Section 2.1).",
        "In doing so, we have exposed our system to the less predictable and highly charged lexical environment of leading-edge research literature, the cauldron where knowledge and terminological systems are forged in real time, and where scientific meaning and interpretation are constantly debated, modified and agreed.",
        "We have not performed major customization of the system (like enriching the tagging lexicon with medical terms), in order to preserve the ability to use the system across different domains.",
        "Domain customization may improve metrics, but at a cost for portability.",
        "The implementation we have described here undoubtedly shows room for improvement in some areas, including: adding other patterns for better overall recall rates, deeper parsing for more accurate semantic typing of sentence arguments, etc.",
        "Also, the issue of which learning algorithms can better perform the initial filtering of EMO candidates is still very much an open question.",
        "Applications that can turn MIDs into truly useful lexical resources by further processing them need to be written.",
        "We plan to continue development of our proof-of-concept system to explore those areas.",
