        "Underspecification is the standard approach to dealing with scope ambiguity (Alshawi and Crouch, 1992; Pinkal, 1996).",
        "The readings of underspecified expressions are represented by compact and concise descriptions, instead of being enumerated explicitly.",
        "Underspecified descriptions are easier to derive in syntax-semantics interfaces (Egg et al., 2001; Copestake et al., 2001), useful in applications such as machine translation (Copestake et al., 1995), and can be resolved by need.",
        "Two important underspecification formalisms in the recent literature are Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) (Copestake et al., 2004) and dominance constraints (Egg et al., 2001).",
        "MRS is the underspecification language which is used in large-scale HPSG grammars, such as the English Resource Grammar (ERG) (Copestake and Flickinger, 2000).",
        "The main advantage of dominance constraints is that they can be solved very efficiently (Althaus et al., 2003; Bodirsky et al., 2004).",
        "Niehren and Thater (2003) defined, in a theoretical paper, a translation from MRS into normal dominance constraints.",
        "This translation clarified the precise relationship between these two related formalisms, and made the powerful meta-theory of dominance constraints accessible to MRS. Their goal was to also make the large grammars for MRS ∗ Supported by the CHORUS project of the SFB 378 of the DFG.",
        "and the efficient constraint solvers for dominance constraints available to the other formalism.",
        "However, Niehren and Thater made three technical assumptions:",
        "1. that EP-conjunction can be resolved in a preprocessing step; 2. that the qeq relation in MRS is simply dominance; 3. and (most importantly) that all linguistically correct and relevant MRS expressions belong to a certain class of constraints called nets.",
        "This means that it is not obvious whether their result can be immediately applied to the output of practical grammars like the ERG.",
        "In this paper, we evaluate the truth of these assumptions on the MRS expressions which the ERG computes for the sentences in the Redwoods Treebank (Oepen et al., 2002).",
        "The main result of our evaluation is that 83% of the Redwoods sentences are indeed nets, and 17% aren’t.",
        "A closer analysis of the non-nets reveals that they seem to be systematically incomplete, i. e. they predict more readings than the sentence actually has.",
        "This supports the claim that all linguistically correct MRS expressions are indeed nets.",
        "We also verify the other two assumptions, one empirically and one by proof.",
        "Our results are practically relevant because dominance constraint solvers are much faster and have more predictable runtimes when solving nets than the LKB solver for MRS (Copestake, 2002), as we also show here.",
        "In addition, nets might be useful as a debugging tool to identify potentially problematic semantic outputs when designing a grammar.",
        "Plan of the Paper.",
        "We first recall the definitions of MRS (§2) and dominance constraints (§3).",
        "We present the translation from MRS-nets to dominance constraints (§4) and prove that it can be extended to MRS-nets with EP-conjunction (§5).",

C2 If h : Qx(h1,h2) and h' : P(..., x ,... ) belong to M, then h outscopes h' in M i. e., binding edges in the graph of M are transitively redundant.",

        "This means that the additional expressivity of proper qeq-constraints is not used in practice, which in turn means that in practice, the translation is sound and correct even for the standard MRS notion of solution, given the constraint is a net."

        "The graph shows that the dominance constraint solver is generally much faster than the LKB solver: The average runtime is less by a factor of 50 for constraints of size 10, and this grows to a factor of 500 for constraints of size 25.",

        "We developed Niehren and Thater’s (2003) theoretical translation into a practical system for translating MRS into dominance constraints, applied it systematically to MRSs produced by English Resource Grammar for the Redwoods treebank, and evaluated the results.",
        "We showed that:",
        "1. most “real life” MRS expressions are MRS-nets, which means that the translation is correct in these cases; 2. for nets, merging is not necessary (or even possible); 3. the practical translation works perfectly for all MRS-nets from the corpus; in particular, the =q relation can be taken as synonymous with dominance in practice.",
        "Because the translation works so well in practice, we were able to compare the runtimes of MRS and dominance constraint solvers on the same inputs.",
        "This evaluation shows that the dominance constraint solver outperforms the MRS solver and displays more predictable runtimes.",
        "A researcher working with MRS can now solve MRS nets using the efficient dominance constraint solvers.",
        "A small but significant number of the MRS constraints derived by the ERG are not nets.",
        "We have argued that these constraints seem to be systematically incomplete, and their correct completions are indeed nets.",
        "A more detailed evaluation is an important task for future research, but if our “net hypothesis” is true, a system that tests whether all outputs of a grammar are nets (or a formal “safety criterion” that would prove this theoretically) could be a useful tool for developing and debugging grammars.",
        "From a more abstract point of view, our evaluation contributes to the fundamental question of what expressive power an underspecification formalism needs.",
        "It turned out that the distinction between qeq",
        "and dominance hardly plays a role in practice.",
        "If the net hypothesis is true, it also follows that merging is not necessary because EP-conjunctions can be converted into ordinary conjunctions.",
        "More research along these lines could help unify different underspecification formalisms and the resources that are available for them.",
        "Acknowledgments We are grateful to Ann Copestake for many fruitful discussions, and to our reviewers for helpful comments."
