        "Sentiment classification is the task of labeling a review document according to the polarity of its prevailing opinion (favorable or unfavorable).",
        "In approaching this problem, a model builder often has three sources of information available: a small collection of labeled documents, a large collection of unlabeled documents, and human understanding of language.",
        "Ideally, a learning method will utilize all three sources.",
        "To accomplish this goal, we generalize an existing procedure that uses the latter two.",
        "We extend this procedure by reinterpreting it as a Naive Bayes model for document sentiment.",
        "Viewed as such, it can also be seen to extract a pair of derived features that are linearly combined to predict sentiment.",
        "This perspective allows us to improve upon previous methods, primarily through two strategies: incorporating additional derived features into the model and, where possible, using labeled data to estimate their relative influence."

        "In March, 2004, the American Association for Artificial Intelligence held a symposium in this area, entitled “Exploring Affect and Attitude in Text.” One task in opinion extraction is to label a review document d according to its prevailing sentiment s E {−1, 1} (unfavorable or favorable).",

        "As a result, estimates for model parameters are subject to a relatively small amount of random variation.",
        "The corresponding drawback to such an approach is that its predictions are not validated on actual documents.",

        "Words that co-occur more frequently with one anchor than the other are themselves taken to be predictive of sentiment.",
        "As a result, information about a pair of words is generalized to many words, and then to documents.",
