        "Word sense disambiguation (WSD) has been a central question in the computational linguistics community since its inception.",
        "WSD is fundamental to natural language understanding and is a useful intermediate step for many other language processing tasks (Ide and Veronis, 1998).",
        "Many recent approaches make use of ideas from statistical machine learning; the availability of shared sense definitions (e.g. WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998)) and recent international competitions (Kilgarrif and Rosenzweig, 2000) have enabled researchers to compare their results.",
        "Supervised approaches which make use of a small hand-labeled training set (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994; Yarowsky, 1993) typically outperform unsupervised approaches (Agirre et al., 2000; Litkowski, 2000; Lin, 2000; Resnik, 1997; Yarowsky, 1992; Yarowsky, 1995), but tend to be tuned to a specific corpus and are constrained by scarcity of labeled data.",
        "In an effort to overcome the difficulty of finding sense-labeled training data, researchers have begun investigating unsupervised approaches to word-sense disambiguation.",
        "For example, the use of parallel corpora for sense tagging can help with word sense disambiguation (Brown et al., 1991; Dagan, 1991; Dagan and Itai, 1994; Ide, 2000; Resnik and Yarowsky, 1999).",
        "As an illustration of sense disambiguation from translation data, when the English word bank is translated to Spanish as orilla, it is clear that we are referring to the shore sense of bank, rather than the financial institution sense.",
        "The main inspiration for our work is Diab and Resnik (2002), who use translations and linguistic knowledge for disambiguation and automatic sense tagging.",
        "Bengio and Kermorvant (2003) present a graphical model that is an attempt to formalize probabilistically the main ideas in Diab and Resnik (2002).",
        "They assume the same semantic hierarchy (in particular, WordNet) for both the languages and assign English words as well as their translations to WordNet synsets.",
        "Here we present two variants of the graphical model in Bengio and Kermorvant (2003), along with a method to discover a cluster structure for the Spanish senses.",
        "We also present empirical word sense disambiguation results which demonstrate the gain brought by this probabilistic approach, even while only using the translated word to provide disambiguation information.",
        "Our first generative model, the Sense Model, groups semantically related words from the two languages into senses, and translations are generated by probabilistically choosing a sense and then words from the sense.",
        "We show that this improves on the results of Diab and Resnik (2002).",
        "Our next model, which we call the Concept Model, aims to improve on the above sense structure by modeling the senses of the two languages separately and relating senses from both languages through a higher-level, semantically less precise concept.",
        "The intuition here is that not all of the senses that are possible for a word will be relevant for a concept.",
        "In other words, the distribution over the senses of a word given a concept can be expected to have a lower entropy than the distribution over the senses of the word in the language as a whole.",
        "In this paper, we look at translation data as a resource for identification of semantic concepts.",
        "Note that actual translated word pairs are not always good matches semantically, because the translation process is not on a word by word basis.",
        "This introduces a kind of noise in the translation, and an additional hidden variable to represent the shared meaning helps to take it into account.",
        "Improved performance over the Sense Model validates the use of concepts in modeling translations.",
        "An interesting by-product of the Concept Model is a semantic structure for the secondary language.",
        "This is automatically constructed using background knowledge of the structure for the primary language and the observed translation pairs.",
        "In the model, words sharing the same sense are synonyms while senses under the same concept are semantically related in the corpus.",
        "An investigation of the model trained over real data reveals that it can indeed group related words together.",
        "It may be noted that predicting senses from translations need not necessarily be an end result in itself.",
        "As we have already mentioned, lack of labeled data is a severe hindrance for supervised approaches to word sense disambiguation.",
        "At the same time, there is an abundance of bilingual documents and many more can potentially be mined from the web.",
        "It should be possible using our approach to (noisily) assign sense tags to words in such documents, thus providing huge resources of labeled data for supervised approaches to make use of.",
        "For the rest of this paper, for simplicity we will refer to the primary language of the parallel document as English and to the secondary as Spanish.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "We begin by formally describing the models in Section 2.",
        "We describe our approach for constructing the senses and concepts in Section 3.",
        "Our algorithm for learning the model parameters is described in Section 4.",

        "We motivate the use of a probabilistic model by illustrating that disambiguation using translations is possible even when a word has a unique translation.",

        "It has a single translation in our corpus, that being prevenci´on.",

        "In our example, since <bar, obstrucci´on> can be generated only through concept c20, P(te11c20) is the only English sense conditional boosted by it.",
        "<prevention, prevenci´on> is generated through a different concept c6118, where the higher conditional P (prevention I tee) gradually strengthens one of the possible instantiations for it, and the other one becomes increasingly unlikely as the iterations progress.",
        "The inference is that only one sense of prevention is possible in the context of the parallel corpus.",
        "The key factor in this disambiguation was that two senses of prevention separated out in two different concepts.",
        "The other significant difference between the models is in the constraints on the parameters and the effect that they have on sense disambiguation.",
        "In the Sense Model, Et P(t) = 1, while in the Concept Model, Et.",
        "E, P(tel c) = 1 separately for each concept c. Now for two relevant senses for an English word, a slight difference in their priors will tend to get ironed out when normalized over the en",
        "tire set of senses for the corpus.",
        "In contrast, if these two senses belong to the same concept in the Concept Model, the difference in the sense conditionals will be highlighted since the normalization occurs over a very small set of senses – the senses for only that concept, which in the best possible scenario will contain only the two contending senses, as in concept c118 of our example.",
        "As can be seen from Table 1, the Concept Model not only outperforms the Sense Model, it does so with significantly fewer parameters.",
        "This may be counter-intuitive since Concept Model involves an extra concept variable.",
        "However, the dissociation of Spanish and English senses can significantly reduce the parameter space.",
        "Imagine two Spanish words that are associated with ten English senses and accordingly each of them has a probability for belonging to each of these ten senses.",
        "Aided with a concept variable, it is possible to model the same relationship by creating a separate Spanish sense that contains these two words and relating this Spanish sense with the ten English senses through a concept variable.",
        "Thus these words now need to belong to only one sense as opposed to ten.",
        "Of course, now there are new transition probabilities for each of the eleven senses from the new concept node.",
        "The exact reduction in the parameter space will depend on the frequent subsets discovered for the sMaps of the Spanish words.",
        "Longer and more frequent subsets will lead to larger reductions.",
        "It must also be borne in mind that this reduction comes with the independence assumptions made in the Concept Model."
