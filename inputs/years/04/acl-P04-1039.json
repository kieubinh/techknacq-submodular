        "Indeed, one of the main goals of the SENSEVAL exercises is to create large amounts of sense-annotated data for supervised systems (Kilgarriff&Rosenzweig, 2000).",
        "The problem is even more challenging for languages which possess scarce computer readable knowledge resources.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the role of large amounts of noisily sense annotated data obtained using an unsupervised approach in relieving the data acquisition bottleneck for the WSD task.",
        "We bootstrap a supervised learning WSD system with an unsupervised seed set.",
        "We use the sense annotated data produced by Diab’s unsupervised system SALAAM (Diab&Resnik, 2002; Diab, 2003).",
        "SALAAM is a WSD system that exploits parallel corpora for sense disambiguation of words in running text.",
        "To date, SALAAM yields the best scores for an unsupervised system on the SENSEVAL2 English All-Words task (Diab, 2003).",
        "SALAAM is an appealing approach as it provides automatically sense annotated data in two languages simultaneously, thereby providing a multilingual framework for solving the data acquisition problem.",
        "For instance, SALAAM has been used to bootstrap the WSD process for Arabic as illustrated in (Diab, 2004).",
        "In a supervised learning setting, WSD is cast as a classification problem, where a predefined set of sense tags constitutes the classes.",
        "The ambiguous words in text are assigned one or more of these classes by a machine learning algorithm based on some extracted features.",
        "This algorithm learns parameters from explicit associations between the class and the features, or combination of features, that characterize it.",
        "Therefore, such systems are very sensitive to the training data, and those data are, generally, assumed to be as clean as possible.",
        "In this paper, we question that assumption.",
        "Can large amounts of noisily annotated data used in training be useful within such a learning paradigm for WSD?",

        "A situation of sense context confusability (SCC) arises when two senses of a noun are very similar and are highly uniformly represented in the training examples.",
        "This is an artifact of the fine granularity of senses in WordNet 1.7pre.",
        "Highly similar senses typically lead to similar usages, therefore similar contexts, which in a learning framework detract from the learning algorithm’s discriminatory power.",
        "Upon examining the 29 polysemous nouns in the training and test sets, we observe that a significant number of the words have similar senses according to a manual grouping provided by Palmer, in 2002.9 For example, senses 2 and 3 of nature, meaning trait and quality, respectively, are considered similar by the manual grouping.",
        "The manual grouping does not provide total coverage of all the noun senses in this test set.",
        "For instance, it only considers the homonymic senses 1, 2 and 3 of spade, yet, in the current test set, spade has 6 senses, due to the existence of sub senses.",
        "26 of the 29 test items exhibit multiple groupings based on the manual grouping.",
        "Only three nouns, detention, dyke, spade do not have any sense groupings.",
        "They all, in turn, achieve high PR scores of 1.0.",
        "There are several nouns that have relatively high SDC values yet their performance ratios are low such as post, nation, channel and circuit.",
        "For instance, nation has a very high SDC value of 0.962, a low sense perplexity of 1.3 – relatively close to the 1.6 sense perplexity of the test data – a sufficient number of contexts (4350), yet it yields a PR of 0.59.",
        "According to the manual sense grouping, senses 1 and 3 are similar, and indeed, upon inspection of the context distributions, we find the bulk of the senses’ instance examples in the SALAAM-tagged training data for the condition that yields this PR in UMSST _5,,,,a,, are annotated with either sense 1 or sense 3, thereby creating confusable contexts for the learning algorithm.",
        "All the cases of nouns that achieve high PR and possess sense groups do not have any SCC in the training data which strongly suggests that SCC is an important factor to consider when predicting the PR of a system."

        "We conclude from the above exploration that SDC and SCC affect PR scores directly.",
        "PerpDiff, STE, and Sense Perplexity, number of senses and number of contexts seem to have no noticeable direct impact on the PR.",
        "Based on this observation, we calculate the SDC values for all the training data used in our experimental conditions for the 29 test items.",
        "Table 3 illustrates the items with the highest SDC values, in descending order, as yielded from any of the SALAAM conditions.",
        "We use an empirical cut-off value of 0.75 for SDC.",
        "The SCC values are reported as a boolean Y/N value, where a Y indicates the presence of a sense confusable context.",
        "As shown a high SDC can serve as a means of auto",
        "matically predicting a high PR, but it is not sufficient.",
        "If we eliminate the items where an SCC exists, namely, mouth, post, and authority, we are still left with nation and circuit, where both yield very low PR scores.",
        "nation has the desirable low PerpDiff of 0.22.",
        "The sense annotation tagging precision of the SV2✂S_T✠ in this condition which yields the highest SDC – Spanish UN data with the SV2✂S_T✠ for training – is a low 30.4✆ and a low STE value of 0.129.",
        "This is due to the fact that both French and Spanish preserve ambiguity in similar ways to English which does not make it a good target word for disambiguation within the SALAAM framework, given these two languages as sources of evidence.",
        "Accordingly, in this case, STE coupled with the noisy tagging could have resulted in the low PR.",
        "However, for circuit, the STE value for its respective condition is a high 0.291, but we observe a relatively high PerpDiff of 1.53 compared to the PerpDiff of 0 for the manually annotated data.",
        "Therefore, a combination of high SDC and nonexistent SCC can reliably predict good PR.",
        "But the other factors still have a role to play in order to achieve accurate prediction.",
        "It is worth emphasizing that two of the identified factors are dependent on the test data in this study, SDC and PerpDiff.",
        "One solution to this problem is to estimate SDC and PerpDiff using a held out data set that is hand tagged.",
        "Such a held out data set would be considerably smaller than the required size of a manually tagged training data for a classical supervised WSD system.",
        "Hence, SALAAM-tagged training data offers a viable solution to the annotation acquisition bottleneck."

        "Moreover, it yields superior results to those obtained by the only comparable bootstrapping approach when tested on the same data set.",
