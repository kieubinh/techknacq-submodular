        "We describe a method to automatically enrich the output of parsers with information that is present in existing treebanks but usually not produced by the parsers themselves.",
        "Our motivation is twofold.",
        "First and most important, for applications requiring information extraction or semantic interpretation of text, it is desirable to have parsers produce grammatically and semantically rich output.",
        "Second, to facilitate dependency-based comparison and evaluation of different parsers, their outputs may need to be transformed into specific rich dependency formalisms.",
        "The method allows us to automatically transform the output of a parser into structures as they are annotated in a dependency treebank.",
        "For a phrase structure parser, we first convert the produced phrase structures into dependency graphs in a straightforward way, and then apply a sequence of graph transformations: changing dependency labels, adding new nodes, and adding new dependencies.",
        "A memory-based learner trained on a dependency corpus is used to detect which modifications should be performed.",
        "For a dependency corpus derived from the Penn Treebank and the parsers we considered, these transformations correspond to adding Penn functional tags (e.g., -SBJ, -TMP, -LOC), empty nodes (e.g., NP PRO) and non-local dependencies (controlled traces, WH-extraction, etc.).",
        "For these specific subtasks our method achieves state of the art performance.",
        "The evaluation of the transformed output of the parsers of Charniak (2000) and Collins (1999) gives 90% unlabelled and 84% labelled accuracy with respect to dependencies, when measured against a dependency corpus derived from the Penn Treebank.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "After providing some background and motivation in Section 2, we give the general overview of our method in Section 3.",
        "In Sections 4 through 8, we describe all stages of the transformation process, providing evaluation results and comparing our methods to earlier work.",
        "We discuss the results in Section 9."

        "State of the art statistical parsers, e.g., parsers trained on the Penn Treebank, produce syntactic parse trees with bare phrase labels, such as NP, PP, S, although the training corpora are usually much richer and often contain additional grammatical and semantic information (distinguishing various modifiers, complements, subjects, objects, etc.",
        "), including non-local dependencies, i.e., relations between phrases not adjacent in the parse tree.",
        "While this information may be explicitly annotated in a treebank, it is rarely used or delivered by parsers.",
        "The reason is that bringing in more information of this type usually makes the underlying parsing model more complicated: more parameters need to be estimated and independence assumptions may no longer hold.",
        "Klein and Manning (2003), for example, mention that using functional tags of the Penn Treebank (temporal, location, subject, predicate, etc.)",
        "with a simple unlexicalized PCFG generally had a negative effect on the parser’s performance.",
        "Currently, there are no parsers trained on the Penn Treebank that use the structure of the treebank in full and that are thus",
        "capable of producing syntactic structures containing all or nearly all of the information annotated in the corpus.",

        "In this section we give a high-level overview of our method for transforming a parser’s output and describe the different steps of the process.",
        "In the experiments we used the parsers described in (Charniak, 2000) and (Collins, 1999).",
        "For Collins’ parser the text was first POS-tagged using Ratnaparkhi’s maximum enthropy tagger.",
        "The training phase of the method consists in learning which transformations need to be applied to the output of a parser to make it as similar to the treebank data as possible.",
        "As a preliminary step (Step 0), we convert the WSJ2 to a dependency corpus without losing the annotated information (functional tags, empty nodes, non-local dependencies).",
        "The same conversion is applied to the output of the parsers we consider.",
        "The details of the conversion process are described in Section 4 below.",
        "The training then proceeds by comparing graphs derived from a parser’s output with the graphs from the dependency corpus, detecting various mismatches, such as incorrect arc labels and missing nodes or arcs.",
        "Then the following steps are taken to fix the mismatches:",
        "Obviously, other modifications are possible, such as deleting arcs or moving arcs from one node to another.",
        "We leave these for future work, though, and focus on the three transformations mentioned above.",
        "The dependency corpus was split into training (WSJ sections 02–21), development (sections 00–",
        "01) and test (section 23) corpora.",
        "For each of the steps 1, 2 and 3 we proceed as follows: 1. compare the training corpus to the output of the parser on the strings of the corpus, after applying the transformations of the previous steps 2. identify possible beneficial transformations (which arc labels need to be changed or where new nodes or arcs need to be added) 3. train a memory-based classifier to predict possible transformations given their context (i.e., information about the local structure of the dependency graph around possible application sites).",
        "While the definitions of the context and application site and the graph modifications are different for the three steps, the general structure of the method remains the same at each stage.",
        "Sections 6, 7 and 8 describe the steps in detail.",
        "In the application phase of the method, we proceed similarly.",
        "First, the output of the parser is converted to dependency graphs, and then the learners trained during the steps 1, 2 and 3 are applied in sequence to perform the graph transformations.",
        "Apart from the conversion from phrase structures to dependency graphs and the extraction of some linguistic features for the learning, our method does not use any information about the details of the treebank annotation or the parser’s output: it works with arbitrary labelled directed graphs."

        "First, for the treebank data, all traces are resolved and corresponding empty nodes are replaced with links to target constituents, so that syntactic trees become directed acyclic graphs.",
        "Second, for each constituent we detect its head daughters (more than one in the case of conjunction) and identify lexical heads.",
        "Then, for each constituent we output new dependencies between its lexical head and the lexical heads of its non-head daughters.",

        "The interpretation of the dependency labels is straightforward: e.g., the label SINP-TMP corresponds to a sentence (S) being modified by a temporal noun phrase (NP-TMP).",
        "The core of the conversion routine is the selection of head daughters of the constituents.",
        "Following (Collins, 1999), we used a head table, but extended it with a set of additional rules, based on constituent labels, POS tags or, sometimes actual words, to account for situations where the head table alone gave unsatisfactory results.",
        "The most notable extension is our handling of conjunctions, which are often left relatively flat in WSJ and, as a result, in a parser’s output: we used simple pattern-based heuristics to detect conjuncts and mark all conjuncts as heads of a conjunction.",
        "After the conversion, every resulting dependency structure is modified deterministically:",
        "• auxiliary verbs (be, do, have) become dependents of corresponding main verbs (similar to modal verbs, which are handled by the head table); • to fix a WSJ inconsistency, we move the -LGS tag (indicating logical subject of passive in a by-phrase) from the PP to its child NP."

        "Developing such heuristics would be a very time consuming and ad hoc process: e.g., Collins’ A and g tags may give useful clues for this labelling, but they are not available in the output of other parsers.",
        "As an alternative to hard-coded heuristics, Blaheta and Charniak (2000) proposed to recover the Penn functional tags automatically.",
        "On the Penn Treebank, they trained a statistical model that, given a constituent in a parsed sentence and its context (parent, grandparent, head words thereof etc.",
        "), predicted the functional label, possibly empty.",

        "In total, around 30% of all the parser’s dependencies had different labels in the treebank.",

        "When included in feature vectors, all dependency labels were split at ‘I’, e.g., the label S�NP-A resulted in two features: S and NP-A.",
        "Testing was done as follows.",
        "The test corpus (section 23) was also parsed, and for each dependency a feature vector was formed and given to TiMBL to correct the dependency label.",

        "The 1% improvement for evaluation on bare labels suggests that our approach is capable not only of adding functional tags, but can also correct the parser’s phrase labels and part-of-speech tags: for Collins’ parser the most frequent correct changes not involving functional labels were NPINN--�NPIJJ and NPIJJ--�NPIVBN, fixing POS tagging errors.",
        "A very substantial increase of the labelled score (from 66% to 81%), which is only 6% lower than unlabelled score, clearly indicates that, although the parsers do not produce functional labels, this information is to a large extent implicitly present in trees and can be recovered."

        "For traces, this corresponds to the evaluation using the head-based antecedent representation described in (Johnson, 2002), and for empty nodes without antecedents (e.g., NP PRO) this is the measure used in Section 7.1.",
        "To make the results comparable to other methods, we strip functional tags from the dependency labels before label comparison.",
        "Below are the overall precision, recall, and f-score for our method and the scores reported in (Dienes and Dubey, 2003) for antecedent recovery using Collins’ parser.",
        "Interestingly, the overall performance of our post-processing method is very similar to that of the pre and in-processing methods of Dienes and Dubey (2003).",
        "Hence, for most cases, traces and empty nodes can be reliably identified using only local information provided by a parser, using the parser itself as a black box.",
        "This is important, since making parsers aware of non-local relations need not improve the overall performance: Dienes and Dubey (2003) report a decrease in PARSEVAL f-score from 88.2% to 86.4% after modifying Collins’ parser to resolve traces internally, although this allowed them to achieve high accuracy for traces."

        "The experiments described in the previous sections indicate that although statistical parsers do not explicitly output some information available in the corpus they were trained on (grammatical and semantic tags, empty nodes, non-local dependencies), this information can be recovered with reasonably high accuracy, using pattern matching and machine learning methods.",
        "For our task, using dependency structures rather than phrase trees has several advantages.",
        "First, after converting both the treebank trees and parsers’ outputs to graphs with head–modifier relations, our method needs very little information about the linguistic nature of the data, and thus is largely corpus-and parser-independent.",
        "Indeed, after the conversion, the only linguistically informed operation is the straightforward extraction of features indicating the presence of subject and object dependents, and finiteness of verb groups.",
        "Second, using a dependency formalism facilitates a very straightforward evaluation of the systems that produce structures more complex than trees.",
        "It is not clear whether the PARSEVAL evaluation can be easily extended to take non-local relations into account (see (Johnson, 2002) for examples of such extension).",
        "Finally, the independence from the details of the parser and the corpus suggests that our method can be applied to systems based on other formalisms, e.g., (Hockenmaier, 2003), to allow a meaningful dependency-based comparison of very different parsers.",
        "Furthermore, with the fine-grained set of dependency labels that our system provides, it is possible to map the resulting structures to other dependency formalisms, either automatically in case annotated corpora exist, or with a manually developed set of rules.",
        "Our preliminary experiments with Collins’ parser and the corpus annotated with grammatical relations (Carroll et al., 2003) are promising: the system achieves 76% precision/recall f-score, after the parser’s output is enriched with our method and transformed to grammatical relations using a set of 40 simple rules.",
        "This is very close to the performance reported by Carroll et al.",
        "(2003) for the parser specifically designed for the extraction of grammatical relations.",
        "Despite the high-dimensional feature spaces, the large number of lexical features, and the lack of independence between features, we achieved high accuracy using a memory-based learner.",
        "TiMBL performed well on tasks where structured, more complicated and task-specific statistical models have been used previously (Blaheta and Charniak, 2000).",
        "For all subtasks we used the same settings for TiMBL: simple feature overlap measure, 5 nearest neighbours with majority voting.",
        "During further experiments with our method on different corpora, we found that quite different settings led to a better performance.",
        "It is clear that more careful and systematic parameter tuning and the analysis of the contribution of different features have to be addressed.",
        "Finally, our method is not restricted to syntactic structures.",
        "It has been successfully applied to the identification of semantic relations (Ahn et al., 2004), using FrameNet as the training corpus.",
        "For this task, we viewed semantic relations (e.g., Speaker, Topic, Addressee) as dependencies between a predicate and its arguments.",
        "Adding such semantic relations to syntactic dependency graphs was simply an additional graph transformation step."

        "We presented a method to automatically enrich the output of a parser with information that is not provided by the parser itself, but is available in a treebank.",
        "Using the method with two state of the art statistical parsers and the Penn Treebank allowed us to recover functional tags (grammatical and semantic), empty nodes and traces.",
        "Thus, we are able to provide virtually all information available in the corpus, without modifying the parser, viewing it, indeed, as a black box.",
        "Our method allows us to perform a meaningful dependency-based comparison of phrase structure parsers.",
        "The evaluation on a dependency corpus derived from the Penn Treebank showed that, after our post-processing, two state of the art statistical parsers achieve 84% accuracy on a fine-grained set of dependency labels.",
        "Finally, our method for enriching the output of a parser is, to a large extent, independent of a specific parser and corpus, and can be used with other syntactic and semantic resources."
