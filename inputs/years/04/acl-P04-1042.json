        "While parsers are been used for other purposes, the primary motivation for syntactic parsing is as an aid to semantic interpretation, in pursuit of broader goals of natural language understanding.",
        "Proponents of traditional ‘deep’ or ‘precise’ approaches to syntax, such as GB, CCG, HPSG, LFG, or TAG, have argued that sophisticated grammatical formalisms are essential to resolving various hidden relationships such as the source phrase of moved whphrases in questions and relativizations, or the controller of clauses without an overt subject.",
        "Knowledge of these hidden relationships is in turn essential to semantic interpretation of the kind practiced in the semantic parsing (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002) and QA (Paşca and Harabagiu, 2001) literatures.",
        "However, work in statistical parsing has for the most part put these needs aside, being content to recover surface context-free (CF) phrase structure trees.",
        "This perhaps reflects the fact that context-free phrase structure grammar (CFG) is in some sense at the the heart of the majority of both formal and computational syntactic research.",
        "Although, upon introducing it, Chomsky (1956) rejected CFG as an adequate framework for natural language description, the majority of work in the last half century has used context-free structural descriptions and related methodologies in one form or another as an important component of syntactic analysis.",
        "CFGs seem adequate to weakly generate almost all common natural language structures, and also facilitate a transparent predicate-argument and/or semantic interpretation for the more basic ones (Gazdar et al., 1985).",
        "Nevertheless, despite their success in providing surface phrase structure analyses, if statistical parsers and the representations they produce do not provide a useful stepping stone to recovering the hidden relationships, they will ultimately come to be seen as a dead end, and work will necessarily return to using richer formalisms.",
        "In this paper we attempt to establish to what degree current statistical parsers are a useful step in analysis by examining the performance of further statistical classifiers on non-local dependency recovery from CF parse trees.",
        "The natural isomorphism from CF trees to dependency trees induces only local dependencies, derived from the head-sister relation in a CF local tree.",
        "However, if the output of a context-free parser can be algorithmically augmented to accurately identify and incorporate nonlocal dependencies, then we can say that the context-free parsing model is a safe approximation to the true task of dependency reconstruction.",
        "We investigate the safeness of this approximation, devising an algorithm to reconstruct non-local dependencies from context-free parse trees using loglinear classifiers, tested on treebanks of not only English but also German, a language with much freer word order and correspondingly more discontinuity than English.",
        "This algorithm can be used as an intermediate step between the surface output trees of modern statistical parsers and semantic interpretation systems for a variety of tasks.1"

        "Traditional LFG parsing, in both non-stochastic (Kaplan and Maxwell, 1993) and stochastic (Riezler et al., 2002; Kaplan et al., 2004) incarnations, also divides the labor of local and nonlocal dependency identification into two phases, starting with context-free parses and continuing by augmentation with functional information."

        "Consistent with prior work and with common practice in statistical parsing, we stripped categories of all functional tags prior to training and testing (though in several cases this seems to have been a limiting move; see Section 5).",

        "However, the distribution includes a context-free version produced algorithmically by recursively remapping discontinuous parts of nodes upward into higher phrases and marking their sites of origin .3 The resulting “traces” correspond roughly to a subclass of the second class of Penn Treebank empties discussed above, and include wh- movement, topicalization, right extrapositions from NP, expletives, and scrambling of sub",

        "Corresponding to the three types of empty-element annotation found in the Penn Treebank, our algorithm divides the process of CF tree enhancement into three phases.",
        "Each phase involves the identification of a certain subset of tree nodes to be operated on, followed by the application of the appropriate operation to the node.",
        "Operations may involve the insertion of a category at some position among a node’s daughters; the marking of certain nodes as dislocated; or the relocation of dislocated nodes to other positions within the tree.",
        "The content and ordering of phases is consistent with the syntactic theory upon which treebank annotation is based.",
        "For example, WSJ annotates relative clauses lacking overt relative pronouns, such as the SBAR in Figure 1, with a trace in the relativization site whose antecedent is an empty relative pronoun.",
        "This requires that empty relative pronoun insertion precede dislocated element identification.",
        "Likewise, dislocated elements can serve as controllers of control loci, based on their originating site, so it is sensible to return dislocated nodes to their originating sites before identifying control loci and their controllers.",
        "For WSJ, the three phases are:",
        "1.",
        "(a) Determine nodes at which to insert null COMPlementizers4 (IDENTNULL) (b) For each COMP insertion node, determine position of each insertion and insert COMP (INSERTNULL) 2.",
        "(a) Classify each tree node as +/- DISLOCATED (IDENTMOVED) (b) For each DISLOCATED node, choose an ORIGIN node (RELOCMOVED) (c) For each pair (DISLOCATED,origin), choose a position of insertion and insert dislocated (INSERTRELOC) 3.",
        "(a) Classify each node as +/- control LOCUS (IDENTLOCUS) (b) For each LOCUS, determine position of insertion and insert LOCUS (INSERTLOCUS) (c) For each LOCUS, determine CONTROLLER (if any) (FINDCONTROLLER)",
        "Note in particular that phase 2 involves the classification of overt tree nodes as dislocated, followed by the identification of an origin site (annotated in the treebank as an empty node) for each dislocated element; whereas phase 3 involves the identification of (empty) control loci first, and of controllers later.",
        "This approach contrasts with Johnson (2002), who treats empty/antecedent identification as a joint task, and with Dienes and Dubey (2003a,b), who always identify empties first and determine antecedents later.",
        "Our motivation is that it should generally be easier to determine whether an overt element is dislocated than whether a given position is the origin of some yet unknown dislocated element (particularly in the absence of a sophisticated model of argument expression); but control loci are highly predictable from local context, such as the subjectless non-finite S in Figure 1’s S-2.5 Indeed this difference seems to be implicit in the nonlocal feature templates used by Dienes and Dubey (2003a,b) in their empty element tagger, in particular lookback for wh- words preceding a candidate verb.",

        "The WSJ results shown in Tables 2 and 3 suggest that discriminative models incorporating both nonlocal and local lexical and syntactic information can achieve good results on the task of non-local dependency identification.",
        "On the PARSEVAL metric, our algorithm performed particularly well on null complementizer and control locus insertion, and on S node relocation.",
        "In particular, Johnson noted that the proper insertion of control loci was a difficult issue involving lexical as well as structural sensitivity.",
        "We found the loglinear paradigm a good one in which to model this feature combination; when run in isolation on gold-standard development trees, our model reached 96.4% F 1 on control locus insertion, reducing error over the Johnson model’s 89.3%",
        "by nearly two-thirds.",
        "The performance of our algorithm is also evident in the substantial contribution to typed dependency accuracy seen in Table 3.",
        "For gold-standard input trees, our algorithm reduces error by over 80% from the surface-dependency baseline, and over 60% compared with Johnson’s results.",
        "For parsed input trees, our algorithm reduces dependency error by 23% over the baseline, and by 5% compared with Johnson’s results.",
        "Note that the dependency figures of Dienes lag behind even the parsed results for Johnson’s model; this may well be due to the fact that Dienes built his model as an extension of Collins (1999), which lags behind Charniak (2000) by about 1.3-1.5%.",
        "Manual investigation of errors on English gold-standard data revealed two major issues that suggest further potential for improvement in performance without further increase in algorithmic complexity or training set size.",
        "First, we noted that annotation inconsistency accounted for a large number of errors, particularly false positives.",
        "VPs from which an S has been extracted ([SShut up,] he [VP said t]) are inconsistently given an empty SBAR daughter, suggesting the cross-model low-70’s performance on null SBAR insertion models (see Table 2) may be a ceiling.",
        "Control loci were often under-annotated; the first five development-set false positive control loci we checked were all due to annotation error.",
        "And why-WHADVPs under SBAR, which are always dislocations, were not so annotated 20% of the time.",
        "Second, both control locus insertion and dislocated NP remapping must be sensitive to the presence of argument NPs under classified nodes.",
        "But temporal NPs, indistinguishable by gross category, also appear under such nodes, creating a major confound.",
        "We used customized features to compensate to some extent, but temporal annotation already exists in WSJ and could be used.",
        "We note that Klein and Manning (2003) independently found retention of temporal NP marking useful for PCFG parsing.",
        "As can be seen in Table 3, the absolute improvement in dependency recovery is smaller for both our and Johnson’s postprocessing algorithms when applied to parsed input trees than when applied to gold-standard input trees.",
        "It seems that this degradation is not primarily due to noise in parse tree outputs reducing recall of nonlocal dependency identification: precision/recall splits were largely the same between gold and parsed data, and manual inspection revealed that incorrect nonlocal dependency choices often arose from syntactically reasonable yet incorrect input from the parser.",
        "For example, the gold-standard parse right-wing whites ... will [VP step up [NP their threats [S [VP * to take matters into their own hands ]]]] has an unindexed control locus because Treebank annotation specifies that infinitival VPs inside NPs are not assigned controllers.",
        "Charniak’s parser, however, attaches the infinitival VP into the higher step up ... VP.",
        "Infinitival VPs inside VPs generally do receive controllers for their null subjects, and our algorithm accordingly yet mistakenly assigns right-wing-whites as the antecedent.",
        "The English/German comparison shown in Tables 4 and 5 is suggestive, but caution is necessary in its interpretation due to the fact that differences in both language structure and treebank annotation may be involved.",
        "Results in the G column of Table 5, showing the accuracy of the context-free dependency approximation from gold-standard parse trees, quantitatively corroborates the intuition that nonlocal dependency is more prominent in German than in English.",
        "Manual investigation of errors made on German gold-standard data revealed two major sources of error beyond sparsity.",
        "The first was a widespread ambiguity of S and VP nodes within S and VP nodes; many true dislocations of all sorts are expressed at the S and VP levels in CFG parse trees, such as VP1 of Figure 2, but many adverbial and subordinate phrases of S or VP category are genuine dependents of the main clausal verb.",
        "We were able to find a number of features to distinguish some cases, such as the presence of certain unambiguous relative-clause introducing complementizers beginning an S node, but much ambiguity remained.",
        "The second was the ambiguity that some matrix S-initial NPs are actually dependents of the VP head (in these cases, NEGRA annotates the finite verb as the head of S and the non-finite verb as the head of VP).",
        "This is not necessarily a genuine discontinuity per se, but rather corresponds to identification of the subject NP in a clause.",
        "Obviously, having access to reliable case marking would improve performance in this area; such information is in fact included in NEGRA’s morphological annotation, another argument for the utility of involving enhanced annotation in CF parsing.",
        "As can be seen in the right half of Table 4, performance falls off considerably on vanilla PCFG-WSJ(full) WSJ(sm) NEGRA parsed data.",
        "This falloff seems more dramatic than that seen in Sections 4.1 and 4.2, no doubt partly due to the poorer performance of the vanilla PCFG, but likely also because only non-relativization dislocations are considered in Section 4.3.",
        "These dislocations often require non-local information (such as identity of surface lexical governor) for identification and are thus especially susceptible to degradation in parsed data.",
        "Nevertheless, seemingly dismal performance here still provided a strong boost to typed dependency evaluation of parsed data, as seen in A o P of Table 5.",
        "We suspect this indicates that dislocated terminals are being usefully identified and mapped back to their proper governors, even if the syntactic projections of these terminals and governors are not being correctly identified by the parser."

        "This was the approach taken by Dienes and Dubey (2003a,b) and Dienes (2003); it is also practiced in recent work on broad-coverage CCG parsing (Hockenmaier, 2003).",
        "The third would be to incorporate nonlocal dependency information into the edge structure parse trees, allowing discontinuous constituency to be explicitly represented in the parse chart.",
        "This approach was tentatively investigated by Plaehn (2000).",
        "As the syntactic diversity of languages for which treebanks are available grows, it will become increasingly important to compare these three approaches."
