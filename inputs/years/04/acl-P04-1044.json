        "A crucial problem in the design of spoken dialogue systems is to decide for incoming recognition hypotheses whether a system should accept (consider correctly recognized), reject (assume misrecogni-tion), or ignore (classify as noise or speech not directed to the system) them.",
        "In addition, a more sophisticated dialogue system might decide whether to clarify or confirm certain hypotheses.",
        "Obviously, incorrect decisions at this point can have serious negative effects on system usability and user satisfaction.",
        "On the one hand, accepting misrecognized hypotheses leads to misunderstandings and unintended system behaviors which are usually difficult to recover from.",
        "On the other hand, users might get frustrated with a system that behaves too cautiously and rejects or ignores too many utterances.",
        "Thus an important feature in dialogue system engineering is the tradeoff between avoiding task failure (due to misrecognitions) and promoting overall dialogue efficiency, flow, and naturalness.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the use of machine learners trained on a combination of acoustic confidence and pragmatic plausibility features (i.e. computed from dialogue context) to predict the quality of incoming n-best recognition hypotheses to a spoken dialogue system.",
        "These predictions are then used to select a “best” hypothesis and to decide on appropriate system reactions.",
        "We evaluate this approach in comparison with a baseline system that combines fixed recognition confidence rejection thresholds with dialogue-state dependent recognition grammars (Lemon, 2004).",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "After a short relation to previous work, Section 3 introduces the WITAS multimodal dialogue system, which we use to collect data (Section 4) and to derive baseline results (Section 5).",
        "Section 6 describes our learning experiments for classifying and selecting from n-best recognition hypotheses and Section 7 reports our results."

        "However, both (Litman et al., 2000) and (Walker et al., 2000) consider only single-best recognition results and thus use their classifiers as “filters” to decide whether the best recognition hypothesis for a user utterance is correct or not.",

        "We also explore the use of more dialogue and task-oriented features (e.g. the dialogue move type of a recognition hypothesis) for classification.",
        "The main difference between our approach and work on hypothesis reordering (e.g. (Chotimongkol and Rudnicky, 2001)) is that we make a decision regarding whether a dialogue system should accept, clarify, reject, or ignore a user utterance.",
        "Furthermore, our approach is more generally applicable than preceding research, since we frame our methodology in the Information State Update (ISU) approach to dialogue management (Traum et al., 1999) and therefore expect it to be applicable to a range of related multimodal dialogue systems."

        "We can compare these results to a hypothetical “oracle” system in order to obtain an upper bound on classification performance.",
        "This is an imaginary system which performs perfectly on the experimental data given the 10-best recognition output.",
        "The oracle results reveal that for 18 of the in-grammar utterances the 10-best recognition hypotheses do not include the correct logical form at all and therefore have to be classified as clarify or reject (i.e. it is not possible to achieve 100% accuracy on the experimental data).",
        "Table 2 shows that our best results are only 8%/12% (absolute) away from the optimal performance.",
        "We use the χ2 test of independence to statistically compare the different classification results.",
        "However, since χ2 only tells us whether two classifications are different from each other, we introduce a simple cost measure (Table 4) for the 3-way classification problem to complement the χ2 results.6",
        "Table 4 captures the intuition that the correct behavior of a dialogue system is to accept correctly recognized utterances and ignore crosstalk (cost 0).",
        "The worst a system can do is to accept misrecognized utterances or utterances that were not addressed to the system.",
        "The remaining classes are as6 We only evaluate the 3-way classification problem because there are no baseline results for the 4-way classification available.",
        "signed a value in-between these two extremes.",
        "Note that the cost assignment is not validated against user judgments.",
        "We only use the costs to interpret the χ2 levels of significance (i.e. as an indicator to compare the relative quality of different systems).",
        "Table 5 shows the differences in cost and χ2 levels of significance when we compare the classification results.",
        "Here, TiOP stands for TiMBL with optimized parameters and the stars indicate the level of statistical significance as computed by the χ2 statistics (*** indicates significance at p = .001, ** at p = .01, and * at p = .05).7",
        "The cost measure shows the strict ordering: Oracle < TiOP < TiMBL < RIPPER < Baseline.",
        "Note however that according to the χ2 test there is no significant difference between the oracle system and TiMBL with optimized parameters.",
        "Table 5 also shows that all of our experiments significantly outperform the baseline system."

        "We used a combination of acoustic confidence and pragmatic plausibility features (i.e. computed from dialogue context) to predict the quality of incoming recognition hypotheses to a multi-modal dialogue system.",
        "We classified hypotheses as accept, (clarify), reject, or ignore: functional categories that 7Following (Hinton, 1995), we leave out categories with expected frequencies < 5 in the χ2 computation and reduce the degrees of freedom accordingly.",
        "can be used by a dialogue manager to decide appropriate system reactions.",
        "The approach is novel in combining machine learning with n-best processing for spoken dialogue systems using the Information State Update approach.",
        "Our best results, obtained using TiMBL with optimized parameters, show a 25% weighted f-score improvement over a baseline system that uses a “grammar-switching” approach to context-sensitive speech recognition, and are only 8% away from the optimal performance that can be achieved on the data.",
        "Clearly, this improvement would result in better dialogue system performance overall.",
        "Parameter optimization improved the classification results by 9% compared to using the learner with default settings, which shows the importance of such tuning.",
        "Future work points in two directions: first, integrating our methodology into working ISU-based dialogue systems and determining whether or not they improve in terms of standard dialogue evaluation metrics (e.g. task completion).",
        "The ISU approach is a particularly useful testbed for our methodology because it collects information pertaining to dialogue context in a central data structure from which it can be easily extracted.",
        "This avenue will be further explored in the TALK project8.",
        "Second, it will be interesting to investigate the impact of different dialogue and task features for classification and to introduce a distinction between “generic” features that are domain independent and “application-specific” features which reflect properties of individual systems and application scenarios."
