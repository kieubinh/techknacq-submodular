        "Lexical resources are crucial in the construction of wide-coverage computational systems based on modern syntactic theories (e.g. LFG, HPSG, CCG, LTAG etc.).",
        "However, as manual construction of such lexical resources is time-consuming, error-prone, expensive and rarely ever complete, it is often the case that limitations of NLP systems based on lexicalised approaches are due to bottlenecks in the lexicon component.",
        "Given this, research on automating lexical acquisition for lexically-based NLP systems is a particularly important issue.",
        "In this paper we present an approach to automating subcategorisation frame acquisition for LFG (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982) i.e. grammatical function-based systems.",
        "LFG has two levels of structural representation: c(onstituent)-structure, and f(unctional)-structure.",
        "LFG differentiates between governable (argument) and non-governable (adjunct) grammatical functions.",
        "Sub-categorisation requirements are enforced through semantic forms specifying the governable grammatical functions required by a particular predicate (e.g. FOCUS((↑ SUBJ)(↑ OBL,,,,,))).",
        "Our approach is based on earlier work on LFG semantic form extraction (van Genabith et al., 1999) and recent progress in automatically annotating the Penn-II treebank with LFG f-structures (Cahill et al., 2004b).",
        "Depending on the quality of the f-structures, reliable LFG semantic forms can then be generated quite simply by recursively reading off the subcategoris-able grammatical functions for each local pre d value at each level of embedding in the f-structures.",
        "The work reported in (van Genabith et al., 1999) was small scale (100 trees), proof of concept and required considerable manual annotation work.",
        "In this paper we show how the extraction process can be scaled to the complete Wall Street Journal (WSJ) section of the Penn-II treebank, with about 1 million words in 50,000 sentences, based on the automatic LFG f-structure annotation algorithm described in (Cahill et al., 2004b).",
        "In addition to extracting grammatical function-based subcategorisation frames, we also include the syntactic categories of the predicate and its subcategorised arguments, as well as additional details such as the prepositions required by obliques, and particles accompanying particle verbs.",
        "Our method does not predefine the frames to be extracted.",
        "In contrast to many other approaches, it discriminates between active and passive frames, properly reflects long distance dependencies and assigns conditional probabilities to the semantic forms associated with each predicate.",

        "Our methodology and its implementation are presented in Section 3.",

        "The first step in the application of our methodology is the production of a treebank annotated with LFG f-structure information.",
        "F-structures are feature structures which represent abstract syntactic information, approximating to basic predicate-argument-modifier structures.",
        "We utilise the automatic annotation algorithm of (Cahill et al., 2004b) to derive a version of Penn-II where each node in each tree is annotated with an LFG functional annotation (i.e. an attribute value structure equation).",
        "Trees are traversed top-down, and annotation is driven by categorial, basic configurational, trace and Penn-II functional tag information in local subtrees of mostly depth one (i.e. CFG rules).",
        "The annotation procedure is dependent on locating the head daughter, for which the scheme of (Magerman, 1994) with some changes and amendments is used.",
        "The head is annotated with the LFG equation T= J. Linguistic generalisations are provided over the left (the prefix) and the right (suffix) context of the head for each syntactic category occurring as the mother node of such heads.",
        "To give a simple example, the rightmost NP to the left of a VP head under an S is likely to be its subject (T SUBJ =J), while the leftmost NP to the right of the V head of a VP is most probably its object (T OBJ =J).",
        "(Cahill et al., 2004b) provide four sets of annotation principles, one for non-coordinate configurations, one for coordinate configurations, one for traces (long distance dependencies) and a final ‘catch all and clean up’ phase.",
        "Distinguishing between argument and adjunct is an inherent step in the automatic assignment of functional annotations.",
        "The satisfactory treatment of long distance dependencies by the annotation algorithm is imperative for the extraction of accurate semantic forms.",
        "The Penn Treebank employs a rich arsenal of traces and empty productions (nodes which do not realise any lexical material) to co-index displaced material with the position where it should be interpreted semantically.",
        "The algorithm of (Cahill et al., 2004b) translates the traces into corresponding re-entrancies in the f-structure representation (Figure 1).",
        "Passive movement is also captured and expressed at f-structure level using a pas s ive : + annotation.",
        "Once a treebank tree is annotated with feature structure equations by the annotation algorithm, the equations are collected and passed to a constraint solver which produces the f-structures.",
        "In order to ensure the quality of the seman",
        "tic forms extracted by our method, we must first ensure the quality of the f-structure annotations.",

        "The algorithm currently achieves an F-score of 96.3% for complete f-structures and 93.6% for preds-only f-structures.1 Our semantic form extraction methodology is based on the procedure of (van Genabith et al., 1999): For each f-structure generated, for each level of embedding we determine the local PRED value and collect the subcategorisable grammatical functions present at that level of embedding.",
        "Consider the f-structure in Figure 1.",

        "Adjuncts (e.g. ADJ, APP etc) are not included in the semantic forms.",
        "PART is not a syntactic function in the strict sense but we capture the relevant co-occurrence patterns of verbs and particles in the semantic forms.",

        "Second, our approach fully reflects long distance dependencies, indicated in terms of traces in the Penn-II Treebank and corresponding re-entrancies at f-structure.",

        "Consider Figure 2: not taking voice into account, the algorithm extracts an intransitive frame outlaw ([ subj] ) for the transitive outlaw.",
        "To correct this, the extraction algorithm uses the feature value pair p a s s ive : +, which appears in the f-structure at the level of embedding of the verb in question, to mark that predicate as occurring in the passive: outlaw([ subj] , p) .",

        "Our recall figure was particularly low in the case of evaluation using details of prepositions (Experiment 3).",
        "This can be accounted for by the fact that COMLEX errs on the side of overgeneration when it comes to preposition assignment.",
        "This is particularly true of directional prepositions, a list of 31 of which has been prepared and is assigned in its entirety by default to any verb which can potentially appear with any directional preposition.",
        "In a subsequent experiment, we incorporate this list of directional prepositions by default into our semantic form induction process in the same way as the creators of COMLEX have done.",
        "Table 6 shows the results of this experiment.",
        "As expected there is a significant im",
        "provement in the recall figure, being almost double the figures reported in Table 5 for Experiments 3 and 3a.",

        "We carried out an extensive evaluation of the complete induced lexicon (not just a sample) against the full COMLEX resource.",
        "To our knowledge, this is the most extensive qualitative evaluation of subcategorisation extraction in English.",
        "The only evaluation of a similar scale is that carried out by (Schulte im Walde, 2002) for German.",
        "Our results compare well with hers.",
        "We believe our semantic forms are fine-grained and by choosing to evaluate against COMLEX we set our sights high: COMLEX is considerably more detailed than the OALD or LDOCE used for other evaluations.",
        "Currently work is under way to extend the coverage of our acquired lexicons by applying our methodology to the Penn-III treebank, a more balanced corpus resource with a number of text genres (in addition to the WSJ sections).",
        "It is important to realise that the induction of lexical resources is part of a larger project on the acquisition of wide-coverage, robust, probabilistic, deep unification grammar resources from treebanks.",
        "We are already using the extracted semantic forms in parsing new text with robust, wide-coverage PCFG-based LFG grammar approximations automatically acquired from the f-structure annotated Penn-II treebank (Cahill et al., 2004a).",
        "We hope to be able to apply our lexical acquisition methodology beyond existing parse-annotated corpora (Penn-II and Penn-III): new text is parsed by our PCFG-based LFG approximations into f-structures from which we can then extract further semantic forms.",
        "The work reported here is part of the core component for bootstrapping this approach.",
        "As the extraction algorithm we presented derives semantic forms at f-structure level, it is easily applied to other, even typologically different, languages.",
        "We have successfully ported our automatic annotation algorithm to the TIGER Treebank, despite German being a less configurational language than English, and extracted wide-coverage, probabilistic LFG grammar approximations and lexical resources for German (Cahill et al., 2003).",
        "Currently, we are migrating the technique to Spanish, which has freer word order than English and less morphological marking than German.",
        "Preliminary results have been very encouraging."
