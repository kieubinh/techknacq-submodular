        "Our research area is descriptive text generation (O’Donnell et al., 2001; Isard et al., 2003), i.e. the generation of descriptions of objects, typically museum artefacts, depicted in a picture.",
        "Text (1), from the GNOME corpus (Poesio et al., 2004), is an example of short human-authored text from this genre:",
        "(1) (a) 144 is a torc.",
        "(b) Its present arrangement,",
        "twisted into three rings, may be a modern alteration; (c) it should probably be a single ring, worn around the neck.",
        "(d) The terminals are in the form of goats’ heads.",
        "According to Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995; Walker et al., 1998a), an important factor for the felicity of (1) is its entity coherence: the way CENTERS (discourse entities), such as the referent of the NPs “144” in clause (a) and “its” in clause (b), are introduced and discussed in subsequent clauses.",
        "It is often claimed in current work on in natural language generation that the constraints on felicitous text proposed by the theory are useful to guide text structuring, in combination with other factors (see (Karamanis, 2003) for an overview).",
        "However, how successful Centering’s constraints are on their own in generating a felicitous text structure is an open question, already raised by the seminal papers of the theory (Brennan et al., 1987; Grosz et al., 1995).",
        "In this work, we explored this question by developing an approach to text structuring purely based on Centering, in which the role of other factors is deliberately ignored.",
        "In accordance with recent work in the emerging field of text-to-text generation (Barzilay et al., 2002; Lapata, 2003), we assume that the input to text structuring is a set of clauses.",
        "The output of text structuring is merely an ordering of these clauses, rather than the treelike structure of database facts often used in traditional deep generation (Reiter and Dale, 2000).",
        "Our approach is further characterized by two key insights.",
        "The first distinguishing feature is that we assume a search-based approach to text structuring (Mellish et al., 1998; Kibble and Power, 2000; Karamanis and Manurung, 2002) in which many candidate orderings of clauses are evaluated according to scores assigned by a given metric, and the best-scoring ordering among the candidate solutions is chosen.",
        "The second novel aspect is that our approach is based on the position that the most straightforward way of using Centering for text structuring is by defining a Centering-based metric of coherence Karamanis (2003).",
        "Together, these two assumptions lead to a view of text planning in which the constraints of Centering act not as filters, but as ranking factors, and the text planner may be forced to choose a suboptimal solution.",
        "However, Karamanis (2003) pointed out that many metrics of coherence can be derived from the claims of Centering, all of which could be used for the type of text structuring assumed in this paper.",
        "Hence, a general methodology for identifying which of these metrics represent the most promising candidates for text structuring is required, so that at least some of them can be compared empirically.",
        "This is the second research question that this paper addresses, building upon previous work on corpus-based evaluations of Centering, and particularly the methods used by Poesio et al.",
        "(2004).",
        "We use the GNOME corpus (Poesio et al., 2004) as the domain of our experiments because it is reliably annotated with features relevant to Centering and contains the genre that we are mainly interested in.",
        "To sum up, in this paper we try to identify the most promising Centering-based metric for text structuring, and to evaluate how useful this metric is for that purpose, using corpus-based methods instead of generally more expensive psycholinguistic techniques.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "After discussing how the GNOME corpus has been used in previous work to evaluate the coherence of a text according to Centering we discuss why such evaluations are not sufficient for text structuring.",
        "We continue by showing how Centering can be used to define different metrics of coherence which might be useful to drive a text planner.",
        "We then outline a corpus-based methodology to choose among these metrics, estimating how well they are expected to do when used by a text planner.",
        "We conclude by discussing our experiments in which this methodology is applied using a subset of the GNOME corpus.",

        "5 In this study we do not take indirect realisation into account, i.e., we ignore the bridging reference (annotated in the corpus) between the referent of “it” de374 in (c) and the referent of “the terminals” de380 in (d), by virtue of which de374 might be thought as being a member of the CF list of (d).",

        "Consider the NOCB utterance (d) in (1).",
        "Simply observing that this transition is ‘dispreferred’ ignores the fact that every other ordering of utterances (b) to (d) would result in more NOCBs than those found in (1).",

        "Also note that since M.BFP fails to overtake M.NOCB in MPIRO, the baseline can be considered the most promising solution among the ones investigated in both domains by applying Occam’s logical principle.",
        "We also tried to account for some additional constraints on coherence, namely local rhetorical relations, based on some of the assumptions in Knott et al.",
        "(2001), and what Karamanis (2003) calls the “PageFocus” which corresponds to the main entity described in a text, in our example de374.",
        "These results, reported in (Karamanis, 2003), indicate that these constraints conflict with Centering as formulated in this paper, by increasing - instead of reducing - the classification rate of the metrics.",
        "Hence, it remains unclear to us how to improve upon M.NOCB.",
        "In our future work, we would like to experiment with more metrics.",
        "Moreover, although we consider the parameter configuration of Centering used here a plausible choice, we intend to apply our methodology to study different instantiations of the Centering parameters, e.g. by investigating whether “indirect realisation” reduces the classification rate for M.NOCB compared to “direct realisation”, etc."
