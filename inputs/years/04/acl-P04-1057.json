        "As we all know, hand-crafted linguistic descriptions such as wide-coverage grammars and large scale dictionaries contain mistakes, and are incomplete.",
        "In the context of parsing, people often construct sets of example sentences that the system should be able to parse correctly.",
        "If a sentence cannot be parsed, it is a clear sign that something is wrong.",
        "This technique only works in as far as the problems that might occur have been anticipated.",
        "More recently, treebanks have become available, and we can apply the parser to the sentences of the treebank and compare the resulting parse trees with the gold standard.",
        "Such techniques are limited, however, because treebanks are relatively small.",
        "This is a serious problem, because the distribution of words is Zipfian (there are very many words that occur very infrequently), and the same appears to hold for syntactic constructions.",
        "In this paper, an error mining technique is described which is very effective at automatically discovering systematic mistakes in a parser by using very large (but unannotated) corpora.",
        "The idea is very simple.",
        "We run the parser on a large set of sentences, and then analyze those sentences the parser cannot parse successfully.",
        "Depending on the nature of the parser, we define the notion ‘successful parse’ in different ways.",
        "In the experiments described here, we use the Alpino wide-coverage parser for Dutch (Bouma et al., 2001; van der Beek et al., 2002b).",
        "This parser is based on a large con-structionalist HPSG for Dutch as well as a very large electronic dictionary (partly derived from CELEX, Parole, and CGN).",
        "The parser is robust in the sense that it essentially always produces a parse.",
        "If a full parse is not possible for a given sentence, then the parser returns a (minimal) number of parsed non-overlapping sentence parts.",
        "In the context of the present paper, a parse is called successful only if the parser finds an analysis spanning the full sentence.",
        "The basic idea is to compare the frequency of words and word sequences in sentences that cannot be parsed successfully with the frequency of the same words and word sequences in unproblematic sentences.",
        "As we illustrate in section 3, this technique obtains very good results if it is applied to large sets of sentences.",
        "To compute the frequency of word sequences of arbitrary length for very large corpora, we use a new combination of suffix arrays and perfect hash finite automata.",
        "This implementation is described in section 4.",
        "The error mining technique is able to discover systematic problems which lead to parsing failure.",
        "This includes missing, incomplete and incorrect lexical entries and grammar rules.",
        "Problems which cause the parser to assign complete but incorrect parses cannot be discovered.",
        "Therefore, treebanks and hand-crafted sets of example sentences remain important to discover problems of the latter type."

        "The error mining technique assumes we have available a large corpus of sentences.",

        "We run the parser on all sentences, and we note for which sentences the parser is successful.",
        "We define the parsability of a word R(w) as the ratio of the number of times the word occurs in a sentence with a successful parse (C(w|OK)) and the total number of sentences that this word occurs in (C(w)):",
        "Thus, if a word only occurs in sentences that cannot be parsed successfully, the parsability of that word is 0.",
        "On the other hand, if a word only occurs in sentences with a successful parse, its parsability is 1.",
        "If we have no reason to believe that a word is particularly easy or difficult, then we expect its parsability to be equal to the coverage of the parser (the proportion of sentences with a successful parse).",
        "If its parsability is (much) lower, then this indicates that something is wrong.",
        "For the experiments described below, the coverage of the parser lies between 91% and 95%.",
        "Yet, for many words we found parsability values that were much lower than that, including quite a number of words with parsability 0.",
        "Below we show some typical examples, and discuss the types of problem that are discovered in this way.",
        "If a word has a parsability of 0, but its frequency is very low (say 1 or 2) then this might easily be due to chance.",
        "We therefore use a frequency cut-off (e.g. 5), and we ignore words which occur less often in sentences without a successful parse.",
        "In many cases, the parsability of a word depends on its context.",
        "For instance, the Dutch word via is a preposition.",
        "Its parsability in a certain experiment was more than 90%.",
        "Yet, the parser was unable to parse sentences with the phrase via via which is an adverbial expression which means via some complicated route.",
        "For this reason, we generalize the parsability of a word to word sequences in a straightforward way.",
        "We write C(wi ... wj) for the number of sentences in which the sequence wi ... wj occurs.",
        "Furthermore, C(wi ... wj |OK), is the number of sentences with a successful parse which contain the sequence wi ... wj .",
        "The parsability of a sequence is defined as:",
        "If a word sequence wi ... wj has a low parsability, then this might be because it is part of a difficult phrase.",
        "It might also be that part of the sequence is the culprit.",
        "In order that we focus on the relevant sequence, we consider a longer sequence wh ... wi ... wj ... wk only if its parsability is lower than the parsability of each of its sub-strings:",
        "This is computed efficiently by considering the parsability of sequences in order of length (shorter sequences before longer ones).",
        "We construct a parsability table, which is a list of n-grams sorted with respect to parsability.",

        "• its frequency in problematic parses is larger than the frequency cut-off • its parsability is lower than the parsability of all of its sub-strings",

        "Furthermore, a time-out per sentence of twenty CPU-seconds was enforced.",
        "The Alpino parser normally exploits a part-of-speech tag filter for efficient parsing (Prins and van Noord, 2003) which was switched off, to ensure that the results were not influenced by mistakes due to this filter.",

        "An error mining technique has been presented which is very helpful in identifying problems in hand-coded grammars and lexicons for parsing.",
        "An important ingredient of the technique consists of the computation of the frequency of n-grams of words for arbitrary values of n. It was shown how a new combination of suffix arrays and perfect hash finite automata allows an efficient implementation.",
        "A number of potential improvements can be envisioned.",
        "In the definition of R(w), the absolute frequency of w is ignored.",
        "Yet, if w is very frequent, R(w) is more reliable than if w is not frequent.",
        "Therefore, as an alternative, we also experimented with a set-up in which an exact binomial test is applied to compute a confidence interval for R(w).",
        "Results can then be ordered with respect to the maximum of these confidence intervals.",
        "This procedure seemed to improve results somewhat, but is computationally much more expensive.",
        "For the first experiment described above, this alternative set-up results in a parsability table of 42K word tuples, whereas the original method produces a table of 65K word tuples.",
        "The parsability table only contains longer n-grams if these have a lower parsability than the corresponding shorter n-grams.",
        "Although this heuristic appears to be useful, it is still possible that a single problem is reflected multiple times in the parsability table.",
        "For longer problematic sequences, the parsability table typically contains partially overlapping parts of that sequence.",
        "This phenomenon is illustrated in table 3 for the idiom Beter ten halve gekeerd dan ten hele gedwaald discussed earlier.",
        "This suggests that it would be useful to consider other heuristics to eliminate such redundancy, perhaps by considering statistical feature selection methods.",
        "The definition used in this paper to identify a successful parse is a rather crude one.",
        "Given that grammars of the type assumed here typically assign very many analyses to a given sentence, it is often the case that a specific problem in the grammar or lexicon rules out the intended parse for a given sentence, but alternative (wrong) parses are still possible.",
        "What appears to be required is a (statistical) model which is capable of judging the plausibility of a parse.",
        "We investigated whether the maximum entropy score S(x) (equation 1) can be used to indicate parse plausibility.",
        "In this set-up, we considered a parse successful only if S(x) of the best parse is above a certain threshold.",
        "However, the resulting parsability table did not appear to indicate problematic word sequences, but rather word sequences typically found in elliptical sentences were returned.",
        "Apparently, the grammatical rules used for ellipsis are heavily punished by the maximum entropy model in order that these rules are used only if other rules are not applicable."
