        "But for other tasks, such as machine translation (Brown et al., 1990), the chief merit of unlabeled data is simply that nothing else is available; unsupervised parameter estimation is notorious for achieving mediocre results.",
        "The standard starting point is the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977).",
        "EM iteratively adjusts a model’s parameters from an initial guess until it converges to a local maximum.",
        "Unfortunately, likelihood functions in practice are riddled with suboptimal local maxima (e.g., Charniak, 1993, ch.",
        "7).",
        "Moreover, maximizing likelihood is not equivalent to maximizing task-defined accuracy (e.g., Merialdo, 1994).",
        "Here we focus on the search error problem.",
        "Assume that one has a model for which improving likelihood really will improve accuracy (e.g., at predicting hidden part-of-speech (POS) tags or parse trees).",
        "Hence, we seek methods that tend to locate mountaintops rather than hilltops of the likelihood function.",
        "Alternatively, we might want methods that find hilltops with other desirable properties.1",
        "In §2 we review deterministic annealing (DA) and show how it generalizes the EM algorithm.",
        "§3 shows how DA can be used for parameter estimation for models of language structure that use dynamic programming to compute posteriors over hidden structure, such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) and stochastic context-free grammars (SCFGs).",
        "In §4 we apply DA to the problem of learning a trigram POS tagger without labeled data.",
        "We then describe how one of the received strengths of DA – its robustness to the initializing model parameters – can be a shortcoming in situations where the initial parameters carry a helpful bias.",
        "We present a solution to this problem in the form of a new algorithm, skewed deterministic annealing (SDA; §5).",

        "We report PARSEVAL scores averaged by constituent (rather than by sentence), and do not give the learner credit for getting full sentences or single tags as constituents.12 Because the E step for this model is computationally intensive, we set the DA parameters at βmin = 0.01, α = 1.5 so that fewer E steps would be necessary.",

        "Thus, our strategy of using DA but modifying it to accept an initializer worked as desired in this case, yielding our best overall performance.",

        "Interestingly, we found that training model 2 (using EM or SDA) on 10% of the corpus resulted on average in models that performed nearly as well on their respective training sets as the full corpus condition did on its training set; see Table 3.",
        "In addition, SDA sometimes performed as well as EM under model 1.",
        "For a random two-way split, EM and SDA converged to almost identical solutions on one of the sub-corpora, and SDA outperformed EM significantly on the other (on model 2).",
        "In order to get multiple points of comparison of EM and SDA on this task with a larger amount of data, we jackknifed the WSJ-10 corpus by splitting it randomly into ten equally-sized nonoverlapping parts then training models on the corpus with each of the ten sub-corpora excluded.",

        "15 The variance of SDA was far less than that of EM; SDA not only always performed better with model 2, but its performance was more consistent over the trials.",
        "We conclude this experimental discussion by cautioning that both CCM models are highly deficient models, and it is unknown how well they generalize to corpora of longer sentences, other languages, or corpora of words (rather than POS tags)."

        "For instance, we might begin with the CCM, the original formulation of which posits only one distinction about constituency (whether a span is a constituent or not) and gradually allow splits in constituent-label space, resulting in multiple grammatical categories that, we hope, arise naturally from the data.",
