        "As the Internet grows, an increasing number of commercial MT systems are getting on line ready to serve anyone anywhere on the earth.",
        "An interesting question we might ponder is whether it is not possible to aggregate the vast number of MT systems available on the Internet into one super MT which surpasses in performance any of those MTs that comprise the system.",
        "And this is what we will be concerned with in the paper, with somewhat watered-down settings.",
        "People in the speech community pursued the idea of combining off-the-shelf ASRs (automatic speech recognizers) into a super ASR for some time, and found that the idea works (Fiscus, 1997; Schwenk and Gauvain, 2000; Utsuro et al., 2003).",
        "In IR (information retrieval), we find some efforts going (under the name of distributed IR or meta-search) to selectively fuse outputs from multiple search engines on the Internet (Callan et al., 2003).",
        "So it would be curious to see whether we could do the same with MTs.",
        "Now back in machine translation, we do find some work addressing such concern: Frederking and Nirenburg (1994) develop a multi-engine MT or MEMT architecture which operates by combining outputs from three different engines based on the knowledge it has about inner workings of each of the component engines.",
        "Brown and Frederking (1995) is a continuation of Frederking and Nirenburg (1994) with an addition of a ngram-based mechanism for a candidate selection.",
        "Nomoto (2003), however, explores a different line of research whose goal is to combine black box MTs using statistical confidence models.",
        "Similar efforts are also found in Akiba et al.",
        "(2002).",
        "The present paper builds on the prior work by Nomoto (2003).",
        "We start by reviewing his approach, and go on to demonstrate that it could be improved by capitalizing on dependence of the MEMT model there on language model.",

        "We take it here that the business of MEMT is about choosing among translation outputs from multiple MT systems, whether black box or not, for each input text.",
        "Therefore the question we want to address is, how do we go about choosing among MT outputs so that we end up with a best one?",
        "What we propose to do is to use some confidence models for translations generated by OTSs, and let them decide which one we should pick.",
        "We essentially work along the lines of Nomoto (2003).",
        "We review below some of the models proposed there, together with some motivation behind them.",
        "Confidence models he proposes come in two varieties: Fluency based model (FLM) and Alignment based model (ALM), which is actually an extension of FLM.",
        "Now suppose we have an English sentence e and its Japanese translation j generated by some OTS.",
        "(One note here: throughout the paper we work on English to Japanese translation.)",

        "guage model (LM) l.1 What FLM says is that the quality of a translation essentially depends on its log likelihood (or fluency) and has nothing to do with what it is a translation of.",
        "ALM extends FLM to include some information on fidelity.",
        "That is, it pays some attention to how faithful a translation is to its source text.",
        "ALM does this by using alignment models from the statistical machine translation literature (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "Here is what ALM looks like.",
        "Model 1.",
        "ALM takes into account the fluency of a translation output (given by Pl (j)) and the degree of association between e and j (given by Q(e I j)), which are in fact two features generally agreed in the MT literature to be most relevant for assessing the quality of translations (White, 2001).",
        "One problem with FLM and ALM is that they fail to take into account the reliability of an OTS system.",
        "As Nomoto (2003) argues, it is reasonable to believe that some MT systems could inherently be more prone to error and outputs they produce tend to be of less quality than those from other systems, no matter what the outputs’ fluency or translation probability may be.",
        "ALM and FLM work solely on statistical information that can be gathered from source and target sentences, dismissing any operational bias that an OTS might have on a particular task.",
        "Nomoto (2003) responds to the problem by introducing a particular regression model known as Support Vector regression (SVR), which enables him to exploit bias in performance of OTSs.",
        "What SVR is intended to do is to modify confidence scores FLM and ALM produce for MT outputs in such a way that they may more accurately reflect their independent evaluation involving human translations or judgments.",
        "SVR is a multidimensional regres-sor, and works pretty much like its enormously popular counterpart, Support Vector classification, except that we are going to work with real numbers for target values and construct the margin, using Vap-nik’s c-insensitive loss function (Sch¨olkopf et al., 1998).",
        "SVR looks something like this.",
        "h(x)=ww•xx+b, with input data xx = (x 1,... , xm) and the corresponding weights ww = (w1, ... , wm).",
        "‘x • y’ denotes the inner product of x and y. xx could be a set of features associated with e and j. Parameters ww and b are something determined by SVR.",
        "It is straightforward to extend the ALM and FLM with SVR, which merely consists of plugging in either model as an input variable in the regressor.",
        "This would give us the following two SVR models with",
        "Notice that h(•) here is supposed to relate FLM or ALM to some independent evaluation metric such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002), not the log likelihood of a translation.",
        "With confidence models in place, define a MEMT model Ψ by: Ψ(e, J,l) = arg maxj EJ(θ(e, j l)) Here e represents a source sentence, J a set of translations for e generated by OTSs, and θ denotes some confidence model under an LM l. Throughout the rest of the paper, we let FLMψ and ALMψ denote MEMT systems based on FLM and ALM, respectively, and similarly for others."

        "That is, it takes as input a source sentence, gets it translated by several OTSs, and picks up the best among translations it gets.",
        "Now a problem with using BLEU in this setup is that translations often end up with zero because model translations they refer to do not contain n-grams of a particular length.2 This would make impossible a comparison and selection among possible translations.",
        "One way out of this, Nomoto (2003) suggests, is to back off to a somewhat imprecise yet robust metric for evaluating translations, which he calls m-precision.",

        "By definition of perplexity, the increase in size of the training data leads to an increase in perplexity of the LM.",
        "So if general observations in Fig.1 hold, then we would expect the “one-huge-LM” approach to perform poorly compared to the V-by-M, which is indeed demonstrated by the following results.",

        "is that there is some discrepancy in the effectiveness of V-by-M between the fluency based and regression based models.",
        "We have no explanation for the cause of the discrepancy at this time, though we may suspect that in learning, as long as there is some pattern to exploit in m-precision and the probability estimates of test sentences, how accurate those estimates are may not matter much.",

        "However, when disengaged, the score slips to 0.1946.",
        "The same holds for ALMO.",
        "Leaving the issue of MEMT models momentarily, let us see how the OTS systems Ai, Lo, At, and Ib are doing on tCPC, tEJP, and tPAT.",
        "Note that the whole business of MEMT would collapse if it slips behind any of the OTS systems that compose it.",

        "Also something of note here is that on tPAT, (r)FLMP and (r)ALMO in Table 4, which operate by the V-by-M scheme, score somewhere from 0.1907 to 0.1954 in BLEU, coming close to OPM, which scores 0.1995 on tPAT (Table 7).",
        "It is interesting to note, incidentally, that there is some discrepancy between BLEU and HFA in performance of the OTSs: A top performing OTS in Table 6, namely At, achieves the average HFA of 0.4643, but scores only 0.1738 for BLEU (Table 7), which is worse than what Ai gets.",
        "Apparently, high HFA does not always mean a high BLEU score.",
        "Why?",
        "The reason is that a best MT output need not mark a high BLEU score.",
        "Notice that ‘best’ here means the best among translations by the OTSs.",
        "It could happen that a poor translation still gets chosen as best, because other translations are far worse.",
        "To return to the discussion of (r)FLMP and (r)ALMO, an obvious fact about their behavior is that regressor based systems rFLMP and rALMO, whether V-by-M enabled or not, surpass in performance their less sophisticated counterparts (see",
        "Table 2,4 and also Table 3,5).",
        "Regression allows the MEMT models to correct themselves for some domain-specific bias of the OTS systems.",

        "Also worth mentioning is that the MEMT models here, when coupled with V-by-M, are all found to surpass component OTS systems by a respectable margin (cf., Tables 4, 7 for BLEU, 2, 6 for HFA).",
        "Regressive MEMTs such as rFLM P and rALM P, are found to be not affected as much by the choice of LM as their non-regressive counterparts.",
        "We suspect this happens because they have access to extra information on the quality of translation derived from human judgments or translations, which may cloud effects of LMs on them.",
