        "QA-by-Dossier-with-Constraints is a new approach to Question Answering whereby candidate answers’ confidences are adjusted by asking auxiliary questions whose answers constrain the original answers.",

        "We show that our approach significantly improves system performance (75% relative improvement in F-measure on select question types) and can create a “dossier” of information about the subject matter in the original question."

        "Traditionally, Question Answering (QA) has drawn on the fields of Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Ontologies, Data Bases and Logical Inference, although it is at heart a problem of NLP.",
        "These fields have been used to supply the technology with which QA components have been built.",
        "We present here a new methodology which attempts to use QA holistically, along with constraint satisfaction, to better answer questions, without requiring any advances in the underlying fields.",
        "Because NLP is still very much an error-prone process, QA systems make many mistakes; accordingly, a variety of methods have been developed to boost the accuracy of their answers.",
        "Such methods include redundancy (getting the same answer from multiple documents, sources, or algorithms), deep parsing of questions and texts (hence improving the accuracy of confidence measures), inferencing (proving the answer from information in texts plus background knowledge) and sanity-checking (verifying that answers are consistent with known facts).",
        "To our knowledge, however, no QA system deliberately asks additional questions in order to derive constraints on the answers to the original questions.",
        "We have found empirically that when our own QA system’s (Prager et al., 2000; Chu-Carroll et al., 2003) top answer is wrong, the correct answer is often present later in the ranked answer list.",
        "In other words, the correct answer is in the passages retrieved by the search engine, but the system was unable to sufficiently promote the correct answer and/or deprecate the incorrect ones.",
        "Our new approach of QA-by-Dossier-with-Constraints (QDC) uses the answers to additional questions to provide more information that can be used in ranking candidate answers to the original question.",
        "These auxiliary questions are selected such that natural constraints exist among the set of correct answers.",
        "After issuing both the original question and auxiliary questions, the system evaluates all possible combinations of the candidate answers and scores them by a simple function of both the answers’ intrinsic confidences, and how well the combination satisfies the aforementioned constraints.",
        "Thus we hope to improve the accuracy of an essentially NLP task by making an end-run around some of the more difficult problems in the field.",
        "We describe QDC and experiments to evaluate its effectiveness.",
        "Our results show that on our test set, substantial improvement is achieved by using constraints, compared with our baseline system, using standard evaluation metrics."

        "Logic and inferencing have been a part of Question-Answering since its earliest days.",
        "The first such systems employed natural-language interfaces to expert systems, e.g. SHRDLU (Winograd, 1972), or to databases e.g. LUNAR (Woods, 1973) and LIFER/LADDER (Hendrix et al.",
        "1977).",
        "CHAT-80 (Warren & Pereira, 1982) was a DCG-based NL-query system about world geography, entirely in Prolog.",
        "In these systems, the NL question is transformed into a semantic form, which is then processed further; the overall architecture and system operation is very different from today’s systems, however, primarily in that there is no text corpus to process.",
        "Inferencing is used in at least two of the more visible systems of the present day.",
        "The LCC system (Moldovan & Rus, 2001) uses a Logic Prover to establish the connection between a candidate answer passage and the question.",
        "Text terms are converted to logical forms, and the question is treated as a goal which is “proven”, with real-world knowledge being provided by Extended WordNet.",
        "The IBM system PIQUANT (Chu-Carroll et al., 2003) uses Cyc (Le-nat, 1995) in answer verification.",
        "Cyc can in some cases confirm or reject candidate answers based on its own store of instance information; in other cases, primarily of a numerical nature, Cyc can confirm whether candidates are within a reasonable range established for their subtype.",
        "At a more abstract level, the use of constraints discussed in this paper can be viewed as simply an example of finding support (or lack of it) for candidate answers.",
        "Many current systems (see, e.g. (Clarke et al., 2001), (Prager et al., 2004)) employ redundancy as a significant feature of operation: if the same answer appears multiple times in an internal top-n list, whether from multiple sources or multiple algorithms/agents, it is given a confidence boost, which will affect whether and how it gets returned to the end-user.",
        "Finally, our approach is somewhat reminiscent of the scripts introduced by Schank (Schank et al., 1975, and see also Lehnert, 1978).",
        "In order to generate meaningful auxiliary questions and constraints, we need a model (“script”) of the situation the question is about.",
        "Among others, we have identified one such script modeling the human life cycle that seems common to different question types regarding people."

        "So if X is a person, for example, these auxiliary questions may be about important dates and events in the person’s life-cycle, as well as his/her achievement.",
        "Likewise, question sets can be developed for other entities such as organizations, places and things.",
        "QbD employs the notion of follow-on questions.",
        "Given an answer to a first-round question, the system can ask more specific questions based on that knowledge.",
        "For example, on discovering a person’s profession, it can ask occupation-specific follow-on questions: if it finds that people are musicians, it can ask what they have composed, if it finds they are explorers, then what they have discovered, and so on.",
        "QA-by-Dossier-with-Constraints extends this approach by capitalizing on the fact that a set of answers about a subject must be mutually consistent, with respect to constraints such as time and geography.",
        "The essence of the QDC approach is to initially return instead of the best answer to appropriately selected factoid questions, the top n answers (we use n=5), and to choose out of this top set the highest confidence answer combination that satisfies consistency constraints.",
        "We illustrate this idea by way of the example, “When did Leonardo da Vinci paint the Mona Lisa?”.",

        "Using QA-byDossier, we ask two related questions “When was Leonardo da Vinci born?” and “When did Leonardo da Vinci die?” The answers to these auxiliary questions are shown in Table 2.",
        "Given common knowledge about a person’s life expectancy and that a painting must be produced while its author is alive, we observe that the best dates proposed in Table 2 consistent with one another are that Leonardo da Vinci was born in 1452, died in 1519, and painted the Mona Lisa in 1503.",
        "[The painting date of 1490 also satisfies the constraints, but with a lower confidence.]",

        "This results in different document sets being passed to the answer selection module.",

        "Despite these open questions, initial trials with QA-by-Dossier-with-Constraints have been very encouraging, whether it is by correctly answering previously missed questions, or by improving confidences of correct answers.",

        "Clearly, if the base QA system is too poor, then the answers to the auxiliary questions will be useless; if the base system is highly accurate, the increase in accuracy will be negligible.",
        "Thus our approach seems most beneficial to middle-performance levels, which, by inspection of TREC results for the last 5 years, is where the leading systems currently lie.",
        "We had initially thought that use of constraints would obviate the need for much of the complexity inherent in NLP.",
        "As mentioned earlier, with the case of “The Beatles” being the reciprocal answer to the auxiliary composition question to “Who is Paul McCartney?”, we see that structured, ontological information would benefit QDC.",
        "Identifying alternate spellings and representations of the same name (e.g. Clavier/Klavier, but also taking care of variations in punctuation and completeness) is also necessary.",
        "When we asked “Who is Ian Anderson?”, having in mind the singer-flautist for the Jethro Tull rock band, we found that he is not only that, but also the community investment manager of the English conglomerate Whitbread, the executive director of the U.S.",
        "Figure Skating Association, a writer for New Scientist, an Australian medical advisor to the WHO, and the general sales manager of Houseman, a supplier of water treatment systems.",
        "Thus the problem of word sense disambiguation has returned in a particularly nasty form.",
        "To be fully effective, QDC must be configured not just to find a consistent set of properties, but a number of independent sets that together cover the highest-confidence returned answers 3.",
        "Altogether, we see that some of the very problems we aimed to skirt are still present and need to be addressed.",
