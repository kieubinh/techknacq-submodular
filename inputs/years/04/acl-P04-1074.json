        "In language studies, temporal information describes changes and time of changes expressed in a language.",
        "Such information is critical in many typical natural language processing (NLP) applications, e.g. language generation and machine translation, etc.",
        "Modeling temporal aspects of an event in a written text is more complex than capturing time in a physical timestamped system.",
        "Event time may be specified explicitly in a sentence, e.g. “他 1997 年 T iAr�i n �ZA H ;p_ 决(They solved the traffic problem of the city in 1997)”; or it may be left implicit, to be recovered by readers from context.",
        "For example, one may know that “修JAIM&-T=A 市 (after the street bridge had been built, they solved the traffic problem of the city)”, yet without knowing the exact time when the street bridge was built.",
        "As reported by Partee (Partee, 1984), the expression of relative temporal relations in which precise times are not stated is common in natural language.",
        "The objective of relative temporal relation resolution is to determine the type of relative relation embedded in a sentence.",
        "In English, temporal expressions have been widely studied.",
        "Lascarides and Asher (Lascarides, Asher and Oberlander, 1992) suggested that temporal relations between two events followed from discourse structures.",
        "They investigated various contextual effects on five discourse relations (namely narration, elaboration, explanation, background and result) and then corresponded each of them to a kind of temporal relations.",
        "Hitzeman et al.",
        "(Hitzeman, Moens and Grover, 1995) described a method for analyzing temporal structure of a discourse by taking into account the effects of tense, aspect, temporal adverbials and rhetorical relations (e.g. causation and elaboration) on temporal ordering.",
        "They argued that rhetorical relations could be further constrained by event temporal classification.",
        "Later, Dorr and Gaasterland (Dorr and Gaasterland, 2002) developed a constraint-based approach to generate sentences, which reflect temporal relations, by making appropriate selections of tense, aspect and connecting words (e.g. before, after and when).",
        "Their works, however, are theoretical in nature and have not investigated computational aspects.",
        "The pioneer work on Chinese temporal relation extraction was first reported by Li and Wong (Li and Wong, 2002).",
        "To discover temporal relations embedded in a sentence, they devised a set of simple rules to map the combined effects of temporal indicators, which are gathered from different grammatical categories, to their corresponding relations.",
        "However, their work did not focus on relative temporal relations.",
        "Given a sentence describing two temporally related events, Li and Wong only took the temporal position words (including before, after and when, which serve as temporal connectives) and the tense/aspect markers of the second event into consideration.",
        "The proposed rule-based approach was simple; but it suffered from low coverage and was particularly ineffective when the interaction between the linguistic elements was unclear.",
        "This paper studies how linguistic features in Chinese interact to influence relative relation resolution.",
        "For this purpose, statistics-based machine learning approaches are applied.",
        "The remainder of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 summarizes the linguistic features, which must be taken into account in temporal relation resolution, and introduces how these features are expressed in Chinese.",
        "In Section 3, the proposed machine learning algorithms to identify temporal relations are outlined; furthermore, a heterogeneous collaborative bootstrapping technique for smoothing is presented.",
        "Experiments designed for studying the impact of different approaches and linguistic features are described in Section 4.",
        "Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper."

        "As the importance of temporal information processing has become apparent, a variety of temporal systems have been introduced, attempting to accommodate the characteristics of relative temporal information.",
        "Among those who worked on temporal relation representations, many took the work of Rei-chenbach (Reichenbach, 1947) as a starting point, while some others based their works on Allen’s (Allen, 1981).",
        "Reichenbach proposed a point-based temporal theory.",
        "This was later enhanced by Bruce who defined seven relative temporal relations (Bruce.",
        "1972).",
        "Given two durative events, the interval relations between them were modeled by the order between the greatest lower bounding points and least upper bounding points of the two events.",
        "In the other camp, instead of adopting time points, Allen took intervals as temporal primitives and introduced thirteen basic binary relations.",
        "In this interval-based theory, points are relegated to a subsidiary status as ‘meeting places’ of intervals.",
        "An extension to Allen’s theory, which treated both points and intervals as primitives on an equal footing, was later investigated by Ma and Knight (Ma and Knight, 1994).",
        "In natural language, events can either be punctual (e.g. 爆炸 (explore)) or durative (e.g. 盖楼 (built a house)) in nature.",
        "Thus Ma and Knight’s model is adopted in our work (see Figure 1).",
        "Taking the sentence “修成立交桥以后,他们解决了该市的交通问题 Mfir, f 417 f1�� i ri J�x 1p7 (after the street bridge had been built, they solved the traffic problem of the city)” as an example, the relation held between building the bridge (i.e. an interval) and solving the problem (i.e. a point) is BEFORE."
