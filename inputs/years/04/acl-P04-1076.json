        "As far as names are concerned, co-reference consists of two sub-tasks: (i) name disambiguation to handle the problem of different entities happening to use the same name; (ii) alias association to handle the problem of the same entity using multiple names (aliases).",

        "This approach faces two challenges: i) it is difficult to incorporate natural language processing (NLP) results in the VSM framework; 1 ii) the algorithm focuses on the local pairwise context similarity, and neglects the global correlation in the data: this may cause inconsistent results, and hurts the performance.",
        "This paper presents a new algorithm that addresses these problems.",
        "A learning scheme with minimal supervision is developed within the Bayesian framework.",

        "For example, the above algorithm identifies the mentions of Bill Clinton as referring to two different persons, one represents his role as U.
