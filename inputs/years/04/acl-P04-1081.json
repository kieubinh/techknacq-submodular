        "Achieving higher precision in supervised word sense disambiguation (WSD) tasks without resorting to ad hoc voting or similar ensemble techniques has become somewhat daunting in recent years, given the challenging benchmarks set by na¨ıve Bayes models (e.g., Mooney (1996), Chodorow et al.",
        "(1999), Pedersen (2001), Yarowsky and Florian (2002)) as well as maximum entropy models (e.g., Dang and Palmer (2002), Klein and Manning (2002)).",
        "A good foundation for comparative studies has been established by the Senseval data and evaluations; of particular relevance here are the lexical sample tasks from Senseval-1 (Kilgarriff and Rosenzweig, 1999) and Senseval-2 (Kilgarriff, 2001).",
        "We therefore chose this problem to introduce an efficient and accurate new word sense disambiguation approach that exploits a nonlinear Kernel PCA technique to make predictions implicitly based on generalizations over feature combinations.",
        "The",
        "technique is applicable whenever vector representations of a disambiguation task can be generated; thus many properties of our technique can be expected to be highly attractive from the standpoint of natural language processing in general.",
        "In the following sections, we first analyze the potential of nonlinear principal components with respect to the task of disambiguating word senses.",
        "Based on this, we describe a full model for WSD built on KPCA.",
        "We then discuss experimental results confirming that this model outperforms state-of-the-art published models for Senseval-related lexical sample tasks as represented by (1) na¨ıve Bayes models, as well as (2) maximum entropy models.",
        "We then consider whether other kernel methods – in particular, the popular SVM model – are equally competitive, and discover experimentally that KPCA achieves higher accuracy than the SVM model."

        "The Kernel Principal Component Analysis technique, or KPCA, is a nonlinear kernel method for extraction of nonlinear principal components from vector sets in which, conceptually, the n-dimensional input vectors are nonlinearly mapped from their original space Rn to a high-dimensional feature space F where linear PCA is performed, yielding a transform by which the input vectors can be mapped nonlinearly to a new set of vectors (Sch¨olkopf et al., 1998).",
        "A major advantage of KPCA is that, unlike other common analysis techniques, as with other kernel methods it inherently takes combinations of predictive features into account when optimizing dimensionality reduction.",
        "For natural language problems in general, of course, it is widely recognized that significant accuracy gains can often be achieved by generalizing over relevant feature combinations (e.g., Kudo and Matsumoto (2003)).",

Suppose b is a nonlinear mapping from the input space Rn to the feature space F. Without loss of generality we assume the M vectors are centered vectors in the feature space, i.e., EMt=1 b (xt) = 0; uncentered vectors can easily be converted to centered vectors (Sch¨olkopf et al., 1998).",
