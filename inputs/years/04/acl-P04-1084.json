        "Synchronous grammars have been proposed for the formal description of parallel texts representing translations of the same document.",
        "As shown by Melamed (2003), a plausible model of parallel text must be able to express discontinuous constituents.",
        "Since linguistic expressions can vanish in translation, a good model must be able to express independent (in addition to synchronous) rewriting.",
        "Inversion Transduction Grammar (ITG) (Wu, 1997) and Syntax-Directed Translation Schema (SDTS) (Aho and Ullman, 1969) lack both of these properties.",
        "Synchronous Tree Adjoining Grammar (STAG) (Shieber, 1994) lacks the latter and allows only limited discontinuities in each tree.",
        "Generalized Multitext Grammar (GMTG) offers a way to synchronize Mildly Context-Sensitive Grammar (MCSG), while satisfying both of the above criteria.",
        "The move to MCSG is motivated by our desire to more perspicuously account for certain syntactic phenomena that cannot be easily captured by context-free grammars, such as clitic climbing, extraposition, and other types of long-distance movement (Becker et al., 1991).",
        "On the other hand, MCSG still observes some restrictions that make the set of languages it generates less expensive to analyze than the languages generated by (properly) context-sensitive formalisms.",
        "More technically, our proposal starts from Multitext Grammar (MTG), a formalism for synchronizing context-free grammars recently proposed by Melamed (2003).",
        "In MTG, synchronous rewriting is implemented by means of an indexing relation that is maintained over occurrences of nonterminals in a sentential form, using essentially the same machinery as SDTS.",
        "Unlike SDTS, MTG can extend the dimensionality of the translation relation beyond two, and it can implement independent rewriting by means of partial deletion of syntactic structures.",
        "Our proposal generalizes MTG by moving from component grammars that generate context-free languages to component grammars whose generative power is equivalent to Linear Context-Free Rewriting Systems (LCFRS), a formalism for describing a class of MCSGs.",
        "The generalization is achieved by allowing context-free productions to rewrite tuples of strings, rather than single strings.",
        "Thus, we retain the intuitive top-down definition of synchronous derivation original in SDTS and MTG but not found in LCFRS, while extending the generative power to linear context-free rewriting languages.",
        "In this respect, GMTG has also been inspired by the class of Local Unordered Scattered Context Grammars (Rambow and Satta, 1999).",
        "A syntactically very different synchronous formalism involving LCFRS has been presented by Bertsch and Nederhof (2001).",
        "This paper begins with an informal description of GMTG.",
        "It continues with an investigation of this formalism’s generative capacity.",
        "Next, we prove that in GMTG each component grammar retains its generative power, a requirement for synchronous formalisms that Rambow and Satta (1996) called the “weak language preservation property.” Lastly, we propose a synchronous generalization of Chomsky Normal Form, which lays the groundwork for synchronous parsing under GMTG using a CKY-style algorithm (Younger, 1967; Melamed, 2004)."

        "Such discontinuities are marked by commas on both the LHS and the RHS of the relevant component.",
        "GMTG’s flexibility allows it to deal with many complex syntactic phenomena.",
        "For example, Becker et al.",
        "(1991) point out that TAG does not have the generative capacity to model certain kinds of scrambling in German, when the so-called “co-occurrence constraint” is imposed, requiring the",

        "They examine the English/German sentence fragment [(... that the detective has promised the client to indict the suspect of the crime), (... daß des Verbrechens der Detektiv den Verd¨achtigen dem Klienten zu ¨uberf¨uhren versprochen hat)].",
