        "Terminology management concerns primarily with terms, i.e., the words that are assigned to concepts used in domain-related texts.",
        "A term is a meaningful unit that represents a specific concept within a domain (Wright, 1997).",
        "Specificity of a term represents the quantity of domain specific information contained in the term.",
        "If a term has large quantity of domain specific information, specificity value of the term is large; otherwise specificity value of the term is small.",
        "Specificity of term X is quantified to positive real number as equation (1).",
        "Specificity of terms is an important necessary condition in term hierarchy, i.e., if X1 is one of ancestors of X2, then Spec(X1) is less than Spec(X2).",
        "Specificity can be applied in automatic construction and evaluation of term hierarchy.",
        "When domain specific concepts are represented as terms, the terms are classified into two categories based on composition of unit words.",
        "In the first category, new terms are created by adding modifiers to existing terms.",
        "For example “insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus” was created by adding modifier “insulin-dependent” to its hypernym “diabetes mellitus” as in Table 1.",
        "In English, the specific level terms are very commonly compounds of the generic level term and some modifier (Croft, 2004).",
        "In this case, compositional information is important to get their meaning.",
        "In the second category, new terms are created independently to existing terms.",
        "For example, “wolfram syndrome” is semantically related to its ancestor terms as in Table 1.",
        "But it shares no common words with its ancestor terms.",
        "In this case, contextual information is used to discriminate the features of the terms.",
        "Contextual information has been mainly used to represent the characteristics of terms.",
        "(Cara-ballo, 1999A) (Grefenstette, 1994) (Hearst, 1992) (Pereira, 1993) and (Sanderson, 1999) used contextual information to find hyponymy relation between terms.",
        "(Caraballo, 1999B) also used contextual information to determine the specificity of nouns.",
        "Contrary, compositional information of terms has not been commonly discussed.",
        "We propose new specificity measuring methods based on both compositional and contextual information.",
        "The methods are formulated as information theory like measures.",
        "Because the methods don't use domain specific information, they are easily adapted to terms of other domains.",
        "This paper consists as follow: compositional and contextual information is discussed in section 2, information theory like measures are described in section 3, experiment and evaluation is discussed in section 4, finally conclusions are drawn in section 5."

        "By compositionality, the meaning of whole term can be strictly predicted from the meaning of the individual words (Manning, 1999).",
        "Many terms are created by appending modifiers to existing terms.",
        "In this mechanism, features of modifiers are added to features of existing terms to make new concepts.",
        "Word frequency and tf.idf value are used to quantify features of unit words.",
        "Internal modifier-head structure of terms is used to measure specificity incrementally.",
        "We assume that terms composed of low frequency words have large quantity of domain information.",
        "Because low frequency words appear only in limited number of terms, the words can clearly discriminate the terms to other terms.",
        "tf.idf, multiplied value of term frequency (tf) and inverse document frequency (idf), is widely used term weighting scheme in information retrieval (Manning, 1999).",
        "Words with high term frequency and low document frequency get large tf.idf value.",
        "Because a document usually discusses one topic, and words of large tf.idf values are good index terms for the document, the words are considered to have topic specific information.",
        "Therefore, if a term includes words of large tf.idf value, the term is assumed to have topic or domain specific information.",
        "If the modifier-head structure of a term is known, the specificity of the term is calculated incrementally starting from head noun.",
        "In this manner, specificity value of a term is always larger than that of the base (head) term.",
        "This result answers to the assumption that more specific term has larger specificity value.",
        "However, it is very difficult to analyze modifier-head structure of compound noun.",
        "We use simple nesting relations between terms to analyze structure of terms.",
        "A term X is nested to term Y, when X is substring of Y (Frantzi, 2000) as follows: Definition 1 If two terms X and Y are terms in same category and X is nested in Y as W1XW2, then X is base term, and W1 and W2 are modifiers of X.",
        "For example two terms, “diabetes mellitus” and “insulin dependent diabetes mellitus”, are all disease names, and the former is nested in the latter.",
        "In this case, “diabetes mellitus” is base term and “insulin dependent” is modifier of “insulin dependent diabetes mellitus” by definition 1.",
        "If multiple terms are nested in a term, the longest term is selected as head term.",
        "Specificity of Y is measured as equation (2).",
        "where Spec(X), Spec(W1), and Spec(W2) are specificity values of X, W1, W2 respectively.",

        "There are some problems that are hard to address using compositional information alone.",
        "Firstly, although features of “wolfram syndrome” share many common features with features of “insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus” in semantic level, they don’t share any common words in lexical level.",
        "In this case, it is unreasonable to compare two specificity values measured based on compositional information alone.",
        "Secondly, when several words are combined to a term, there are additional semantic components that are not predicted by unit words.",
        "For example, “wolfram syndrome” is a kind of “diabetes mellitus”.",
        "We can not predict “diabetes mellitus” from two separate words “wolfram” and “syndrome”.",
        "Finally, modifier-head structure of some terms is ambiguous.",
        "For instance, “vampire slayer” might be a slayer who is vampire or a slayer of vampires.",
        "Therefore contextual is used to complement these problems.",
        "Contextual information is distribution of surrounding words of target terms.",
        "For example, the distribution of co-occurrence words of the terms, the distribution of predicates which have the terms as arguments, and the distribution of modifiers of the terms are contextual information.",
        "General terms usually tend to be modified by other words.",
        "Contrary, domain specific terms don’t tend to be modified by other words, because they have sufficient information in themselves (Caraballo, 1999B).",
        "Under this assumption, we use probabilistic distribution of modifiers as contextual information.",
        "Because domain specific terms, unlike general words, are rarely modified in corpus, it is important to collect statistically sufficient modifiers from given corpus.",
        "Therefore accurate text processing, such as syntactic parsing, is needed to extract modifiers.",
        "As Cara-ballo’s work was for general words, they extracted only rightmost prenominals as context information.",
        "We use Conexor functional dependency parser (Conexor, 2004) to analyze the structure of sentences.",
        "Among many dependency functions defined in Conexor parser, “attr” and “mod” functions are used to extract modifiers from analyzed structures.",
