        "Topic signatures can be useful in a number of Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, such as Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and Text Summarisation.",
        "Our method takes advantage of the different way in which word senses are lexicalised in English and Chinese, and also exploits the large amount of Chinese text available in corpora and on the Web.",

        "Lexical knowledge is crucial for many NLP tasks.",
        "Huge efforts and investments have been made to build repositories with different types of knowledge.",
        "Many of them have proved useful, such as WordNet (Miller et al., 1990).",
        "However, in some areas, such as WSD, manually created knowledge bases seem never to satisfy the huge requirement by supervised machine learning systems.",
        "This is the so-called knowledge acquisition bottleneck.",
        "As an alternative, automatic or semi-automatic acquisition methods have been proposed to tackle the bottleneck.",
        "For example, Agirre et al.",
        "(2001) tried to automatically extract topic signatures by querying a search engine using monosemous synonyms or other knowledge associated with a concept defined in WordNet.",
        "The Web provides further ways of overcoming the bottleneck.",
        "Mihalcea et al.",
        "(1999) presented a method enabling automatic acquisition of sense-tagged corpora, based on WordNet and an Internet search engine.",
        "Chklovski and Mihalcea (2002) presented another interesting proposal which turns to Web users to produce sense-tagged corpora.",
        "Another type of method, which exploits differences between languages, has shown great promise.",
        "For example, some work has been done based on the assumption that mappings of words and meanings are different in different languages.",
        "Gale et al.",
        "(1992) proposed a method which automatically produces sense-tagged data using parallel bilingual corpora.",
        "Diab and Resnik (2002) presented an unsupervised method for WSD using the same type of resource.",
        "One problem with relying on bilingual corpora for data collection is that bilingual corpora are rare, and aligned bilingual corpora are even rarer.",
        "Mining the Web for bilingual text (Resnik, 1999) is not likely to provide sufficient quantities of high quality data.",
        "Another problem is that if two languages are closely related, data for some words cannot be collected because different senses of polysemous words in one language often translate to the same word in the other.",
        "In this paper, we present a novel approach for automatically acquiring topic signatures (see Table 1 for an example of topic signatures), which also adopts the cross-lingual paradigm.",
        "To solve the problem of different senses not being distinguishable mentioned in the previous paragraph, we chose a language very distant to English – Chinese, since the more distant two languages are, the more likely that senses are lexicalised differently (Resnik and Yarowsky, 1999).",
        "Because our approach only uses Chinese monolingual text, we also avoid the problem of shortage of aligned bilingual corpora.",
        "We build the topic signatures by using Chinese-English and English-Chinese bilingual lexicons and a large amount of Chinese text, which can be collected either from the Web or from Chinese corpora.",
        "Since topic signatures are potentially good training data for WSD algorithms, we set up a task to disambiguate 6 words using a WSD algorithm similar to Sch¨utze’s (1998) context-group discrimination.",
        "The results show that our topic signatures are useful for WSD.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organised as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the process of acquisition of the topic signatures.",
        "Section 3 demonstrates the application of this resource on WSD, and presents the results of our experiments.",
        "Section 4 discusses factors that could affect the acquisition process and then we conclude in Section 5."

        "Translate an English ambiguous word w to Chinese, using an English-Chinese lexicon.",
        "Given the assumption we mentioned, each sense si of w maps to a distinct Chinese word1.",
        "At the end of this step, we have produced a set C, which consists of Chinese words {c1, c2, ..., cn}, where ci is the translation corresponding to sense si of w, and n is the number of senses that w has.",

        "Shallow process these Chinese corpora.",
        "Text segmentation and POS tagging are done in this step.",
        "4.",

        "In our experiments, we did the former.",
        "The complete process is automatic, and unsupervised.",
        "At the end of this process, for each sense si of an ambiguous word w, we have a large set of English contexts.",
        "Each context is a topic signature, which represents topical information that tends to co-occur with sense si.",
        "Note that an element in our topic signatures is not necessarily a single English word.",
        "It can be a set of English words which are translations of a Chinese word c. For example, the component of a topic signature, {vesture, clothing, clothes}, is translated from the Chinese word A.",
        "Under the assumption that the majority of c’s are unambiguous, which we discuss later, we refer to elements in a topic signature as concepts in this paper.",
        "Choosing an appropriate English-Chinese dictionary is the first problem we faced.",
        "The one we decided to use is the Yahoo!",
        "Student English-Chinese On-line Dictionary2.",
        "As this dictionary is designed for English learners, its sense granularity is far coarser-grained than that of WordNet.",
        "However, researchers argue that the granularity of WordNet is too fine for many applications, and some also proposed new evaluation standards.",
        "For example, Resnik and Yarowsky (1999) sug",
        "gested that for the purpose of WSD, the different senses of a word could be determined by considering only sense distinctions that are lexicalised cross-linguistically.",
        "Our approach is in accord with their proposal, since bilingual dictionaries interpret sense distinctions crossing two languages.",
        "For efficiency purposes, we extract our topic signatures mainly from the Mandarin portion of the Chinese Gigaword Corpus (CGC), produced by the LDC3, which contains 1.3GB of newswire text drawn from Xinhua newspaper.",
        "Some Chinese translations of English word senses could be sparse, making it impossible to extract sufficient training data simply relying on CGC.",
        "In this situation, we can turn to the large amount of Chinese text on the Web.",
        "There are many good search engines and on-line databases supporting the Chinese language.",
        "After investigation, we chose People’s Daily On-line4, which is the website for People’s Daily, one of the most influential newspaper in mainland China.",
        "It maintains a vast database of news stories, available to search by the public.",
        "Among other reasons, we chose this website because its articles have similar quality and coverage to those in the CGC, so that we could combine texts from these two resources to get a larger amount of topic signatures.",
        "Note that we can always turn to other sources on the Web to retrieve even more data, if needed.",
        "For Chinese text segmentation and POS tagging5 we adopted the freely-available software package – ICTCLAS6.",
        "This system includes a word segmenter, a POS tagger and an unknown-word recogniser.",
        "The claimed precision of segmentation is 97.58%, evaluated on a 1.2M word portion of the People’s Daily Corpus.",
        "To automatically translate the Chinese text back to English, we used the electronic LDC Chinese-English Translation Lexicon Version 3.0.",
        "An alternative was to use machine translation software, which would yield a rather different type of resource, but this is beyond the scope of this paper.",
        "Then, we filtered the topic signatures with",
        "a stop-word list, to ensure only content words are included in our final results.",
        "One might argue that, since many Chinese words are also ambiguous, a Chinese word may have more than one English translation and thus translated concepts in topic signatures would still be ambiguous.",
        "This happens for some Chinese words, and will inevitably affect the performance of our system to some extent.",
        "A practical solution is to expand the queries with different descriptions associated with each sense of w, normally provided in a bilingual dictionary, when retrieving the Chinese text.",
        "To get an idea of the baseline performance, we did not follow this solution in our experiments.",
        "The topic signatures we acquired contain rich topical information.",
        "But they do not provide any other types of linguistic knowledge.",
        "Since they were created by word to word translation, syntactic analysis of them is not possible.",
        "Even the distances between the target ambiguous word and its context words are not reliable because of differences in word order between Chinese and English.",
        "Table 1 lists two sets of topic signatures, each containing the 20 most frequent nouns, ranked by occurrence count, that surround instances of the financial sense of interest.",

        "Words, contexts and senses are represented in Word Space, a high-dimensional, real-valued space in which closeness corresponds to semantic similarity.",

        "In our adaptation of this algorithm, we omitted the clustering step, because our data has already been sense classified according to the senses defined in the English-Chinese dictionary.",

        "This defect makes our WSD algorithm unable to use the possibly strong topical information contained in those words.",
        "Secondly, errors generated during Chinese segmentation could affect the distributions of words.",
        "For example, a Chinese string ABC may be segmented as either A + BC or AB + C; assuming the former is correct whereas AB + C was produced by the segmenter, distributions of words A, AB, BC, and C are all affected accordingly.",
        "Other factors such as cultural differences reflected in the different languages could also affect the results of this knowledge acquisition process.",
        "In our experiments, we adopted Chinese as a source language to retrieve English topic signatures.",
        "Nevertheless, our technique should also work on other distant language pairs, as long as there are existing bilingual lexicons and large monolingual corpora for the languages used.",
        "For example, one should be able to build French topic signatures using Chinese text, or Spanish topic signatures from Japanese text.",
