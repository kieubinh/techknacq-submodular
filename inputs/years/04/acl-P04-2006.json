        "A web-based automated reading strategy trainer called iSTART (Interactive Strategy Trainer for Active Reading and Thinking) adaptively assigns individual students to appropriate reading training programs.",
        "It follows the SERT (Self-Explanation Reading Training) methodology developed by McNamara (in press) as a way to improve high school students’ reading ability by teaching them to use active reading strategies in self-explaining difficult texts.",
        "Details of the strategies can be found in McNamara (in press) and of iSTART in Levinstein et al.",
        "(2003) During iSTART’s practice module, the student self-explains a sentence.",
        "Then the trainer analyzes the student’s explanation and responds.",
        "The current system uses simple word matching algorithms to evaluate the student’s input that do not yield results that are sufficiently reliable or accurate.",
        "We therefore propose a new system for handling the student’s explanation more effectively.",
        "Two major tasks of this semantically-based system are to (1) construct an internal representation of sentences and explanations and (2) recognize the reading strategies the student uses beginning with paraphrasing.",
        "Construct an Internal Representation: We transform the natural language explanation into a representation suitable for later analysis.",
        "The Sentence Parser gives us a syntactically and morphologically tagged representation.",
        "We transform the output of the Link Grammar parser (CMU, 2000) that generates syntactical and morphological information into an appropriate knowledge representation using the Representation Generator.",
        "Recognize Paraphrasing: In what follows, we list the paraphrase patterns that we plan to cover and define a recognition model for each pattern.",
        "This involves two steps: (1) recognizing paraphrasing patterns, and (2) reporting the result.",
        "The Paraphrase Recognizer compares two internal representation (one is of a given sentence and another is of the student’s explanation) and finds paraphrase matches (“concept-relation-concept” triplet matches) according to a paraphrasing pattern.",
        "The Reporter provides the final summary of the total paraphrase matches, noting unmatched information in either the sentence or the explanation.",
        "Based on the similarity measure, the report will include whether the student has fully or partially paraphrased a given sentence and whether it contains any additional information."

        "McNamara (in press), on the other hand, does not consider using definitions or examples to be part of paraphrasing, but rather considers them elaboration.",
        "Stede (1996) considers different aspects or intentions to be paraphrases if they mention the same content or situation.",

        "To recognize paraphrasing, we convert natural language sentences into Conceptual Graphs (CG, Sowa, 1983; 1992) and then compare two CGs for matching according to paraphrasing patterns.",

        "A triplet match means that a triplet from the student’s input matches with a triplet from the given sentence.",

        "It is also possible that several triplets of one sentence together match a single triplet of the other.",

        "This process mainly requires mapping one or more Link connector types into a relation of the conceptual graph.",
        "A parse from the Link Grammar consists of triplets: starting word, an ending word, and a connector type between these two words.",
        "For example, [1 2 (Sp)] means word-1 connects to word-2 with a subject connector or that word-1 is the subject of word-2.",
        "The sentence “A walnut is eaten by a monkey” is parsed as follows:",
        "We then convert each Link triplet into a corresponding CG triplet.",
        "Two words in the Link triplet can be converted into two concepts of the CG.",
        "To decide whether to put a word on the left or the right side of the CG triplet, we define a mapping rule for each Link connector type.",

        "We illustrate our approach to paraphrase pattern recognition on single sentences: using synonyms (single or compound-word synonyms and idiomatic expressions), changing the voice, using a different word form, breaking a long sentence into smaller sentences, substituting a definition for a word, and changing the sentence structure.",
        "Preliminaries: Before we start the recognition process, we need to assume that we have all the information about the text: each sentence has various content words (excluding such ‘stop words’ as a, an, the, etc.",
        "); each content word has a definition together with a list of synonyms, antonyms, and other relations provided by WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "To prepare a given text and a sentence, we plan to have an automated process that generates necessary information as well as manual intervention to verify and rectify the automated result, if necessary.",
        "Single-Word Synonyms: First we discover that both CGs have the same pattern and then we check whether words in the same position are synonyms.",
        "Example:",
        "we need to be able to match a word and its compound-word synonym.",
        "For example, ‘install’ has ‘set up’ and ‘put in’ as its compound-word synonyms.",
        "The compound words are declared by the parser program.",
        "During the preliminary processing CGs are pre-generated.",
        "Then, this case will be treated like the single-word synonym.",
        "Idiomatic Clause/Phrase: For each idiom, a CG will be generated and used in the comparison process.",
        "For example, the phrase ‘give someone a hand’ means ‘help’.",
        "The preliminary process will generate the following conceptual graph:",
        "In this example, one might say that a ‘hand’ might be an actual (physical) hand rather than a synonym phrase for ‘help’.",
        "To reduce this particular ambiguity, the analysis of the context may be necessary.",
        "Voice: Even if the voice of a sentence is changed, it will have the same CG.",
        "For example, both “Jenny helps Kay” and “Kay is helped by Jenny” have the same graphs as follows:",
        "At this time we are assuming that if two CGs are exactly the same, it means paraphrasing by changing voice pattern.",
        "However, we plan to introduce a modified conceptual graph that retains the original sentence structure so that we can verify that it was paraphrasing by change of voice and not simple copying.",
        "Part-of-speech: A paraphrase can be generated by changing the part-of-speech of some keywords.",
        "In the following example, the student uses “a historical life story” instead of “life history”, and ‘similarity’ instead of ‘similar’.",
        "Original sentence: “All thunderstorms have a similar life history.” Student’s Explanation: “All thunderstorms have similarity in their historical life story.” To find this paraphrasing pattern, we look for the same word, or a word that has the same base-form.",
        "In this example, the sentences share the same base-form for ‘similar’ and ‘similarity’ as well as for ‘history’ and ‘historical’.",
        "Breaking long sentence: A sentence can be explained by small sentences coupled up together in such a way that each covers a part of the original sentence.",
        "We integrate CGs of all sentences in the student’s input together before comparing it with the original sentence.",
        "We will provisionally assume that the student uses only the words that appear in the sentence in this breaking down process.",
        "One solution is to combine graphs from all sentences together.",
        "This can be done by merging graphs of the same concept.",
        "This process involves pronoun resolution.",
        "In this example, ‘it’ could refer to ‘life’ or ‘history’.",
        "Our plan is to exercise all possible pronoun references and select one that gives the best paraphrasing recognition result.",
        "Definition/Meaning: A CG is pre-generated for a definition of each word and its associations (synonyms, idiomatic expressions, etc.).",
        "To find a paraphrasing pattern of using the definition, for example, a ‘history’ means “the continuum of events occurring in succession leading from the past to the present and even into the future”, we build a CG for this as shown below:",
        "We refine this CG by incorporating CGs of the definition into a single integrated CG, if possible.",
        "From WordNet 2.0, the synonyms of ‘past’, ‘present’, and ‘future’ found to be “begin, start, beginning process”, “middle, go though, middle process”, and “end, last, ending process”, respectively.",
        "The following example shows how they can be used in recognizing paraphrases.",
        "From this CG, we found the use of ‘begin’, ‘go-through’, and ‘end’, which are parts of the CG of history’s definition.",
        "These together with the correspondence of words in the sentences show that the student has used paraphrasing by using a definition of ‘history’ in the self-explanation.",
        "Sentence Structure: The same thing can be said in a number of different ways.",
        "For example, to say “There is someone happy”, we can say “Someone is happy”, “A person is happy”, or “There is a person who is happy”, etc.",
        "As can be easily seen, all sentences have a similar CG triplet of “[Person: 3] – > (Char) – > [Happy]” in their CGs.",
        "But, we cannot simply say that they are paraphrases of each other; therefore, need to study more on possible solutions."
