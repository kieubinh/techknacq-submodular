        "Lexical semantic classes group together words that have a similar meaning.",
        "Knowledge about verbs is especially important, since verbs are the primary means of structuring and conveying meaning in sentences.",
        "Manually built semantic classifications of English verbs have been used for different applications such as machine translation (Dorr, 1997), verb subcategorisation acquisition (Korhonen, 2002a) or parsing (Schneider, 2003).",
        "(Levin, 1993) has established a large-scale classification of English verbs based on the hypothesis that the meaning of a verb and its syntactic behaviour are related, and therefore semantic information can be induced from the syntactic behaviour of the verb.",
        "A classification of Spanish verbs based on the same hypothesis has been developed by (V´azquez et al., 2000).",
        "But manually constructing large-scale verb classifications is a labour-intensive task.",
        "For this reason, various methods for automatically classifying verbs using machine learning techniques have been attempted ((Merlo and Stevenson, 2001), (Stevenson and Joa-nis, 2003), (Schulte im Walde, 2003)).",
        "In this article we present experiments aiming at automatically classifying Spanish verbs into lexical semantic classes based on their subcategorisation frames.",
        "We adopt the idea that a description of verbs in terms of their syntactic behaviour is useful for acquiring their semantic properties.",
        "The classification task at hand is achieved through a process that requires different steps: we first extract from a partially parsed corpus the probabilities of the subcategorisation frames for each verb.",
        "Then, the acquired probabilities are used as features describing the verbs and given as input to an unsupervised classification algorithm that clusters together the verbs according to the similarity of their descriptions.",
        "For the task of acquiring verb subcategorisation frames, we adapt to the specificities of the Spanish language well-known techniques that have been developed for English, and our results compare favourably to the sate of the art results obtained for English (Korhonen, 2002b).",

        "Subcategorisation frames encode the information of how many arguments are required by the verb, and of what syntactic type.",
        "Acquiring the subcat-egorization frames for a verb involves, in the first place, distinguishing which constituents are its arguments and which are adjuncts, elements that give an additional piece of information to the sentence.",
        "Moreover, sentences contain other constituents that are not included in the subcategorisation frames of verbs: these are sub-constituents that are not structurally attached to the verb, but to other constituents."

      "heading": "2.1 Methodology and Materials",
      "text": [
        "We experiment our methodology on two corpora of different sizes, both consisting of Spanish newswire text: a 3 million word corpus, hereafter called small corpus, and a 50 million word corpus, hereafter called large corpus.",
        "They are both POS tagged and partially parsed using the MS-analyzer, a partial parser for Spanish that includes named entities recognition (Atserias et al., 1998).",
        "In order to collect the frequency distributions of Spanish subcategorisation frames, we adapt a methodology that has been developed for English to the specificities of the Spanish language ((Brent, 1993), (Manning, 1993), (Korhonen, 2002b)).",
        "It consists in extracting from the corpus pairs made of a verb and its co-occurring constituents that are a possible pattern of a frame, and then filtering out the patterns that do not have a probability of co-occurrence with the verb high enough to be considered its arguments.",
        "We establish a set of 11 possible Spanish subcategorisation frames.",
        "These are the plausible combinations of a maximum of 2 of the following constituents: nominal phrases, prepositional phrases, temporal sentential clauses, gerundive sentential clauses, infinitival sentential clauses, and infinitival sentential clauses introduced by a preposition.",
        "The individual prepositions are also taken into account as part of the subcategorisation frame types.",
        "Adapting a methodology that has been thought for English presents a few problems, because English is a language with a strong word order constraint, while in Spanish the order of constituents is freer.",
        "Although the unmarked order of constituents is Subject Verb Object with the direct object preceding the indirect object, in naturally occurring language the constituents can be moved to non-canonical positions.",
        "Since we extract the patterns from a partially parsed corpus, which has no information on the attachment or grammatical function of the constituents, we have to take into account that the extraction is an approximation.",
        "There are various phenomena that can lead us to an erroneous extraction of the constituents.",
        "As an illustrative example, in Spanish it is possible to have an inversion in the order of the objects, as can be observed in sentence (1), where the indirect object a Straw (“to Straw”) precedes the direct object los alegatos (“the pleas”).",
        "(1) El gobierno chileno presentar´a hoy a Straw los alegatos (... ).",
        "“The Chilean government will present today to Straw the pleas (... )”.",
        "Dealing with this kind of phenomenon introduces some noise in the data.",
        "Matching a pattern for a subcategorisation frame from sentence (1), for example, we would misleadingly induce the pattern [_ PP(a)] for the verb presentar, “present”, when in fact the correct pattern for this sentence is [_ NP PP(a)].",
        "The solution we adopt for dealing with the variations in the order of constituents is to take into account the functional information provided by cl-itics.",
        "Clitics are unstressed pronouns that refer to an antecedent in the discourse.",
        "In Spanish, clitic pronouns can only refer to the subject, the direct object, or the indirect object of the verb, and they can in most cases be disambiguated taking into account their agreement (in person, number and gender) with the verb.",
        "When we find a clitic pronoun in a sentence, we know that an argument position is already filled by it, and the rest of the constituents that are candidates for the position are either discarded or moved to another position.",
        "Sentence (2) shows an example of how the presence of clitic pronouns allows us to transform the patterns extracted.",
        "The sentence would normally match with the frame pattern [_ PP(por)], but the presence of the clitic (which has the form le) allows us to deduce that the sentence contains an indirect object, realised in the subcategorisation pattern with a prepositional phrase headed by a in second position.",
        "Therefore, we look for the following nominal phrase, la aparici´on del cad´aver, to fill the slot of the direct object, that otherwise would have not been included in the pattern.",
        "(2) Por la tarde, agentes del cuerpo nacional de polic´ıa le comunicaron por tel´efono la aparici´on del cad´aver.",
        "“In the afternoon, agents of the national police cliticIO reported by phone the apparition of the corpse.”.",
        "The collection of pairs verb + pattern obtained with the method described in the last section needs to be filtered out, because we may have extracted constituents that are in fact adjuncts, or elements that are not attached to the verb, or errors in the extraction process.",
        "We filter out the spurious patterns with a Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE), a method proposed by (Korhonen, 2002b) for this task.",
        "MLE is calculated as the ratio of the frequency of patterni+verbs over the frequency of verb.",
        "Pairs of verb+pattern that do not have a probability of co-occurring together higher than a certain threshold are filtered out.",
        "The threshold is determined empirically using held-out data (20% of the total of the corpus), by choosing from a range of values between 0.02 and 0.1 the value that yields better results against a held-out gold standard of 10 verbs.",
        "In our experiments, this method yields a threshold value of 0.05."

        "After the extraction process, the small corpus consists of 58493 pairs of verb+pattern, while the large corpus contains 1253188 pairs.' Since we include in our patterns the heads of the prepositional phrases, the corpora contain a large number of pattern types (838 in the small corpora, and 2099 in the large corpora).",
        "We investigate grouping semantically equivalent prepositions together, in order to reduce the number of pattern types, and therefore increment the probabilities on the patterns.",

        "The experiments on the large corpus give better results than the ones on the small one, and grouping similar prepositions together is useful only on the large corpus.",
        "This is probably due to the fact that the small corpus does not suffer from a too large number of frame types, and the effect of the groupings cannot be noticed.",
        "The F measure value of 66% reported on the third line of table 1, obtained on the large corpus with preposition groups, compares favourably to the results reported on (Korhonen, 2002b) for a similar experiment on English subcategorization frames, in which an F measure of 65.2 is achieved."

        "In the task of acquiring subcategorisation frames, we achieve state of the art results.",
        "On the contrary, the task of inducing semantic classes from syntactic information using a clustering algorithm leaves room for improvement.",
        "The future work for this task goes on two directions.",
        "On the one hand, the theoretical basis of the manual verb classification suggests that, although the syntactic behaviour of verbs is an important criteria for a semantic classification, other properties of the verbs should be taken into account.",
        "Therefore, the description of verbs could be further enhanced with features that reflect on meaning components and event structure.",
        "The incorporation of name entity recognition in the experiments reported here is a first step in this direction, but it is probably a too sparse feature in the data to make any significant contributions.",
        "The event structure of predicates could be statistically approximated from text by grasping the aspect of the verb.",
        "The aspect of the verbs could, in turn, be approximated by developing features that would consider the usage of certain tenses, or the presence of certain types of adverbs that imply a restriction on the aspect of the verb.",
        "Adverbs such as ”suddenly”, ”continuously”, ”often”, or even adverbial sentences such as ”every day” give information on the event structure of predicates.",
        "As they are a closed class of words, a typology of adverbs could be established to approximate the event structure of the verb (Esteve Ferrer and Merlo, 2003).",
        "On the other hand, an observation of the verb clusters output by the algorithm suggests that they are intuitively more plausible than what the evaluation measures indicate.",
        "For the purposes of possible applications, a hard clustering of verbs does not seem to be necessary, especially when even manually constructed classifications adopt arbitrary decisions and do not agree with each other: knowing which verbs are semantically similar to each other in a more “fuzzy” way might be even more useful.",
        "For this reason, a new approach could be envisaged for this task, in the direction of the work by (Weeds and Weir, 2003), by building rankings of similarity for each verb.",
        "For the purpose of evaluation, the gold standard classification could also be organised in the form of similarity rankings, based on the distance between the verbs in the hierarchy.",
        "Then, the rankings for each verb could be evaluated.",
        "The two directions appointed here, enriching the verb descriptions with new features that grasp other properties of the verbs, and envisaging a similarity ranking of verbs instead of a hard clustering, are the next steps to be taken for this work."
