        "Recently, a variety of methods have been proposed for acquisition of subcategorization frames (SCFs) from corpora (surveyed in (Korhonen, 2002)).",
        "One interesting possibility is to use these techniques to improve the coverage of existing large-scale lexicon resources such as lexicons of lexicalized grammars.",
        "However, there has been little work on evaluating the impact of acquired SCFs with the exception of (Carroll and Fang, 2004).",
        "The problem when we integrate acquired SCFs into existing lexicalized grammars is lower quality of the acquired SCFs, since they are acquired in an unsupervised manner, rather than being manually coded.",
        "If we attempt to compensate for the poor precision by being less strict in filtering out less likely SCFs, then we will end up with a larger number of noisy lexical entries, which is problematic for parsing with lexicalized grammars (Sarkar et al., 2000).",
        "We thus need some method of selecting the most reliable set of SCFs from the system output as demonstrated in (Korhonen, 2002).",
        "In this paper, I present a method of improving the accuracy of SCFs acquired from corpora in order to augment existing lexicon resources.",
        "I first estimate a confidence value that a word can have each SCF, using corpus-based statistics.",
        "To capture latent co-occurrence tendency among SCFs in the target lexicon, I next perform clustering of SCF confidence-value vectors of words in the acquired lexicon and the target lexicon.",
        "Since each centroid value of the obtained clusters indicates whether the words in that cluster have each SCF, we can eliminate SCFs acquired in error and predict possible SCFs according to the centroids.",
        "I applied my method to SCFs acquired from a corpus of newsgroup posting about mobile phones (Carroll and Fang, 2004), using the XTAG English grammar (XTAG Research Group, 2001) and the LinGO English Resource Grammar (ERG) (Copestake, 2002).",

        "The obtained SCFs comprise the total 163 SCF types which are originally based on the SCFs in the ANLT (Boguraev and Briscoe, 1987) and COMLEX (Grishman et al., 1994) dictionaries.",
        "In this example, the SCF type 24 corresponds to an SCF of transitive verb.",
        "They then obtain SCFs for the target lexicalized grammar (the LinGO ERG (Copestake, 2002) in their study) using a handcrafted translation map from these 163 types to the SCF types in the target grammar.",
        "They reported that they could achieve a coverage improvement of 4.5% but that average parse time was doubled.",
        "This is because they did not use any filtering method for the acquired SCFs to suppress an increase of the lexical ambiguity.",
        "We definitely need some method to control the quality of the acquired SCFs.",

        "In this study, I assume that a word wi appears with each SCF sj with a certain (non-zero) probability Oij(= p(sij |wi) > 0 where Ej Oij = 1), but only SCFs whose probabilities exceed a certain threshold are recognized in the lexicon.",

        "In this context, I can regard a confidence value of each SCF as a probability that the probability of that SCF exceeds the recognition threshold.",

        "When the relative frequency of sj for a word wi exceeds the recognition threshold, its confidence value confij is set to 1, and otherwise confi j is set to 0.",
        "However, an observed probability is unreliable for infrequent words.",
        "Moreover, when we want to encode confidence values of reliable SCFs in the target grammar, we cannot distinguish the confidence values of those SCFs with confidence values of acquired SCFs.",
        "The other promising way to estimate a confidence value, which I adopt in this study, is to assume a probability eij as a stochastic variable in the context of Bayesian statistics (Gelman et al., 1995).",
