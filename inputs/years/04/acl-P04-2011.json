        "The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for part-of-speech (POS) tagging is typically based on tag trigrams.",

        "Using n-gram models for n > 3 in order to incorporate global context is problematic as the tag sequences corresponding to higher order models will become increasingly rare in training data, leading to incorrect estimations of their probabilities.",
        "The trigram HMM can be extended with global contextual information, without making the model infeasible, by incorporating the context separately from the POS tags.",
        "The new information incorporated in the model is acquired through the use of a wide-coverage parser.",

        "The Hidden Markov Model (HMM) used for part-of-speech (POS) tagging is usually a second-order model, using tag trigrams, implementing the idea that a limited number of preceding tags provide a considerable amount of information on the identity of the current tag.",
        "This approach leads to good results.",
        "For example, the TnT trigram HMM tagger achieves state-of-the-art tagging accuracies on English and German (Brants, 2000).",
        "In general, however, as the model does not consider global context, mistakes are made that concern long-distance syntactic relations."

      "text": [
        "The simplifying assumption, which is the basis for HMM tagging, that the context of a given tag can be fully represented by just the previous two tags, leads to tagging errors where syntactic features that fall outside of this range, and that are needed for determining the identity of the tag at hand, are ignored.",
        "One such error in tagging Dutch is related to finiteness of verbs.",
        "This is discussed in the next paragraph and will be used in explaining the proposed approach.",
        "Other possible applications of the technique include assignment of case in German, and assignment of chunk tags in addition to part-of-speech tags.",

        "In Dutch, the plural finite form of a verb is similar in appearance to the infinitive form of the verb.",
        "In example (1-a) the second verb in the sentence, vliegen, is correctly tagged as an infinitive, but in example (1-b) the added adverb creates a surrounding in which the tagger incorrectly labels the verb as the finite plural form.",
        "Since a clause normally contains precisely one finite verb, this mistake could be avoided by remembering whether the finite verb for the current clause has already occurred, and using this information in classifying a newly observed verb as either finite or nonfinite.",
        "The trigram tagger has normally “forgotten” about any finite verb upon reaching a second verb, and is led into a mistake by other parts of the context even if the two verbs are close to each other.",
        "Basing the model on n-grams bigger than trigrams is not a solution as the n-grams would often not occur in the training data, making the associated probabilities hard to estimate."
