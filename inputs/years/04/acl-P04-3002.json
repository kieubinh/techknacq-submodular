        "Bilingual word alignment is first introduced as an intermediate result in statistical machine translation (SMT) (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "In previous alignment methods, some researchers modeled the alignments with different statistical models (Wu, 1997; Och and Ney, 2000; Cherry and Lin, 2003).",
        "Some researchers use similarity and association measures to build alignment links (Ahrenberg et al., 1998; Tufis and Barbu, 2002).",
        "However, All of these methods require a large-scale bilingual corpus for training.",
        "When the large-scale bilingual corpus is not available, some researchers use existing dictionaries to improve word alignment (Ker and Chang, 1997).",
        "However, few works address the problem of domain-specific word alignment when neither the large-scale domain-specific bilingual corpus nor the domain-specific translation dictionary is available.",
        "This paper addresses the problem of word alignment in a specific domain, where only a small domain-specific corpus is available.",
        "In the domain-specific corpus, there are two kinds of words.",
        "Some are general words, which are also frequently used in the general domain.",
        "Others are domain-specific words, which only occur in the specific domain.",
        "In general, it is not quite hard to obtain a large-scale general bilingual corpus while the available domain-specific bilingual corpus is usually quite small.",
        "Thus, we use the bilingual corpus in the general domain to improve word alignments for general words and the corpus in the specific domain for domain-specific words.",
        "In other words, we will adapt the word alignment information in the general domain to the specific domain.",
        "In this paper, we perform word alignment adaptation from the general domain to a specific domain (in this study, a user manual for a medical system) with four steps.",
        "(1) We train a word alignment model using the large-scale bilingual corpus in the general domain; (2) We train another word alignment model using the small-scale bilingual corpus in the specific domain; (3) We build two translation dictionaries according to the alignment results in (1) and (2) respectively; (4) For each sentence pair in the specific domain, we use the two models to get different word alignment results and improve the results according to the translation dictionaries.",
        "Experimental results show that our method improves domain-specific word alignment in terms of both precision and recall, achieving a 21.96% relative error rate reduction.",
        "The acquired alignment results are used in a generalized translation memory system (GTMS, a kind of computer assisted translation systems) (Simard and Langlais, 2001).",
        "This kind of system facilitates the reuse of existing translation pairs to translate documents.",
        "When translating a new sentence, the system tries to provide the pre-translated examples matched with the input and recommends a translation to the human translator, and then the translator edits the suggestion to get a final translation.",
        "The conventional TMS can only recommend translation examples on the sentential level while GTMS can work on both sentential and sub-sentential levels by using word alignment results.",
        "These GTMS are usually employed to translate various documents such as user manuals, computer operation guides, and mechanical operation manuals."
