        "Our recent research in cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) established the need for properly matching the parallel corpus used for query translation to the target corpus (Rogati and Yang, 2004).",
        "In particular, we showed that using a general purpose machine translation (MT) system such as SYSTRAN, or a general purpose parallel corpus - both of which perform very well for news stories (Peters, 2003) - dramatically fails in the medical domain.",
        "To explore solutions to this problem, we used cosine similarity between training and target corpora as respective weights when building a translation model.",
        "This approach treats a parallel corpus as a homogeneous entity, an entity that is self-consistent in its domain and document quality.",
        "In this paper, we propose that instead of weighting entire resources, we can select individual documents from these corpora in order to build a parallel corpus that is tailor-made to fit a specific target collection.",
        "To avoid confusion, it is helpful to remember that in IR settings the true test data are the queries, not the target documents.",
        "The documents are available off-line and can be (and usually are) used for training and system development.",
        "In other words, by matching the training corpora and the target documents we are not using test data for training.",
        "(Rogati and Yang, 2004) also discusses indirectly related work, such as query translation disambiguation and building domain-specific language models for speech recognition.",
        "We are not aware of any additional related work.",
        "In addition to proposing individual documents as the unit for building custom-made parallel corpora, in this paper we start exploring the criteria used for individual document selection by examining the effect of ranking documents using the length-normalized Okapi-based similarity score between them and the target corpus."

        "While selecting and weighing entire training corpora is a problem already explored by (Rogati and Yang, 2004), in this paper we focus on a lower granularity level: individual documents in the parallel corpora.",
        "We seek to construct a custom parallel corpus, by choosing individual documents which best match the testing collection.",
        "We compute the similarity between the test collection (in German or English) and each individual document in the parallel corpora for that respective language.",
        "We have a choice of similarity metrics, but since this computation is simply retrieval with a long query, we start with the Okapi model (Robertson, 1993), as implemented by the Lemur system (Olgivie and Callan, 2001).",
        "Although the Okapi model takes into account average document length, we compare it with its length-normalized version, measuring per-word similarity.",
