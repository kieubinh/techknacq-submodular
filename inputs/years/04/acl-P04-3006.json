        "In June 2003, the U.S. government organized a “Surprise Language Exercise” for the NLP community.",
        "The goal was to build the best possible language technologies for a “surprise” language in just one month (Oard, 2003).",
        "One of the main technologies pursued was machine translation (MT).",
        "Statistical MT (SMT) systems were the most successful in this scenario, because their construction typically requires less time than other approaches.",
        "On the other hand, SMT systems require large quantities of parallel text as training data.",
        "A significant collection of parallel text was obtained for this purpose from multiple sources.",
        "SMT systems were built and tested; results were reported.",
        "Much later we were surprised to discover that a significant portion of the training data was not parallel text!",
        "Some of the document pairs were on the same topic but not translations of each other.",
        "For today’s sentence-based SMT systems, this kind of data is noise.",
        "How much better would the results have been if the noisy training data were automatically filtered out?",
        "This question is becoming more important as SMT systems increase their reliance on automatically collected parallel texts.",
        "There is abundant literature on aligning parallel texts at the sentence level.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, all published methods happily misalign non-parallel inputs, without so much as a warning.",
        "There is also some recent work on distinguishing parallel texts from pairs of unrelated texts (Resnik and Smith, 2003).",
        "In this paper, we propose a solution to the more difficult problem of distinguishing parallel texts from texts that are comparable but not parallel.",
        "Definitions of “comparable texts” vary in the literature.",
        "Here we adopt a definition that is most suitable for filtering SMT training data: Two texts are “comparable” if they are not alignable at approximately the sentence level.",
        "This definition is also suitable for other applications of parallel texts, such as machine-assisted translation and computer-assisted foreign language learning.",
        "Resnik and Smith (2003) suggested three approaches to filtering non-parallel texts: STRAND, tsim, and a combination of the two.",
        "STRAND relies on mark-up within a document to reveal the document’s structure.",
        "STRAND then predicts that documents with the same structure are parallel.",
        "Tsim uses a machine-readable bilingual dictionary to find word-to-word matches between two halves of a bitext.",
        "It then computes a similarity score based on the maximum cardinality bipartite matching between the two halves.",
        "We chose to compare our method with tsim because we were interested in an approach that works with both marked up and plain text documents."

      "heading": "2 A Modification to SIMR",
      "text": [
        "Our work is based on a modification of the SIMR bitext mapping algorithm (Melamed, 1999).",
        "The SIMR algorithm attempts to construct a piecewise linear approximation to the True Bitext Map (TBM) of a bitext by greedily searching for small chains of points of correspondence.",
        "Each chain forms one section of the approximation.",
        "SIMR uses a two-phase approach to generating chains.",
        "First, it generates a set of potential points of correspondence within a search rectangle.",
        "Next, it searches the",
        "points of correspondence for chains whose points meet requirements for linearity, injectivity, and maximum angle deviation.",
        "If no such chain is found, the search rectangle is expanded and the search repeats.",
        "Our method of detecting translations is based on the premise that SIMR will find fewer points of correspondence in comparable texts than it will in parallel texts.",
        "This is because points of correspondence are more likely to occur in closely corresponding locations in the two halves of a bitext than in two documents that are merely comparable.",
        "Therefore, the bitext map of parallel texts will usually be much denser than the bitext map of comparable texts.",
        "Figure 1 above contrasts the bitext maps output by SIMR for non-parallel and parallel texts.",
        "To maximize the percentage of correctly classified document pairs, we need to maximize the difference between the map densities of parallel and comparable texts.",
        "SIMR’s built in restrictions on the chains it will accept severely limit the number of points of correspondence SIMR accepts from most non-parallel texts.",
        "Despite this SIMR still generated bitext maps for some non-parallel documents that had densities very close to the densities of parallel documents.",
        "Chains of spurious points tended to form over a longer section of the bitext than correct chains.",
        "Therefore we introduced an additional parameter that limited the length of chains that SIMR would accept.",
        "This modification of SIMR is called SIMR-cl.",
        "Chains are not perfectly linear.",
        "Therefore we cannot calculate chain length by simply taking the distance between the first and last points in the chain.",
        "Instead we find the smallest possible rectangle for which all points in the chain are interior points.",
        "We then calculate the length of the chain as the distance from the lower left corner to the upper right hand corner of the rectangle.",
        "When SIMR finds an acceptable chain the search rectangle is moved so that the point on the lower left is no longer included in the search.",
        "As a result, when SIMR is finding a large number of chains, the length of those chains will remain relatively short.",
        "Therefore, in parallel texts SIMR will find many chains and limiting the chain length will have a minimal effect on the number of chains SIMR will find.",
        "On a non-parallel text, however, SIMR will find fewer sets of points of correspondence meeting the criteria for a chain.",
        "The result is longer chains, which can be filtered by our new parameter.",
        "E.g., the non-parallel bitext map in Figure 1, which was created without the chain length parameter, has on average 630 characters between points.",
        "In contrast, running SIMR on the same pair of non-parallel documents with a maximum chain length of 700 yielded only 22 points of correspondence, or 3032 characters between points on average."

        "Training SIMR-cl, much like SIMR, requires a state space search algorithm, and an objective function to evaluate the current state.",
        "We chose to use simulated annealing to perform our state space search.",
        "The first step in training is to generate a set of parameter values that make up the current state.",
        "SIMR-cl uses the standard SIMR parameters plus the additional chain length parameter discussed above.",
        "Once the current state is set SIMR-cl generates a bitext map and calculates the density of the map.",
        "The bitext map density is defined as the number of points in the bitext map divided by the length of the main diagonal of the bitext space.",
        "We call this the SIMR-cl score.",
        "Our objective function seeks to drive the parameters to a state where we can select a single threshold value that will classify all candidate bitexts in the development set correctly.",
        "That is, all parallel texts should have a SIMR-cl score greater than the threshold, and all non-parallel texts should have a SIMR-cl score less than the threshold.",
        "We cannot achieve this by simply measuring the percentage of correctly classified candidate text pairs, because any given change to the parameters is not likely to change the classification of any candidate bitexts.",
        "In order to measure the amount of error we borrowed the concept of margin slack from the support vector machines literature.",
        "For simplicity we used a margin of zero, which reduces the margin slack of a SIMR-cl score to the difference between the threshold density, and the density of a misclassified candidate pair.",
        "Any correctly classified candidate pair is defined to have a margin slack of zero.",
        "From there we defined our objective as minimizing the sum of the margin slack of all candidate pairs.",
        "All that is left at this point is to select an optimal threshold.",

        "We repeated their experiments using 1/4 of the available candidate pairs for training and found no improvement, indicating that tsim can be optimally trained using a small development set.",

        "Second, we seem to have discovered the existence of training data for a machine learning approach to translation with summarization.",
        "Third, our results suggest that the density of a bitext map is highly correlated with its accuracy, and that this correlation is largely invariant across language pairs and text genres.",
        "If this is true, then it should be possible to train bitext mapping algorithms without any hand-aligned training data, by using map density as the objective function instead of RMS error."
