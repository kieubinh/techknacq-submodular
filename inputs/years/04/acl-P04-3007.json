        "In this work we consider a learning resource comprising over 80 foreign-language-to-English bilingual dictionaries, collected by downloading electronic dictionaries from the Internet and also scanning and running optical character recognition (OCR) software on paper dictionaries.",
        "Such a diverse parallel lexical data set has not, to our knowledge, previously been assembled and examined in its aggregate form as a lexical semantics training resource.",
        "We show that this aggregate data set admits of some surprising applications, including discovery of synonymy relationships between words and automatic induction of high-quality hierarchical word sense clusterings for English.",
        "We perform and describe several experiments deriving synonyms and sense groupings from the aggregate bilingual dictionary, and subsequently suggest some possible applications for the results.",
        "Finally, we propose that sense taxonomies of the kind introduced here, being of different provenance from those produced explicitly by lexicographers or using unsupervised corpus-driven methods, have significant value because they add diversity to the set of available resources."

        "Roughly 15K English words had at least 100 foreign entries; over 64K had at least 10 entries.",
        "No complex or hierarchical structure was assumed or used in our input dictionaries.",
        "Each was initially parsed into the “lowest common denominator” form.",
        "This consisted of a list of pairs of the form (foreign word, English word).",
        "Because bilingual dictionary structure varies widely, and even the availability and compatibility of part-of-speech tags for entries is uncertain, we made the decision to compile the aggregate resource only with data that could be extracted from every individual dictionary into a universally compatible format.",
        "The unique pairs extracted from each dictionary were then converted to 4 tuples of the form: <foreign language, dictionary name, foreign word, English word> before being inserted into the final, combined dictionary data set."

        "We began by using the above-described data set to obtain a synonymy relation between English words.",
        "In general, in a paper bilingual dictionary, each for-blond and just are synonymous with differing senses of fair eign word can be associated with a list of English words which are possible translations; in our reduced format each entry lists a single foreign word and single possible English translation, though taking a union of all English translations for a particular foreign word recreates this list.",
        "We use the notion of coentry to build the synonymy relation between English words.",
        "The per-entry coentry count Cper – entry(e1,e2) for two English words e1 and e2 is simply the number of times e1 and e2 both appear as the translation of the same foreign word (over all foreign words, dictionaries and languages).",
        "The per-dictionary coentry count Cper – dict(e1,e2), ignores the number of individual coentries within a particular dictionary and merely counts as 1 any number of coentries inside a particular dictionary.",
        "Finally, per-language coentry count Cper – lang(e1,e2) counts as 1 any number of coentries for e1 and e2 for a particular language.",

        "We found the more conservative per-dictionary and per-language counts to be a useful device, given that some dictionary creators appear sometimes to copy and paste identical synonym sets in a fairly indiscriminate fashion, spuriously inflating the Cper – entry(e1,e2) counts.",
        "Our algorithm for identifying synonyms was simple: we sorted all pairs of English words by decreasing Cper – dict(e1,e2) and, after inspection of the resulting list, cut it off at a per-dictionary and per-language count threshold1 yielding qualitatively strong results.",
        "For all word pairs e1,e2 above threshold, we say the symmetric synonymy relation S(e1,e2) holds.",

        "In fact, “deposit” and “sell” are coentries under only 2 out of 44 languages in our database (German and Swedish, which are closely related).",
        "On the other hand, near-synonymous English translations of a particular sense across a variety of languages will result in high coentry counts, as is the case with Cper – lang(deposit,sediment).",

      "text": [
        "This is the first presentation of a novel method for the induction of word sense inventories, which makes use of aggregate information from a large collection of bilingual dictionaries.",
        "One possible application of the induced sense inventories presented here is as an aid to manual construction of monolingual dictionaries or thesauri, motivated by translation distinctions across numerous world languages.",
        "While the desired granularity of sense distinction will vary according to the requirements of taste and differing applications, treating our output as a proposal to be assessed and manually modified would be a valuable labor-saving tool for lexicographers.",
        "Another application of this work is a supplemental resource for statistical machine translation (SMT).",
        "It is possible, as shown graphically in Figure 4, to recover the foreign words associated with a cluster (not just a single word).",
        "Given that the clusters provide a more complete coverage of English word types for a given sense than the English side of a particular bilingual dictionary, clusters could be used to unify bitext co-occurrence counts of foreign words with English senses in a way that typical bilingual dictionaries cannot.",
        "Unifying counts in this way would be a useful way of reducing data sparsity in SMT training.",
        "Finally, evaluation of induced sense taxonomies is always problematic.",
        "First of all, there is no agreed “correct” way to classify the possible senses of a particular word.",
        "To some degree this is because human experts disagree on particular judgments of classification, though a larger issue, as pointed out in Resnik and Yarowsky 1997, is that what constitutes an appropriate set of sense distinctions for a word is, emphatically, a function of the task at hand.",
        "The sense-distinction requirements of English-to-French machine translation differ from those of English-to-Arabic machine translation (due to differing degrees of parallel polysemy across the language pairs), and both differ from those of English dictionary construction.",
        "We believe that the translingually-motivated word-sense taxonomies developed here will prove useful for the a variety of tasks including those mentioned above.",
        "The fact that they are derived from a novel resource, not constructed explicitly by humans or derived in fully unsupervised fashion from text corpora, makes them worthy of study and incorporation in future lexicographic, machine translation, and word sense disambiguation efforts."
