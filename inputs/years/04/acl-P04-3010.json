        "Part-of-speech (POS) tagging is a job to assign a proper POS tag to each linguistic unit such as word for a given sentence.",
        "In English POS tagging, word is used as a linguistic unit.",
        "However, the number of possible words in agglutinative languages such as Korean is almost infinite because words can be freely formed by gluing morphemes together.",
        "Therefore, morpheme-unit tagging is preferred and more suitable in such languages than word-unit tagging.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of morpheme structure of a sentence, where the bold lines indicate the most likely morpheme-POS sequence.",
        "A solid line represents a transition between two morphemes across a word boundary and a dotted line represents a transition between two morphemes in a word.",
        "The previous probabilistic POS models for agglutinative languages have considered only lexical forms of morphemes, not surface forms of words.",
        "This causes an inaccurate calculation of the probability.",

        "This section describes the HMM-based morpheme-unit model.",
        "The morpheme-unit POS tagging model is to find the most likely sequence of morphemes M and corresponding POS tags T for a given sentence W, as follows (Kim et al., 1998; Lee et al., 2000):",
        "In the equation, u(>= n) denotes the number of morphemes in the sentence.",
        "A sequence of W = W1,n = W1W2 • • • Wn is a sentence of n words, and a sequence of M = m,u = m1m2 • • • mu and a sequence of T = t1,u = t1t2 • • • to denote a sequence of u lexical forms of morphemes and a sequence of u morpheme categories (POS tags), respectively.",
        "To simplify Equation 2, a Markov assumption is usually used as follows:",
        "where, to is a pseudo tag which denotes the beginning of word and is also written as BOW.",
        "p denotes a type of transition from the previous tag to the current tag.",
        "It has a binary value according to the type of the transition (either intra-word or inter-word transition).",
        "As can be seen, the word1 sequence W1,n is discarded in Equation 2.",
        "This leads to an inaccurate",
        "calculation of the probability.",
        "A lexical form of a word can be mapped to more than one surface word.",
        "In this case, although the different surface forms are given, if they have the same lexical form, then the probabilities will be the same.",
        "For example, a lexical form mong-go/nc+leul/jc2, can be mapped from two surface forms mong-gol and mong-go-leul.",
        "By applying Equation 1 and Equation 2 to both words, the following equations can be derived: •(mong-go, nc, leul, jc I mong-gol) ti P(mong-go, nc, leul, jc) (4) • (mong-go, nc, leul, j c I mong-go-leul ) ti P(mong-go, nc, leul, jc) (5) As a result, we can acquire the following equation from Equation 4 and Equation 5: P( mong-go, nc, leul, jc I mong-gol) = P(mong-go, nc, leul, jc I mong-go-leul) (6) That is, they assume that probabilities of the results that have the same lexical form are the same.",
        "However, we can easily show that Equation 6 is mistaken: Actually, P(mong-go, nc, leul, jc mong-go-leul) = 1 and P(mong-gol, nc mong-gol) zA 0.",
        "Hence, P(mong-go, nc, leul, jc I mong-gol) < P(mong-go, nc, leul, jc I mong-go-leul).",
        "To overcome the disadvantage, we propose a new tagging model that can consider the surface form."

        "Although it is not necessary to discuss the morphological analysis model in detail, we should note that surface forms are considered here.",
        "The transition model is a form of point-wise mutual information.",

        "Due to the sparse data problem, they cannot also be calculated directly from the test data.",
        "By a Markov assumption, the denominator and the numerator can be broken down into Equation 18 and Equation 19, respectively.",
