        "During recent years the Question Answering (QA) field has undergone considerable changes: question types have diversified, question complexity has increased, and evaluations have become more standardized - as reflected by the TREC QA track (Voorhees, 2003).",
        "Some recent approaches have tapped into external data sources such as the Web, encyclopedias, databases in order to find answer candidates, which may then be located in the specific corpus being searched (Dumais et al., 2002; Xu et al., 2003).",
        "As systems improve, the availability of rich resources will be increasingly critical to QA performance.",
        "While on-line resources such as the Web, WordNet, gazetteers, and encyclopedias are becoming more prevalent, no system-independent study has quantified their impact on the QA task.",
        "This paper focuses on several resources and their inherent potential to provide answers, without concentrating on a particular QA system or component.",
        "The goal is to quantify and bound the potential impact of these resources on the QA process."

        "For a TREC evaluation, answers found on the web must also be mapped to relevant documents in the local corpus.",
        "In order to evaluate the impact of web documents on TREC questions, we performed an experiment where simple queries were submitted to a web search engine.",

        "The goal was to determine the quality of query expansion as measured by the density of correct answers already present in the expansion terms.",
        "Even without filtering n-grams matching the expected answer type, simple PRF produces the correct answer in the top n-grams for more than half the questions.",
