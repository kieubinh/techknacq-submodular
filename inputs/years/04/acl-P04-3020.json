        "Graph-based ranking algorithms, such as Klein-berg’s HITS algorithm (Kleinberg, 1999) or Google’s PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998), have been traditionally and successfully used in citation analysis, social networks, and the analysis of the link-structure of the World Wide Web.",
        "In short, a graph-based ranking algorithm is a way of deciding on the importance of a vertex within a graph, by taking into account global information recursively computed from the entire graph, rather than relying only on local vertex-specific information.",
        "A similar line of thinking can be applied to lexical or semantic graphs extracted from natural language documents, resulting in a graph-based ranking model called TextRank (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004), which can be used for a variety of natural language processing applications where knowledge drawn from an entire text is used in making local ranking/selection decisions.",
        "Such text-oriented ranking methods can be applied to tasks ranging from automated extraction of keyphrases, to extractive summarization and word sense disambiguation (Mihalcea et al., 2004).",
        "In this paper, we investigate a range of graph-based ranking algorithms, and evaluate their application to automatic unsupervised sentence extraction in the context of a text summarization task.",
        "We show that the results obtained with this new unsupervised method are competitive with previously developed state-of-the-art systems."

        "We also show how these algorithms can be adapted to undirected or weighted graphs, which are particularly useful in the context of text-based ranking applications.",
        "Let G = (V, E) be a directed graph with the set of vertices V and set of edges E, where E is a subset of V x V. For a given vertex Vi, let In(Vi) be the set of vertices that point to it (predecessors), and let Out(Vi) be the set of vertices that vertex Vi points to (successors)."

        "For loosely connected graphs, with the number of edges proportional with the number of vertices, undirected graphs tend to have more gradual convergence curves.",

        "In the context of Web surfing or citation analysis, it is unusual for a vertex to include multiple or partial links to another vertex, and hence the original definition for graph-based ranking algorithms is assuming unweighted graphs.",
        "However, in our TextRank model the graphs are build from natural language texts, and may include multiple or partial links between the units (vertices) that are extracted from text.",
        "It may be therefore useful to indicate and incorporate into the model the “strength” of the connection between two vertices Viand Vj as a weight wij added to the corresponding edge that connects the two vertices.",
        "Consequently, we introduce new formulae for graph-based ranking that take into account edge weights when computing the score associated with a vertex in the graph.",
        "While the final vertex scores (and therefore rankings) for weighted graphs differ significantly as compared to their unweighted alternatives, the number of iterations to convergence and the shape of the convergence curves is almost identical for weighted and unweighted graphs."

      "text": [
        "To enable the application of graph-based ranking algorithms to natural language texts, TextRank starts by building a graph that represents the text, and interconnects words or other text entities with meaningful relations.",
        "For the task of sentence extraction, the goal is to rank entire sentences, and therefore a vertex is added to the graph for each sentence in the text.",
        "To establish connections (edges) between sentences, we are defining a “similarity” relation, where “similarity” is measured as a function of content overlap.",
        "Such a relation between two sentences can be seen as a process of “recommendation”: a sentence that addresses certain concepts in a text, gives the reader a “recommendation” to refer to other sentences in the text that address the same concepts, and therefore a link can be drawn between any two such sentences that share common content.",
        "The overlap of two sentences can be determined simply as the number of common tokens between the lexical representations of the two sentences, or it can be run through syntactic filters, which only count words of a certain syntactic category.",
        "Moreover, to avoid promoting long sentences, we are using a normalization factor, and divide the content overlap of two sentences with the length of each sentence.",
        "Formally, given two sentences Si and Sj, with a sentence being represented by the set of Ni words that appear in the sentence: Si = Wi1, Wi2 , ..., WiNi, the similarity of Si and Sj is defined as:",
        "strength of the connections between various sentence pairs in the text2.",
        "The text is therefore represented as a weighted graph, and consequently we are using the weighted graph-based ranking formulae introduced in Section 2.5.",
        "The graph can be represented as: (a) simple undirected graph; (b) directed weighted graph with the orientation of edges set from a sentence to sentences that follow in the text (directed forward); or (c) directed weighted graph with the orientation of edges set from a sentence to previous sentences in the text (directed backward).",

        "Among all algorithms, the HITSA and PageRank algorithms provide the best performance, at par with the best performing system from DUC 20025.",
        "This proves that graph-based ranking algorithms, previously found successful in Web link analysis, can be turned into a state-of-the-art tool for sentence extraction when applied to graphs extracted from texts.",
        "Notice that TextRank goes beyond the sentence “connectivity” in a text.",
        "For instance, sentence 15 in the example provided in Figure 1 would not be identified as “important” based on the number of connections it has with other vertices in the graph6, but it is identified as “important” by TextRank (and by humans – according to the reference summaries for this text).",
        "Another important advantage of TextRank is that it gives a ranking over all sentences in a text – which means that it can be easily adapted to extracting very short summaries, or longer more explicative summaries, consisting of more than 100 words."

        "Intuitively, TextRank works well because it does not only rely on the local context of a text unit (vertex), but rather it takes into account information recursively drawn from the entire text (graph).",
        "Through the graphs it builds on texts, TextRank identifies connections between various entities in a text, and implements the concept of recommendation.",
        "A text unit recommends other related text units, and the strength of the recommendation is recursively computed based on the importance of the units making the recommendation.",
        "In the process of identifying important sentences in a text, a sentence recommends another sentence that addresses similar concepts as being useful for the overall understanding of the text.",
        "Sentences that are highly recommended by other sentences are likely to be more informative for the given text, and will be therefore given a higher score.",
        "An important aspect of TextRank is that it does not require deep linguistic knowledge, nor domain or language specific annotated corpora, which makes it highly portable to other domains, genres, or languages."
