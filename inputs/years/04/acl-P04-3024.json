        "Text classification is the assignment of predefined categories to text documents.",
        "Text classification has many applications in natural language processing tasks such as Email filtering, prediction of user preferences and organization of web content.",
        "The Naive Bayes classifier is a popular machine learning technique for text classification because it performs well in many domains, despite its simplicity (Domingos and Pazzani, 1997).",
        "Naive Bayes assumes a stochastic model of document generation.",
        "Using Bayes’ rule, the model is inverted in order to predict the most likely class for a new document.",
        "We assume that documents are generated according to a multinomial event model (McCallum and Nigam, 1998).",
        "Thus a document is represented as a vector di = (xi1 ... xilVl) of word counts where V is the vocabulary and each xit E {0, 1, 2,... } indicates how often wt occurs in di.",
        "Given model parameters p(wt |cj) and class prior probabilities p(cj ) and assuming independence of the words, the most likely class for a document di is computed as",
        "where n(wt, di) is the number of occurrences of wt in di.",
        "p(wt|cj) and p(cj) are estimated from training documents with known classes, using maximum",
        "It is common practice to use only a subset of the words in the training documents for classification to avoid overfitting and make classification more efficient.",
        "This is usually done by assigning each word a score f (wt) that measures its usefulness for classification and selecting the N highest scored words.",
        "One of the best performing scoring functions for feature selection in text classification is mutual information (Yang and Pedersen, 1997).",
        "The mutual information between two random variables, MI(X; Y), measures the amount of information that the value of one variable gives about the value of the other (Cover and Thomas, 1991).",
        "Note that in the multinomial model, the word variable W takes on values from the vocabulary V. In order to use mutual information with a multinomial model, one defines new random variables Wt E {0, 1} with p(Wt = 1) = p(W = wt) (Mc-Callum and Nigam, 1998; Rennie, 2001).",
        "Then the mutual information between a word wt and the class variable C is",
        "where p(x, cj) and p(x) are short for p(Wt = x, cj ) and p(Wt = x).",
        "p(x,cj), p(x) and p(cj) are estimated from the training documents by counting how often wt occurs in each class."

        "There is a strong connection between Naive Bayes and KL-divergence (Kullback-Leibler divergence, relative entropy).",

        "much one probability distribution is different from another (Cover and Thomas, 1991).",
        "It is defined (for discrete distributions) by",
        "By viewing a document as a probability distribution over words, Naive Bayes can be interpreted in an information-theoretic framework (Dhillon et al., 2002).",
        "Let p(wt |d) = n(wt,d)/|d|.",
        "Taking logarithms and dividing by the length of d, (1) can be rewritten as",
        "This means that Naive Bayes assigns to a document d the class which is “most similar” to d in terms of the distribution of words.",

        "We define a new scoring function for feature selection based on the following considerations.",
        "In the previous section we have seen that Naive Bayes assigns a document d the class c* such that the “distance” between d and c* is minimized.",
        "A classification error occurs when a test document is closer to some other class than to its true class, in terms of KL-divergence.",
        "We seek to define a scoring function such that words whose distribution in the individual training documents of a class is much different from the distribution in the class (according to (2)) receive a lower score, while words with a similar distribution in all training documents of the same class receive a higher score.",
        "By removing words with a lower score from the vocabulary, the training documents of each class become more similar to each other, and therefore, also to the class, in terms of word distribution.",
        "This leads to more homogeneous classes.",
        "Assuming that the test documents and training documents come from the same distribution, the similarity between the test documents and their respective classes will be increased as well, thus resulting in higher classification accuracy.",
        "We now make this more precise.",
        "Let S = {d1, ... , dlSl } be the set of training documents, and denote the class of di with c(di).",
        "The average KL-divergence for a word wt between the training documents and their classes is given by",
        "One problem with (8) is that in addition to the conditional probabilities p(wt |cj) for each word and each class, the computation considers each individual document, thus resulting in a time requirement of O (|S |).1 In order to avoid this additional complexity, instead of KLt(S) we use an approximation �KLt(S), which is based on the following two",
        "assumptions: (i) the number of occurrences of wt is the same in all documents that contain wt, (ii) all documents in the same class cj have the same length.",
        "Let Njt be the number of documents in cj that contain wt, and let",
        "be the average probability of wt in those documents in cj that contain wt (if wt does not occur in cj, set ˜pd (wt |cj) = 0).",
        "Then KLt (S) reduces to",
        "Plugging in (9) and (3) and defining q(wt |cj) = Njt /|cj |, we get",
        "Note that computing �KLt(S) only requires a statistics of the number of words and documents for each",
        "class, not per document.",
        "Thus KLt (S) can be computed in O (IC I) .",
        "Typically, JCJis much smaller than XS1.",
        "Another important thing to note is the following.",
        "By removing words with an uneven distribution in the documents of the same class, not only the documents in the class, but also the classes themselves may become more similar, which reduces the ability to distinguish between different classes.",
        "Let p(wt) be the number of occurrences of wt in all training documents, divided by the total number of words,",
        "�Kt (S) can be interpreted as an approximation of the average divergence of the distribution of wt in the individual training documents from the global distribution (averaged over all training documents in all classes).",
        "If wt is independent of the class, then �Kt (S) = �KLt(S).",
        "The difference between the two is a measure of the increase in homogeneity of the training documents, in terms of the distribution of wt, when the documents are clustered in their true classes.",
        "It is large if the distribution of wt is similar in the training documents of the same class but dissimilar in documents of different classes.",
        "In analogy to mutual information, we define our new scoring function as the difference",
        "and p(wt Icj) is estimated as in (2)."
