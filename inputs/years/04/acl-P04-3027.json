        "Second, some senses in the dictionary are null (or non-existing) in the used corpora.",
        "Conversely, we have to generate more senses depending on the corpora, and we define these senses with practical senses.",
        "Our goal in this study is to revise sense boundary in the existing dictionaries with practical senses from the large-scaled corpus.",
        "The collocation from the large-scaled corpus contains semantic information.",
