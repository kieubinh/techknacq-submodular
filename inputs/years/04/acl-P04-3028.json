        "In this paper we investigate the automatic labeling of spoken dialogue data, in order to train a classifier that predicts students’ emotional states in a human-human speech-based tutoring corpus.",
        "Supervised training of classifiers requires annotated data, which demands costly efforts from human annotators.",
        "One approach to minimize this effort is to use Co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998), a semi-supervised algorithm in which two learners are iteratively combining their outputs to increase the training set used to retrain each other and generate more labeled data automatically.",
        "The main focus of this paper is to explore how Co-training can be applied to annotate spoken dialogues.",
        "A major challenge to address is in reducing the dimensionality of the many features available to the learners.",
        "The motivation for our research arises from the need to annotate a human-human speech corpus for the ITSPOKE (Intelligent Tutoring SPOKEn dialogue System) project (Litman and Silliman, 2004).",
        "Ongoing research in ITSPOKE aims to recognize emotional states of students in order to build a spoken dialogue tutoring system that automatically predicts and adapts to the student’s emotions.",
        "ITSPOKE uses supervised learning to predict emotions with spoken dialogue data.",
        "Although a large set of dialogues have been collected, only 8% of them have been annotated (10 dialogues with a total of 350 utterances), due to the laborious annotation process.",
        "We believe that increasing the size of the training set with more annotated examples will increase the accuracy of the system’s predictions.",
        "Therefore, we are looking for a less labour-intensive approach to data annotation."

        "were coded based on both what the student said and how he or she said it.",

        "51.71% of these turns were labeled as Non-Emotional and the rest as Emotional.",
        "Also prior to our study, each annotated turn was represented as a vector of 449 features hypothesized to be relevant for emotion prediction (Forbes-Riley and Litman, 2004).",

        "To address the challenge of training classifiers when only a small set of labeled examples is available, Blum and Mitchell (1998) proposed Co-training as a way to bootstrap classifiers from a large set of unlabeled data.",
        "Under this framework, two (or more) learners are trained iteratively in tandem.",
        "In each iteration, the learners classify more unlabeled data to increase the training data for each other.",
        "In theory, the learners must have distinct views of the data (i.e., their features are conditionally independent given the label example), but some studies suggest that Co-training can still be helpful even when the independence assumption does not hold (Goldman, 2000).",
        "To apply Co-training to our task, we develop two high-precision learners: Emotional and Non-Emotional.",
        "The learners use different features because each is maximizing the precision of its label (possibly with low recall).",
        "While we have not proved these two learners are conditionally independent, this division of expertise ensures that the learners are different.",
        "The algorithm for our Co-training system is shown in Figure 1.",
        "Each learner selects the examples whose predicted labeled corresponds to its expertise class with the highest confidence.",
        "The maximum number of iterations and the number of examples added per iteration are parameters of the system."
