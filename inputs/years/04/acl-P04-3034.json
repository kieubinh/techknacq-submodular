        "In the process of automatic classifying documents into several predefined classes – text categorization (Sebastiani, 2002) – text documents are usually seen as sets or bags of all the words that have appeared in a document, maybe after removing words in a stop-list.",
        "In this paper we describe a novel approach to text categorization in which each documents is first split into subparts, called fragments.",
        "Each fragment is consequently seen as a new document which shares the same label with its source document.",
        "We introduce two variants of this approach – skip-tail and fragments.",
        "Both of these methods are briefly described below.",
        "We demonstrate the increased accuracy that we observed."

        "The first method uses only the first X sentences of a document and is henceforth referred to as skip-tail.",
        "The idea behind this approach is that the beginning of each document contains enough information for the classification.",
        "In the process of learning, each document is first replaced by its initial part.",
        "The learning algorithm then uses only these initial fragments as learning (test) examples.",
        "We also sought the minimum length of initial fragments that preserve the accuracy of the classification."

        "This method is henceforth referred to as fragments.",
        "Initially, the classifier is used to generate a model from these fragments.",
        "Subsequently, the model is utilized to classify unseen documents (test set) which have also been split into fragments."

        "3 Classification by means of fragments of documents The class of the whole document is determined as follows.",
        "Let us take a document T which consists of fragments 11, ... , l,, such that T = U 1 l2 and Vi, j : i :�4 j n l2 n lj = 0.",
        "The value of n depends on the length of the document T and on the number of sentences in the fragments.",
        "Let L = {ll, ... , l,,}, and C denotes the set of possible classes.",
        "We than use the learned model to assign a class c(l) E C to each of the fragments l E L. Let p(l, c(l)) be the confidence of the classification fragment l into the class c(l).",
        "This confidence measure is computed as an estimated probability of the predicted class.",
        "Then for each fragment l E L classified to the class c E C we define c(L, c) = {l E L c(1) = c}.",
        "The confidence of the classification of the whole document T into c is computed as follows",
        "Finally, the class c(T) which is assigned to a document T is computed according to the following definition:",
        "In other words, a document T is classified to a c E C, which was assigned to the most fragments from L (the most frequent class).",
        "If there are two classes with the same cardinality, the confidence measure P(L, c) is employed.",
        "We also tested another method that exploited the confidence of classification but the results were not satisfactory."
