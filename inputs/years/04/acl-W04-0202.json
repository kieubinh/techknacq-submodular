        "In this paper, we present a preliminary version of COOPML, a language designed for annotating cooperative discourse.",
        "We investigate the different linguistic marks that identify and characterize the different forms of cooperativity found in written texts from FAQs, Forums and emails.",
        "1 What are cooperative responses and why annotate them ?",
        "Grice (Grice, 1975) proposed a number of maxims that describe various ways in which speakers are engaged in a cooperative conversation.",
        "Human conversations are governed by implicit rules, used and understood by all conversants.",
        "The contents of a response can be just direct w.r.t.",
        "the question literal contents, but it can also go beyond what is normally expected, in a relevant way, in order to meet the questionerâ€™s expectations.",
        "Such a response is said to be cooperative.",
        "Following these maxims and related works, e.g. (Searle, 1975), in the early 1990s, a number of forms of cooperative responses were identified.",
        "Most of the efforts in these studies and systems focussed on the foundations and on the implementation of reasoning procedures (Gal, 1988), (Minock et ali., 1996), while little attention was paid to question analysis and NL response generation.",
        "An overview of these systems can be found in (Gaster-land et al., 1994) and in (Webber et ali., 2002), based on works by (Hendrix et ali., 1978), (Kaplan, 1982), (Mays et ali., 1982), among others.",
        "These systems include e.g. the identification of false presuppositions and various types of misunderstandings found in questions.",
        "They also include reasoning schemas based e.g. on constant relaxation to provide approximate or alternative, but relevant, answers when the direct question has no response.",
        "Intensional reasoning schemas can also be used to generalize over lists of basic responses or to construct summaries.",
        "The framework of Advanced Reasoning for Question Answering (QA) systems, as described in a recent road map, raises new challenges since answers can no longer be only directly extracted from texts (as in TREC) or databases, but requires the use of a domain knowledge base, including a conceptual ontology, and dedicated inference mechanisms.",
        "Such a perspective, obviously, reinforces and gives a whole new insight to cooperative answering.",
        "For example, if one asks 1:",
        "where close-by alternatives are proposed, involving relaxing Borme, identified as a village, into close-by villages or towns that respond to the question, evaluating proximity, and finally sorting the responses, e.g. by increasing distance from Borme.",
        "This simple example shows that, if a direct response cannot be found, several forms of knowledge, reasoning schemas and strategies need to be used.",
        "This is one of the major challenges of advanced QA.",
        "Another challenge, not yet addressed, is the generation of the response in natural language.",
        "Our first aim is to study, via corpus annotations, how humans deploy cooperative behaviours and procedures, by what means, and what is the form of the responses provided.",
        "Our second aim is to construct a linguistically and cognitively adequate formal model that integrates language, knowledge and inference aspects involved in cooperative responses.",
        "Our assumption is then that an automatic cooperative QA system, although much more stereotyped than any natural system, could be induced from natural productions without loosing too much of the cooperative contents produced by humans.",
        "From that point of view, the results presented in this paper establish a base for investigating coop-erativity empirically and not only in an abstract and",
        "introspective way.",
        "Our goal is to get a kind of empirical testing and then model for cooperative answering, to get clearer ideas on the structure of cooperative discourse, the reasoning processes involved, the types of knowledge involved and the NL expression modes."

        "This is not only due to the generic character of our definitions, but also to the existence of continuums between categories, and to the interpretation of responses that may vary depending on context, profile and culture of annotators.",
        "An experiment carried out on three independent subjects (annotation task followed by a discussion of the results) reveals that there is a clear consensus of 80% on the annotations we did ourselves.",
        "The other 20% reflect interpretation variations, in general highly contextual.",
        "These 20% are almost the same cases for the three subjects.",
        "In particular, at the level of additional information (CR), we observed some differences in judgement in particular between restrictions (AR) and warnings (AA), and a few others between CSFH and CSFC whose differences may sometimes be only superficial (presentation of the arguments of the response)."

        "For that purpose, we designed a programme in Prolog (for fast prototyping) that uses: (1) the domain lexicon and ontology, to have access e.g. to term lexicalizations and morphology, and (2) a set of â€™localâ€™ grammars that implement the different marks.",
        "Since these marks involve lexical and morphological variations, negation, and some long-distance dependencies, grammars are a good solution.",
        "Tests were carried out on a new corpus, essentially from airlines FAQ.",
        "134 QA pairs have been selected from this corpus containing some form of cooperativity.",
        "The annotation of this corpus is automatic, while the evaluation of the results is manual and is carried out in parallel by both ourselves and by an external professional evaluator.",
        "These 134 QA pairs contain a total of 237 MU, therefore an average of 1.76 MU per response.",
        "Most responses have 2 MU, the maximum observed being 4.",
        "Surprisingly, out of the 134 pairs, only 108 contain direct responses followed by various CSF, the other 16 only contain cooperative know-how responses (CSF), without any direct response part.",
        "Evaluation results, although carried out on a relatively small set of QA pairs, give good indications on the accuracy of the linguistic marks, and also on the typology of the different MU.",
        "We consider here the MU: DS, AJ, AR, AA, as characterized above:",
        "A: number of MU annotated correctly for that category, B: MU not annotated (no decision made), C: incorrect annotation.",
        "MU boundaries have been correctly identified in 88% of the cases, they are mostly related to punctuation marks.",
        "There are obviously a few delicate cases where annotation is difficult if not impossible.",
        "First, we observed a few discontinuities: an MU can be fragmented.",
        "In that case, it is necessary to add an index to the tag so that the different fragments can be unambiguously related, as in: Q: What is the deadline for an internet reservation?",
        "R: < DR index = 1 > In the case of an electronic ticket, you can reserve up to 24h prior to departure < /DR > .",
        "< B > You just need to show up at the registration desk < /B > .",
        "< DR index = 1 > In the case of a traditional ticket ... < /DR >.",
        "The index=1 allows to tie the two fragments of the enumeration.",
        "In a number of cases the direct response part is rather indirect, making its identification via the means presented above quite delicate: Q: Iforgot to note my reservation number, how can I get it?",
        "R: A confirmation email has been sent to you as soon as the reservation has been finalized.... To identify this portion of the response as a DR, it is necessary to infer that the email is a potential container for a reservation number."

        "This work is of much interest to define the formal structure of a cooperative discourse.",
        "It can be used in discourse parsing as well as generation, where it needs to be paired with other structures such as rhethorical structures.",
        "It is so far limited to written forms.",
        "We believe the same global structure, with minor adaptations and additional marks, is valid for dialogues and oral communication, but this remains to be investigated.",
        "The main application area where our work is of interest is probably advanced Question-Answering systems.",
        "Besides cooperative discourse annotation, we have investigated the different forms lexicalization takes between the question and the different parts of the response, the direct response (DR), the response elaboration (ER) and the additional information (CR).",
        "These are subtle realizations of much interest for natural language generation.",
        "These elements are reported in (Benamara and Saint-Dizier, 2004b).",

        "â€¢ analyze the linguistic marks associated with the MU not investigated here, and possible correlations or conflicts between MU, â€¢ analyze its customisation to various application domains: since quite a lot of ontological and lexical knowledge is involved, in particular to identify DS, this needs some elaboration, â€¢ investigate portability to other languages, in particular investigate the cost related to linguistic resources development, â€¢ develop a robust annotator, for each of the levels identified, and make it available on a standard platform, â€¢ investigate knowledge annotation.",
        "This point is quite innovative and of much interest because of the heavy knowledge load involved in the production of cooperative responses.",
