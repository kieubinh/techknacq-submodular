        "In ongoing work, we explore the possibility to make use of large corpora to test hypotheses concerning linguistic factors determining the meaning and use of connectives.",
        "Of course, corpus-based approaches of connectives are not new, but classically they consist of either fully analysed but relatively small corpora, or of large corpora of which a random set is analysed.",
        "The reason for this quantitative restriction is clear: The data-analyses are completely hand-based.",
        "While these empirical studies are useful from a qualitative point of view, they all suffer from the same quantitative drawback, namely the relatively small number of data (rarely more than 100 occurrences are analysed, mostly only 50).",
        "In addition, most of these analyses are still too analyst-dependent, making generalizations and replications difficult.",
        "Changing this situation includes handling exhaustively large corpora (with hundreds and even thousands of occurrences of the same linguistic phenomenon) and implementing the analytic procedures to make them analyst-independent.",
        "In this paper, we test such a methodology for which we used a number of linguistic hypotheses found in the literature on the semantics of causal connectives and tried to replicate the results.",
        "The linguistic material we worked on are four Dutch backward causal connectives: aangezien ('since'), doordat ('because of the fact that'), omdat ('because') and, want ('because').",
        "This choice was motivated by the fact that there has already been quite some linguistic work on this topic, mainly empirically based (Degand, 2001; Degand and Pander Maat, 2003; Pit, 2003).1 We have shown elsewhere how linguistic hypotheses concerning the scaling of these connectives in terms of subjectivity and their thematic behaviour could be supported (Bestgen et al., 2003).",
        "Since these first results are very encouraging, we would like to focus here on the methods of automatic analysis – Latent Semantic Analysis and Thematic Text Analysis - and on the fairly straightforward (annotation) tools needed to perform the semantic analyses, i.e. POS-tagging, lemmatisation and a thesaurus-like thematic dictionary.",
        "We illustrate how the combination of the two techniques of automatic analysis permit to gain deeper insight into the semantic constraints on the use of the connectives studied.",
        "Doing so, we test a number of new hypotheses concerning the perspectivizing and polyphonic nature of connectives that remain unconfirmed in the linguistic literature.",
        "We also discuss the robustness of the techniques and their re-usability in other contexts and other languages."

        "As a basis for our analyses we worked with the first six months of a Dutch newspaper corpus of more than 30 million words2.",
        "This material was POS-tagged using MBT (Memory Based Tagger) (Daelemans et al., 1996).",
        "We then discarded the items with few content words: sports results, television programs, crosswords and puzzles, stock exchange reports, service information from the newspaper editor, etc.",
        "We also ‘cleaned’ the corpus material of irregularities caused by the incompatibility between the source file and the tagging program (mostly nonsense words generated by the program).",
        "This eventually led to a data set of approximately 16,500,000 words.",
        "The POS-tagging permitted to segment the corpus in sentences and to label the words grammatically.",
        "Second, POS-tagging allowed us to locate and extract the connectives from the sentences in which they occurred.",
        "Concretely, we extracted all sentence-length segments on the basis of the tag <UT> (‘utterance’).",
        "We then did a search on the four connectives tagged as <conj> by the parser.",
        "Table 1 displays the frequencies of the retrieved connectives.",
        "These figures do not include a number of sentences that were eliminated because they were potentially problematic for the analysis.",
        "This was for instance the case for sentences containing more than one connective out of our list of four.3",
        "The extracted sentences were then analysed in terms of a series of heuristics to identify the CAUSE (P) and CONSEQUENCE segments (Q)4.",
        "From a syntactic point of view, the connectives doordat, omdat and aangezien can occur in two basic types of causal constructions: medial (Q CONNECTIVE P), see example (1), and preposed ones (CONNECTIVE P, Q), see example (2).",

        "a) If CONN = omdat, doordat or aangezien; and b) If CONN in initial position, look for first finite verb [vf], if vf appears in segment < ... vf, vf ...> or <... vf vf ...>, then cut before second vf, and segment containing CONN is P, the other one is Q. c) If CONN in initial position and there is only one vf, then segment containing CONN is P, and previous sentence is Q.",
        "Other rules are used to determine whether the CONN is in initial position or not.",

        "’And because Dutch is still the main language in the Netherlands, most subjects are taught in that language.’ This resulted in 21 heuristic rules, the adequacy of which was hand-checked on large samples of the data.",
        "In the end, 1.4% of the data were lost because one of the segments was missing or because none of the procedures could work out the identification of P and Q.",
        "Ultimately we were able to identify the causal segments for 14181 sentences.",
        "Four syntactic environments can be distinguished, involving a preposed construction <Conn P Q.> as in examples (2, 3, 5) above, and three types of medial constructions: a) <Q conn P.> corresponds to a construction in which Q and P are linked by a connective within the same sentence (example 1); b) <Q. Conn P.> corresponds to constructions in which the previous sentence functions as Q (examples 4); and c) <Prev.",
        "Q conn P.> corresponds to constructions for which the Q-segment is anaphoric with the preceding sentence, thus requiring this previous sentence for the semantic interpretation, as in example (6), in which the Q “dat komt” (litt.",

        "This is because Europe is not participating in new growth markets.’ Actually, only 7.1% of the sentences investigated belong to the preposed construction type.",
        "However, important divergences exist between the connectives: want is never used in preposed position, omdat in 10.41% of the cases, and doordat in 14.32% of the cases, a figure which rises to 43.5% of the cases for aangezien.",
        "It is interesting to point out that this is in total agreement with previous small-scale corpus research on this matter."

        "The first automatic technique that will be presented is Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), a mathematical technique for extracting a very large “semantic space” from large text corpora on the basis of the statistical analysis of the set of co-occurrences in a text corpus.",
        "Landauer et al.",
        "(1998) stress that this technique can be viewed from two sides.",
        "At a theoretical level, it is meant to be used to develop simulations of the cognitive processes running during language comprehension, including, for instance, a computational model of metaphor treatment (Kintsch, 2000 ; Lemaire et al., 2001), but also to analyse the coherence of texts (Foltz et al., 1998 ; Piérard et al., 2004).",
        "At a more applied level, it is a technique which enables to infer and to represent the meaning of words on the basis of their actual use in text so that the similarity of the meaning of words, sentences or paragraphs can be estimated (Bestgen, 2002; Choi et al., 2001).",
        "It is this latter aspect which draws our attention here.",
        "The point of departure of the analysis is a lexical table (Lebart and Salem, 1992) containing the frequencies of every word in each of the documents included in the text material, a document being a text, a paragraph, or a sentence.",
        "To derive semantic relations between words from the lexical table the analysis of mere co-occurrences will not do, the major problem being that even in a large corpus most words are relatively rare.",
        "Consequently the co-occurrences of words are even rarer.",
        "This fact makes such co-occurrences very sensitive to arbitrary variations (Burgess et al., 1998 ; Kintsch, 2001).",
        "LSA resolves this problem by replacing the original frequency table by an approximation producing a kind of smoothening effect on the associations.",
        "To this end, the frequency table undergoes a singular value decomposition and it is then recomposed on the basis of only a fraction of the information it contains.",
        "Thus, the thousands of words from the documents have been substituted by linear combinations or ‘semantic dimensions’ with respect to which the original words can be situated again.",
        "Contrary to a classical factor analysis the extracted dimensions are very numerous and non-interpretable.",
        "All original words and segments can then be placed into this semantic space.",
        "The meaning of each word is represented by a vector, thus indicating the exact location of the word in this multidimensional semantic space.",
        "To calculate the semantic proximity between two words, the cosine between the two vectors that represent them is calculated.",
        "The more two words are semantically similar, the more their vectors point in the same direction, and consequently, the closer their cosine will be to 1 (coinciding vectors).",
        "A cosine of 0 shows an absence of similarity, since the corresponding vectors point in orthogonal directions.",
        "It is also possible to calculate the similarity between ‘higher order’ elements, i.e. between sentences, paragraphs, and entire documents, or combinations of those, even if this higher order element isn’t by itself an analysed element.",
        "The vector in question corresponds to the centroid of the words composing the segment under investigation.",
        "The centroid results from the weighted sum of the vectors of these words (Deerwester et al., 1990).",
        "This makes it possible to calculate the semantic proximity between any two sentences, viz. whether present in the original corpus or not, whether the original corpus had been segmented in sentence length documents or not.",
        "To perform the LSA analyses, we used the Dutch newspaper corpus to build the semantic space.",
        "To this end, the data set, which had been lemmatised with MBLEM (Memory Based Lem-matiser) (Van den Bosch & Daelemans, 1999), was cut into article-length segments.",
        "Elimination of all digits, special characters, punctuation marks, and of a list of 222 stopwords (words occurring in “any” context, like determiners, auxiliaries, conjunctions, ...), brought the total number of words back to approximately 6.5 million.",
        "For the input lexical table, the documents were articles of minimally 24 words and maximally 523 words, i.e. all articles minus the 10% shortest and minus the 10% longest ones.",
        "As to the words, we kept all those that occurred at least ten times in the data set.",
        "Overall this resulted in a matrix of 36630 terms in 28640 documents.",
        "To build the semantic space proper, the singular value decomposition was realized with the program SVDPACKC (Berry, 1992; Berry et al., 1993), and the 300 first singular vectors were retained.",

        "We would like to explore this matter further by comparing the semantic tightness of the segments related by our connectives.",
        "This will be done by calculating the semantic proximity between Q and P for each of the connectives.",

        "The first one had the connectives as independent variable and the semantic proximity between the causal segments as dependent variable.",
        "It shows that hypothesis 1 is borne out (F(3, 10505) = 11.36, p < 0.0001): the causal segments related by the (monophonic) connective omdat are semantically closer than the segments related by the (polyphonic) connective want.",
        "The results furthermore show that doordat and aangezien should be described in terms of monophonic connectives.",
        "The second ANOVA, with the connectives as independent variable and the semantic proximity between the prior and subsequent sentences as dependent variable, confirms hypothesis 2 (F(3, 10505) = 25.75, p < 0.0001): the monophonic connectives aangezien, doordat and omdat go along with topic continuity (or at least semantic proximity) between the prior and subsequent sentence to the causal construction, while this is less the case for the connective want.",
        "To confirm that these results are indeed related to the issue of perspectivisation, this LSA-analysis was completed with a thematic text analysis to test for the presence vs. absence of perspective indicators.",

        "(Caenepeel, 1989).",
        "The dictionary was composed of two subcategories: a) communication markers, like (non-ambiguous) verbs and adverbs of saying and thinking, e.g. report, tell, confirm, require, according to,... b) markers of the speaker's attitude, like linguistic elements expressing an expectation or a denial of expectation, intensifiers and attitudinals, and evaluative words, e.g. probably, must, horrible, fantastic, ... To build the dictionary, we used a Dutch thesaurus (Brouwers, 1997) and extracted all (unambiguous) lemmas corresponding to one of the above-mentioned categories.",
        "Multi-word expressions or separable verbs were not included in the lists.",
        "The lists were composed on two native speaker's judgements with a good knowledge of the literature on perspectivisation.",
        "The idea of the thematic text analysis was to confirm that the break in semantic tightness occurring with want-segments, as revealed by the LSA-analysis, could indeed be interpreted in terms of a perspective shift.",
        "We would therefore expect that the causal segments related by the connective want show diverging perspectivisation patterns, and that this will not be the case for the segments related by omdat, doordat, aangezien.",
        "This is reformulated in hypothesis 3.",
        "The results displayed in Table 3 show that the hypothesis is borne out for the subcategory of attitudinal markers: want-segments display a higher amount of attitudinal markers in Q than in P (F(1, 5588) = 26.84, p < 0.0001).",
        "For the other connectives this is not the case.",

        "cation markers in Q (F(1, 6746) = 6.53, p < 0.01).",
        "While this latter result might seem counter to expectation, it actually goes in the direction of prior observations that omdat-relations frequently display the explicit introduction of speech acts (Degand, 2001; Pit 2003).",
        "All together, these results offer new interesting insights into the discourse environment of (Dutch) causal connectives.",
        "On the one hand, we have shown with the LSA analysis that the proximity between Q and P is lower for want-relations than for the other connectives and that this is also the case for the semantic proximity between the sentences prior and subsequent to the causal relations.",
        "We therefore concluded that the connective want is a marker of thematic shift.",
        "On the other hand, the TTA analysis revealed that the Q-segments in want-relations display a higher amount of attitudinal markers.",
        "In our view, the presence of these markers leads to the conclusion that the connective want is indeed a marker of perspective shift, i.e. the break in semantic tightness should be interpreted as a perspective break, as has often been suggested in the literature.",
        "Furthermore, the additional results for want (absence of communication markers in Q) also suggest that markers expressing the speaker's attitude should be clearly distinguished from those that explicit the speaker's speech act (verbs of saying) or designate him/her explicitly as the source of the speech act (adverbs like aldus, volgens, ... 'according to').",
        "The polyphony/monophony distinction overlaps with the coordination/subordination distinction between want vs. the other connectives.",
        "The question arises which of those two factors is responsible for the results obtained.",
        "One route to follow is to compare our results with a language like English in which a same connective (because) has both monophonic and polyphonic uses, or with a language like French where a polyphonic connective like puisque is subordinating.",
