        "In order to improve the time-consuming and tedious task of the manually annotation, a semiautomatic and interactive process is followed: first, an anaphora resolution system selects each anaphora and its antecedent from a list of candidates; then, the human annotator decides wether or not accept the suggestion.",
        "With this approach, the correctness of the anaphora resolution system is a key factor in the quest of an efficient annotation process.",
        "For this reason, we use the linguistic information of the previous annotation tasks (morphological, syntactic and, mainly, semantic information) to improve the anaphora resolution system.",

        "Cast3Lb project is part of the general project 3LB1.",
        "The main objective of this general project is to develop three corpora annotated with syntactic, semantic and pragmatic/coreferential information: one for Catalan (Cat3LB), one for Basque (Eus3LB) and one for Spanish (Cast3LB).",
        "The Spanish corpus Cast3LB is a part of the CLIC-TALP corpus, which is made up of 100.000 words from the LexEsp corpus (Sebasti´an et al., 2000) plus 25.000 words coming from the EFE Spanish Corpus, given by the Agencia EFE (the official news agency) for research purposes.",
        "The EFE corpus fragments are comparable among the languages of the general project (Catalan, Basque and Spanish).",
        "We have selected this corpus because it contains a large variety of Spanish texts (newspapers, novels, scientific papers... ), both from Spain and South-America, so it is a good representation of the current state of the Spanish language.",
        "Moreover, the automatic morphological annotation of this corpus has been manually checked (Civit, 2003).",
        "The spirit of the annotation scheme is to build a flexible system portable to different romance languages and to potential new cases that might appear, but consistent with all annotation levels and annotation data.",
        "At the syntactic level we follow the constituency annotation scheme.",
        "Main principles of syntactic annotation are the following (Civit et al., 2003): a)",
        "only the explicit elements are annotated (except for elliptical subjects); b) we do not alter the surface word order of the elements; c) we do not follow any specific theoretical framework; d) we do not take into account the verbal phrase, rather, the main constituents of the sentence become the daughters of the root node; e) this syntactic information is enriched by the functional information of the main phrases, but we have not taken into account the possibility of double functions.",
        "At the semantic level, we annotate the sense of the nouns, verbs and some adjectives, following an all words approach.",
        "The specific sense (or senses) of each one is assigned by means of the EuroWord-Net offset number (Vossen, 1998).",
        "Also, due to some words are not available in EuroWordNet or do not have the suitable sense, we have created two new tags to mark this circumstance.",
        "At the discourse level, we mark the coreference of nominal phrases and some elliptical elements.",
        "The coreference expressions taken into account are personal pronouns, clitics, elliptical subjects and some elliptical adjectives.",
        "The definite descriptions are not marked.",
        "The possible antecedents considered are the nominal phrases or other coreferential expressions."

        "As we said before, main objective of Cast3LB project at semantic level is to develop an “all words” corpus with the specific sense (or senses) of nouns, verbs and adjectives.",
        "Our proposal is based on the SemCor corpus (Miller, 1990).",
        "This corpus is formed by a portion of the Brown corpus and the novel The Red Badge of Courage.",
        "Altogether, it is formed by approximately 250.000 words, where nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs have been manually annotated with WordNet senses (Miller, 1990).",
        "Another corpus with WordNet-based semantic annotation is the DSO corpus (Ng and Lee, 1996).",
        "In this corpus, the most frequent English ambiguous nouns and verbs had been annotated with the correct sense (121 nouns and 70 verbs).",
        "The corpus is formed by 192.800 sentences from the Brown Corpus and the Wall Street Journal, and it has also been manually annotated.",
        "Finally, the SENSEVAL forum has developed a few sense annotated corpora for the evaluation of Word Sense Disambiguation systems (Kilgarriff and Palmer, 2000), some of which also use WordNet as a lexical resource.",
        "We have decided to use Spanish WordNet for several reasons.",
        "First of all, Spanish WordNet is, up to now, the more commonly used lexical resource in Word Sense Disambiguation tasks.",
        "Secondly, it is one of the most complete lexical resources currently available for Spanish.",
        "Finally, as part of EuroWordNet, the lexical structure of Spanish and the lexical structure of Catalan and Basque are related.",
        "Therefore, the annotated senses of the three corpora of 3LB project can also be related.",
        "The tag used to mark a word sense is its offset number, that is, its identification number in EuroWordNet’s InterLingua Index.",
        "The corpus has 42291 lexical words, where 20461 are nouns, 13471 are verbs and 8543 are adjectives.",
        "On other hand, not all nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are annotated, due to EuroWordNet does not contain them.",
        "Possible lacks in this sense are (i) the synset, (ii) the word, (iii) the synset and the word, and (iv) the link between the synset and the word.",
        "In order to deal with these cases we have defined two more tags in EuroWordNet:",
        "• C 1S: the word is found, but not its correct sense (due to a sense lack, or because there is no link between the word and the synset).",
        "• C2S: the word is not found (because it is not there, or because both the word and the synset are missing).",
        "It is possible to distinguish two methods for semantically annotate a corpus.",
        "The first one is linear (or “textual”) method (Kilgarriff, 1998), where the human annotator marks the sentences token by token up to the end of the corpus.",
        "In this strategy the annotator must read and analyze the sense of each word every time it appears in the corpus.",
        "The second annotation method is transversal (or “lexical”) (Kilgarriff, 1998), where he/she annotates word-type by word-type, all the occurrences of each word in the corpus one by one.",
        "With this method, the annotator must read and analyze all the senses of a word only once.",
        "We have followed in Cast3LB the transversal process.",
        "The main advantage of this method is that we can focus our attention on the sense structure of one word and deal with its specific semantic problems: its main sense or senses, its specific senses.... Then we check the context of the single word each time it appears and select the corresponding sense.",
        "Through this approach, semantic features of each word is taken into consideration only once, and the whole corpus achieves greater consistency.",
        "Through the linear process, however, the annotator must remember the sense structure of each word and their specific problems each time the word appears in the corpus, making the annotation process much more complex, and increasing the possibilities of low consistency and disagreement between the annotators.",
        "Nevertheless, the transversal method finds its disadvantage in the annotation of large corpus, because no fragment of the corpus is available until the whole corpus is completed.",
        "To avoid this, we have selected a fragment of the whole corpus and annotated it by means of the linear process.",
        "Everybody agrees that semantic annotation is a tedious and difficult task.",
        "From a general point of view, the main problem in the semantic annotation is the subjectivity of the human annotator when it comes to the selection of the correct sense, because there are usually more than one sense for a word, and, due to the WorNet’s granularity, more than one could be correct for a given word.",
        "Another important problem in the semantic annotation is the poor agreement between different annotators, due to the ambiguity and/or vagueness of many words.",
        "In order to overcome these problems, the annotation process has been carried out in two steps.",
        "In the first step, a subset of ambiguous words have been annotated twice by two annotators.",
        "With this double annotation we have developed a disagreement typology and an annotation handbook, where all the possible causes of ambiguity have been described and common solutions have been adopted for the rest of cases.",
        "In the second step the remaining corpus is annotated following the criteria adopted in the annotation handbook.",
        "Our final aim is to obtain useful resources for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) systems in Spanish.",
        "This semantically annotated corpus will be used as a training corpus for the development of unsupervised systems and as a reference in general evaluation tasks.",
        "At the end of the project, we will have a large amount of words with an unambiguous sense tag in a real context.",
        "As well as this final application, we exploit this semantic information in the anaphoric annotation task.",
        "In (Saiz-Noeda, 2002), how to apply semantic information in anaphora resolution systems is showed and evaluated.",
        "We take this proposal, but applied to manual anaphora annotation.",
        "Due to the corpus has been annotated with syntactic information, and the sense of each word is marked with the offset number of EuroWordNet, it is possible to extract semantic features of each verb and noun through the ontological concepts of the EuroWordNet’s Top Ontology.",
        "Furthermore, the corpus has been annotated with syntactic roles, so it is possible to extract syntactic patterns formed by the verb and its main complements: subject-verb, verb-direct objects, verb-indirect objects.",
        "As we will show bellow, these patterns are useful in order to select the specific antecedent of an anaphora, according to semantic compatibility criteria between the antecedent and the verb of the sentence where the anaphora appears."

        "They are annotated by means of the identification of the same antecedent.",
        "We do not annotate the definite descriptions.",
        "They consist of nominal phrases that can refer (or not) to an antecedent.",

        "These problems could further increase the time-consuming in the annotation process and widen the gap of disagreement between the human annotators.",
        "This proposal of annotation scheme is based on the one used in the MUC (Message Understanding Conference) (Hirschman, 1997) as well as in the works of Gaizauskas (Gaizauskas and Humphreys, 1996) and Mitkov (Mitkov et al., 2002): this is the mostly used scheme in coreferential annotation (Mitkov, 2002).",
        "In the anaphoric annotation, two linguistic elements must be marked: the anaphoric expression and its antecedent.",
        "In the antecedent we annotate the following information:",
        "• A reference tag that shows the presence of an antecedent (“REF”), • An identification number (“ID”), • The minimum continuous substring that could be considerer correct (“MIN”).",
        "In the coreferential expression, we annotate:",
        "• The presence of a coreferential expression (“COREF”), • An identification number (“ID”), • The type of anaphoric expression: elliptical subject, elliptical head of noun phrase, tonic pronoun or atonic pronoun (“TYPE”), • The antecedent, through its identification number (“REF”), • Finally, a status tag where the annotators shows their confidence in the annotation (“STATUS”).",
        "As previously mentioned in this paper, the main problem in the anaphoric annotation is the low agreement between human annotators.",
        "There is usually less agreement in anaphoric annotation than in syntactic annotation ((Mitkov, 2002), 141).",
        "In order to reduce this low agreement, we annotate only the clearest type of anaphoric units (pronouns, elliptical subjects and elliptical nominal heads), and we introduce the lowest necessary information.",
        "Moreover, with the tag ”STATUS”, the human annotator can show his confidence in the anaphoric unit and the antecedent marked.",

        "With an anaphora resolution system it is possible to automatize this process: the system selects possible anaphoric elements, their possible antecedents, and decides the main candidate.",
        "The human annotator must only check the suggestion.",

        "The specific use of semantic information is related to the sematic compatibility between the possible antecedent (a noun) and the verb of the sentence in which the anaphoric pronoun appears.",
        "Due to the pronoun replaces a lexical word (the antecedent), the semantic information of the antecedent must be compatible with the semantic restrictions of the verb.",

        "So the possible antecedents with low compatibility are rejected, and the antecedents with high compatibility are selected.",
        "These semantic preferences, plus the syntactic and morphological restrictions and preferences, are used to select the correct antecedent of the anaphora.",
