        "Particular attention was paid to the factors affecting the generation of pronouns (Pearson et al., 2000; Henschel et al., 2000), demonstratives (Poesio and Nygren-Modjeska, To appear) possessives (Poesio and Nissim, 2001) and definites in general (Poesio, 2004a).",
        "These results, and the annotated corpus, were used in the development of both symbolic and statistical natural language generation algorithms for sentence planning (Poesio, 2000a; Henschel et al., 2000; Cheng et al., 2001), aggregation (Cheng, 2001) and text planning (Kara-manis, 2003).",
        "The empirical side of the project involved both psychological experiments and corpus annotation, based on a scheme based on the MATE proposals, as well as on a detailed annotation manual (Poesio, 2000b), the reliability of whose instructions was tested by extensive experiments (Poesio, 2000a).",
        "More recently, the corpus has also been used to develop and evaluate anaphora resolution systems, with a special focus on the resolution of bridging references (Poesio, 2003; Poesio and Alexandrov-Kabadjov, 2004; Poesio et al., 2004a) Although the results of the studies using the GNOME corpus mentioned above have been published in a number of papers, and although a detailed annotation manual was written and has been available on the Web for a few years (Poesio, 2000b), none of the previously published papers discusses in detail the goals of the annotation and the methodology that was followed, especially for the non-anaphoric aspects.",

        "ing theory (Grosz et al., 1995) are called UTTERANCES, i.e., the units of text after which the local focus is updated.",
        "In most annotations concerned with salience, a predefined notion of utterance was adopted, typically sentences (Miltsakaki, 2002) or (finite) clauses (Kameyama, 1998).",
        "This approach, however, precludes using the corpus to compare possible definitions of utterance, one of the goals of the GNOME annotation (Poesio et al., 2004b).",
        "In order to do this, we marked all spans of text that might be claimed to update the local focus, including sentences (defined as all units of text ending with a full stop, a question mark, or an exclamation point) as well as what we called (DISCOURSE) UNITS.",
        "Units include clauses (defined as sequences of text containing a verbal complex, all its obligatory arguments, and all postverbal adjuncts) as well as other sentence subconstituents that might be viewed as independently updating the local focus, such as parentheticals, preposed PPs, and (the second element of) coordinated VPs.",

        "Subordinate units also include adjunct clauses headed by connectives such as before, after, because and clauses in subject position.",
        "In total, the texts used for the main study contain 505 sentences and more than 1,000 units, including 900 finite clauses.3 Sentence and Unit Attributes Sentences have one attribute, STYPE, specifying whether the sentence is declarative, interrogative, imperative, or ex-clamative.",

        "For the GNOME corpus, we adopted a simplified version of the MATE scheme, as for our purposes it’s not essential to mark all semantic relations between entities introduced by a text, but only those that may establish a ‘link’ between two utterances.",
        "So, for example, it was not necessary for us to mark a relation between the subject of a copular sentence and its predicate - e.g., between the price of aluminum siding and $3.85 or $4.02 in the example above.",
        "In the GNOME corpus, anaphoric information is marked by means of a special (ante) element; the (ante) element itself specifies the index of the anaphoric expression (a (ne) element) and the type of semantic relation (e.g., identity), whereas one or more embedded (anchor) elements indicate possible antecedents.6 (See (8).)",

        "However, previous attempts at marking anaphoric information, particularly in the context of the MUC initiative, suggested that while agreement on identity relations is"

        "fairly easy to achieve, marking bridging references is hard; this was confirmed by Poesio and Vieira (1998).",
        "For these reasons, and to reduce the annotators’ work, we did not mark all relations.",
        "Besides identity (IDENT) we only marked up three associative relations (Hawkins, 1978): set membership (ELEMENT), subset (SUBSET), and ‘generalized possession’ (POSS), which includes part-of relations as well as ownership relations.",
        "We only marked relations between objects realized by noun phrases, excluding anaphoric references to actions, events or propositions implicitly introduced by clauses or sentences.",
        "We also gave strict instructions to our annotators limiting how much to mark.",
        "As expected, we found a reasonable (if not perfect) agreement on identity relations.",
        "In our most recent analysis (two annotators looking at the anaphoric relations between 200 NPs) we observed no real disagreements; 79.4% of the relations were marked up by both annotators; 12.8% by only one of them; and in 7.7% of the cases, one of the annotators marked up a closer antecedent than the other.",
        "With associative references, limiting the relations did limit the disagreements among annotators (only 4.8% of the relations are actually marked differently) but only 22% of bridging references were marked in the same way by both annotators; 73.17% of relations are marked by only one or the other annotator.",
        "So reaching agreement on this information involved several discussions between annotators and more than one pass over the corpus."

      "text": [
        "The reader will have noticed that no attempt was done to directly mark up properties of the local focus - e.g., which discourse entity is the CB of a particular utterance.",
        "We found that it is much easier to annotate the ‘building blocks’ of a theory of the local focus, and then use scripts to automatically compute the CB.",
        "There are two advantages to this approach: first of all, agreement on the ‘building blocks’ is much easier to reach than agreement on the CB–in our preliminary experiments we didn’t go beyond r. = .6 when trying to directly identify the CB using the definitions from (Brennan et al., 1987).",
        "And secondly, this approach makes it possible to compute the CB according to different ways of instantiating what we call the ‘parameters of Centering’ –e.g., ranking.",
        "We developed such scripts for the work discussed in (Poesio et al., 2004b); they can be tested on the web site associated with that paper, http://cswww.essex.ac.uk/staff/poesio/ cbc/.",
        "These scripts have been subsequently used to compute the CB in, e.g., (Poesio and Nissim, 2001; Poesio and Nygren-Modjeska, To appear)."

        "Corpus consistency The main lesson learned from this effort is that actually using a corpus is the best way both to ensure its correctness and to learn which types of information are most useful.",
        "Thematic Roles One attribute on which we weren’t able to reach acceptable agreement was the thematic role of an NP, which has been argued to be a better indicator of salience than grammatical function (Sidner, 1979; Stevenson et al., 1994); the agreement value in this case was r. = .35.",
        "Other groups however have shown that this can be done, e.g., in Framenet (Baker et al., 1998) and more recently in PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002).",
        "Planned Revisions of the Scheme A number of aspects of the annotation scheme used for the corpus could be improved.",
        "An obvious improvement would be to directly annotate predicates with their WordNet senses instead of annotating ONTO and animacy.",
        "We started doing this for the annotation of modifiers (Cheng et al., 2001), and developed an interface to WordNet, but too late to redo the whole corpus.",
        "Of the attributes, COUNT and GENERIC were the most difficult to annotate; further tests with these attributes could be useful.",
        "Automatic annotation A substantial part of the annotation work required for GNOME now could (and should) be done automatically, or semi-automatically.",
        "This includes, most obviously, the identification of sentences and NPs, already done automatically in the VENEX corpus (Poesio, 2004b); and at least grammatical function, animacy, and countability could be automatically annotated in preliminary form with existing techniques, and then corrected by hand.",
        "We also plan to use the corpus to bootstrap techniques for automatic identification of uniqueness and gender."
