        "LIDAS is a purely symbolic discourse parser most similar to the D-LTAG parser described in (Forbes et.",
        "al.",
        "2003).",
        "The overall structures of the LIDAS and D-LTAG parsers are almost identical.",
        "There are a number of apparently significant differences between the underlying theories although some of these may turn out to be notational variants after more extensive analysis.",
        "An important difference between D-LTAG and U-LDM derives from the fundamental question of segmentation; D-LTAG segments are larger than our segments, corresponding more or less to BDU-trees (but cf. footnote 20).",
        "In D-LTAG, because only one grammar formalism governs both discourse and sentence level parsing, continuation can also take place on parts of segments as defined by sentence-level syntactic relations.",
        "Under the U-LDM, which employs independent sentential and discourse grammars, only segments are potential anchors for continuation.",
        "Not only because we use an external syntactic parser as an oracle that informs segment attachment on the BDU-tree, but more importantly because sentential syntax can be overridden by discourse syntax in some cases.",
        "Another basic difference between the two approaches is that D-LTAG builds its initial and auxiliary trees around connectives.",
        "Every discourse relation is expressed by a, possibly empty, connective.",
        "In U-LDM, connectives give evidence about the possible discourse relations, as do other parts of the sentence, but they do not solely determine discourse relation.",
        "We can thus account correctly for cases in which the wrong connective is selected to express a semantic relationship among segments.",
        "Lastly, our parser is meant to be incremental at the discourse level, whereas the D-LTAG parser appears to operate on the discourse as a whole.",

        "In this paper we described a novel approach to discourse segmentation and discourse structure analysis that unifies sentential syntax with discourse structure and argued that most of the information needed to assign a structural description to a text is available from sentential syntactic parsing, sentential semantic analysis and relationships among words captured in a lexical ontology such as WordNet.",
        "The U-LDM discourse rules and parsing strategies presented here are a first step.",
        "We have tested out these rules in analyzing a corpus of over 300 Technical Reports that have been summarized under the PALSUMM System that operates on top of LIDAS.",
        "(Polanyi et al. 2004; Thione et al. 2004) Much work remains to be done.",
        "Understanding the complex interrelationships between rules is a formidable task.",
        "Critically important, too, is to unify the semantically motivated structural analyses presented here with an explicit S-DRT type formal semantic account of discourse semantics.",
        "However, we believe that the results presented here represent an important advance in understanding the nature of natural language texts."
