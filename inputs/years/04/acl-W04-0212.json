        "Large scale annotated corpora such as the Penn TreeBank (Marcus et al., 1993) have played a central role in speech and natural language research.",
        "However, with the demand for more powerful NLP applications comes a need for greater richness in annotation – hence, the development of PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002), which adds basic semantics to the PTB in the form of verb predicate-argument annotation and eventually similar annotation of nominalizations.",
        "We have been developing yet another annotation layer above these both.",
        "The Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB) adds low-level discourse structure and semantics through the annotation of discourse connectives and their arguments, using connective-specific semantic role labels.",
        "With this added knowledge, the PDTB (together with the PTB and PropBank) should support more in-depth NLP research and more powerful applications.",
        "Work on the PDTB is grounded in a lexical-ized approach to discourse – DLTAG (Webber and Joshi, 1998; Webber et al., 1999a; Webber et al., 2000; Webber et al., 2003).",
        "Here, low-level discourse structure and semantics are taken to result (in part) from composing elementary predicate-argument relations whose predicates come mainly from discourse connectives1 and whose arguments",
        "come from units of discourse – clausal, sentential or multi-sentential units.",
        "The PDTB therefore differs from the RST-annotated corpus (Carlson et al., 2003) which starts with (abstract) rhetorical relations (Mann and Thompson, 1988) and annotates a subset of the Penn WSJ corpus with those relations that can be taken to hold between (primarily) pairs of discourse spans identified in the corpus.",
        "The current paper focuses on what can be discovered through analyzing PDTB annotation, both on its own and together with the Penn TreeBank.",
        "Section 2 of the paper briefly reviews the theoretical background of the project, its current state, the guidelines given to annotators, the annotation tool they used (WordFreak), and the extent of inter-annotator agreement.",
        "Section 3 shows how we have used PDTB annotation, along with the PTB, to extract several features pertaining to discourse connectives and their arguments, and discusses the relevance of these features for NLP research and applications.",
        "Section 4 concludes with the summary."

        "Subordinate and coordinating conjunctions, for example, require two aring the annotations independent of the DLTAG structural descriptions for two reasons: (1) to make the annotated corpus useful to researchers working in different frameworks and (2) to simplify the annotators’ task, thereby increasing inter-annotator reliability.",

        "The crucial contribution of this framework to the design of PDTB is what can be seen as a bottom-up approach to discourse structure.",
        "Specifically, instead of appealing to an abstract (and arbitrary) set of discourse relations whose identification may confound multiple sources of discourse meaning, we start with the annotation of discourse connectives and their arguments, thus exposing a clearly defined level of discourse representation."

        "The current version of the guidelines is available at http://www.cis.upenn.edu/ pdtb.",
        "Below we outline basic points from the guidelines.",
        "What counts as a discourse connective?",
        "We count as discourse connectives (1) all subordinating and coordinating conjunctions, (2) all discourse adverbials, and (3) all inter-sentential implicit connectives.",
        "Discourse adverbials include only those adverbials which convey relationships between two abstract objects such as events, states, propositions, etc.",
        "(Asher, 1993).",
        "For instance, in Example 1, as a result conveys a cause-effect relation between the event of limiting the size of industries and that of industries operating out of small, expensive, and inefficient units.",
        "In contrast, the semantic interpretation of the clausal adverbial strangely in Example 2 only requires a single event/state which it classifies in the set of strange events/states.2",
        "(1) [In the past, the socialist policies of the government strictly limited the size of new steel mills, petrochemical plants, car factories and other industrial concerns to conserve resources and restrict the profits businessmen could make].",
        "As a result, [industry operated out of small, expensive, highly inefficient industrial units].",
        "(2) Strangely, conventional wisdom inside the Beltway regards these transfer payments as “uncontrollable” or “nondiscretionary.”",
        "Implicit connectives are taken to occur between adjacent sentences not related by any explicit connective.",
        "They are annotated with whatever explicit connective the annotator feels could be inserted, with the original meaning retained.",
        "Assessment of inter-annotator agreement groups these annotations into five coarse classes (Miltsakaki et al., 2004).",
        "Currently, we are not annotating implicit connectives intra-sententially (such as between a main clause and a free adjunct) or across paragraphs.",
        "What counts as a legal argument?",
        "The simplest argument to a connective is what we take to be the minimum unit of discourse.",
        "Because we take discourse relations to hold between abstract objects, we require that an argument contain at least one clause-level predication (usually a verb – tensed or untensed), though it may span as much as a sequence of clauses or sentences.",
        "The two exceptions are nominal phrases that express an event or a state, and discourse deictics that denote an abstract object.",
        "What we describe to annotators as arguments to discourse connectives are actually the textual span from which the argument is derived (Webber et al., 1999a; Webber et al., 2003).",
        "This is especially clear in the case of the first argument of instead in (3), which does not actually include the negation, although it is part of the selected text.3",
        "(3) [No price for the new shares has been set].",
        "Instead, [the companies will leave it up to the marketplace to decide].",
        "How far does an argument extend?",
        "One particularly significant addition to the guidelines came as a result of differences among annotators as to how large a span constituted the argument of a connective.",
        "During pilot annotations, annotators used three annotation tags: CONN for the connective and ARGT and ARG2 for the two arguments.",
        "To this set, we have added two optional tags, SUPT and SUP2 (supplementary), for cases when the annotator wants to mark textual spans s/he considers to be useful, supplementary information for the interpretation of an argument.",
        "Examples (4) and (5) demonstrate its use.",
        "The arguments are shown in square brackets, while spans providing supplementary information are shown in parentheses.4",

        "With respect to agreement, we did not use the kappa statistic (Siegel and Castellan, 1988) because it requires the data tokens to be classified into discrete categories and PDTB annotation involves selecting a span of text whose length is not prescribed a priori.5 Instead of kappa, we assessed inter-annotator agreement using an exact match criterion: for any ARG1 or ARG2 token, agreement was recorded as 1 when both annotators made identical",
        "span that could constitute an elementary discourse unit, and one set in which there is only a separate category for each span that at least one annotator has selected.",
        "Because the arguments of connectives tend to be longer and hence more variable than the elementary spans used in the RST-corpus, we do not see any gain from introducing the first set of categories, and the second set is equivalent to our exact match criterion.",

        "Treating ARG1 and ARG2 annotations as independent tokens for assessment, the total number of inter-annotator judgments assessed for explicit connectives was twice the number of connective tokens, i.e, 5434.",
        "In this measure, we achieved a high-level of agreement on the arguments to subordinate conjunctions (92.4%), while lower agreement on adverbials (71.8%).6 This difference between the two types is not surprising, since locating the anaphoric (ARG1) argument of adverbial connectives is believed to be a harder task than that of locating the arguments of subordinating conjunctions.",
        "For example, the anaphoric argument of the adverbial connectives may be located in some non-adjacent span of text, even several paragraphs away.",
        "A detailed analysis of inter-annotator variation shows that most of the disagreements (79%) involved Partial Overlap – that is, text that is common to what is selected separately by each annotator.",
        "Partial overlap subsumes categories such as (a) higher verb, where one of the annotators included some extra clausal material that contained a higher governing predicate, (b) dependent clause, where one of the annotators included extra clausal material which was syntactically dependent on the clause selected by both, and (c) parenthetical, where one of the annotators included text that occurred in the middle of the other annotator’s selection.",

        "The multi-layered annotations for PDTB, PTB (and soon to be available PropBank) are rendered in XML within a “stand-off” annotation architecture in which multiple (independently conducted) annotations refer to the same primary document.",
        "WordFreak directly renders the PDTB annotations in the stand-off XML representation, but for the syntactic layer, the PTB phrase structure constituent annotations had to first be converted to the XML stand-off representation .7 For preparing the connective tokens for data mining, we started with the 2717 annotations for the 10 explicit connectives reported in Section 2.2 and extracted those tokens on which we achieved full “exact match” agreement as well as “partial overlap” agreement on both the arguments (cf.",
        "Section 2.4).",
        "We felt justified in combining both sets because “partial overlap” disagreements, which occurred mostly within sentences, did not make any overall difference to the features that were extracted.",
        "The total number of tokens we obtained from this was 2688.",
        "51 tokens on this set had to be thrown out since the official release of the Penn TreeBank did not have the corresponding syntactic annotations for these tokens.8 From the remaining 2637 tokens, we extracted two sets of features, one for adverbials (229 tokens) and the other for subordinating conjunctions (2408 tokens).",
        "For the adverbials, we wanted to determine whether the results reported in earlier work (Creswell et al., 2002) held up.",
        "Among other things, this work examined whether (1) anaphoric arguments could be reliably annotated, to facilitate the development of robust anaphora resolution algorithms, and (2) there were differences be",

        "These features are further described below: POS: pertains to the position of the connective in its host argument, i.e., the argument in which it occurs.9 POS can take three defined values: INIT for argument-initial position (Examples 7-9), MED for argument-medial position (Examples 10-11), and FINAL for argument-final position (Examples 12 and 13).",
        "Note that the host argument of the connective is a sentence in Example 8 and 9, a VP conjunct in Example 7, a free adjunct in Example 10, the main clause of a sentence in Example 11, a subordinate clause in Example 12, and finally, the first of the two coordinated sentences in Example 13.",
        "LOC: pertains to the size and location of the anaphoric argument of the connective.",
        "LOC can take four defined values: SS for when the anaphoric argument occurs in the same sentence as the connective (Examples 7, 10 and 11), PS for when the argument occurs in the immediately previous sentence (Examples 12 and 13), PP for when the argument occurs in the immediately preceding sequence of sentences (Example 8), and NC for when the argument occurs in some non-contiguous sentence(s) (Example 9).",
        "A sentence is defined as minimally a main clause and all of its attached subordinate clauses, if any.",

        "An important aspect of the LOC feature is that it involved the multi-layering of PDTB and PTB, since the PDTB itself contains no information about syntactic constituency or even sentence boundaries.",

        "Furthermore, in Example 7, the arguments of the conjunction and, though not yet addressed by our annotators, differ from the arguments of instead.",
        "Any attempt to treat instead as a structural connective will produce a syntactic analysis with crossing branches – a source of both theoretical and practical (parsing) problems (Forbes et al., 2003).",
        "Turning now to the individual analysis of adverbials, Table 2 shows that the 4 connectives other than therefore pattern rather similarly with respect to the location of the anaphoric argument (SS, PS, PP, NC).",
        "All of them except therefore have their antecedent predominantly in the previous sentence (between 54.8% and 77.8%).",
        "The question is whether the difference in how therefore patterns – i.e., drawing its antecedent 55% of the time from the same sentence – is simply a consequence of having such few data points (i.e., only 20) or a matter of “house style” (with all the examples from the Wall Street Journal) or a difference that is theoretically motivated.",
        "If the answer lies in house style or theory, then it is relevant to work in natural language generation.",
        "Further annotation and analysis of adverbials and their arguments in the PDTB will provide more information as to this puzzle.",

        "This data mining experiment illustrates the first three, as well as providing information relevant to further development of discourse parsing systems and natural language generation systems.",
        "For future work, we intend to explore further the extraction and study of other features related to discourse adverbials.",
        "Two features that we are currently working to extract automatically pertain to (a) the co-occurrence of discourse adverbials with other connectives in the host argument, and (b) the syntactic type and depth of the anaphoric arguments, such as whether the argument was a finite or non-finite complement clause, a relative clause, or a finite or non-finite subordinate clause etc.",
        "For the subordinating conjunctions (Table 3), we extracted features pertaining to the relative position of the two arguments of the conjunction.",
        "Subordinating conjunctions often take their arguments in the same sentence with the subordinate clause as one argument and the main clause as its other argument.",
        "However, the subordinate clause can either occur to the right of the main clause, i.e., postposed, as in Example 17, or it can occur preposed, i.e., before the main clause, as in Example 18.",

        "The distribution of the relative position of the arguments of these connectives, given in Table 3, shows significant differences across the connectives.",
        "There are a few interesting things to note here.",
        "First, even if one considers only the four subordinating conjunctions with 100 tokens, no two of them pattern in the same way.",
        "Second, with when, the almost equal distribution of preposed and postposed tokens suggests either free variation of the two patterns or different uses of the two patterns, with each use favoring a different pattern.",
        "The latter would accord with a theoretical distinction that has been made between postposed when expressing a purely temporal relation between the two clauses, and preposed when expressing a contingent relation between them (Moens and Steedman, 1988).",
        "Integrated evidence from the PTB and PropBank may help distinguish the two possibilities.",
        "Third, there is a striking contrast between the patterning of although and even though, especially if one assumes that even though (like even when, even after, even if, etc.)",
        "involves application of the topi-calizer even to the subordinate clause, just as it can apply to other constituents.",
        "Further annotation and analysis of the PDTB will reveal whether all subordinating conjunctions that co-occur with even pattern like even though, or whether this is specific to the concessive.",
        "Finally, when Williams and Reiter (2003) examined 342 texts from the RST annotation of the Penn TreeBank corpus (Carlson et al., 2003), they reported that 77% of the instances of concessive relations that they examined appeared in the order ARG2-ARG1.",
        "(The eleven instances of although that they examined and the three instances of even though appeared in concessive relations, along with instances of but, despite, however, etc.)",
        "If we were to collapse together all instances of although and even though annotated in the PDTB (totalling 450), we would find that 46% (206) patterned as ARG1ARG2, and 54% of them (244) patterned as ARG2ARG1.",
        "This might lead us to draw a similar conclusion to Williams and Reiter (2003).",
        "But it would also disguise the fact noted above that although and even though pattern oppositely to one another.",
        "This suggests (1) that making the feature extraction procedure specific to particular connectives, as in the PDTB, will reveal distributional patterns that are lost when more abstract relations are the focus of the annotation, and (2) that a larger set of annotated tokens can show more reliable distributional patterns.",
        "In sum, data mining of PDTB with respect to subordinating conjunctions has shown radically different distribution patterns regarding the relative position of the arguments.",
        "Some of these have confirmed and strengthened previous theoretical claims and some have suggested new and promising research directions.",
        "Further work in this area will also be extremely relevant for NLG sentence planning components employing discourse relations (Walker et al.",
        "(2003), Stent et al.",
        "(2004), among others), where the sentence planner needs to make decisions regarding cue placement.",
        "Finally, while our approach is “syntactic”, with the distribution of the connectives and their arguments being explored in terms of whether they are subordinating conjunctions, coordinating conjunctions, or adverbial connectives, one can also explore the patterning of connectives in terms of semantic categories, once their semantic role annotation is complete (cf.",
        "Section 2.2).",
        "The latter could be especially interesting to cross-linguistic studies of discourse, as well as to applications such as multilingual generation and MT are envisaged.11"
