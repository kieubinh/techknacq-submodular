        "Discourse information plays an important part in natural language systems performing tasks such as text summarization, question-answering systems and collaborative planning.",
        "But the type of discourse information that is relevant varies widely depending on domain, genre, number of participants, whether it is written or spoken, etc.",
        "Therefore empirical analysis is necessary to determine commonalities in the variations of discourse and develop general purpose algorithms for discourse analysis.",
        "The heightened interest in human language technologies in the last decade has sparked several discourse annotation projects.",
        "Though there has been a lot of research, many of the projects focus on a few specific areas of discourse relevant to their respective system.",
        "For example, a text summarization system working on texts from the web would not need to know about dialogue modeling or grounding or prosody.",
        "In contrast, for a spoken dialogue system that collaborates with a user, such information is crucial but the organization of web pages is not.",
        "In this paper we describe our work in the Monroe Project, an effort targeting the production and use of a linguistically rich annotated corpus of a series of task-oriented spoken dialogs in an emergency rescue domain.",
        "Our project differs from past projects involving reference annotation and discourse segmentation in that the semantics and discourse information is generated automatically.",
        "Most other work in this area has had minimal semantics or speech act tagging, if anything at all, which can be quite labor intensive to annotate.",
        "In addition, our domain is spoken language, which is rarely annotated for the information we are providing.",
        "We describe our research on reference resolution and discourse segmentation using the annotated corpus and the software tools we have developed to help us with different aspects of the annotation tasks."

        "One of the aims of the Monroe Project was to develop a wide coverage grammar for spoken dialogue.",
        "Since parsing is just an initial stage of natural language understanding, the project was focused not just on obtaining syntactic trees alone (as is done in many other parsed corpora, for example, Penn TreeBank (Marcus et al., 1993) or Tiger (Brants and Plaehn, 2000)).",
        "Instead, we aimed to develop a parser and grammar for the production of syntactic parses and semantic representations useful in discourse processing.",
        "The parser produces a domain-independent semantic representation with information necessary for referential and discourse processing, in particular, domain-independent representations of determiners and quantifiers (to be resolved by our reference module), domain-independent representations for discourse adverbials, and tense, aspect and modality information.",
        "This necessitated the development of a domain-independent logical form syntax and a domain-independent ontology as a source of semantic types for our representations (Dzikovska et al., 2004).",
        "In subsequent sections we discuss how the parser-generated representations are used as a basis for discourse annotation."

        "If an entity is mentioned frequently, and thus is very important to the current topic, it is usually pronom-inalized.",
        "Psycholinguistic studies show that salient terms are usually evoked as pronouns because of the lighter inference load they place on the listener.",
        "Because pronouns occur frequently in discourse, it is very important to know what they resolve to, so the entire sentence can be processed correctly.",

        "There has been plenty of theoretical work such as (Grosz and Sidner, 1986), (Moser and Moore, 1996) which shows that just as sentences can be decomposed into smaller constituents, a discourse can be decomposed into smaller units called discourse segments.",
        "Though there are many different ways to segment discourse, the common themes are that some sequences are more closely related than others (discourse segments) and that a discourse can be organized as a tree, with the leaves being the individual utterances and the interior nodes being discourse segments.",
        "The embeddedness of a segment effects which previous segments, and thus their entities, are accessible.",
        "As a discourse progresses, segments close and unless they are close to the root of the tree (have a low embedding) may not be accessible.",
        "Discourse segmentation has implications for spoken dialogue systems.",
        "Properly detecting discourse structure can lead to improved reference resolution accuracy since competing antecedents in inaccessible clauses may be removed from consideration.",
        "Discourse segmentation is often closely related to plan and intention recognition, so recognizing one can lead to better detection of the other.",

        "The semantic features are the domain-independent semantic properties of words encoded in our lexicon.",
        "We use them to express selectional restrictions (Dzikovska, 2004) and we are currently investigating their use in reference resolution.",
        "For discourse annotation, we primarily rely on the logical forms.",

        "There is a domain-independent term for the discourse adverbial Sot, and the term for the main event, (LF: : Move GO) , which contains the tense and modal information in the : TMA field.",
        "The phrase the heart attack person is represented by two terms linked together with the :ASSOC-WITH relationship, to be resolved during discourse processing.",
        "Finally, there is a term for the adverbial modifier there, which also results in the implicit pronoun (the ZSo is identified as a conjunct because it is a connective, and its meaning cannot be identified more specifically by the parser without pragmatic reasoning last term in the representation) denoting a place to which the movement is directed.",
        "The terms provide the basic building blocks to be used in the discourse annotation, and their unique identifiers are used as reference indices, as discussed in the next section.",
        "The corpus-building process consists of three stages: initial annotation, parsing and hand-checking.",
        "The initial annotation prepares the sentences as suitable inputs to the TRIPS parser.",

        "As a first approximation, the utterances where there is a parse covering the entire utterance are marked as “AUTO-GOOD” and those where there is not are marked as “AUTO-BAD”.",
        "Then these results are hand-checked by human annotators using our CorpusTool to inspect the analyses and either mark them as “GOOD”, or mark the incorrect parses as “BAD”, and add a reason code explaining the problem with the parse.",
        "Note that we use a strict criterion for accuracy so only utterances that have both a correct syntactic structure and a correct logical form can be marked as “GOOD”.",
        "The CorpusTool allows annotators to view the syntactic and semantic representations at different levels of granularity.",
        "The top-level LF tree shown in Figure 3 allows a number of crucial aspects of the representation to be checked quickly.",
        "Note that the entity identifiers are color-coded, which is a great help for checking variable mappings.",
        "If everything shown in the top-level representation is correct, the full LF with all terms expanded can be viewed.",
        "Similarly, levels of the parse tree can be hidden or expanded as needed.",
        "After the initial checking stage, we analyze the utterances marked “BAD” and make changes in the grammar and lexicon to address the BAD utterances whenever possible.",
        "Occasionally, when the problems are due to ambiguity, the parser is able to parse the utterance, but the interpretation it selects is not the correct one among possible alternatives.",
        "In this case, we manually select the correct parse and add it to the gold-standard corpus.",
        "Once the changes have been made, we re-parse the corpus.",
        "Our parsing tool determines automatically which parses have been changed and marks them to be rechecked by the human annotators.",

        "The hand-checking scheme was found to be quite reliable, with a kappa of 0.79.",
        "Currently, 85% of the grammatical sentences are marked as GOOD in the gold-standard coverage of the 5 dialogs in the Monroe corpus.",

        "Our annotation scheme is based on the GNOME project scheme (Poesio, 2000) which annotates referential links between entities as well as their respective discourse and salience information.",
        "The main difference in our approach is that we do not annotate discourse units and certain semantic features, and most of the basic syntactic and semantic features are produced automatically for us in the parsing phase.",
        "We use standoff annotation to separate our coref-erence annotation from the syntactic and semantic parse annotations.",
        "The standoff file for pronouns consists of two fields for each pronoun to handle the reference information: relation, which specifies how the entities are related; and refers-to, which specifies the id of the term the referential entity in question points to.",

        "demonstrative relations (Poesio and Viera, 1998).",
        "Because our focus was on coreferential entities, we had our annotators annotate only the main relation type for the non-coreferential pronouns since these could be done more reliably.",

        "Demonstrative pronouns had refers-to fields pointing to either utterance numbers or a list of utterance numbers in the case of a discourse segment.",
        "Finally, there were some pronouns for which it was too difficult to decide what they referred to, if anything.",
        "These typically were found in incomplete sentences without a verb to provide semantic information.",
        "After the annotation phase, a post-processing phase identifies all the noun phrases that refer to the same entity, and generates a unique chain-id for this entity.",
        "This is similar to the field in the GNOME scheme.",
        "The advantage of doing this processing is that it is possible for a referring expression to refer to a past instantiation that was not the last mentioned instantiation, which is usually what is annotated.",
        "As a result, it is necessary to mark all coreferential instantiations with the same identification tag.",
        "Figure 5 shows a snapshot of the PronounTool in use for the pronoun there in the second utterance of our example.",

        "The user selects the entity and clicks “Select” and the antecedent id is added to the refers-to field.",
