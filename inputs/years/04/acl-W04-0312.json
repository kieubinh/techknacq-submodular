        "Despite increasing psycholinguistic evidence of incrementality in language processing, both in parsing (see e.g. (Crocker et al., 2000)) and in production (Ferreira, 1996), there is almost universal agreement that this should not be reflected in grammar formalisms which constitute the underlying model of language (for rare exceptions, see (Hausser, 1989; Kempson et al., 2001)).",
        "Constraint-based grammar formalisms are accordingly defined neutrally between either of these applications, with parsing/generation systems (whether incremental or not) defined as independent architectures manipulating the same underlying system.1 Such assumptions however lead to formal architectures that are relatively poorly set up for modelling dialogue, for they provide no basis for the very rich degree of interaction between participants in dialogue.",
        "A common phenomenon in dialogue is",
        "that of shared utterances (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986), with exchange of roles of parser and producer midway through an utterance:2",
        "Daniel: Why don’t you stop mumbling and Marc: Speak proper like?",
        "Daniel: speak proper?",
        "Ruth: What did Alex ... Hugh: Design?",
        "A kaleidoscope.",
        "Such utterances clearly show the need for a strictly incremental model: however, they are particularly problematic for any overall architecture in which parsing and generation are independently defined as applications of a use-neutral grammar formalism which yields as output the set of well-formed strings, for in these types of exchange, the string uttered by one and parsed by the other need not be a wellformed string in its own right, so will not fall within the set of data which the underlying formalism is set up to capture.",
        "Yet, with the transition between interlocutors seen as a shift from one system to another, each such substring will have to be characterised independently.",
        "Many other dialogue phenomena also show the need for interaction between the parsing and generation processes, among them cross-speaker ellipsis (e.g. simple bare fragment answers to wh-questions), and alignment (Pickering and Garrod, 2004), in which conversational participants mirror each other’s patterns at many levels (including lexical choice and syntactic structure).",
        "The challenge of being able to model these phenomena, problematic for theorists but extremely easy and natural for dialogue participants themselves, has recently been put out by Pickering and Garrod (2004) as a means of evaluating both putative grammar formalisms and",
        "models of language use.",
        "In response to this challenge, we suggest that an alternative means of evaluating parsing implementations is by evaluation of paired parsing-generation models and the dialogue model that results.",
        "As an illustration of this, we show how if we drop the assumption that grammar formalisms are defined neutrally between parsing and production in favour of frameworks in which the serial nature of language processing is a central design feature (as in Dynamic Syntax: (Kempson et al., 2001)), then we can define a model in which incremental subsystems of parsing and generation are necessarily tightly coordinated, and can thus provide a computational model of dialogue which directly corresponds with currently emerging psycholinguistic results (Branigan et al., 2000).",
        "In particular, by adding a shared model of context to previously defined word-by-word incremental parsing and generation models, we show how the switch in speaker/hearer roles during a shared utterance can be seen as a switch between processes which are directed by different goals, but which share the same incrementally built data structures.",
        "We then show how this inherent incrementality and structure/context sharing also allows a straightforward model of cross-speaker ellipsis and alignment."

        "Dynamic Syntax (DS) (Kempson et al., 2001) is a parsing-directed grammar formalism in which a decorated tree structure representing a semantic interpretation for a string is incrementally projected following the left-right sequence of the words.",
        "Importantly, this tree is not a model of syntactic structure, but is strictly semantic, being a representation of the predicate-argument structure of the sentence.",
        "In DS, grammaticality is defined as parsability (the successful incremental construction of a tree-structure logical form, using all the information given by the words in sequence): there is no central use-neutral grammar of the kind assumed by most approaches to parsing and/or generation.",
        "The logical forms are lambda terms of the epsilon calculus (see (Meyer-Viol, 1995) for a recent development), so quantification is expressed through terms of type e whose complexity is reflected in evaluation procedures that apply to propositional formulae once constructed, and not in the tree itself.",
        "With all quantification expressed as type e terms, the standard grounds for mismatch between syntactic and semantic analysis for all NPs is removed; and, indeed, all syntactic distributions are explained in terms of this incremental and monotonic growth of partial representations of content.",
        "Hence the claim that the model itself constitutes a NL grammar formalism.",
        "Parsing (Kempson et al., 2001) defines parsing as a process of building labelled semantic trees in a strictly left-to-right, word-by-word incremental fashion by using computational actions and lexical actions defined (for some natural language) using the modal tree logic LOFT (Blackburn and Meyer-Viol, 1994).",
        "These actions are defined as transition functions between intermediate states, which monotonically extend tree structures and node decorations.",
        "Words are specified in the lexicon to have associated lexical actions: the (possibly partial) semantic trees are monotonically extended by applying these actions as each word is consumed from the input string.",
        "Partial trees may be underspecified: tree node relations may be only partially specified; node decorations may be defined in terms of unfulfilled requirements and metavariables; and trees may lack a full set of scope constraints.",
        "Anaphora resolution is a familiar case of update: pronouns are defined to project metavariables that are substituted from context as part of the construction process.",
        "Relative to the same tree-growth dynamics, long-distance dependency effects are characterised through restricted licensing of partial trees with relation between nodes introduced with merely a constraint on some fixed extension (following D-Tree grammar formalisms (Marcus, 1987)), an underspecification that gets resolved within the left-to-right construction process.3 Quantifying terms are also built up using determiner and noun to yield a partially specified term e.g. (E, y, Man'(y)) with a requirement for a scope statement.",
        "These scope statements, of the form x < y (‘the term binding x is to be evaluated as taking scope over the term binding y’), are added to a locally dominating type-t-requiring node.",
        "Generally, they are added to an accumulating set following the serial order of processing in determining the scope dependency, but indefinites (freer in scope potential) are assigned a metavariable as first argument, allow",
        "ing selection from any term already added, including temporally-sorted variables associated with tense/modality specifications.",
        "The general mechanism is the incremental analogue of quantifier storage; and once a propositional formula of type t has been derived at a node with some collection of scope statements, these are jointly evaluated to yield fully expanded terms that reflect all relative dependencies within the restrictor of the terms themselves.",
        "For example, parsing A man coughed yields the pair Si < x, Cough'(E, x, Man'(x)) (Si the index of evaluation), then evaluated as Man'(a) n Cough'(a) where a = (E, x, Man'(x) n Cough'(x)).4 Once all requirements are satisfied and all partiality and underspecification is resolved, trees are complete, parsing is successful and the input string is said to be grammatical.",
        "Central to the formalism is the incremental and monotonic growth of labelled partial trees: the parser state at any point contains all the partial trees which have been produced by the portion of the string so far consumed and which remain candidates for completion.5",
        "Generation (Otsuka and Purver, 2003; Purver and Otsuka, 2003) (hereafter O&P) give an initial method of context-independent tactical generation based on the same incremental parsing process, in which an output string is produced according to an input semantic tree, the goal tree.",
        "The generator incrementally produces a set of corresponding output strings and their associated partial trees (again, on a left-to-right, word-by-word basis) by following standard parsing routines and using the goal tree as a subsumption check.",
        "At each stage, partial strings and trees are tentatively extended using some word/action pair from the lexicon; only those candidates which produce trees which subsume the goal tree are kept, and the process succeeds when a complete tree identical to the goal tree is produced.",
        "Generation and parsing thus use the same tree representations and tree-building actions throughout."

      "heading": "3 Contextual Model",
      "text": [
        "The current proposed model (and its implementation) is based on these earlier definitions but modifies them in several ways, most significantly by the addition of a model of context: ical language that decorate the tree.",
        "while they assume some notion of context they give no formal model or implementation.",
        "The contextual model we now assume is made up not only of the semantic trees built by the DS parsing process, but also the sequences of words and associated lexical actions that have been used to build them.",
        "It is the presence of (and associations between) all three, together with the fact that this context is equally available to both parsing and generation processes, that allow our straightforward model of dialogue phenomena.7 For the purposes of the current implementation, we make a simplifying assumption that the length of context is finite and limited to the result of some immediately previous parse (although information that is independently available can be represented in the DS tree format, so that, in reality, larger and only partially ordered contexts are no doubt possible): context at any point is therefore made up of the trees and word/action sequences obtained in parsing the previous sentence and the current (incomplete) sentence.",
        "Parsing in Context A parser state is therefore defined to be a set of triples (T, W, A), where T is a (possibly partial) semantic tree,8 W the sequence of words and A the sequence of lexical and computational actions that have been used in building it.",
        "This set will initially contain only a single triple (Ta, 0, 0) (where Ta is the basic axiom taken as the starting point of the parser, and the word and action sequences are empty), but will expand as words are consumed from the input string and the corresponding actions produce multiple possible partial trees.",
        "At any point in the parsing process, the context for a particular partial tree T in 6 There are other departures in the treatment of linked structures (for relatives and other modifiers) and quantification, and more relevantly to improve the incrementality of the generation process: we do not adopt the proposal of O&P to speed up generation by use of a restricted multiset of lexical entries selected on the basis of goal tree features, which prevents strictly incremental generation and excludes modification of the goal tree.",
        "7 In building n-tuples of trees corresponding to predicate-argument structures, the system is similar to LTAG formalisms (Joshi and Kulick, 1997).",
        "However, unlike LTAG systems (see e.g. (Stone and Doran, 1997)), both parsing and generation are not head-driven, but fully (word-by-word) incremental.",
        "This has the advantage of allowing fully incremental models for all languages, matching psycholinguistic observations (Ferreira, 1996).",
        "this set can then be taken to consist of: (a) a similar triple (T0, W0, A0) given by the previous sentence, where T0 is its semantic tree representation, W0 and A0 the sequences of words and actions that were used in building it; and (b) the triple (T, W, A) itself.",
        "Once parsing is complete, the final parser state, a set of triples, will form the new starting context for the next sentence.",
        "In the simple case where the sentence is unambiguous (or all ambiguity has been removed) this set will again have been reduced to a single triple (T1, W1, A1), corresponding to the final interpretation of the string T1 with its sequence of words W1 and actions A1, and this replaces (T0, W0, A0) as the new context; in the presence of persistent ambiguity there will simply be more than one triple in the new context.9 Generation in Context A generator state is now defined as a pair (Tg, X) of a goal tree Tg and a set X of pairs (5, P), where 5 is a candidate partial string and P is the associated parser state (a set of (T, W, A) triples).",
        "Initially, the set X will usually contain only one pair, of an empty candidate string and the standard initial parser state, (0, { (Ta, 0, 0)1).",
        "However, as both parsing and generation processes are strictly incremental, they can in theory start from any state.",
        "The context for any partial tree T is defined exactly as for parsing: the previous sentence triple (T0, W0, A0); and the current triple (T, W, A).",
        "Generation and parsing are thus very closely coupled, with the central part of both processes being a parser state: a set of tree/word-sequence/action-sequence triples.",
        "Essential to this correspondence is the lack of construction of higher-level hypotheses about the state of the interlocutor.",
        "All transitions are defined over the context for the individual (parser or generator).",
        "In principle, contexts could be extended to include high-level hypotheses, but these are not essential and are not implemented in our model (see (Millikan, 2004) for justification of this stance)."

        "The initial hearer A therefore parses as usual until transition,10 then given a suitable goal tree Tg, forms a transition generator state Gt = (Tg, {(0, Pt)}), from which generation can begin directly – see figure 2.11 Note that the context does not change between processes.",
        "For generation to begin from this transition state, the new goal tree Tg must be subsumed by at least one of the partial trees in Pt (i.e. the proposition to be expressed must be subsumed by the incomplete proposition that has been built so far by the parser).",

        "Transition from Speaker to Hearer At transition, the initial speaker B’s generator state G't contains the pair (5t, P't), where 5t is the partial string output so far, and Pt' is the corresponding parser state, the transition state as far as B is concerned.",

        "A generator state must therefore rule out only pairs (5, P) for which P contains no trees which subsume the goal tree, rather than thinning the set P directly via the subsumption check as proposed by O&P. It is the incrementality of the underlying grammar formalism that allows this simple switch: the parsing process can begin directly 12 Of course, if both A and B share the same lexical entries and communication is perfect, Pt = P't, but we do not have to assume that this is the case.",
