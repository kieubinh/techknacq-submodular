        "Although language processing may be a specialized cognitive faculty, it is possible that it is nevertheless shaped by general constraints on the human cognitive architecture.",
        "This point has been addressed extensively in the connectionist literature, but we present a somewhat different approach to this problem by casting parsing within the cognitive architecture ACT-R (Anderson et al., 2002) and directly using the constraints provided in ACT-R to account for several interesting cross-linguistic facts: the well-known sentential complement/relative clause asymmetry (Gibson, 2000; Grodner and Gibson, 2003) and the subject/object relative clause asymmetry in English (Homes and O’Regan, 1981); and some recent results (Vasishth, 2003) involving Hindi center embeddings, including a principled account of individual variation in subject behavior.",
        "In developing this approach, we argue that resource limitation in working memory is better defined as an artefact of very general constraints on information processing – specifically, rehearsal and activation – rather than as an inherent numerical bound on memory capacity (cf. (Gibson, 2000; Hawkins, 1994); also see Section 3.5).",
        "In the rest of this paper, we first introduce the ACT-R architecture.",
        "Then we present the results of several simulations of experiments available in the psycholinguistic literature.",
        "The paper concludes with a discussion of the potential advantages and shortcomings of this approach, and of the broader consequences of modeling parsing within a cognitive architecture."

        "ACT-R is a theory of the human cognitive architecture.",
        "It allows the development of computational models that can closely simulate experimental methodologies such as eye-tracking and self-paced reading, and has been used to model a wide array of behavioral data from learning and memory, problem solving and decision making, language and communication, perception and attention, cognitive development, and individual differences (Anderson et al., 2002).",
        "The ACT-R architecture is attractive as a modeling tool for three reasons.",
        "First, it is based on a wide array of empirical results in various domains of cognitive psychology.",
        "Second, it is flexible enough to permit the modeler to add their own assumptions and theories about the specific task to be modeled.",
        "Finally, ACT-R models yield dependent measures such as reading time in much the same way as humans performing the experiment; e.g., the system can easily be programmed to simulate key presses after it processes material presented on the screen.",
        "As shown in Figure 1, the architecture consists of several MODULES such as Declarative, Visual, and Manual.",
        "Each module is associated with a BUFFER which temporarily stores information for a given action.",
        "For example, the visual buffer is used to store an item “seen” by the system in the environment before it is used in the service of some task.",
        "The module that is especially important for the present paper is the Declarative (henceforth, DM).",
        "DM represents permanent memory: every fact that is assumed to be known is encoded as a CHUNK in declarative memory.",
        "A chunk is an attribute-value list structure with a special attribute, ISA, which defines its type.",

        "Examples of executing actions are retrieving something from DM; changing a value in one of the goal’s slots; repositioning the hand over a keyboard; a visual shift of attention; changing the goal to a new one, etc.",
        "If the goal is changed, then this new goal now occupies the goal buffer.",
        "Building an ACT-R model is essentially a definition of possible sequences of actions for a given state of affairs.",
        "Events like retrievals from DM are triggered by looking at the contents of one or more buffers.",
        "For example, the ACT-R system “sees” an item/object on the screen and then encodes it as a visual chunk.",
        "This chunk can then be harvested from the visual buffer; it includes (as slot-value specifications) information about the content of the item seen, its x-y coordinates, etc.",

        "Previous research suggests that humans employ some variant of left-corner parsing (see, e.g., (Resnik, 1992)), which in essence involves a bottom-up and a top-down (predictive) step.",
        "We adopt this parsing strategy in the simulations.",
        "In order to model the prediction of syntactic structure based on incrementally appearing input, we assume that sentence structure templates are available in declarative memory as underspecified chunks.",
        "These chunks are retrieved every time a new word is integrated into the structure, as are prior arguments necessary for semantic integration.",
        "We illustrate the parsing process with a simple example (Figure 2).",
        "Suppose that the sentence to be parsed is The girl ran, and suppose that we are simulating self-paced reading (Just et al., 1982).",
        "When the word the is seen, a bottom-up and top-down structure building step results in a sentence with an intransitive verb being predicted.",
        "This structure becomes the current goal.",
        "Then the word girl is seen and processed, i.e., its lexical entry is retrieved from declarative memory.",
        "The noun slot in the goal is then instantiated with that lexical entry.",
        "In the next step, if the word ran is seen the relevant lexical item for the verb is retrieved and instantiated with the verb slot of the goal; here, the verb’s argument is also retrieved and integrated with the subcategorization frame of the verb.",
        "If, instead of ran the word that appears, a new goal is created, with any previously instantiated slots of the preceding goal being passed on to the new goal, and parsing proceeds from there.",
        "Each retrieval of a goal from memory results in a surge in its activation, so that repeated retrievals result in increased activation; and the higher the activation of an item the faster it is processed.",
        "At the same time, activation decays according to the power law of forgetting (Anderson et al., 2002).",
        "In the same way that the goals undergo decay and reactivation, so do the previously seen words.",
        "This means that the speed of retrieval of a previously seen argument at a verb will be determined by the activation level of that argument.",
        "Thus, the activation of both the goals (predicted structures) and the arguments affect processing.",
        "In our simulations, for simplicity we code in the exact steps that ACT-R takes for particular sentences.",
        "Although it is feasible to build a very gen",
        "eral parser in pure ACT-R, before doing this we wanted to first establish whether ACT-R’s reactivation mechanisms can account for a reasonable array of facts from the sentence processing literature.",

        "There are of course certain potential limitations in the work presented here.",
        "Several alternative hypotheses remain to be explored, e.g., the role of competence grammar and its own (possibly theory-internal) operations on processing; the role of experience (Crocker and Brants, 2000), etc.",
        "However, the present research is a necessary first step since it provides a basis for such a comparison.",
        "Secondly, there are specific assumptions in the model that may be controversial.",
        "For example, we assume that entire sentence structures are predicted as goal chunks, and not verb-types (cf. (Konieczny, 2000)).",
        "We are conducting further experiments to explore the predictions made by different assumptions.",
        "Finally, we have used toy simulations to explore the ACT-R constraint-interaction space, the task of scaling up such a model to parse essentially any kind of input is necessary, but still in the future.",
