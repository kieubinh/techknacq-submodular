        "Much research on multiword expressions involving verbs has focused on verb-particle constructions (VPCs), such as scale up or put down (e.g., Bannard et al., 2003; McCarthy et al., 2003; Villavicencio, 2003).",

        "These constructions, like VPCs, may extend the meaning of the component words in interesting ways, may be (semi-)productive, and may or may not be compositional.",
        "Interestingly, despite these shared properties, LVCs are in some sense the opposite of VPCs.",
        "Where VPCs involve a wide range of verbs in combination with a small number of particles, LVCs involve a small number of verbs in combination with a wide range of co-verbal elements.",
        "An LVC occurs when a light verb, such as take, give, or make in (1), is used in conjunction with a complement to form a multiword expression.",
        "A verb used as a light verb can be viewed as drawing on a subset of its more general semantic features (Butt, 2003).",
        "This entails that most of the distinctive meaning of a (non-idiomatic) LVC comes from the complement to the light verb.",
        "This property can be seen clearly in the paraphrases of (1) given below in (2): in each, the complement of the light verb in (1a–c) contributes the main verb of the corresponding paraphrase.1",

        "Furthermore, LVCs have particular properties that require special attention within a computational system.",
        "For example, many LVCs (such as those in (1) above) exhibit compositional and semi-productive patterns, while others (such as take charge) may be more fixed.",
        "Thus, LVCs present the well-known problem with multiword expressions of determining whether and how they should be listed in a computational lexicon.",
        "Moreover, LVCs are divided into different classes of constructions, which have distinctive syntactic and semantic properties (Wierzbicka, 1982; Kearns, 2002).",
        "In general, there is no one “light verb construction” that can be dealt with uniformly in a computational system, as is suggested by Sag et al.",

        "Rather there are different types of LVCs, each with unique properties.",
        "In our initial computational investigation of light verb phenomena, we have chosen to focus on a particular class of semi-productive LVCs in English, exemplified by such expressions as take a stroll, take a run, take a walk, etc.",
        "Specifically, we investigate the degree to which we can determine, on the basis of corpus statistics, which words form a valid complement to a given light verb in this type of construction. '",
        "The two expressions differ in aspectual properties.",
        "It has been argued that the usage of a light verb adds a telic component to the event in most cases (Wierzbicka, 1982; Butt, 2003); though see Folli et al.",
        "(2003) for telicity in Persian LVCs.",
        "Our approach draws on a linguistic analysis, presented in Section 2, in which the complement of this type of LVC (e.g., a walk in take a walk) is – in spite of the presence of the determiner a – actually a verbal element (Wierzbicka, 1982; Kearns, 2002).",
        "Section 3 describes how this analysis motivates both a method for generalizing over verb classes to find potential valid complements for a light verb, and a mutual information measure that takes the linguistic properties of this type of LVC into account.",

        "The main difference between these two types of light verb usages is that the complement of a TLV is claimed to be headed by a verb.",
        "Wierzbicka (1982) argues that although the complement in such constructions might appear to be a zero-derived nominal, its syntactic category when used in an LVC is actually a verb, as indicated by the properties of such TLV constructions.",
        "For example, Kearns (2002) shows that, in contrast to VAVs, the complement of a TLV usually cannot be definite (3), nor can it be the surface subject of a passive construction (4) or a fronted wh-element (5).",

        "For simplicity, we will continue to refer to them here generally as LVCs.",
        "The meaning of an LVC of this type is almost equivalent to the meaning of the verbal complement (cf. (1) and (2) in Section 1).",
        "However, the light verb does contribute to the meaning of the construction, as can be seen by the fact that there are constraints on which light verb can occur with which complement (Wierzbicka, 1982).",
        "For example, one can give a cry but not *take a cry.",
        "The acceptability depends on semantic properties of the complement, and, as we explore below, may generalize in consistent ways across semantically similar (complement) verbs, as in give a cry, give a moan, give a howl; *take a cry, *take a moan, *take a howl.",
        "Many interesting questions pertaining to the syntactic and semantic properties of LVCs have been examined in the linguistic literature: How does the semantics of an LVC relate to the semantics of its parts?",

        "Why do certain light verbs select for certain complements?",
        "What underlies the (semi-)productivity of the creation of LVCs?",
        "Given the crosslinguistic frequency of LVCs, work on computational lexicons will depend heavily on the answers to these questions.",

        "We hypothesized that while the latter should indicate a collocation, the combined measure should help to focus on LVCs in particular, because of their linguistic property of occurring primarily with an indefinite determiner.",
        "On the individual classes, when considering correlations that are statistically significant or marginally so (i.e., at the confidence level of 90%), the DiffAll measure overall has somewhat stronger correlations than MI.",
        "Over all complement verbs together, DiffAll is roughly the same as MI for take; is somewhat better for give, and is worse for make.'",
        "Better performance over the individual classes indicates that when applying the measures, at least to take and give, it is helpful to separate the data according to semantic verb class.",
        "For make, the appropriate approach is not as clear, since the results on the individual classes are so skewed.",
        "In general, the results confirm our hypothesis that semantic verb classes are highly relevant to measuring the acceptability of LVCs of this type.",
        "The results also indicate the need to look in more detail at the properties of different light verbs."

        "Other computational research on LVCs differs from ours in two key aspects.",
        "First, the work has looked at any nominalizations as complements of potential light verbs (what they term “support verbs”) (Fontenelle, 1993; Grefenstette and Teufel, 1995; Dras and Johnson, 1996).",
        "Our work differs in focusing on verbal nouns that form the complement of a particular type of LVC, allowing us to explore the role of class information in restricting the complements of these constructions.",
        "Second, this earlier work has viewed all verbs as possible light verbs, while we look at only the class of potential light verbs identified by linguistic theory.",
        "The difference in focus on these two aspects of the problem leads to the basic differences in approach: while they attempt to find probable light verbs for nominalization complements, we try to find possible (verbal) noun complements for given light verbs.",
        "Our work differs both practically, in the type of measure used, and conceptually, in the formulation of the problem.",
        "For example, Grefenstette and Teufel (1995) used some linguistic properties to weed out potential light verbs from lists sorted by raw frequency, while Dras and Johnson (1996) used frequency of the verb weighted by a weak predictor of its prior probability as a light verb.",
        "We instead use a standard collocation detection measure (mutual information), the terms of which we modify to",
        "capture linguistic properties of the construction.",
        "More fundamentally, our proposal differs in its emphasis on possible class-based generalizations in LVCs that have heretofore been unexplored.",
        "It would be interesting to apply this idea to the broader classes of nominalizations investigated in earlier work.",
        "Moreover, our approach could draw on ideas from the earlier proposals to detect the light verbs automatically, since the precise set of LVs differs crosslinguistically – and LV status may indeed be a continuum rather than a discrete distinction."

        "Our results demonstrate the benefit of treating LVCs as more than just a simple collocation.",
        "We exploit linguistic knowledge particular to the “LV a V” construction to devise an acceptability measure that correlates reasonably well with human judgments.",
        "By comparing the mutual information with indefinite and definite determiners, we use syntactic patterns to tap into the distinctive underlying properties of the construction.",
        "Furthermore, we hypothesized that, because the complement in these constructions is a verb, we would see systematic behaviour across the light verbs in terms of their ability to combine with complements from different verb classes.",
        "Our human ratings indeed showed class-based tendencies for the light verbs.",
        "Moreover, our acceptability measure showed higher correlations when the verbs were divided by class.",
        "This indicates that there is greater consistency within a verb class between the corpus statistics and the ability to combine with a light verb.",
        "Thus, the semantic classes provide a useful way to increase the performance of the acceptability measure.",
        "The correlations are far from perfect, however.",
        "In addition to noise in the data, one problem may be that these classes are too coarse-grained.",
        "Exploration is needed of other possible verb (and noun) classes as the basis for generalizing the complements of these constructions.",
        "However, we must also look to the measures themselves for improving our techniques.",
        "Several linguistic properties distinguish these constructions, but our measures only drew on one.",
        "In ongoing work, we are exploring methods for incorporating other linguistic behaviours into a measure for these constructions, as well as for LVCs more generally.",
        "We are widening this investigation in other directions as well.",
        "Our results reveal interesting differences among the light verbs, indicating that the set of light verbs is itself heterogeneous.",
        "More research is needed to determine the properties of a broader range of light verbs, and how they influence the valid combinations they form with semantic classes.",
        "Finally, we plan to collect more extensive rating data, but are concerned with the difficulty found in judging these constructions.",
        "Gathering solid human ratings is a challenge in this line of investigation, but this only serves to underscore the importance of devising corpus-based acceptability measures in order to better support development of accurate computational lexicons."
