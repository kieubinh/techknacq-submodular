        "Automatic paraphrase generation technology offers the potential to bridge gaps between the authors and readers of documents.",

        "In Japanese, like other languages, there are several classes of paraphrasing that exhibit a degree of regularity that allows them to be explained by a handful of sophisticated general rules and lexical semantic knowledge.",
        "For example, paraphrases associated with voice alteration, verb/case alteration, compounds, and lexical derivations all fall into such classes.",
        "In this paper, we focus our discussion on another useful class of paraphrases, namely, the paraphrasing of light-verb constructions (LVCs), and propose a computational model for generating paraphrases of this class.",
        "Sentence (1s) is an example of an LVC 1.",
        "An LVC is a verb phrase (“kandou-o ataeta (made an impression)” in (1s)) that consists of a light-verb (“ataeta (give-PAST)”) that grammatically governs a nomi",

        "film-NOM him-ACC be impressed-CAUSATIVE, PAST The film impressed him.",
        "To generate this type of paraphrase, we need a computational model that is capable of the following two classes of choice (also see Section 2.2): Selection of the voice: The model needs to be able to choose the voice of the target sentence from active, passive, causative, etc.",
        "In example (1), the causative voice is chosen, which is indicated by the auxiliary verb “ase (causative)”.",
        "Reassignment of the cases: The model needs to be able to reassign a case marker to each argument of the main verb.",
        "In (1), the grammatical case of “kare (him),” which was originally assigned the dative case, is changed to accusative.",
        "The task is not as simple as it may seem, because both decisions depend not only on the syntactic and semantic attributes of the light-verb, but also on those of the nominalized verb (Muraki, 1991).",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel lexical semantics-based account of the LVC paraphrasing, which uses the theory of Lexical Conceptual Structure (LCS) of Japanese verbs (Kageyama, 1996; Takeuchi et al., 2001).",
        "The theory of LCS offers an advantage as the basis of lexical resources for paraphrasing, because it has been developed to explain varieties of linguistic phenomena including lexical derivations, the construction of compounds, and verb alteration (Levin, 1993; Dorr et al., 1995; Kageyama, 1996; Takeuchi et al., 2001), all of which are associated with the systematic paraphrasing we mentioned above.",
        "The paraphrasing associated with LVCs is not idiosyncratic to Japanese but also appears commonly in other languages such as English (Mel’ˇcuk and Polgu`ere, 1987; Iordanskaja et al., 1991; Dras, 1999, etc.",

        "One of the critical issues that we face in paraphrase generation is how to develop and maintain knowledge resources that covers a sufficiently wide range of paraphrasing patterns such as those indicating that “to make an attempt” can be paraphrased into “to attempt,” and that “potential” can be paraphrased into “possibility.” Several attempts have been made to develop such resources manually (Sato, 1999; Dras, 1999; Inui and Nogami, 2001); those work have, however, tended to restrict their scope to specific classes of paraphrases, and cannot be used to construct a sufficiently comprehensive resource for practical applications.",
        "There is another trend in the research in this field, namely, the automatic acquisition of paraphrase patterns from parallel or comparable corpora (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Lin and Pantel, 2001; Pang et al., 2003; Shinyama and Sekine, 2003, etc.).",
        "This type of approach may be able to reduce the cost of resource development.",
        "There are problems that must be overcome, however, before they can work practically.",
        "First, automatically acquired patterns tend to be complex.",
        "For example, from the paraphrase of (4s) into (4t), we can naively obtain the pattern: “X is purchased by Y ==>.",
        "Y buys X.”",
        "(4) s. This car was purchased by him.",
        "t. He bought this car.",
        "This could also, however, be regarded as a combination of a simpler pattern of lexical paraphrasing (“purchase ==>.",
        "buy”) and a voice activization (“X",
        "be VERB-PP by Y ==>.",
        "Y VERB X”).",
        "If we were to use an acquisition scheme that is not capable of decomposing such complex paraphrases correctly, we would have to collect a combinatorial number of paraphrases to gain the required coverage.",
        "Second, the results of automatic acquisition would likely include many inappropriate patterns, which would require manual correction.",
        "Manual correction, however, would be impractical if we were collecting a combinatorial number of patterns.",
        "Our approach to this dilemma is as follows: first, we manually develop the resources needed to cover those paraphrases that appear regularly, and then decompose and automatically refine the acquired paraphrasing patterns using those resources.",
        "The work reported in this paper is aimed at this resource development."

        "However, not only the triplet itself but also its context sometimes affects whether the given triplet can be paraphrased.",
        "For example, we regard “imi-ga aru” as an LVC, because the nominalized verb “imi” and the tuple (“ga”, “aru”) appear in the vocabulary lists.",
        "However, the (n, c, v) in (15s) does not act as an LVC, while the same triplet in (16s) does.",
        "The above difference is caused by the polysemy of the nominalized verb “imi” that denotes “worth” in the context of (15s), but “meaning” in (16s).",
        "Although incorporating word sense disambiguation using contextual clues complicates our model, in fact only a limited number of nominalized verbs are polysemous.",
        "We therefore expect that we can list them up and use this as a trigger for making a decision as to whether we need to take the context into account.",
        "Namely, given a (n, c, v), we would be able to classify it into (a) a main verb phrase, (b) a delicate case in terms of the dependence of its context, and (c) an LVC.",
        "We can adopt a different approach to avoiding incorrect paraphrase generation.",
        "As described in Section 5.",
        "1, our model generates all the possible paraphrase candidates when more than one LCS is assigned to a verb.",
        "Similarly, our approach can be extended to (i) over-generate paraphrase candidates by considering the polysemy of not only assigned LCS types, but also that of nominalized verbs (see (15s) and (16s)) and whether the given (n, c, v) is an LVC, and (ii) revise or reject the incorrect candidates by using handcrafted solid rules or statistical language models."
