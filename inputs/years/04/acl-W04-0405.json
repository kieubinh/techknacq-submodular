        "While proper treatment of the Propositional Content (PC) of a sentence is undoubtedly important in natural language processing (NLP), the Non-propositional Content (NPC) also plays a critical role in tasks such as discourse understanding, dialogue modeling, detecting speaker’s intension.",
        "We refer generically to the information which is provided by auxiliaries, adverbs, sentence-final particles or specific predicative forms in Japanese sentences as NPC.",
        "It is concerned with notions such as polarity, tense, aspect, voice, modality, and illocutionary act, which incorporate temporal, contingent, subjective, epistemic or attitudinal information into the PC.",
        "Though the inferential NPC e.g., implicature (Grice, 1975), has been discussed in semantics or pragmatics, it lies beyond the state-of-the-art technology of NLP.",
        "Besides, no systematic attempt to connect linguistic forms in the sentence with the non-inferential NPCs has been reported in NLP community.",
        "In this paper, we present a framework for the treatment of NPC of a sentence on the basis of the extensive, proper employment of multiword expressions (MWEs) indicating the NPCs in Japanese.",
        "In Japanese, which is a so-called SOV language, NPCs are typically indicated in the V-final position by auxiliaries, particles and their various alternative multiword expressions.",
        "We have extracted extensively these expressions from large-scale Japanese linguistic data.",
        "We refer to these, including auxiliaries and ending-particles, as NPC indicators (NPCIs).",
        "The number of NPCIs amounts to 1,500, whereas that of auxiliaries and ending-particles is about 50, which is apparently insufficient for practical NLP tasks.",
        "Our model leads to dealing not only with some of illocutionary acts (Austin, 1962) but also with the logical operations peculiar to the family of modal logic, i.e., deontic (Mally, 1926) and temporal logic (Prior, 1967).",
        "We also present, in this paper, the idea of the similarity among NPCs within our framework.",
        "This is essential for text retrieval, paraphrasing, document summarization, example-based MT, etc.",
        "Some of the indirect speech acts (Searle, 1975) and axioms proper to the family of modal logic are treated formally in the similarity paradigm.",
        "In Section 2, we introduce an overview of our ongoing MWE resource development for general Japanese language processing.",
        "In Section 3, we introduce a framework for the treatment of NPC.",
        "A set of primitive functions to compose NPC is explained in Section 4.",
        "In Section 5, first, the relationship between the framework and Japanese syntax, and second, methods to identify NPCs of Japanese sentences and to apply them to a translation task are described.",
        "In Section 6, we formalize the similarity among NPCs within the framework.",

        "where a verb F1 “�� iru” ‘be’ is followed by three auxiliaries, “� bekida” ‘should’, “ nai” ❑ ‘not’ and “ ❑ ta” ‘-ed’ which mean obligation, negation and past-tense, respectively, in the sentence-final position 2 .",

        "Moreover, each stage of this incorporation would be regarded as mapping the utterance’s meaning from one to another, in parallel with a syntactic form being mapped from one to another.",
