        "Due to its expressive power, the schema can deal not only with fixed expressions but also with morphosyntactically flexible constructions.",
        "It also allows us to lemmatize word combinations as a unit and yet to parse the components individually if necessary.",

        "There is no agreement among authors about the definition of the term Multiword Expression.",
        "However, in this article, Multiword Expressions (hereafter MWE) refer to any word combinations ranging from idioms, over proper names, compounds, lexical and grammatical collocations... to institutionalized phrases.",
        "MWEs comprise both semantically compositional and non-compositional combinations, and both syntactically regular and idiosyncratic phrases, including complex named entities such as proper nouns, dates and number expressions (see section 2).",
        "In contrast, Multiword Lexical Units (hereafter MWLU) comprise lexicalized phrases – semantically non-compositional or syntactically idiosyncratic word combinations – which are represented and stored in the lexical database of Basque (EDBL).",

        "The definition of the term Multiword Expression and the types of such MWEs to be treated in NLP may vary considerably depending on the purposes or \"the depth of processing being undertaken\" (Copestake et al., 2002).",
        "Multiword itself is a vague term.",
        "At text level, a word could be defined as \"any string of characters between two blanks\" (Fontenelle et al., 1994).",
        "This is not applicable to languages as Japanese, which are typically written without spaces.",
        "Besides, a great number of MWEs that in uninflected languages would be multiword, constitute a single typographic unit in agglutinative languages such as Basque (ziurrenik 'most probably', aurrerantzean 'from now on', aurretiaz 'in advance').",
        "Therefore, we consider them single words and they are included in the lexical database as such (or recognized by means of morphological analysis).",
        "In our case, when deciding which Basque MWEs to include in the database, we mostly rely on lexicographers' expertise since we consider lexicalized phrases have a top priority for both lemmatizing and syntactic purposes.",
        "So, the MWEs dealt with in the database comprise fixed expressions, which admit no morphosyntactic or internal modification – including foreign expressions such as in situ, a priori, strictu sensu, etc. – , idioms, both decomposable and non-decomposable, and lexicalized compounds.",
        "We also consider light verb constructions when they are syntactically idiosyncratic.",
        "However, currently we do not treat open collocations, proverbs, catch phrases and similes.",
        "Mostly, we don't include proper names in the database either, since complex named entities are given a separate treatment.",
        "Apart from proper nouns, also dates and number expressions are treated separately (see 4.1).",
        "So far we have described 2,270 MWLUs in our database.",
        "This work has been carried out in two phases.",
        "For the first phase, we made use of the Statistical Corpus of 20th Century Basque (http://www.euskaracorpusa.net) that contains about 4.7 million words.",
        "As a starting point, we chose the MWLUs that occurred more than 10 times in this manually lemmatized corpus.",

      "text": [
        "Many of the lexicalized phrases are semantically non-compositional (or partially compositional), i.e. they can hardly be interpreted in terms of the meaning of their constituents (adarra jo 'to pull someone's leg', literally 'to play the horn').",
        "Often, a component of these sequences hardly occurs in any other context and it is difficult to assign it a part of speech.",
        "For example, the word noizik is an archaism of modern noiztik 'from when', which occurs just in the expressions noizik behin, noizik behinean, noizik noizera, and noizik behinka all meaning 'once in a while'.",
        "Besides, it is not clear which is the part of speech of the words laprast in laprast egin 'to slip' or dir-dir in dir-dir egin 'to shine'.",
        "From a syntactic point of view, many of these MWEs present an unusual structure.",
        "For example, many complex verbs in Basque are light verb constructions, being the meaning of the compound quite compositional, e.g. lo egin 'to sleep' literally 'to make (a) sleep' or lan egin 'to work' literally 'to make (a) work'.",
        "However, lo egin and lan egin can be considered 'syntactically idiomatic' since the nouns in these expressions, lo and lan, take no determiner, which would be completely ungrammatical for a noun functioning as a regular direct object (*arroz jan nuen 'I ate rice').",
        "Morphosyntactic flexibility, being significant in this type of constructions in Basque, may vary considerably.",
        "For example in lo egin 'to sleep' the noun lo admits modification (lo asko egin zuen 'he slept very much') and may take the partitive assignment (ez dut lorik egin 'I haven't slept') while the verb egin can be subject to focalization (egin duzu lorik bart?",
        "'did you sleep at all last night?'); besides, the components of the construction may change positions and some elements and phrases may be placed between them (mendian egin omen zuen lasai lo 'it is said that he slept peacefully in the mountain').",
        "In contrast, alde egin 'to escape' is morphosyntactically quite rigid.",
        "In all the cases, the verb egin can take any inflection.",
