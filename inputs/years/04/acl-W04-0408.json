        "In recent years, dependency grammar (DG) (Tesni`ere, 1959; Sgall et al., 1986; Mel’ˇcuk, 1988) has received resurgent interest.",
        "Core concepts such as grammatical functions, valency and the head-dependent asymmetry have now found their way into most grammar formalisms, including phrase structure-based ones such as HPSG, LFG and TAG.",
        "This renewed interest in DG has also given rise to new grammar formalisms based directly on DG (Nasr, 1995; Heinecke et al., 1998; Br¨oker, 1999; Gerdes and Kahane, 2001; Kruijff, 2001; Joshi and Rambow, 2003).",
        "A controversy among DG grammarians circles around the question of assuming a 1:1- correspondence between words and nodes in the dependency graph.",
        "This assumption simplifies the formalization of DGs substantially, and is often required for parsing.",
        "But as soon as semantics comes in, the picture changes.",
        "Clearly, the 1:1-correspondence between words and nodes does not hold anymore for multiword expressions (MWEs), where one semantic unit, represented by a node in a semantically oriented dependency graph, corresponds not to one, but to more than one word.",
        "Most DGs interested in semantics have thus weakened the 1:1-assumption, starting with Tesni`ere’s work.",
        "Tesni`ere proposed the concept of nuclei to group together sets of nodes.",
        "FGD, on the other hand, allows for the deletion of solely syntactically motivated nodes in the tectogrammatical structure.",
        "Similarly, in MTT, nodes present on the syntactic structures can be deleted on the semantic structure.",
        "This can happen e.g. through paraphrasing rules implemented by lexical functions (Mel’ˇcuk, 1996).",
        "Unfortunately, these attempts to break the 1:1-correspondence have not yet been formalized in a declarative way.",
        "Extensible Dependency Grammar (XDG) is a new grammar formalism based on Topological Dependency Grammar (TDG) (Duchier and Debusmann, 2001).",
        "From TDG, it inherits declarative word order constraints, the ability to distinguish multiple dimensions of linguistic description, and an axiomatization as a constraint satisfaction problem (Duchier, 2003) solvable using constraint programming (Apt, 2003).",
        "One of the benefits of this axiomatization is that the linear order of the words can be left underspecified, with the effect that the constraint solver can be applied for both parsing and generation.",
        "XDG solving is efficient at least for the smaller-scale example grammars tested so far, but these good results hinge substantially on the assumption of a 1:1-correspondence between words and nodes.",
        "As XDG has been created to cover not only syntax but also semantics, we have no choice but to weaken the 1:1-correspondence.",
        "In this paper, we outline a way to break out of the 1:1-straightjacket, without sacrificing the potential for efficient parsing and generation.",
        "We introduce a new layer of lexical organization called groups above the basic XDG lexicon, allowing us to describe MWEs as tuples of dependency subgraphs.",
        "Groups can be compiled into simple lexical entries, which can then be used by the already existing XDG solver for parsing and generation.",
        "With groups, we can omit nodes present in the syntactic dimensions in the semantic dimensions, and thus get away from the 1:1-correspondence.",
        "Groups are motivated by the continuity hypothesis of (Kay and Fillmore, 1999), assuming the continuity of the lexicon and the construction.",
        "They can also be regarded as a declarative formalization of Mel’ˇcuk’s paraphrasing rules, or as a realization of the extended domain of locality of TAG (Joshi, 1987) in terms of dependency grammar, as also proposed in (Nasr, 1996) and (Joshi and Rambow, 2003).",
        "The structure of this paper is as follows.",
        "We introduce XDG in section 2.",
        "In section 3, we introduce groups, the new layer of lexical organization required for the modeling of MWEs, and in section 4, we show how to compile groups into simple lexical entries amenable for parsing and generation.",
        "Section 5 concludes the paper and outlines future work."

        "How well groups can be integrated with this meta-grammatical functionality is an open question.",
        "XDG research has so far mainly been focused on parsing, only to a very small extent on generation, and to no extent at all on Machine Translation (MT).",
