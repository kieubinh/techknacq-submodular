        "Defining frozen sentences is not easy, and many conceptual and terminological disputes on concurrent terms (‘idioms’, ‘collocations’, ‘phrasèmes’, etc.)",
        "can be found in the literature (M. Gross 1988; G.Gross 1996; Mejri 1997; Mel’cuk 1993; Mogor-rón-Huerta 2002; Gaatone 2000; Jurafsky & Martin 2000: 571-573; McKeown & Rodev 2000; Mutsimoto 2003: 395).",
        "As a first approach to a (consensual?)",
        "definition, frozen sentences are elementary sentences where the main verb and at least one of its argument noun-phrases are distribution-ally constraint, and usually the global meaning of the expression cannot be calculated from the individual meaning of its component elements when they are used independently (M. Gross 1982, 1989, 1996; G. Gross 1996; Ranchhod 2003).",
        "For that reason, the whole expression must be taken as a complex, multiword lexical unit.",
        "For example, in: (1) O João matou dois coelhos de uma cajadada (lit: ‘John killed two rabbits with one blow’, John killed two birds with one stone) the verb-object combination (matar-coelhos) is frozen.",
        "One cannot replace coelhos (rabbits) for another animal and the numeral determinant is necessarily dois (two).",
        "Also, it is not possible to modify coelhos with any free adjective (dois coelhos *gordos/ *grandes, two fat/big rabbits).",
        "In addition, the adverbial de uma cajadada (with one blow) can hardly be zeroed, or the meaning of the sentence becomes literal.",
        "On the other hand, frozen sentences usually present some, often highly constraint, formal variation.",
        "For the most part, this variation is strictly lexical.",
        "In this case, in the adverbial, the noun cajadada (lit: a blow with a stick) can be replaced by assentada and vez (turn), but the meaning of the expression remains unchanged.",
        "This variation does not happens elsewhere.",
        "Furthermore, if we disregard proverbs1, completely frozen sentences are rare.",
        "Usually, one or more of its argument noun phrases are distributionally free.",
        "In this case, any human noun can adequately occupy the structural position of subject.",
        "The frozen verb-noun combination is responsible for this distributional constraint, which can be considerably different from the constraints imposed by the verb when functioning as an independent lexical unit.",
        "For example, the verb matar (to kill) admits both human and non-human (animate and abstract) nouns for its subject when its object is coelhos (rabbits): (2a) O João/a raposa/o tiro/a praga matou dois coelhos (John/the fox/ shooting/ plague killed two rabbits).",
        "Another way frozen sentences often differ from free sentences is the fact that they block transformations that should otherwise be possible, given the syntactic properties of the main verb and its arguments.",
        "Hence, while it is possible to form from (2a) the passive sentence (2b): (2b) Dois coelhos foram mortos pelo João/ a raposa/ o tiro/ a praga (Two rabbits were killed by John/ the fox/ shoot1 Proverbs differ from frozen sentences (a) from not having any free elements, (b) in the way they function in discourse, which is similar to quotations and (c) for their general value as advices or as atemporal truths about human life.",
        "However, partly because of their being an oral tradition, even proverbs can show some formal variation (Chacoto 1994).",
        "ing/ plague), the same does not happen with (1): (1a) °Dois coelhos foram mortos pelo João de uma cajadada (Two rabbits were killed by John with one blow), since the meaning of the sentence becomes literal (this is shown by symbol ‘°’).",
        "Finally, frozen sentences constitute a non-trivial problem for many NLP applications.",
        "Since they are multiword expressions functioning as meaning units, they have to be identified as a block.",
        "However, their elements can appear discontinuously and they can also present some formal variation.",
        "They are often ambiguous, the same sequence having both a literal and a figurative meaning – and in this case, only an extended context can disambiguate them.",
        "They constitute an important part of the lexicon, comparable to (but probably much larger than) simple verbs."

      "heading": "2 Classification of Frozen Sentences",
      "text": [
        "Many frozen sentences, especially those that are most usual or most obviously idiomatic, have already been collected both in general and in specialized dictionaries of ‘idioms’.",
        "In these dictionaries, frozen sentences are usually undistinguished from other types of multiword expressions, such as compound nouns, adverbs, prepositions, conjunctions, proverbs, and so on.",
        "In order to build an electronic dictionary of frozen sentences of European Portuguese, several sources where used, including specialized dictionaries2, and completed with newspapers, magazines, etc.",
        "and our knowledge as native speakers of Portuguese.",
        "The formal framework of M. Gross (1982, 1989, 1996; see Le-clère 2002, for an updated overview) was adopted to classify frozen sentences.",
        "The classification is based on the sentence structure, the number and type of noun phrases attached to the main verb, their frozen or free nature, as well as the syntactic properties of the construction.",
        "Table 1 shows some formal classes3, their internal structure, an illustra",
        "tive example, and the approximate number of sentences collected so far.",
        "Compared with figures available for other languages – French (+20,000; M.Gross 1996), Spanish (3,500; Mogorrón-Huerta 2002), Greek (4,500; Fotopoulou 1993) and Brazilian Portuguese (3,500; Vale 2001), it is clear that these lists are still far from complete and should, in fact, be completed, probably using other corpus-based methods for lexical acquisition (McKeown & Rodev 2000, Mutsimoto 2003)."

        "This class is defined by having a prepositional phrase where only the head-noun C is frozen with the verb, while its determinative complement de N (of N) is free: N0 V Prep (C de N)1."

      "heading": "4 Syntactic Properties",
      "text": [
        "For lack of space, only some of the most prominent properties will be considered here.",
        "For each sentence, the distributional constraints (human/ non-human noun) on the free noun phrases are indicated: ‘+’ if the sentence admits it, ‘-’ if it does not.",
        "In this class, these are the subject and the determinative complement of C. Usually, the verb can inflect freely, thus its lemma is shown in brackets < >.",
        "In some sentences, V presents an intrinsically reflexive construction (noted Vse): (3) O Pedro atirou-se aos pés da Ana <e pediu-lhe para ficar> (Peter threw himself to the feet of Ana <and begged her to stay>.",
        "The reflex pronoun cannot be replaced by a noun phrase of the same distributional nature but not coreferent to the subject: O Pedro atirou *o João / ºo livro aos pés da Ana (Peter threw John/the book to the feet of Ana).",
        "Usually, this reflex pronoun cannot be zeroed.",
        "However, some verbs allow this zeroing of the pronoun: (4) O Pedro riu(-se) na cara da Ana (Peter laughs (himself) at the face of Ana).",
        "In this case, the simplest way is to double the entry.",
        "Also in some cases, there is an obligatory negation (NegObrig): (5) O Pedro não /nunca /nem chega aos calcanhares da Ana (lit: Peter does not/never/not even gets to the heels of Ana, Peter is not a match for Ana).",
        "The half-frozen noun phrase can often undergo an operation called dative restructuring (Leclère 1995), that splits the noun phrase in two and where the determinative complement becomes a dative complement a N (to N) of the verb: (6) O Pedro foi às trombas do João = ao João (lit: Peter went to the snouts of/to John, Peter hit John).",
        "This operation depends on the metonymical relation between C and the noun of its free determinative complement.",
        "The new dative complement can be reduced to a dative clitic pronoun (-lhe): (6a) Pedro foi-lhe (= ao João) às trombas do João.",
        "However, dative restructuring must be systematically checked for each sentence, since some sentences do not admit it: (7) O Pedro foi na cantiga do João/ *ao João/ *-lhe (lit: Peter went in the song of John, Peter was persuaded by John’s ill-intended words).",
        "In some cases, however, the restructured noun phrase: (8a) O salário do Pedro sai-lhe do pelo (lit: Peter’s salary gets him out from the fur, To earn his salary, Peter has to work very hard) is much more acceptable than its basic form: '*O salário sai do pelo do Pedro (The salary gets out from Peter’s fur) 4.",
        "The determinative complement can also be reduced to an oblique or to a possessive pronoun: (7a) O Pedro foi na cantiga do João = na cantiga dele = na sua cantiga, but in some cases, the reduction to a possessive is blocked: (6b) O Pedro foi às trombas do João = 'às trombas dele = *'às suas trombas.",
        "Finally, there can be some facultative, free insertions be4 In this case, the pronouncing may blocked by the (double) metonymical relation of Pedro with both the head noun of both the subject and object noun phrase.",
        "tween the verb and the prepositional phrase: (9) A fama subiu (rapidamente/logo) à cabeça do Pedro (Fame went up (quickly/soon) to Peter’s head).",
        "As one can see, these properties may be independent from each other and some of them can appear in combination in the same sentence.",
        "For example, obligatory negation can combine with the reduction do possessive pronoun: (5a) O Pedro ndo chega aos sews calcanhares (lit: Peter does not get to the his heels, Peter is not a match for him) or with the dative pronoun resulting from the noun phrase restructuring: (5b) O Pedro ndo te chega aos calcanhares (lit: Peter does not get you to the heels, Peter is not a match for you).",
        "In both cases, the pronouns appear inserted between the characteristic (and fixed) elements of this frozen sentence."

        "Several comparisons are thus made in Table 6 (below).",
        "The size (in number of simple words - W) of Expresso is approximately 2.4 times larger than MorphOlimpics, and the size of CETEMPúblico is 116 times larger than Expresso: W(Exp)=2.4xW (MO);W(Pub)=116xW(Exp).",

        "As it was said above, precision of the results is relatively high.",
        "In fact, most word combinations in the dictionary of frozen sentences are unique, therefore, unambiguous combinations.",
        "The finite-state approach adopted here is based on matching strings that could correspond to the characteristic word sequence of each frozen sentence.",
        "However, going through the concordances manually, some incorrect matches were detected and it would be impossible to comment on all those cases here, so only a few cases (all from CETEMPúblico), will be discussed.",
        "Mostly, mismatches were due to morphologically (orthographically) ambiguous words.",
        "In the sentence: O general António Ramalho Eanes está de volta à cena política (General António Ramalho Eanes is back to the political scene) volta is not verb, but a noun.",
        "Still, this noun is a nomi-nalization of voltar (with a resultative aspectual value): voltar à cena = estar de volta a cena , so that the overall meaning is stil the same.",
        "Other nominalizations of the same kind were also founded, e.g. usar da palavra = fazer uso da palavra (to speak, in a formal situation).",
        "Therefore, the study of frozen sentences with verbal predicates should be extended to their corresponding nominalizations (M. Gross 1986).",
        "Another interesting aspect of this example is the fact that the noun cena appears with the adjective política (political, referring to politics).",
        "In the dictionary, the entry of the frozen sentence was just voltar à cena.",
        "As one can see, it will still be necessary to complete the dictionary allowing C to be modified by this kind of adjectives, with which they form compound nouns (G. Gross 1988).",
        "Sometimes, the matched string is formally ambiguous with free constructions: Como resultado, a Comunidade dá de si uma imagem de paralisia (Has a result, the Community gives of itself an image of paralysis).",
        "The expression dar de si (class CP1) usually has a non-human subject meaning ‘to break’,’to fall apart’.",
        "In this case, however, we have a construction of the noun imagem, with two distributionally free complements, such as we find in the next example: Isso deu uma imagem negativa da comunidade (That gave a negative image of the community).",
        "If it were possible to identify the noun phrase a Comunidade and its head as a human noun, and to associate a construction to the noun imagem, the ambiguity would not arise, since the distributional properties stated in the CP 1 matrix for dar de si would prevent it from being tagged.",
        "However, this goes well beyond the mere task of lexical analysis and it would require some parsing procedure to avoid the incorrect lexical tag.",
        "Ambiguity also arises from the syntactic operations underwent by a free sentence.",
        "These transformations may produce strings that are superficially identical to frozen sentences.",
        "In the following example: [ ... ] e em vez de se dirigir às máquinas, foi para a rua que Júlia Pinho teve de caminhar [ ... ] (instead of approaching the machines, it was to the street that JP had to walk), we find a cleft sentence with the form foi of verb ser (to be).",
        "This sentence can be obtained from: JP teve de caminhar para a rua (JP had to walk to the street).",
        "Now, foi of verb ser (to be) is ambiguous with foi of verb ir (to go/walk) appearing in the frozen sentence ir para a rua (lit: to go to the street, ‘to be fired’).",
        "Again, ambiguous strings will not be resolved unless some syntactic parsing is done in order to recognize transformations (in this case, clefting).",
        "The components of certain frozen sentences may, also, be particularly apt to become ambiguous strings.",
        "For example, in the expression fazer das suas (lit: to do of his-fem.pl., to do mischief) the possessive pronoun is a lexical constant, invariable in both gender, and number, while agreeing in person with the subjet: Fergie tornou fazer das suas (Fergie has done mischief again).",
        "However, the possessive often appears as a mere determinant on a free construction, e.g. João Hon-rado nunca fez das suas certezas uma muralha de arrogância (JH has never done of his certainties a wall of arrogance).",
        "One could think that people tend avoid this kind of ambiguity, but it is not always so: 6 out of 14 matched sequences fazer das suas do not correspond to the frozen sentence.",
        "Likewise, with the expression partir do zero/nada (to start from scratch) 7 out of 14 matches correspond to the compound adverb a partir do zero/nada (from scratch).",
        "Notice also that this frozen adverb, undoubtedly related with the frozen sentence but appearing with various verbs, also composed of a compound preposition a partir de (from), so the expression is three times ambiguous grammatically.",
        "A similar ambiguity between occurs between frozen sentence N0 dizer respeito a N2 (N0 concerns to N1; 299 matches) and the related compound adverb no que diz respeito a N (concerning N; 215 matches).",
        "Finally, while most frozen sentences constitute unique word combinations and present a clearcut, single meaning (however difficult it may be to define it precisely), more rarely, some of them show multiple meanings.",
        "This is the case of en-trar em campo (to enter the field) or entrar em cena (enter the scene) used in some sports or in theater jargon and as a general metaphor to ‘begin some activity’.",
        "These multi-meaning frozen sentences can be dealt with in the same way as polisemic simple words, by multiplying the number of entries in the lexicon-grammar."
