        "(Meyers et al., 2004b; Meyers et al., 2004a), a project with the goal of annotating all nominal argument structure in the Penn Treebank II corpus.",
        "The phenomena we cover include the following (among others):",
        "• Support verb constructions like IBMS gave ÚÕÓ�A a promotion; Theys took a walk; and ���A had a visit.",
        "• PP constructions exemplified by At Mary's request, John performed the operationA.",
        "and With Jo's help, FloA discovered oilA.",
        "• Nominal constructions such as hisA share",
        "of the blame and a topicA of discussion.",
        "We also discuss how all these phenomena interact and sometimes form what we call support chains.",
        "For example, we can provide an explanation of how they is linked to the subject position of debate in the sentence Theys had lots of internal debate about this one.",
        "It turns out that the argument sharing aspects of the nominal phenomena we describe here is very similar to that of verbal phenomena which have been more throughly studied.",
        "Thus our example of a support chain is similar to subject equi (control) and subject raising examples like They seemed to want to debate, and our PP example with request is a lot like sentences with parenthetical verbs, e.g., John, Mary thought, could perform the operation really well.",
        "In both cases, the modifier of the sentence includes the sentence as an argument.",
        "In this paper, we describe types and subtypes of the various constructions that allow noun arguments to occur outside the NP.",
        "In the process, issues of of \"idiomaticity\" arise.",
        "The phenomena discussed are typically licensed idiosyncratically by two or more words (an MWE).",
        "However, this is a tendency rather than a rule.",
        "For example, support verbs straddle the line between idioms and non-idioms (Sag et al., 2002).",
        "While keep tabs on and make sense really do seem to be idiomatic, some support verbs are quite productive, e.g., attempt can combine with many nouns that describe or imply actions, e.g., Hes attempted + an attack/an experiment/.... Cases like give a standing ovation are decomposable – clearly something is being given, even though ovation is arguably the main predicate.",
        "Even cases like take a walk and make an attack should be viewed as MWEs, given that the light verbs take and make co-occur with only certain nouns – hence the ill-formedness of *make a walk and *take an attack.",
        "Thus the words and phrases that are the subject of this study range from non-MWEs to true MWEs and include many that are difficult to determine whether or not they should be considered MWEs.",
        "It is our view that phenomena are defined by their edges and not their middle and an understanding of the phenomenon discussed will help create better definitions and classifications of MWEs.",
        "In the NomBank project, we annotate the argument structure of nouns, including these NP-external arguments.",
        "Creating specifications that are as unambiguous as possible would ensure that annotators record these phenomena consistently.",
        "This goal motivated us to make many of the definitions that we provide below."

        "We define a support verb as a verb which takes at least two arguments NPl and XP2 such that XP2 is an argument of the head of NPl.",
        "For example, in Johns took a walk, a support verb (took) shares one of its arguments (John) with the head of its other argument (walk).",
        "A support verb can either be semantically empty, e.g., Johns made a proposal to Mary or have content, e.g., Apples attempted a takeover of Sun Microsystems.",
        "The semantically empty support verbs, also called \"light\" verbs (Wierzbicka, 1982), are similar to subject to subject raising verbs like seem in John seemed to leave.",
        "In contrast, what we call the equi variety of support verbs are more like equi verbs (also called control verbs) like want in John wants to leave.",
        "In fact attempt can function either as an equi verb or as equi support verb, e.g., in both John attempted to attack and Johns attempted an attack, attempt shares its subject with attack.",
        "In all cases of support verbs, an argument is shared between a higher predicate Pl and a lower predicate P2, such that the phrase headed by P2 is an argument of Pl.",
        "For light support verbs, Pl carries modality, tense and other features, but is otherwise semantically empty – in particular the relation between the upper predicate and the shared argument is merely a \"surface\" relation, rather than a semantic one.",
        "In contrast, the equi-like support verbs assign a semantic role to the shared argument.",
        "Thus in the light support construction Johns made an attack, John is just the",
        "ATTACKER, whereas in the equi support construction Johns attempted an attack, John is both the ATTEMPTER and the ATTACKER.",
        "The meaning and argument selection of a predicate nominal are often similar whether or not it occurs with a support verb.",
        "Nevertheless there are three important ways that support verbs and nouns interact.",
        "First of all, many support-verb/noun combinations qualify as MWEs.",
        "In general, only certain support-verb/noun combinations are possible, e.g., give a kiss, but not *make a kiss.",
        "Also, like idioms, some support-verb-plus-noun combinations allow aberrant syntax, e.g., make sense is fine without a determiner, whereas sense in other contexts requires one.",
        "Similarly, keep tabs on is only well-formed with the plural form of the noun tabs (compare Shes kept tabs on Mary with the ill-formed: *She kept a tab on Mary).",
        "These sort of limitations tend to occur in idioms.",
        "Some nouns do not occur outside the containing support construction, e.g., wreak havoc, suggesting that they are in fact idioms.",
        "Secondly, different support verbs have different argument sharing properties (ïel'c�u�, 1988; ïel'c�u�, 1996).",
        "For example, have a visit is different from pay a visit because the subject of have acts like the object of visit, but the subject of pay acts like the subject of visit.",
        "In John had a visit, someone visits John, whereas in Johns paid a visit, John visits someone.",
        "Finally, arguments of a noun may have different interpretations depending on whether or not it occurs within a support construction.",
        "Some differences include the following:",
        "• Negation and Modality – Support may change the implication as to whether or not an event actually takes place.",
        "A comparison of the following pairs of examples illustrates this point.",
        " – Mary's destruction of the ring vs. Marys attempted the destruction of the ring – Fred's nomination of Mary vs. Mary refused Fred's nomination • Degree of Agentivity – compare the shared argument's (Mary's) level of participation in the following phrases.",
        " – Mary's attack on Fred – Marys helped with the attack on Fred – Marys planned an attack on Fred",
        "In the first instance, Mary actually attacks; in the second, she helps attack; and if the attack even occurs in the third example, her role may be that of a general, not a soldier.",
        "• Changes in Other Arguments – compare the extent of the destruction in the following two examples.",
        "In the first case, the destruction is total, but not in the second.",
        " – Mary's destruction of San Francisco – Marys wrought destruction on San"
      ]
    },
    {
      "heading": "Francisco",
      "text": [
        "Similar difference can be observed in raising and equi constructions.",
        "For example, John is the subject of attack in the following sentences: John attacked, John seemed to attack, John helped attack, John refused to attack.",
        "Nevertheless other aspects of meaning differ in each of these sentences, just as they do in the comparable support examples above.",
        "Allowing for these various changes in meaning may make our definition of SUPPORT seem overly inclusive.",
        "However, we do not claim that support includes every case in which one can infer a connection between a noun phrase and one of its missing arguments.",
        "Rather, we require that the support relation be lexically based.",
        "This means that the support relation must either be licensed by the support verb, e.g., attempt or by the combination of the support verb, the noun and optionally, a preposition, e.g., keep tabs on.",
        "This rules out cases where a connection between a noun and one of its arguments can be made by other means.",
        "For example, in He did not want a rival to win the prize, one might deduce that He is an argument of rival.",
        "However, this connection is made by means of \"bridging\", a discourse process akin to coreference (Poesio and Vieira, 1998) – when not explicit, the argument of rival typically occurs nearby, just as the antecedent of he probably occurs nearby.",
        "Therefore rival is not part of a support structure in that sentence.",
        "Similarly, led is not a support verb in the sentence Market conditions led to the cancellation of the planned exchange.",
        "Here Market conditions is not an argument of cancellation – this would seem to violate a selection restriction since only sentient beings can cancel things.",
        "That sentence actually implies that Market conditions set a series of events into motion which ultimately caused the exchange to be canceled.",
        "Support constructions vary with respect to their degree of idiomaticity.",
        "Some support verb noun combinations seem really idiosyncratic, e.g., keep tabs on, make sense and wreak havoc.",
        "Others are quite productive, e.g., attempt and plan can occur with many different actions.",
        "Others are somewhere in the middle, e.g., take a walk and give a kiss.",
        "For some of the idiomatic and semi-idiomatic cases, it is not possible to cleanly make the equi/light distinction.",
        "For example, in Johns gave Mary a kiss and Johns gave them a standing ovation, it is clear that John is the KISSER and the APPLAUDER, but it is unclear whether he is a GIVER or not.",
        "It depends on how literally you interpret the MWEs give a kiss and give a standing ovation.",
        "For annotation purposes, we do not draw this distinction as we are only interested in marking the argument structure of the nouns.",
        "Thus whether or not a shared argument is an \"underlying\" argument of the support verb as well is of little importance.3 Nevertheless, we note the distinction in order to provide annotators with a fuller inventory of support constructions.",
        "Knowing all the cases helps the annotators find the support constructions even though it is unnecessary to assign particular instances to one case or the other.",
        "On a similar note, our goal for annotation is to identify noun argument structure.",
        "It is not necessary for us to draw the line between productive support items and MWEs – we leave that to the user.",
        "3 Arguments across Copulas As shown in the following examples, prepositional and clausal arguments of nouns can usually occur in the environment: [NP copula XP] where XP is an argument of the head of NP.",
        "According to a literal interpretation of the above definition, these are instances of support.",
        "However, at best, they are trivial cases.",
        "• The real battle is over who will control the market.",
        "• This picture is about a middle-aged son who makes sure ... • The theory is that Seymour is the chief designer of the Cray-3 ...",
        "3Similarly, the relation between the predicate \"leave\" and its argument John is the same in John tried to leave and John seemed to leave.",
        "It is only when one marks the higher predicates that a distinction is relevant.",
        "Due to the generality of these constructions, it seems unlikely that these are really cases of support.",
        "Indeed it seems that cases of predication other than simple copular constructions can link nouns and arguments in the same way.",
        "The following includes examples of predication in clefting, extraposition, and small clauses.",
        "Therefore, we assume that these links are due to predication, not support.",
        "• It's a mistake to put too much power in the hands of a single person.",
        "[CLEFT] • The real battle will take place between center-stage players like Toshiba, Zenith and now Compaq.",

        "[SMALL CLAUSE] 4 Partitives, Transparent Nouns, Crisscross Nouns, etc.",
        "There are a number of noun phrase constructions such that given the environment: [NP1 ... [PP [NP2 N2 ]]], an argument or adjunct of N2 may precede the PP inside of NPI.",
        "Below, we give the range of such cases that we have observed during our annotation effort.",
        "As we show later, the lower predicate NP2 can also be in prenominal positions.",

        "Also, some part-whole relations allow this sort of argument transmission as well – the possessor of a stage of development is the thing that is developing; if one has a share of liability, then one is (partially) liable.",

        "that license this set of complement structures.",

        "The second variety of PPs are instances of subject oriented adverbials.",
        "Adverbs like willingly and accidentally in John accidentally spilled the beans and Mary left the room willingly; infinitival purpose clauses as in George lowered taxes to please his father and the PP expressions in the next set of examples have something in common: in addition to modifying the main clause (conveying manner or purpose), they also take the subject of the sentence as an argument.",
        "For example, in Mary left the room willingly, Mary is willing.",
        "In the examples below, we express the relation between the adverbial and the subject in terms of the argument taking properties of the prepositional object.",

        "For verbs, these phrases are typically offset by commas and include a verb that takes a sentential complement.",

        "A final feature of this work is the place of the nominal argument sharing phenomena we describe in work on MWEs.",
        "Many support verb + noun combinations either qualify as bona fide idioms or straddle the line between idioms and non-idioms.",
        "Our hope is that a better understanding of the argument taking properties of these structures will help with the argument structure of idioms and MWEs more generally."
