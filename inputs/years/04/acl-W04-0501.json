        "Over the last three decades, the development of restricted domain applications has been an ongoing theme in computational linguistic research.",
        "Speech Recognition, Machine Translation, Sum-marization, and Question Answering researchers have all built at one time or another restricted domain systems.",
        "In retrospect, it is long due to examine both the successes and failures of these previous attempts.",
        "In this talk, I will examine the circumstances in which the development of restricted domain applications has led to significant advances in the state of the art and the circumstances in which restricted domain research has had little impact on our field.",
        "I will use the lessons learned from previous attempts to building restricted domain natural language processing applications in order to examine the potential impact of current research in restricted domain question answering."
