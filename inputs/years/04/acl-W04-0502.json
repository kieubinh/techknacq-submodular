        "The Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) organized the first QA evaluation (QA track) in 1999 (Voorhees, 2000) and annual evaluations of this nature are ongoing (Voorhees, to appear).",
        "While the tasks and answer requirements have varied slightly from year to year, the purpose behind QA evaluations remains the same: to move from the traditional document retrieval to actual information retrieval by providing an answer to a question rather than a ranked list of relevant documents.",
        "The track was originally intended to bring together the fields of Information Extraction (IE) and Information Retrieval (IR).",
        "This legacy still continues in the factoid questions that require an IE type answer snippet in response, e.g.: “What country is the Aswan High Dam located in?” This style of QA evaluation is spreading with very similar evaluations in Asia (Fukumoto, Kato, Masui, 2003) and Europe (Magnini et al., 2003).",
        "Although these evaluations have a multilingual slant, they are strongly modeled after the TREC QA track.",
        "Typical QA systems that participate in these evaluations classify the questions into types which determine what kind of answer is required.",
        "After an initial retrieval of documents pertaining to the question, some form of text processing is then applied to identify possible answer sentences in the documents.",
        "Sentences that are near or contain keywords from the original question and contain the desired answer pattern are selected for answer extraction.",
        "Since it is difficult for systems to determine which part of the sentence is the correct answer, especially if it contains multiple extractions of the desired type, many systems have resorted to redundancy tactics (Banko et al., 2002; Buchholz, 2002).",
        "These systems use the Web as an answer verification tool by choosing the answer that appears most often together with the question keywords.",
        "While this technique is very successful in open domain evaluations, restricted-domain systems do not have the luxury of using redundancy, making these evaluations inappropriate for systems such as these.",
        "Our QA system participated in the three earlier TREC evaluations, e.g. (Diekema et al., 2002).",
        "However, after starting work in the restricted-domain of reusable launch vehicles, we found that the TREC evaluation no longer suited our system development needs and maintaining two different QA systems was too costly."

      "text": [
        "The restricted-domain systems of today are different from the toy systems from the early years of QA (Voorhees and Tice, 2000), which might be what first comes to mind when reading the term ‘restricted-domain’.",
        "Early systems like LUNAR (with a domain somewhat tangentially related to ours, namely lunar archeology) were developed by researchers in the field of natural language understanding.",
        "These early systems encoded large amounts of domain knowledge in databases.",
        "The restricted-domain systems of today are far less dependent on large knowledge bases and do not aim for language understanding per se.",
        "Rather, they use specialized extraction rules on a domain specific collection.",
        "The one thing that both types of restricted-domain systems have in common is that they are often developed with a certain goal or task in mind.",
        "As we will see later, this task orientation becomes equally important in the evaluation of these QA systems.",
        "An example of a modern-day restricted-domain system is our Knowledge Acquisition and Access System (KAAS) QA system.",
        "The KAAS was developed for use in a collaborative learning environment (Advanced Interactive Discovery Environment for Engineering Education or AIDE) for undergraduate students from two universities majoring in aeronautical engineering.",
        "While students are working within the AIDE they can ask questions and quickly get answers.",
        "The collection against which the questions are searched consists of textbooks, technical papers, and websites that have been preselected for relevance and pedagogical value.",
        "The KAAS system uses a two-stage retrieval model to find answers in relevant passages.",
        "Relevant passages are processed by the Center for Natural Language Processing’s eQuery information extraction system using additional rules in the domain of reusable launch vehicles.",
        "Users are aided in their question formulations through domain specific query expansions."

      "heading": "3 Initiating a restricted domain evaluation",
      "text": [
        "When it came time to evaluate the KAAS system, we initially defaulted to the TREC style QA evaluation with short, fact-based questions, adjudicated answers to these questions, and a test collection in which to find those answers.",
        "This choice of evaluation was not surprising since early versions of our system grew out of that environment.",
        "However, it quickly became apparent that this evaluation style posed problems for our restricted-domain, specific purpose system.",
        "Developing a set of test questions was easier said than done.",
        "Unlike the open domain evaluations, where test questions can be mined from question logs (Encarta, Excite, AskJeeves), no question sets are at the disposal of restricted-domain evaluators.",
        "To build a set of test questions, we hired two sophomore aerospace engineering students.",
        "Based on class project papers of the previous semester and examples of TREC questions, the students were asked to create as many short factoid questions as they could, i.e “What is APAS?” However, the real user questions that we collected later did not look anything like the short test questions in this initial evaluation set.",
        "The user questions were much more complex, e.g. “How difficult is it to mold and shape graphite-epoxies compared with alloys or ceramics that may be used for thermal protective applications?” A more in depth analysis of KAAS question types can be found in Diekema et al.",
        "(to appear).",
        "Establishing answers for the initial test questions proved difficult as well.",
        "The students did fine at collecting the questions that they had while reading the papers, but lacked sufficient domain expertise to establish answer correctness.",
        "Another issue was determining recall because it wasn’t always clear whether the (small) corpus simply did not contain the answer or whether the system was not able to find it.",
        "A third student, a doctoral student in aerospace engineering, was hired to help with these issues.",
        "To facilitate automatic evaluation we wanted to represent the answers in simple patterns but found that complex answers are not necessarily suitable for such a representation, even though patterns have proven feasible for TREC systems.",
        "While a newswire document collection for general domain evaluation is easy to find, a collection in our specialized domain needed to be created from scratch.",
        "Not only did the collection of documents take time, the conversion of most of these documents to text proved to be quite an unexpected hurdle as well.",
        "As is evident, the TREC style QA evaluation did not suit our restricted domain system.",
        "It also leaves out the user entirely.",
        "While information-based evaluations are necessary to establish the ability of the system to answer questions correctly, we felt that they were not sufficient for evaluating a system with real users."

        "Restricted domain systems tend to be situated not only within a specific domain, but also within a certain user community and within a specific task domain.",
        "A generic evaluation is neither sufficient nor suitable for a restricted domain system.",
        "The environment in which KAAS is situated should drive the evaluation.",
        "Unlike many of the systems that participate in a TREC QA evaluation, the KAAS system has to function in real time with real users, not in batch mode with surrogate relevance assessors.",
        "This brings with it additional evaluation criteria such as utility and system speed (Nyberg and Mitamura, 2003).",
        "KAAS users were asked in two separate surveys about their use and experiences with the system.",
        "The surveys were part of larger scale, cross-university course evaluations which looked at the students’ perceptions of distance learning, collaboration at a distance, the collaborative software package, the KAAS, and each participating faculty member.",
        "While there was some structure and guidance in the user survey of the QA system, it was minimal and the survey is mainly characterized by the open nature of the responses.",
        "There were 25 to 30 students participating in each full course survey, but since we do not have the actual surveys that were turned in, we are not certain as to exactly how many students completed the survey section on the KAAS.",
        "However, it appears that most, if not all of the students provided feedback.",
        "Given the free text nature of the responses, it was decided that the three researchers would do a content analysis of the responses and independently derive a set of evaluation dimensions that they detected in the students’ responses.",
        "Through content analysis of the user responses and follow-up discussion, we identified 5 main areas of importance to KAAS users when using the system: system performance, answers, database content, display, and expectations (see Figure 1).",

        "If the system is down or not available to them at that moment, they will not come back later and try again.",

        "The answer return rate measures how long it takes (on average) to return an answer after the user has submitted a question.",

        "e.g. “in general what I received was helpful and accurate”, “it [the system] was useful for the Columbia incident exercise...”.",
        "Possible metrics concerning answers are “accuracy or correctness”, “completeness”, “relevance”, or “task suitability”.",
        "While the first three metrics are used in some shape or form in the TREC evaluations, “task suitability” is not.",

        "Users desired extended coverage to ensure that a wide range of questions could be fielded by the collection, e.g. “I found the data too limited in scope”.",
        "Possible database content metrics are “authority”, “coverage”, “size”, and “up-to-dateness”.",
