        "(RDQA) works on specific domains and often uses document collections restricted in subject and volume.",
        "It has some characteristics that make techniques developed recently for open-domain QA, particularly those within TREC (Text REtrieval Conference, e.g. (TREC, 2002)) competitions, become less helpful.",
        "First, in RDQA, correct answers to a question may often be found in only very few documents.",
        "Light et al. (2001) give evidence that the performance on precision of a system depends greatly on the redundancy of answer occurrences in the document collection1.",
        "Second, a RDQA system has often to work with domain-specific terminology, including domain-specific word meaning.",
        "Lexical and semantic techniques based on general lexicons and thesauri, such as WordNet, may not apply well here.",
        "Third, if a QA system is to be used for a real application, e.g. answering questions from clients of a company, it should accept complex questions, of",
        "various forms and styles.",
        "The system should then return a complete answer, which can be long and complex, because it has to, e.g., clarify the context of the problem posed in the question, explain the options of a service, give instructions, procedures, or suggestions, etc.",
        "Contrarily, techniques from TREC competitions, aiming at finding short and precise answers, are often based on the hypothesis that the questions are constituted by a single, and often simple, sentence, and can be categorized into a well-defined and simple semantic classification (e.g.",
        "Person, Time, Location, Quantity, etc.).",
        "RDQA has a long history, beginning with systems working over databases (e.g., BASEBALL (Green et al., 1961) and LUNAR (Woods, 1973)).",
        "Recently, research in QA has concentrated mostly on open-domain QA, in particular on how to find a very precise and short answer.",
        "Nonetheless, RDQA seems to be regaining attention, as shown by this ACL workshop.",
        "Researchers are also beginning to recognize the importance of long and complete answers.",
        "Lin et al. (2003) carried out experiments showing that users prefer an answer within context, e.g., an answer within its containing paragraph.",
        "Buchholz and Daelemans (2001) defined some types of complex answers, and proposed that the system presents a list of good candidates to the user, and let him construct the reply by himself.",
        "Harabagiu et al. (2001) mentioned the class of questions that need a listing answer.",
        "One well-known approach for RDQA was semantic grammars (Brown and Burton, 1975), which build predefined patterns of questions for a specific task.",
        "Simple and easy to implement, this approach can only deal with very small tasks, and a restricted set of questions.",
        "The most popular class of techniques for QA – whether it is restricted-domain or open-domain, includes using thesauri and lexicons, classifying documents, and categorizing the questions.",
        "Harabagiu et al. (2000), for example, use WordNet extensively to generate keyword alternations and infer the expected answer category of a question.",
        "In this paper, we present several methods to improve the precision of a RDQA system which should accept freely complex questions and return complete answers.",
        "We use our experiments in developing a real system as demonstration.",
        "2 Overview of the demonstration system The objective of this system is to reply to clients' questions on services offered by a large company, here Bell Canada.",
        "The company provides wide-range services on telephone, wireless, Internet, Web, etc.",
        "for personal and enterprise clients.",
        "The document collection was derived from HTML and PDF files from the company's website (www.bell.ca).",
        "As the structure of these files was so complicated, documents were saved as pure text with no mark-ups, sacrificing some important formatting cues like titles, listings, tables.",
        "The collection comprises more than 220 documents, of a total of about 560K characters.",
        "The available question set has 140 questions.",
        "It was assured that every question has an answer from the contents of the collection.",
        "The form and style of the questions vary freely.",
        "Most questions are composed of one sentence, but some are composed of several sentences.",
        "The average length of questions is 11.3 words (to compare, that of TREC questions is 7.3 words).",
        "The questions ask about what a service is, its details, whether a service exists for a certain need, how to do something with a service, etc.",
        "For the project, we divided the question set at random into 80 questions for training and 60 for testing.",
        "Below are some examples of questions: Do I have a customized domain name even with the Occasional Plan of Business Internet Dial?",
        "With the Web Live Voice service, is it possible that a visitor activates a call to our company from our web pages, but then the call is connected over normal phone line?",
        "It seems that the First Rate Plan is only good if most of my calls are in the evenings or weekends.",
        "If so, is there another plan for long distance calls anytime during the day?",
        "Although our collection was not very large, it was not so small either so that a strategy of searching the answers directly in the collection could be obvious.",
        "Hence we first followed the classic two-step strategy of QA: information retrieval (IR), and then candidate selection and answer extraction.",
        "For the first step, we used Okapi, a well-known generic IR engine (www.soi.city.ac.uk/~andym/OKAPI-PACK/, also (Beaulieu et al., 1995)).",
        "For each question, Okapi returns an ordered list of answer candidates, together with a relevance score for each candidate and the name of the document containing it.",
        "An answer candidate is a paragraph which Okapi considers most relevant to the question.",
        "The candidates were then evaluated by a human judge using a binary scale: correct or incorrect.",
        "This kind of judgment is recommended in the context of communications between a company and its clients, because the conditions and technical details of a service should be edited as clearly as possible in the reply to the client.",
        "However we did also accept some tolerance in the evaluation.",
        "If a question is ambiguous, e.g., it asks about phones but does not specify whether it pertains to wired phones or wireless phones, all correct candidates of either case will be accepted.",
        "If a candidate is good but incomplete as a reply, it will be judged correct if it contains the principal theme of the supposed answer, and if missing information can be found in paragraphs around the candidate's text in the containing document.",
        "Table 1 shows Okapi's performance on the training question set.",
        "We kept at most the 10 best candidates for each question, because after rank 10 a good answer was very rare.",
        "C(n) is the number of candidates at rank n which are judged correct.",
        "Q(n) is the number of questions in the training set which have at least one correct answer among the first n ranks.",
        "As for answer redundancy, among the 45 questions having at least a correct answer (see Q(10)), there were 33 questions (41.3% of the entire training set) having exactly 1 correct answer, 10 questions (12.5%) having 2, and 2 questions (2.5%) having 3 correct answers.",
        "Table 2 gives Okapi's precision on the test question set.",
        "The results show that Okapi's performance on precision was not satisfying, conforming to our discussion about characteristics of RDQA above.",
        "The precision was particularly weak for n's from 1 to 5.",
        "Unfortunately, these are cases that the system aims at.",
        "n--1 means that only one answer will be returned – a totally automatic system.",
        "n--2 to 5 correspond to more practical scenarios of a semi-automatic system, where an agent of the company chooses the best one among the n candidates, edits it, and sends it to the client.",
        "We stopped at n--5 because a greater number of candidates seems too heavy psychologically to the human agent.",
        "Also note that the rank of the candidates is not important here, because they would be equally examined by the agent.",
        "This explains why we used Q(n) to measure the precision performance rather than 2 A paragraph is a block of text separated by double newlines.",
        "As formatted files were saved in plain text, original \"logical\" paragraphs may be joined up into one paragraph, which may affect the precision of the candidates.",
        "other well-known scoring such as mean reciprocal rank (MRR).",
        "Examining the correct candidates, we found that they were generally good enough to be sent to the user as an understandable reply.",
        "About 25% of them contained superfluous information for the corresponding question, while 15% were lacking of information.",
        "However, only 2/3 of the latter (that is 10% of all) looked difficult to be completed automatically.",
        "Building the answer from a good candidate therefore seemed less important than improving the precision of the IR module.",
        "We therefore concentrated on how to improve Q(n), n= 1 to 5, of the system."

        "The first approach to improve the precision performance of the IR module is to use a better engine, e.g. by adjusting the parameters, modifying the formulas of the engine, or replacing a generic engine by a more domain-specific one, etc.",
        "Now suppose that the IR engine is already fixed, e.g. because we have achieved the best engine, or, more practically, because we cannot make changes or afford another engine.",
        "The second approach consists in improving the results returned by the IR engine.",
        "One main direction is candidate re-ranking, i.e. pushing good candidates in the returned candidate list to the first ranks as much as possible, thus increasing Q(n).",
        "To do this, we need some information that can characterize the relevance of a candidate to the corresponding question better than the IR engine did.",
        "The most prominent kind of such information may be the domain-specific language used in the working domain of the QA system, particularly its vocabulary, or even more narrowly, its terminological set.",
        "In the following, we will present our development of the second approach on the Bell Canada QA system first, because it seems less costly than the first one.",

      "text": [
        "In the first experiment, we noted that the names of specific Bell services, such as 'Business Internet Dial', 'Web Live Voice', etc., could be used as a relevance characterizing information, because they occurred very often in almost every document and question, and a service was often presented or mentioned in only one or a few documents, making these terms very discriminating.",
        "To have a generic concept, let's call these names 'special terms'.",
        "Luckily, these special terms occurred normally in capital letters, and could be automatically extracted easily.",
        "After a manual filtering, we obtained more than 450 special terms.",
        "We designed a new scoring system which raises the score of the candidates containing occurrences of special terms found in the corresponding question, as follows:",
        "Thus, the score of candidate i in the ranked list returned by Okapi depends on: (i) The original Okapi_score given by Okapi, weighted by some integer value OW.",
        "(ii) A Term_score that measures the importance of common occurrences of special terms, and, with less emphasis, other noun phrases and open-class words, in the question and the candidate.",
        "It is weighted by some integer value RC[i] (for rank coefficient) that represents the role of the relative ranking of Okapi.",
        "(iii) A document coefficient DC that indicates the relative importance of a candidate i coming or not coming from a document which contains at least a special term occurring in the question.",
        "DC is thus represented by a 2-value pair; e.g., the pair (1, 0) corresponds to the extreme case of keeping only candidates coming from a document which contains at least one special term in the question, and throwing out all others.",
        "We ran the system with 20 different values of DC, 50 of RC, and OW from 0 to 60, on the training question set.",
        "See (Doan-Nguyen and Kosseim, 2004) for a detailed explanation of how formula (1) was derived, and how to design the values of DC, RC, and OW.",

        "To find another document characterization which can complement this, we tried to map the documents into a system of concepts.",
        "Each document says things about a set of concepts, and a concept is discussed in a set of documents.",
        "Building such a concept system seems feasible within closed-domain applications, because the domain of the document collection is pre-defined, the number of documents is in a controlled range, and the documents are often already classified topically, e.g. by their creator.",
        "If no such classification existed, one can use techniques of building hierarchies of clusters (e.g. those summarized in (Kowalski, 1997)).",
        "We used the original document classification of Bell Canada, represented in the web page URLs, as the basis for constructing the concept hierarchy and the mapping between it and the document collection.",
        "Below is a small excerpt from the hierarchy:",
        "In general, a leaf node concept corresponds to one or very few documents talking about it.",
        "A parent concept corresponds to the union of documents of its child concepts.",
        "Note that although many concepts coincide in fact with a special term, e.g. 'First Rate', many others are not special terms, e.g. 'phone', 'wireless', 'long distance', etc.",
        "The use of the concept hierarchy in the QA system was based on the following assumption: A question can be well understood only when we can recognize the concepts implicit in it.",
        "For example, the concepts in the question: It seems that the First Rate Plan is only good if most of my calls are in the evenings or weekends.",
        "If so, is there another plan for long distance calls anytime during the day?",
        "include Personal Phone -LongDistance and Personal-Phone-LongDistance-FirstRate.",

        "To map a question to the concept hierarchy, we postulated that the question should contain words expressing the concepts.",
        "These words may be those constituting the concepts, e.g., 'long', 'distance', 'first', 'rate', etc., or synonyms/near synonyms of them, e.g., 'telephone' to 'phone'; 'mobile', 'cellphone' to 'wireless'.",
        "For every concept, we built a bag of words which make up the concept, e.g., the bag of words for Personal-Phone-LongDistance-FirstRate is {'personal', 'phone', 'long', 'distance', 'first', 'rate'}.",
        "We also built manually a small lexicon of (near) synonyms as mentioned above.",
        "Now, a question will be analyzed into separate words (stop words removed), and we look for concepts whose bags of words have elements in common with them.",
        "(Here we used the Porter stemmed form of words in comparison, and also counted cases of synonyms/near synonyms.)",
        "A concept is judged more relevant to a question if: (i) its bag of words has more elements in common with the question's set of words; (ii) the quotient of the size of the common subset mentioned in (i) over the size of the entire bag of words is larger; and (iii) the question contains more occurrences of words in that subset.",
        "From the relevant concept set, it is straightforward to derive the relevant document set for a given question.",
        "The documents will be ranked according to the order of the deriving concepts.",
        "(If a document is derived from several concepts, the highest rank will be used.)",
        "As for the coverage of the mapping, there were only 4 questions in the training set and 6 in the test set (7% of the entire question set) having an empty relevant document set.",
        "In fact, these questions seemed to need a context to be understood, e.g., a question like 'What does Dot org mean?' should be posed in a conversation about Internet services.",
        "Now the score of a candidate is calculated by:",
        "(2) Score_of_candidate[i] = (CC + DC) x (OW x Okapi_score + RC[i] x Term_score + 1)",
        "The value of CC (concept-related coefficient) depends on the document that provides the candidate.",
        "CC should be high if the rank of the document is high, e.g. CC=1 if rank=1, CC=0.9 if rank=2, CC=0.8 if rank=3, etc.",
        "If the document does not occur in the concept-derived list, its CC should be very small, e.g. 0.",
        "The sum (CC + DC) represents a combination of the two kinds of document characterization.",
