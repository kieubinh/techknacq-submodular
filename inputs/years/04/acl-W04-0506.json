        "The current trend in Question Answering is towards the processing of large volumes of open-domain texts (e.g. documents extracted from the World Wide Web).",
        "Open domain QA is a hard task because no restriction is imposed either on the question type or on the user’s vocabulary.",
        "This is why, most of the efforts (Voorhees, 2003) are focused on answering factoid style questions (and to a little extend, definition questions) using shallow text processing which is roughly based on pattern extraction or information retrieval techniques.",
        "However, QA should support the integration of deeper modes of language understanding as well as more elaborated reasoning schemas for more complex QA strategies, in order to provide, for example, better answer ranking, answer justification, responses to unanticipated questions or to resolve situations in which no answer is found in the data sources.",
        "Cooperative answering systems are typically designed to deal with such situations, by providing non-misleading, and useful answers to a query.",
        "(Grice, 1975) maxims of conversation namely the quality, quantity, relation and style maxims are frequently used as a basis for designing cooperative answering systems.",
        "An overview of cooperative answering techniques is given in (Gaasterland et al., 1994).",
        "In COGEX (Moldovan et al., 2003), a recent QA system, authors used automated reasoning for QA and showed that it is feasible, effective and scalable.",
        "This logical prover aims at checking and extracting all kinds of lexical relationships between the question and its candidate answers using world knowledge axioms, supplied by WordNet glosses, as well as rewriting rules representing equivalent classes of linguistic patterns.",
        "Such inference techniques (e.g. lexical equivalence, unification on logical representations of texts) are not sufficient for providing intelligent or cooperative responses.",
        "Indeed, advanced strategies for QA requires, as we explain in this paper, the integration of reasoning components operating over a variety of knowledge bases, encoding common sense knowledge as well as knowledge specific to a variety of domains.",
        "We relate in this paper, an experiment for designing a logic based QA system, WEBCOOP, that integrates knowledge representation and advanced reasoning procedures to generate cooperative responses to natural language (NL) queries on the web.",
        "This experiment is first carried out on a relatively restricted domain that includes a number of aspects of tourism (accommodation and transportation, which have very different characteristics on the web).",
        "The tourism domain is in fact half way between an open domain and a closed domain (e.g. weather forecast, Unix technical manuals).",
        "The tourism domain has a kernel roughly around accommodation and transportation, but it also includes satellite domains, such as history, security, health, immigration, ecology, etc.",
        "Those satellite domains are only partly considered, from the point of view of the ‘kernel’ domains.",
        "We also observe that there is, in fact, a kind of continuum between the notions of open domain and closed domain, via restricted domains which makes quite fuzzy the definition of what a restricted domain is.",
        "Besides the technical functionalities of WEBCOOP, the main goal of this paper is to evaluate the different facets of the portability of WEBCOOP.",
        "Three major points are at stake: (1) resources, in term of language resources and kinds of knowledge required, (2) cooperative procedures involved, such as identifying and explaining user false presuppositions, relaxing constraints or providing intensional responses, and finally (3) the intelligibility of the system outputs (such as hyperlinks, short responses or list of answers), considering that answers should also include a trace of the inferences drawn.",
        "In the next sections, we briefly present the WEBCOOP architecture focusing on the kinds of knowledge and cooperative procedures involved.",
        "Then, we analyze the main characteristics of the tourism domain and outline its main features as a restricted domain.",
        "Then, we analyze the portability of this type of QA system to other restricted domains.",
        "Finally, we propose an evaluation methodology based on experimental psychology for the point (3) cited in the last paragraph."

        "To have a more accurate perception of how co-operativity is realized in man-man communication, we collected a corpus of question answer pairs (QA pairs) found in a number of web sites dedicated to different kinds of large public domains.",
        "60% of the corpus is dedicated to tourism (our implementation being based on this application domain), 22% to health and the other QA pairs are dedicated to sport, shopping and education.",
        "The analysis of this corpus aims at identifying the external form and the conceptual categories of questions, as well as categorizing the different cooperative functions deployed by humans in their discourse.",
        "Our main claim is that an automatic cooperative QA system could be induced from natural productions without loosing too much of the cooperative contents produced by humans.",
        "We noted that human responses are much more diverse than any machine could produce in the near future.",
        "Nevertheless, it is possible to normalize these forms to more stereotyped utterances."

        "The general architecture of the system (figure 1) is inspired from our corpus analysis.",
        "Our system being a direct QA system, it does not have any user model.",
        "In WEBCOOP, NL responses are produced",
        "from first order logical formulas constructed from reasoning processes carried out by an inference engine.",
        "Our approach requires the development of a knowledge extractor from web pages (Benamara and Saint Dizier, 2004b) (viewed as a passage retrieval component) and the elaboration of a robust question parser.",
        "We assume that the most relevant documents to the user’s question are found using standard information retrieval techniques and that the relevant paragraphs that respond to the question keywords are correctly extracted from those documents (Harabagiu and Maiorano, 1999).",
        "Then, our knowledge extractor transforms each relevant paragraphs into a logical representation.",
        "The WEBCOOP inference engine has to decide, via cooperative rules, what is relevant and how to organize it in a way that allows for the realization of a coherent and informative response.",
        "Responses are structured in two parts.",
        "The first part contains explanation elements in natural language.",
        "It is a first level of coopera-tivity that reports user misconceptions in relation with the domain knowledge (answer explanation).",
        "The second part is the most important and the most original.",
        "It reflects the know-how of the cooperative system, going beyond the cooperative statements given in part one.",
        "It is based on intensional description techniques and on intelligent relaxation procedures going beyond classical generalization methods used in AI.",
        "This component also includes additional dedicated cooperative rules that make a thorough use of the domain ontology and of general knowledge.",
        "In WEBCOOP, responses provided to users are built in web style by integrating natural language generation (NLG) techniques with hypertexts in order to produce dynamic responses (Dale et al., 1998).",
        "We claim that responses in natural language must make explicit in some way, via explanations and justifications, the mechanisms that led to the answer.",
        "For each type of inference used in WEBCOOP, we define general and underspecified natural language templates (Reiter, 1995) that translate the reasoning mechanisms in accessible terms.",
        "A template is composed of three parts, 5, F, and R, where: 5 are specified elements, F are functions that choose for each concept in the ontology, its appropriate lexicalization, - R are logical formulas representing the rest of the response to be generated.",
        "The underspecified elements, F and R, depend on the question, on local semantic factors and on the type of solution elaborated.",
        "Their generation relies on ontological knowledge, general linguistic knowledge and lexicalisation and aggregation functions.",
        "Templates have been induced from a number of QA pairs found in large public domaines.",
        "Responses have been normalized without loosing too much of their accuracy in order to get stereotyped response forms usable in NL generation frameworks.",
        "A large portion of underspecified elements, within a template, is presented as an hyperlink to the user as illustrated in the examples in the next section.",
        "Here is an example of a template dedicated to one of our relaxation schemas.",
        "It is used when the question focus is relaxed using its sister nodes in the ontology.",

        "In",
        "a second step, the know-how component of the cooperative system generates a set of flexible solutions as shown in the figure above, since the first part of the response is informative but not really productive for the user.",
        "The three flexible solutions proposed emerge from know-how cooperative rules based on relaxation procedures designed to be minimal and conceptually relevant.",
        "The first flexible solution is based on a cardinality relaxation, while in the last two solutions, relaxation operates gradually on concepts such as the type of accommodation (hotel or pension) or the region (possibly a close-by region, with similar characteristics), via the domain model and the ontology.",

        "Example 2.",
        "Suppose a user asks for means of transportation to go to Geneva airport.",
        "In WEBCOOP, we have a variable-depth intensional calculus which allows us, experimentally, to tune the degree of intensionality of responses in terms of the abstraction level in the ontology of the generalizes.",

        "and the encoding of conditional situations: book flight(A) :- person(A), age(A, AG), AG > 17. which says that you can book a flight if you are at least 18 years old.",

        "indicates that ‘a chalet cannot accommodate more than 10 persons’.",
        "The ontology, described below, contains data which can be interpreted as facts (e.g. hierarchical relations), rules or integrity constraints (as simple as domain constraints for property values).",

        "We reported in this paper an experiment for designing a logic based QA system, WEBCOOP, that integrates knowledge representation and advanced reasoning procedures to generate cooperative responses to natural language queries on the web.",
        "We claim that restricted domains are more suitable than open domains to conduct research in advanced techniques on QA because those systems require deeper modes of language understanding, more elaborated reasoning schemas paired with a variety of knowledge forms and sources.",
        "WEBCOOP is applied to the tourism domain, it is a challenging and rewarding experience because the tourism domain is half way between open domain applications and closed domains, allowing us to better perceive these two perspectives.",
        "Our corpus based approach allows to identify the type of knowledge associated with each cooperative function.",
        "The annotation of corpora constitutes, in our sense, a good evaluation method for the study of the portability of WEBOOP to other restricted domains.",
        "Finally, since an evaluation in TREC style is not relevant for our approach, we have: (1) the evaluation of the portability of the system w.r.t.",
        "the forms of knowledge involved and the applicability of inference schemas and (2) the evaluation of the linguistic and cognitive adequacy of the responses produced by the system.",
        "We are now evaluating the portability of generation templates to the health and education domains and the accuracy of cooperative functions."
