        "Such metadata can exist in different forms like complex annotations of media recordings as discussed for example by Bird (2001) and Brugman (2001).",
        "A second type of metadata consists of keywords describing objects that form the catalogues of the increasingly large digital collections, e.g., of linguistic data.",
        "This type of metadata was introduced by initiatives such as Dublin Core3 for general type web-resources, OLAC4 for general type linguistic resources and IMDI5 for more elaborate linguistic resource descriptions that are useful not only for discovery but also for management purposes.",
        "Although the first type of metadata is very important for the above mentioned use in content descriptions, in this paper we will focus on aspects that are related to the second, keyword type of metadata.",
        "It is obvious that this type of metadata",
        "• contains amongst others important information about a resource that cannot be retrieved from its content; • are especially relevant for the discovery and management of multimedia resources since speech and image recognition are still far away from being applicable in most cases; • includes a reduced set of descriptive elements and requires classification such that content information in many cases is richer; • offers a limited set of semantically well",
        "defined data categories (ISO 12620) that can be related with other concepts.",
