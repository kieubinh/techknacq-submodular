        "This paper describes using RDF/RDFS/XML to create and navigate a metadata model of relationships among entities in text.",
        "The metadata we create is roughly an order of magnitude smaller than the content being modeled, it provides the end-user with context sensitive information about the hyper-linked entities in focus.",
        "These entities at the core of the model are originally found and resolved using a combination of information extraction and record linkage techniques.",
        "The RDF/RDFS metadata model is then used to ”look ahead” and navigate to related information.",
        "An RDF aware front-end web application streamlines the presentation of information to the end user."

        "As an information provider, Thomson West stores vast quantities of documents that are served up in response to user queries.",
        "Determining the relationships between entities of interest in these documents can be a complex and time consuming part of end-user research.",
        "Nor is this sort of information always explicitly presented in the documents retrieved by searches.",
        "Automating the process of discovery is complicated by the need to uniquely identify and resolve ambiguities and co-references between entities.",
        "Our system relies on various NLP techniques and name/entity taggers to identify attorney and judge names in news articles on Westlaw TM.",
        "These names are then tagged with unique reference identifiers that link them to their records in our legal directory.",
        "The relationships between these individuals and other entities like their firm (or court name for judges), and title of the document in which they are found are stored as RDF metadata.",
        "A simple representation of relationships among these entities is shown in Figure 1.",
        "Documents make references to attorneys.",
        "Using NLP techniques, each occurrence is resolved to a unique reference identification.",
        "The metadata then allows us",
        "to expose meaningful relationships among entities in text.",
        "Storing this information as metadata in the UI allows us to look ahead.",
        "Hovering over a name, the end user is able to see which firms they are affiliated with.",
        "The user is also able to look ahead to see all the other documents that the person occurs in.",
        "In addition, we also know which firm each attorney works for and this relationship allows us to see all the other attorneys who work for the same firm.",
        "This information is not present in any of the documents retrieved but is inferred from our RDF/RDFS (Lassila, 2000), (Klyne and Carroll, 2004), (W3C, 1999), (W3C, 2004) metadata model.",
        "The RDF/RDFS metadata model helps to dynamically resolve relationship among entities during the time of front end rendering.",
        "This system could be extended to incorporate additional relationships between other kinds of data."

        "Content in our architecture consists of plain text news documents and RDF metadata.",
        "Both are stored in an XML content repository.",
        "In addition we also store Thomson West’s legal database of attorney profiles in the same repository as well.",
        "With the content stored, we use a name/entity tagger in combination with methods described in (Dozier and Haschart, 2000) to link occurrences of attorney",
        "names within the plain text news documents to their database profile record.",
        "There are several reasons that motivate us to build this web application using RDF/RDFS.",
        "Firstly, our existing data model put metadata and content in the same data repository, the relationships or links are embedded inside content.",
        "This makes it very difficult to build new business products since developers have to write programs to look at content first, extract information out of it and then put this extracted information somewhere to enable front-end rendering.",
        "The disadvantage of this approach is being able to dynamically maintain the integrity of both data repository and relationship repository in a rapidly changing environment.",
        "Both of these repositories need to be updated whenever any relationships get updated.",
        "The use of RDF/RDFS separates relationships from content so manipulation of metadata is easier and less expensive.",
        "RDF/RDFS’s ability to provide a data infrastructure for entities, relationships extracted from NLP applications is the second reason for choosing it as our data model.",
        "In our domain, we have different kinds of entities embedded in news articles, law reviews, legal cases etc.",
        "These entities include attorney name, judge name, and law firm names.",
        "We are interested in not only identifying them in content but also finding their relationships and linking them together.",
        "RDF/RDFS allows us to accomplish this.",
        "Architecture for this application uses MVC (Model View Controller) design pattern for separating graphical interface of one application from its backend artifacts such as code and data.",
        "This classic architectural design pattern provided the flexibility to maintain multiple views of backend data."

        "The news documents are preprocessed using our name entity tagger.",
        "The tagging process is able to generate a list of people templates that are then fed into an entity reference resolution program.",

        "Each document in both content and metadata repositories has a unique number associated with it.",
