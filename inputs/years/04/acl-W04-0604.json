        "A method for mapping linguistic descriptions in plain XML into semantically rich RDF/OWL is outlined and demonstrated.",
        "Starting with Simons’s (2003) original proof of concept of this method, we extend his Semantic Interpretation Language (SIL) for creating metaschemas to carry out the mapping, employ the General Ontology for Linguistic Description (GOLD) of Farrar and Langendoen (2003) as the target semantic schema, and make use of SeRQL, an RDF-aware search engine.",

        "Machine-readable structured linguistic documents (comparative word lists, lexicons, annotated texts, audio and audio-video recordings aligned with transcriptions (possibly annotated), grammatical descriptions, etc.)",
        "are being made available in a wide variety of formats on the Web.",
        "Until recently, the linguistics community has not been par",
        "ticularly concerned about the ease with which those structures can be accessed by other users, nor about the comparability of the structures that can be accessed.",
        "Now that community is beginning to realize that XML encoding provides relatively straightforward access to the intended structures and at the same time insures that the documents will continue be accessible for the foreseeable future.",
        "However, XML encoding by itself does not insure comparability.",
        "To achieve that goal, the community must either adopt standards for encoding particular structures, or methods need to be developed for interpreting structures that are differently encoded.",
        "This paper reports on an effort to do the latter: to migrate XML documentation of linguistic structure to a semantically interoperable format.",
        "One of the most compelling reasons to do so is to enable intelligent search: the ability to query documents based on their semantics, rather than on strings of characters that may occur in them or on their document syntax.",
        "Facilitating intelligent searching is also one of the major goals of the Semantic Web.",
        "We are making the first steps towards a Semantic Web for linguistics by showing how to migrate a significant amount of language resources to a format that makes them semantically comparable.",
        "2 Background The work reported in this paper was carried out as part of the Electronic Metastructure for Endangered Language Data (EMELD) project [emeld.org] (NSF grant 0094934) and the Data-Driven Linguistic Ontology project (NSF grant 0411348).",
        "One of the objectives of the EMELD project is the “formulation and promulgation of best practice in linguistic markup of texts and lexicon.” Underlying this objective is the goal of ensuring that the digital language documentation produced by linguists will be truly portable in the sense of Bird and Simons (2003): that it will transcend computer environments, scholarly communities, domains of application, and the passage of time.",
        "The project was undertaken on the basis of the following principles:",
        "1.",
        "XML markup provides the best format for the interchange and archiving of endangered language description and documentation.",
        "2.",
        "No single schema or set of schemas for XML markup can be imposed on all language resources.",
        "3.",
        "The resources must nevertheless be comparable for searching, drawing inferences, etc.",
        "Simons (2003) points out the conflict between the second and third principles, and describes the following set of actions for reconciling them.",
        "1.",
        "Develop a community consensus on shared ontologies of linguistic concepts that can serve as the basis for interoperation.",
        "2.",
        "Define the semantics of any particular markup schema by mapping its elements and attributes to the concepts in the shared ontology that they represent.",
        "3.",
        "Map each individual language resource onto its (partial) semantic interpretation by applying the mapping of its markup schema.",
        "4.",
        "Perform queries and other knowledge-based operations across resources over these semantic interpretations rather than the original XML documents.",
        "The EMELD project has already begun work on the first of these action items, the creation of a sharable ontology for language documentation and description, a General Ontology for Linguistic Description (GOLD) [emeld.org/gold] (Farrar and Langendoen, 2003), which is intended to be grounded in a suitable upper ontology such as SUMO (Niles and Pease, 2001) or DOLCE (Ma-solo et al., 2002).",
        "GOLD is itself being written in OWL, the Ontology Web Language (McGuinness and van Harmelen, 2004), for use in Semantic Web applications.",
        "Simons (2003, 2004) also provides a ‘proof of concept’ for an implementation of the remaining three action items as follows.",
        "1.",
        "Beginning with three dictionaries that used similar but distinct markup based on the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) guidelines (Sperberg-McQueen and Burnard, 2002), Simons created mappings from their different markup schemas to a common semantics as defined by an RDF Schema (Brickley and Guha, 2004).",
        "Such a semantic schema provides a “formal definition ... of the concepts in a particular domain, including types of resources that exist, the properties that can relate pairs of resources, and the properties that can describe a single resource in terms of literal values” (Simons, 2004).",
        "This mapping he called a metaschema, a formal definition of how the elements and attributes of a markup schema are to be interpreted in terms of the concepts of the semantic schema.",
        "He called the ‘language’ for writing metaschemas (defined via an XML DTD) a Semantic Interpretation Language (SIL).",
        "2.",
        "Simons performed the semantic interpretation operation in a two-step process using XSLT, first to create an interpreter for a particular metaschema and then to apply it against a source document to yield the RDF document (repository) that is its semantic interpretation.",
        "3.",
        "Simons then loaded the RDF repositories into a Prolog system to create a merged database of RDF triples and used Prolog’s inference engine to query the semantic interpretations.",
        "Simons (2003) describes this implementation as providing a semantics of markup, rather than as devising yet another markup language for semantics.",
        "As such, it is in the spirit of efforts such as Sperberg-McQueen et al.",
        "(2000), who define the meaning of markup as the set of inferences licensed by it.",
        "However, their model does not provide for the general comparison of documents.",
        "It is also in the spirit of the proposal for a Linguistic Annotation Framework (LAF) under development by Working Group 1-1 of ISO TC 37 SC 4 [www.tc37sc4.org] (Ide and Romary, 2003; Ide, Romary and de la Clergerie, 2003), but differs from it in some significant ways.",
        "For example, our strategy does not require that the source annotations be mapped to an XML ‘pivot format’.",
        "On the other hand, the LAF does not require that the source annotations be in XML to begin with.",
        "The ‘data categories’ of the LAF correspond to the concepts in GOLD; however the “creation of an ontology of annotation classes and types” is not yet part of the LAF (Ide, Romary and de la Clergerie 2003).",
        "Moreover, the LAF data model is confined to feature structures, whereas GOLD plans to offer feature structures as one of several data structuring alternatives.",
        "Finally, through its connection with an upper ontology, GOLD will also be related to the ‘rest of the world’, whereas the LAF ontology is apparently intended for linguistic structure only."

        "2.",
        "SIL is extended to include the ability to map the content of designated elements and attributes in source documents to the semantic schema, not just the markup itself.",
        "3.",
        "We devise metaschemas for lexicons that use distinct XML markup schemas: one of the lexicons that Simons (2003) originally used, for Sikaiana (Solomon Islands) with",
        "about 3000 entries; a Hopi (Arizona) dictionary with about 30,000 entries, for which Kenneth Hill’s original encoding using a proprietary and no longer supported database program was converted to XML by Lewis and Gonzalez; and a Potawatomi (Great Lakes region, US and Canada) lexicon being created by Laura BuszardWelcher using the EMELD FIELD tool.",
        "4.",
        "The Prolog query engine is replaced by SeRQL, an SQL-like query language for Sesame, an RDF database program (Broek-stra, Kampman and van Harmelen 2002; User Guide for Sesame 2004).",
        "It is our intention to couple Sesame with an inference engine that reads OWL documents, such as Racer (Haarslev and Moller 2001).",
        "In carrying out the migration of such language resources to the Semantic Web, we are guided by the principle of preserving the original analyses as much as possible.",
        "At the same time, since the migrated resources are to be rendered mutually interoperable and transparent to the tools that are designed to work over them, the migration process has the potential to greatly increase the precision of the original analyses, to reveal inconsistencies in them, and ultimately to result in enriched resources.",
        "For example, the comparison of two descriptions of the same language that has been made possible by migration could reveal errors in one or the other.",
        "Similarly, a single resource could be checked for consistency with accumulated linguistic knowledge represented in an ontology.",
        "The migration process thus provides two sources of new knowledge.",
        "First is the knowledge brought in from the document interpretation process itself, i.e. by the linguist, not necessarily the one who performed the original analysis.",
        "Second when the migrated documents are added to the knowledge base, new inferences can be automatically generated based on the general knowledge of linguistics captured in the ontology.",
        "The type of new knowledge generated is however constrained, for example, by the type of search to be done over the resulting knowledge base (see section 6).",
        "However the migration process can also skew or misinterpret the intentions underlying the original documentation.",
        "To minimize this risk, the migration tools should be as non-intrusive as possible.",
        "Even so, some steps are necessary to add structure where structure is lacking in the original XML documentation and to interpret the meaning of the original elements where their meanings are undefined or unclear.",
        "For the ontology the implication is that theory-laden concepts either should be avoided or less encumbered alternatives should be made available."

        "The LINGUISTICUNIT hierarchy is organized according to how its components are realized as forms, and not according to their formal linguistic features, which are theory specific.",
        "So, for example, LEXICALUNIT is simply a formal unit that can appear in isolation in its realized form, and not necessarily something that can be a constituent of larger syntactic constructions.",
        "The methodology leaves open the question of whether, for example, a SUBLEXICALUNIT can also be a phrasal constituent, as appears to be the case with CLITIC.",
        "Yet another alternative would be to organize LINGUISTICUNIT according to semantic features, e.g., a SUBLEXICALUNIT would be something which usually represents a grammaticized notion.",
        "But, since this varies from language to language, a different taxonomy would be needed for every type of language encountered.",
        "To sum up, adhering to strictly formal features necessitates theory-specific taxonomies, while adhering to semantic features leads to language-specific taxonomies.",

        "This is certainly a reasonable criticism, since excluding data structures from GOLD would make the ontological modelling process much simpler.",
        "However, they are included because we envision that subsequent applications will need to be able to reason, not only about the data itself, but also about how it is structured.",
