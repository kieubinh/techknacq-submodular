        "Mikrokosmos contains an ontology plus a number of lexicons in different languages that were originally developed for machine translation.",
        "The underlying representation formalism for these resources is an ad-hoc frame-based language which makes it difficult to interoperate Mikrokosmos with state-of-the-art knowledge-based systems.",
        "In this paper we propose a translation from the frame-based representation of Mikrokosmos into Description logics.",
        "This translation allows us to automatically transform Mikrokosmos sources into OWL and thus provide a powerful ontology in the formalism of the semantic web.",
        "Furthermore, the reasoning mechanisms of Description Logics may also support knowledge acquisition and maintenance as well as its application in natural language processing systems."

        "The Mikrokosmos project was originally an interlingual system for Knowledge-Based Machine Translation (KBMT) (Nirenburg, 1987) developed in the Computing Research Laboratory from New Mexico State University.",
        "Although KBMT was conceived for translation of domain specific texts, no further restrictions are imposed in the contents of the text.",
        "Therefore the creators of Mikrokosmos built a rich ontology that contains a lot of general concepts, more than 4.700 concepts that are connected with an average of other 14 concepts using attributes and relations (de Quesada, 2001).",
        "KBMT is an expensive approach that requires a big effort on knowledge acquisition, and it has been considered impractical by some authors.",
        "For that reason, the creators of Mikrokosmos were especially concerned about developing real-size systems that would demonstrate the feasibility of their approach.",
        "Generating contents for the ontology was their first concern, while the use of a rigorous formalism for knowledge representation was not considered a priority (Moreno-Ortiz et al., 2002).",
        "The work presented here is an effort to port Mikrokosmos into Description Logics (DL) in order to incorporate this resource into the systems we are developing.",
        "Our work on natural language generation integrates ontologies and case-based reasoning (CBR) (Diaz-Agudo et al., 2002), an approach that heavily relies on classification-based reasoning from DL.",
        "Representing Mikrokosmos in DL should bring several benefits.",
        "Since DL is the underlying knowledge representation approach in the Semantic Web, a big number of supporting tools are being developed for acquiring and maintaining ontologies represented in some version of DL, such as OWL (Bechhofer et al., 2004).",
        "Giving a well-founded formal representation to Mikrokosmos should improve its quality by uncovering inconsistencies.",
        "Finally, porting Mikrokosmos to a formalism as popular as OWL will definitively increase its potential user community.",
        "There are other efforts that convert ontologies from different representations to Description Logics languages.",
        "OntoMap is a website that provides access to upper-level ontologies and hand-crafted mappings between them (Kiryakov et al., 2001).",
        "The initial set of ontologies contains Cyc, EuroWordnet and Mikrokosmos ontology, but it only deals with the top-level hierarchy.",
        "In case of Mikrokosmos it only contains 13 concepts.",
        "Their main effort involves the mapping between different ontologies.",
        "They also provide the resources in DAML+OIL.",
        "The project’s goal is to facilitate easy access, understanding, and reuse of general-purpose ontologies and upper-level models.",
        "The rest of this paper runs as follows.",
        "Next section describes the frame-based language used in Mikrokosmos ontology, and Section 3 describes the DL which is the target of the translation.",
        "Section 4 is dedicated to the mapping process and Section 5 evaluates this process.",
        "Section 6 points out future work, and finally Section 7 concludes the paper."

        "In Mikrokosmos, ontology lists the definitions of concepts that are understood as corresponding to classes of thing and events in the world.",
        "Concepts are primitive symbols of a world model which includes objects, events and properties organized in a complex hierarchy of language-independent concepts (See top hierarchy of Mikrokosmos in Figure 1).",
        "The concepts are constructed following super ordinates, or hyponymy relations (IS-A links).",
        "In addition to its organization into a taxonomy via IS-A links, the ontology contain numerous other links between concepts, such as links using properties (Lonergan, 2001).",
        "For example DECEMBER has a relation with WINTER using the property PART-OF-OBJECT.",
        "Each concept that makes up the ontology is language independent and is represented using frames.",
        "For example we can see the frame for concept REPLACEMENT-FOR in Table 1.",
        "The format of Mikrokosmos Ontology is described in detail in (Nirenburg and Raskin, 2004).",
        "It formally introduces the syntax and the semantics of the ontology using a BNF grammar.",
        "We are most interested in how we can access to this information.",
        "Ontology is saved in a text file using Spencer notation that is based on XML.",
        "There is another notation called Beale notation that is based on Lisp, but we will focus on Spencer notation.",
        "In the XML based format we have the whole ontology represented in a list of RECORD entries.",

        "Possible descendants of ONTOLOGY-SLOT are: DEFINITION, DOMAIN, INSTANCES, INVERSE, IS-A, RANGE, SUBCLASSES and some others that are less important; later in this section we will explain them in detail.",
        "The third field is FACET, and it describes some finer distinctions between the possible fillers of the slot.",
        "Possibles FACET fillers are: VALUE, SEM, DEFAULT, INV, NOT, DEFAULT, DEFAULT-MEASURE and RELAXABLE-TO.",
        "The last field is FILLER, and its value depends on the other fields, but generally it contains either a Name of a concept of the ontology or an instance.",
        "Initially we can think that there are no restrictions in these representations, but there are some special slots that limit expressiveness.",
        "All CONCEPT frames have non-special and special slots.",
