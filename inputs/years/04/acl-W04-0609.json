        "In the areas of knowledge representation and reasoning (KR) and of conceptual modelling, it has long been recognised that conceptualising a domain is a prerequisite for understanding the domain and processing information about the domain, especially in the case of large, non-trivial domains.",
        "Nowadays, there is no clear-cut border between large and small domains, simply because information systems are no longer isolated but are parts of the global information system and need to be interoperable.",
        "Hence, conceptualisations and ontologies are required for all kinds of information systems and information processing.",
        "In some cases it is not clear yet what functions and advantages ontologies can offer, but there is no doubt that in every case ontologies do offer something: at the very least they offer a way to address meaning of terms (concepts, relations) required for information processing.",
        "This paper attempts to provide some suggestions on how natural language processing can benefit from using ontologies.",
        "We present a large-scale research project in which ontologies are part of the reasoning process used for information management and for the presentation of information.",
        "Users' access to information and the presentation of information to users are both mediated via natural language, and the ontologies used in the reasoning component are coupled with the lexicon used in the natural language component.",

        "It provides some suggestions on how ontologies can help a natural language processing component build semantic representations which are directly used in a complex information management system.",
        "This is work in progress and a formal evaluation has not yet been put in place.",
        "However, the reviewers for this paper have rightly asked how this would be conducted.",
        "In the agent-based architecture we use, each agent can be tested in isolation and we have already conducted tests to ensure that the answers returned by the KR agent for specific questions in our scenario are correct and consistent.",
        "A more interesting evaluation will be possible when the scenario is expanded, to see whether unplanned answers returned when the system is asked new unscripted questions are in fact useful to the users.",
        "This will take place in the next phase of the project.",
        "For now, we conclude that an ontology is a knowledge base which can serve as the basis for creating the part of the lexicon for domain content words.",
        "This is achieved by producing a list of terms with their meanings, i.e. partial definitions given the two hierarchies in the ontology, and we are exploring methods to automate this process."
