        "Event clustering automatically groups documents by events that are specified in the documents in a temporal order.",
        "The research issues behind event clustering include: how many features can be used to determine event clusters, which cue patterns can be employed to relate news stories in the same event, how the clustering strategies affect the clustering performance using retrospective data or on-line data, how the time factor affects clustering performance, and how multilingual data is clustered.",
        "Chen and Ku (2002) considered named entities, other nouns and verbs as cue patterns to relate news stories describing the same event.",

        "They introduced more semantic approach for feature selection than the approach of parts of speech.",

        "Bagga and Baldwin (1998) proposed entity-based cross-document co-referencing which uses co-reference chains of each document to generate its summary and then use the summary rather than the whole article to select informative words to be the features of the document.",
