        "The problem of name recognition and classification has been intensively studied since 1995, when it was introduced as part of the MUC6 Evaluation (Grishman and Sundheim, 1996).",
        "A wide variety of machine learning methods have been applied to this problem, including Hidden Markov Models (Bikel et al.",
        "1997), Maximum Entropy methods (Borthwick et al.",
        "1998, Chieu and Ng 2002), Decision Trees (Sekine et al.",

        "2002), Agent-based Approach (Ye et al.",

        "However, the performance of even the best of these models1 has been limited by the amount of labeled training data available to them and the range of features which they employ.",

        "If a name has not been seen before, and appears in a relatively uninformative context, it becomes very hard to classify.",
        "We propose to use more global information to improve the performance of name recognition.",
        "Some name taggers have incorporated a name cache or similar mechanism which makes use of names previously recognized in the document.",
        "In our approach, we perform coreference analysis and then use detailed evidence from other phrases in the document which are co-referential with this name in order to disambiguate the name.",
        "This allows us to perform a richer set of corrections than with a name cache.",
        "We then go one step further and process similar documents containing instances of the same name, and combine the evidence from these additional instances.",
        "At each step we are able to demonstrate a small but consistent improvement in named entity recognition.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 briefly describes the baseline name tagger and coreference resolver used in this paper.",

        "The first method is to use three manually built proper name lists which include common names of each type (selected from the high frequency names in the user query blog of COMPASS, a Chinese search engine, and name lists provided by Linguistic Data Consortium; the PER list includes 147 names, the GPE list 226 names, and the ORG list 130 names).",

We compute Margin (wi,..., wj; T) = log P1 – log P2 Here P1 is the maximum path probability and P2 is the maximum probability among all paths for which some word in wi, ..., wj is assigned a tag other than T. A large margin indicates greater confidence in the tag assignment.",

        "In other words, if a name has more coref-ed mentions, it is more likely to be correct.",

        "The table also indicates that the accuracy of single name entities (singletons) is much lower than the overall accuracy.",
        "So, although they constitute only about 10% of all names, increasing their accuracy can significantly improve overall performance.",
