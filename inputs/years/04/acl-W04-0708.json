        "I trace the problem to an implicit assumption in Centering that coherence relations are primarily entity-based.",

        "(1) Ellen2 was talking to Marys and Susank about cats.",
        "(2) Marys loves herd cat.",
        "(3) a. Susank loves herd cat too.",
        "(strict) b. Susank loves herk cat too.",
        "(sloppy) c. Susank loves here cat too.",
        "(other)",
        "The terms strict and sloppy are originally due to (Ross, 1967), where they were applied to cases involving ellipsis.",
        "In the above example, the VP \"loves her cat\" can be elided.",
        "Whether \"loves her cat\" is overt or elided does not change the interpretive possibilities in this example.",
        "Although the analysis of the differences between elliptical sentences and their overt counterparts is an important area of research, I will ignore this issue in this paper, and assume that the ellipsis case is interpretively analogous to the above overt examples.",
        "It is widely accepted that the strict and sloppy readings are equally acceptable, while the other reading is impossible.",
        "In a series of papers (Hardt, 1996; Hardt, 1999; Stone and Hardt, 1997; Hardt, 2003) I have previously suggested that Centering Theory might provide an account of this.",
        "These papers do not apply Centering in a systematic way.",
        "Rather, they rely on certain claims that are inspired by Centering.",
        "First, in sentences with a single pronoun, that pronoun must refer to the Center.",
        "Second, there is a preference that Center Shifts are associated with Subjects, or otherwise prominent NP's. I employ the following notational conventions: a pronoun referring to the Center is notated with a * subscript, while an NP that shifts the Center is notated with a * superscript.",
        "This follows a well-established convention in dynamic semantics that superscripted indices indicate context change, while subscripts do not.",
        "The * is meant to indicate position 0 in the current state (or assignment function).",
        "All NP's also receive ordinary indices as well; this ensure that an individual remains accessible after it is no longer the Center.",
        "The three readings are indexed as follows:",
        "(4) Ellen*i was talking to Maryi and Susank about cats.",
        "(5) Mary* loves her* cat.",
        "(6) a. Susank loves her* cat too.",
        "(strict) b. Susan* loves her* cat too.",
        "(sloppy) c. Susank loves here cat too.",
        "(other)",
        "First, Ellen is established as the Center.",
        "Next, the Center shifts to Mary.",
        "Then for the strict reading, the Center remains Mary, while for the sloppy reading, it shifts to Susan.",
        "In both cases, the pronoun refers to the Center, as required since it is the only pronoun.",
        "For the other, the pronoun does not refer to the Center.",
        "The Centering approach to strict/sloppy alternation is proposed as an alternative to semantic accounts (Sag, 1976) which rely on variable binding.",
        "I have argued that the variable binding account predicts that the antecedent for a sloppy pronoun ( \"Susan\" in the above example) must be sister to a constituent containing the sloppy pronoun; the Centering account is somewhat more flexible; it involves a preference that the antecedent must be rather prominent, but does not impose a specific structural constraint.",
        "From this perspective, one would expect that sloppy identity is somewhat flexible concerning the structural position of the antecedent, as long as it is contextually prominent.",
        "It has long been recognized that sloppy identity exhibits precisely this sort of flexibility.",
        "This poses a major problem for the variable binding account, and (Hardt, 2003) points out that a recent attempt (Tomioka, 1999) to solve this problem requires substantial complication of the syntax-semantics interface, and appears to encounter substantial empirical problems as well.",
        "This proposal is attractive in that it imports independently required principles concerning the processing of pronouns.",
        "It arguably accounts for strict-sloppy alternation better than alternative accounts, and avoids any complications to the mechanisms of syntax and semantics."

        "Unfortunately, there is a serious problem with this rosy scenario: Centering Theory as it is generally understood fails utterly to capture the facts in examples involving strict-sloppy alternation.",
        "While it is generally agreed that the strict and sloppy readings are both acceptable, and the \"other\" reading impossible, Centering only permits the strict reading, treating the sloppy reading on a par with the impossible \"other\" reading.",
        "To show this, I will first give a brief presentation of Centering Theory.",

        "The above claims are instantiated in the BFP algorithm (Brennan et al., 1987).",
        "For purposes of comparison, it is convenient to use the formulation of (Beaver, 2002), COT.",

        "While space doesn't permit a detailed study of the integration of Dynamic Centering with a general parallelism theory, it seems clear that a theory such as Rooth's would naturally rule out the above reading: Rooth's theory requires non-accented material in the second sentence to semantically match corresponding material in the first sentence.",
