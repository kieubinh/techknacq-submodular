        "The study of nominal ellipsis resolution differs significantly from that of pronominal and other anaphoric resolution with the view that ellipsis in its own right has null morphology, and hence the detection of ellipsis is an additional task.",
        "Consequently, much work on nominal ellipsis resolution has focused on resolving syntactically missing arguments, i.e. implicit subjects, and to a much lesser extent, objects and indirect objects.",
        "Since the subject is the most frequent and usually the most semantically significant argument, this focus is legitimate.",
        "Even so, current research is still challenged by the prospect of adequately accounting for even subject ellipsis.",
        "Needless to say, there have been attempts to resolve other types of nominal ellipsis, such as lexical nouns, indirect anaphors, and exophora (Mitkov 2002).",
        "This paper is an elaboration of the paper (Nariyama 2003a) that raised another type of ellipsis whose resolution has been hitherto neglected, presumably because the existence of this type of ellipsis is even more inconspicuous than those ellipses that have been studied.",
        "It occurs in some constructions, which appear to be syntactically complete but are in actuality missing an agent.",
        "Hence, this disguised ellipsis is referred to as 'incognito' ellipsis.",
        "As the agent is the key nominal constituent that is informationally vital, particularly in applications for Question Answering and Machine Translation systems, it deserves attention and sound analysis.",
        "The rest of this paper is organised as follows.",
        "Section 2 lays out background of the phenomenon.",
        "Section 3 examines the aspect of detecting such ellipses.",
        "For acheiving this task, it discusses the process of creating a list of argument taking nominals in order to alleviate the problems arising from word sense disambiguations inherent in the semantics of verbs.",
        "Finally, Section 4 presents a method for resolving incognito ellipses as well as common ellipses in a unified manner."

        "The use of the existential (i.e. intransitive) construction signals that, in the case of (9), the caller Z is lower than the receiver X of the call in terms of animacy and discourse salience, while a transitive sentence signals that the caller is higher than the receiver.",

        "This leads to the correct reading indicated.",
        "The claim that sentences that violate the principle of direct alignment are restructured into the existential or nominative object constructions (i.e. intransitive sentences) is verified in the small bilingual corpus analysis; intransitive sentences are used 42.8% in Japanese, while 23.4% in the English translations (Nariyama 2003a).",
        "Moreover, the principle of ellipsis specifies that the higher an argument in terms of animacy and discourse salience, the more prone it will be to ellipsis.",
        "Indeed, when a higher argument is ellipted, as in 'There was a call (for me) from my husband', the sentence sounds natural.",
        "On the other hand, when a lower argument is ellipted while a higher is retained, as in 'There was a call for me (from my husband)', the sentence is unnatural in Japanese, sounding as if there should have been an argument specified.",
