        "The references made by the speakers to the entities that they talk about are one of the keys to the understanding of human dialogs.",
        "When speakers discuss one or more documents, as in a press review meeting, the references to these documents constitute a significant proportion of all the occurring references.",
        "A computer representation of the referents is available in this case, unlike references to more abstract objects, since here the documents can be stored in electronic format.",
        "Reference resolution amounts thus to the construction of links between each referring expression (RE) and the corresponding document element.",
        "For example, if someone says: “I do not agree with the title of our latest report”, then ‘our latest report’ refers to a document available as a computer file, and ‘the title of our latest report’ refers precisely to its title, an element that can be retrieved from the file.",
        "We propose here an algorithm for the resolution of references to documents, or ref2doc.",
        "Its implementation and evaluation require a computational framework that includes several types of data – documents, transcriptions, and links – and an evaluation measure.",
        "We summarize our view of reference resolution over a restricted domain in Section 2.",
        "Then, we situate the present task in the overall speech-to-document alignment process (Section 3).",
        "The annotated data and the evaluation metric are described in Section 4, along with empirical results regarding the patterns of the REs.",
        "The resolution algorithm is presented in Section 5, and the results obtained in various configurations are analyzed in Section 6, with conclusions about their relevance.",
        "Section 7 outlines the applications of the ref2doc algorithm to the exploitation of documents in meeting processing and retrieval applications."

        "From a cognitive point of view, the role of referring expressions in discourse is to specify the entities about which the speaker talks.",
        "It has long been observed that a more accurate view is that REs rather specify representations of entities in the speaker’s or hearer’s mind, an abstraction called discourse entities or DEs (Sidner, 1983; Grosz et al., 1995).",
        "Reference resolution can be defined as the construction of the discourse entities specified by referring expressions, or rather, the construction of computational representations of DEs.",
        "This difficult but important task in discourse understanding by computers appears to be more tractable when enough knowledge about a domain is available to a system (Gaizauskas and Humphreys, 1997), or when the representations are considerably simplified (Popescu-Belis et al., 1998).",
        "The coreference and anaphoric links, that is, links between REs only, are somewhat different aspects of the phenomenon of reference (Devitt and Sterelny, 1999; Lycan, 2000).",
        "Coreference is the relation between two REs that specify the same DE.",
        "Anaphora is a relation between two REs, called antecedent RE and anaphoric RE, where the DE specified by the latter is determined by knowledge of the DE specified by the former.",
        "In other terms, the DE specified by the anaphoric RE cannot be fully determined without knowledge of the antecedent RE.",
        "Depending on how the referent of the second RE is determined by the referent of the first one, the two REs may be coreferent, as in example (1) below, or they can be related by other referring relations, e.g. whole/part, function/value, etc., as in (2).",

        "Itz discusses ... 2.",
        "The first articlez is particularly relevant to our company.",
        "The titled suggests that we...",
        "In the present case, reference resolution over a restricted domain differs significantly both from anaphora resolution (Mitkov, 2002) and from coreference resolution (Hirschman, 1997; van Deemter and Kibble, 2000).",
        "The REs available in the dialog transcript must be matched against the set of potential referents or DEs, which can be derived from the document structure.",
        "Therefore a computational representation of the referents is here available to serve as DEs.",
        "This advantage results directly from our present research goal and could be later extended to DEs derived computationally from document content, such as the persons mentioned in an article.",
        "Reference resolution in a restricted domain presents similarities with problems in natural language generation (NLG) and in command dialogs, that is, when the sets of referents are known a priori to the system.",
        "In NLG, the problem is to generate REs from existing computational descriptions of entities – see Paraboni and van Deemter (2002) for an application to intra-document references.",
        "In command dialogs, the problem is to match the REs produced by the user against the objects managed by the interface, again known formally to the system (Huls et al., 1995; Skantze, 2002)."

        "Citation-based alignment is a pure lexicographic match between terms in documents and terms in the speech transcription.",
        "Thematic alignment is derived from semantic similarity between sections of documents (sentences, paragraphs, logical blocks, etc.)",
        "and units of the dialog structure (utterances, turns, and thematic episodes).",
        "We have implemented an algorithm that uses various state-of-the-art similarity metrics (cosine, Jaccard, Dice) between bags of weighted words.",
        "For matching spoken utterances with document logical blocks, using cosine metric, recall is 0.84, and precision is 0.77, which are encouraging results.",
        "And when matching speech turns with logical blocks, recall stays at 0.84 and precision rises to 0.85.",
        "On the other hand, alignment of spoken utterances to document sentences is less precise but is more promising since it relies on less processing.",
        "Using Jaccard metric, recall is 0.83, and precision is 0.76 (Lalanne et al., 2004).",
        "Thematic units have not been considered yet, for want of reliable automatic segmentation.",
        "Reference-based alignment is complementary to other methods; these could be integrated in a common framework, so that they can be consolidated and compared.",
        "Their fusion should allow for more robust document-to-speech alignment."

        "A promising use of human dialog understanding is for the processing and retrieval of staff or business meetings (Armstrong et al., 2003).",
        "When meetings deal with one or several documents, it is important to link in a precise manner each episode or even utterance of the meeting to the sections of the documents that they refer to.",
        "Considering users who have missed a meeting or want to review a meeting that they attended, this alignment is required for two types of queries that appear in recent studies of user requirements (Lisowska et al., 2004).",
        "First, the users could look for episodes of a meeting in which a particular section of a given document was discussed, so that they can learn what was said about that section.",
        "Second, the relevant documents could automatically be displayed when the users browse a given episode of a meeting – so that a rich, multi-modal context of the meeting episode is presented."

        "This article described a framework and an algorithm for solving references made to documents in meeting recordings by linking referring expressions to the document elements they denote.",
        "The implementation of the algorithm, together with test data (annotated meeting documents and transcripts) and an evaluation metric, show that the best results are obtained when combining anaphora tracking with a weighted lexical matching between RE plus right context, against title plus article contents.",
        "An extension of the present algorithm is under study, in which REs are processed differently according to their type: REs explicitly referring to an article (‘the article’, ‘the section’), REs referring to positions (‘the article at the bottom left’), REs referring to the entities of the contents, etc.",
        "These could be matched to various data categories from the document representations.",
        "Since printed documents and spoken interaction are two important modalities in communication, this article is also a step towards cross-modal applications.",
        "The reference-based alignment between transcripts and documents generates enriched transcripts, with explicit information about the contents and the timing of document mentions; conversely, it also helps document structuring.",
        "These in turn enhance browsing and searching capabilities for multimodal meeting processing and retrieval."
