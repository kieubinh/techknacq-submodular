        "The need for identifying the antecedents of anaphoric expressions in the literature is well-recognized.",
        "Most previous approaches assume that anaphoric expressions and their antecedents would appear in the same documents.",
        "However, further work is called for when such antecedents need to be associated with actual entities in the world, where the task of establishing the denotation of a named entity with respect to the world or a model is known as named entity grounding (Leidner et al., 2003).",
        "In the biomedical domain where the phrases in the literature tend to refer to actual biological entities such as proteins, the phrases should be associated with the actual entries of external resources (Hachey et al., 2004).",
        "In this paper, we present a biomedical anaphora resolution system, BioAR, in order to identify the actual referents of those phrases in the biomedical literature and to annotate the phrases, especially those that refer to proteins, with the entries of proteome databases such as Swiss-Prot by suitable anaphora resolution.",
        "Anaphora resolution indicates the process of determining the antecedent of an anaphoric expression.",
        "Traditional approaches to anaphora resolution in general domain utilize various constraints or preferences from the morphological, syntactic, and semantic points of view.",
        "The most prominent proposal for anaphora resolution is a centering theory (Grosz et al.",
        "(1995)), which identifies the antecedents of pronouns with respect to discourse structures, based on the observation that those entities that have already been mentioned and are more central than others tend to be referred back by pronouns subsequently.",
        "Byron (2002) proposed to identify the antecedents of pronominal references in spoken dialogues by utilizing discourse structures with discourse entities and semantic filtering.",

        "In the biomedical literature, an anaphoric expression works as the device of making an abbreviated and indirect reference to some biological object or objects.",
        "This notion can be applied to all the phrases in the literature which refer to proteins, in that the phrases can be associated (or grounded) with the protein entries in proteome databases, which biologists generally regard as the identities of proteins.",
        "The protein-referring phrases in the literature include not only gene/protein names but also anaphoric expressions and missing arguments of biological interactions (or null anaphors) which refer to proteins.1 As for anaphoric expressions, previous approaches to anaphora resolution often stop at antecedent noun phrases in the same documents, but we propose to further identify the proteins that are composed of protein domains referred to by anaphoric expressions.",
        "For example, the anaphoric expression the KH domain in the last sentence in Table 1 refers to the domain shared by the proteins “the yeast and mammalian branchpoint sequence binding proteins (BBP and mBBP/SF1).”2 While previous approaches have dealt only with the resolution of pronouns (e.g. it, they) and sortal",

        "For example, the omitted argument of interaction in the first example in Table 2 is the sentential subject, or “MOB 1.” In the second example in Table 2, the two omitted participants of the interaction represented by the anaphoric expression this interaction are “lamin A” and “emerin,” which are also the syntactic arguments of the verb binds.",
        "In this paper, we present a biomedical anaphora resolution system, BioAR, to ground the protein-referring phrases in the biological interactions extracted by our biomedical information extraction system, BioIE (Kim and Park, 2004; Park et al., 2001), with Swiss-Prot entries.",
        "BioIE is a system that extracts general biological interactions of arbitrary types from the biomedical literature.",
        "This system shows the performance of 88 92% precision and 55 57% recall, or the F-scores of 68 70.",
        "While the output of BioIE includes complex linguistic phenomena, such as anaphoric expressions, conjunctions, prepositional phrases, and relative clauses, many of the noun phrases in the results of BioIE refer to proteins since the relevant interaction keywords, such as interact and bind, mostly represent protein-protein interactions",
