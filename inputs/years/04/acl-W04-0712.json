        "the user could deal with different appointments in parallel).",
        "Applied under appropriate conditions, default unification turned out to be a robust and efficient method for VP ellipsis and even NP ellipsis.",
        "It was also successfully used to inherit information in situations without any syntactically recognizable ellipsis.",
