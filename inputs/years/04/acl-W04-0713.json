        "However APAs are quite common in English dialogues, see i.a.",
        "(Byron and Allen, 1998).",
        "Recently two algorithms for resolving APAs and IPAs in specific English dialogues have been proposed: Eckert and Strube’s (2000) ES00, Byron’s (2002) PHORA.",
        "APAs are also frequent in Danish.",
        "We found that 15% of all pronominal anaphors in our texts were APAs, while they constituted 48% of the anaphors in the analysed dialogues.",
        "Furthermore third-person singular pronouns in neuter gender which can be IPAs or APAs were APAs in two-third of the cases in both texts and dialogues.",
        "In this paper we describe an algorithm, called DAR, for resolving intersentential IPAs and APAs in Danish.'",
        "Unlike ES00 and PHORA, DAR applies to both texts and dialogues.",
        "Differing from most resolution algorithms, DAR correctly accounts for the resolution of pronouns referring to newly introduced information, as it is the case in examples (1) and (2).",
        "(1) [Chefen]i fik kun [en søn]k og [han]k gad i hvert fald ikke videreføre familieforetagendet.",

        "This nominal is assigned lower prominence than the subject pronoun hun (she) in most salience models.",

        "The first account, e.g. (Grosz et al., 1995), assigns the highest degree of salience to the most known (topical) entities in the discourse model, the second assigns the highest degree of salience to entities in the focal part of utterances in Information Structure terms which, often, represent new information (Haji�cov�a et",

        "In most applied approaches pronominal anaphora resolution is equivalent to determining the antecedent domain and choosing the most prominent or salient antecedent among possible candidates.",
        "Although there is not always an identity relation between linguistic antecedents and referents, we also follow this strategy, well aware that it is particularly problematic for APAs.",
        "In fact, the same linguistic expression can evoke different abstract objects depending on the context in which the APA occurs, see (Webber, 1991).",
        "Determining the degree of salience of discourse elements, henceforth DEs, is essential to anaphor resolution because personal pronouns refer to the most salient candidate antecedent that matches the given predication (Sidner, 1983).",
        "Nearly all salience-based models identify high degree of salience with high degree of givenness of DEs.",
        "In fact, although the various algorithms use different criteria for ranking DEs such as linear order, hierarchy of grammatical roles, information structure, Prince’s Familiarity Scale (Prince, 1981), they all assign the highest prominence to the DEs which are most topical, known, bound, familiar and thus given, i.a.",
        "(Grosz et al., 1995; Brennan et al., 1987; Strube and Hahn, 1996; Strube, 1998).",
        "Grosz et al.",
        "(1995) also suggest that continuing speaking about the same elements in a discourse segment is perceived as more coherent than shifting the focus of attention.",
        "They implement this by the following ranking of transition states: continue > retain > shift.",
        "One salience model departs from the givenness2 assumption.",
        "It has been proposed by Haji�cov�a et al.",
        "(1990) and assigns the highest degree of salience to DEs in the focal part of an utterance in information structure terms (Sgall et al., 1986).",
        "These entities often represent new information.",
        "Haji�cov�a et al.’s approach is original and can account for the data in (1) and (2).",
        "However, it is problematic from an applied point of view.",
        "In the first place it is difficult to",
        "determine the information structure of all utterances.",
        "Secondly, focal candidate antecedents are ranked highest in Haji�cov�a et al.’s model, but they still compete with given candidate antecedents in their system.",
        "Finally the data does not confirm that all entities in the focal part of an utterance have the highest degree of accessibility.",
        "We agree with Haji�cov�a’s insight, but in order to operationalise the role of focality in resolution in a reliable way we propose the following.",
        "Accessibility by default is connected with givenness as assumed in most resolution algorithms.",
        "However, speakers can explicitly change the degree of accessibility of entities in discourse by marking them as salient with information structure related devices.",
        "These entities represent the main focus of an utterance, have the highest degree of salience and are, in the majority of cases, the preferred antecedents of anaphors.",
        "In these cases the shift of focus of attention is, in our opinion, as coherent as continuing speaking about the same entities, because it is preannounced to the addressee.",
        "On the basis of the data we propose a list of identifiable constructions in which explicit focus marking occurs and the focal DEs have the highest degree of salience in our data.3 Examples from the list are the following: a: Entities referred to by NPs which are focally marked structurally.",
        "In Danish this marking occurs in clefts, existential and topicalised constructions.4 b: Entities referred to by NPs that follow focusing adverbs, as in (1).",
        "c: Entities focally marked by the prosody (if this information is available) and/or entities providing the information requested in questions, as in (2).",
        "The hierarchy of verbal complements can model givenness preference in Danish.",
        "As in English pronouns have high givenness degree (pronominal chain preference).",
        "In addition to salience preferences we found that parallelism can account for numerous uses of Danish anaphors.",
        "According to parallelism in adjacent utterances with parallel grammatical complements, the preferred antecedent of an anaphor in the second utterance is the linguistic expression in",
        "the first utterance with the same grammatical function.",
        "Inspired by the work of (Kameyama, 1996) we have defined a preference interaction model to be used in resolution.",
        "Our model is given in figure 1.5 The interaction model states that givenness preferences are overridden by focality preference, when in conflict, and that they all are overridden by parallelism.",
        "Also in Dan",
        "ish demonstrative and personal pronouns refer to entities with different status in the discourse model.",
        "Weak (cliticised and unstressed) pronouns usually refer to the most salient entity in the utterance.",
        "Strong (stressed and demonstrative) pronouns emphasise or put in contrast the entities they refer to and/or indicate that their antecedents are not the most expected ones.6 Demonstratives preferentially refer to abstract entities, while personal pronouns preferentially refer to individual entities in ambiguous contexts.",
        "All these differences are implemented in DAR.",
        "Approx.",
        "half of the APA occurrences in our dialogues refer to entities evoked by larger discourse segments (more turn takings).",
        "Thus we follow Eckert and Strube’s approach of marking the structure of dialogues and searching for APA antecedents in the right frontier of the discourse tree (Webber, 1991).",
        "DAR presupposes different discourse structures for texts and dialogues.",
        "DAR follows the ES00 and PHORA strategy of discriminating between IPAs and APAs by rules looking at the semantic constraints on the predication contexts in which the anaphors occur.",
        "DAR relies on many more discriminating rules than ES00.",
        "These rules were defined analysing large amounts of data and using the encodings of the Danish PAROLE computational lexicon (Braasch et al., 1998; Navarretta, 1997).",
        "DAR uses language-specific rules to account 5 The interaction model was defined on the basis of the data and the results of a survey of pronominal uses.",
        "Commonsense preferences which override all the other preferences (see inter alia (Hobbs, 1983) are not implemented.",
        "6 The most frequent Danish third person singular gender pronoun det can both be a personal pronoun (corresponding to it) and a demonstrative pronoun (corresponding to this/that).",
        "In the latter case it is always stressed.",

        "We find the algorithm very interesting because it addresses many of the same phenomena, but with different strategies.",
