        "10 of the words were chosen in coordination with other lexical-sample tasks.",
        "The examples were taken from newspapers, an in-house balanced corpus and Internet texts.",
        "We additionally included a large set of untagged examples, and a lemmatised version of the data including lemma, PoS and case information.",

        "The larger number of unlabelled data was released with the purpose to enable the exploration of semi-supervised systems.",
        "The test set comprised 1/3 of the tagged examples.",
        "The sense inventory was taken from the Basque WordNet, which is linked to WordNet version 1.6 (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "The examples came mainly from newspaper texts, although we also used a balanced in-house corpus and texts from Internet.",
        "The words selected for this task were coordinated with other lexical-sample tasks (such as Catalan, English, Italian, Romanian and Spanish) in order to share around 10 of the target words.",

        "She had to delete and add senses to the words, specially for adjectives and verbs, and was allowed to check the examples in the corpus.",
        "• The three taggers would meet, read the glosses",
        "and examples given in the Basque WordNet and discuss the meaning of each synset.",

        "WordNet might change during this meeting; that is, linguists could agree that one of the word’s senses was missing, or that a synset did not fit with a word.",
        "This was done prior to looking at the corpus.",
        "Then, the editor would update the Basque WordNet according to those decisions before giving the taggers the final synset list.",
        "Overall (including first bullet above), 143 senses were deleted and 92 senses added, leaving a total of 316 senses.",
        "This reflects the current situation of the Basque WordNet, which is still under construction.",
        "• Two taggers independently tagged all examples for the word.",
        "No communication was allowed while tagging the word.",
        "• Multiple synset tags were allowed, as well as",
        "the following tags: the lemma (in the case of multiword terms), U (unassignable), P (proper noun), and X (incorrectly lemmatized).",
        "Those with an X were removed from the final release.",
        "In the case of proper nouns and multiword terms no synset tag was assigned.",
        "Sometimes the U tag was used for word senses which are not in the Basque WordNet.",
        "For instance, the sense of kanal corresponding to TV channel, which is the most frequent sense in the examples, is not present in the Basque WordNet (it was not included in WordNet 1.6).",
        "• A program was used to compute agreement rates and to output those occurrences where there was disagreement.",
        "Those occurrences were grouped by the senses assigned.",
        "• A third tagger, the referee, reviewed the",
        "disagreements and decided which one was the correct sense (or senses).",
        "The taggers were allowed to return more than one sense, and they returned 9887 tags (1.34 per occurrence).",
        "Overall, the two taggers agreed in at least one tag 78.2% of the time.",
        "Some words attained an agreement rate above 95% (e.g. nouns kanal or tentsio), but others like herri – town/people/nation– attained only 52% agreement.",
        "On average, the whole tagging task took 54 seconds per occurrence for the tagger, and 20 seconds for the referee.",
        "However, this average does not include the time the taggers and the referee spent in the meetings they did to understand the meaning of each synset.",
