        "SENSEVAL is an evaluation exercise of the latest word-sense disambiguation (WSD) systems.",
        "It serves as a forum that brings together researchers in WSD and domains that use WSD for various tasks.",
        "It allows researchers to discuss modifications that improve the performance of their systems, and analyze combinations that are optimal.",
        "Since the first edition of the SENSEVAL competitions, a number of languages were added to the original set of tasks.",
        "Having the WSD task prepared for several languages provides the opportunity to test the generality of WSD systems, and to detect differences with respect to word senses in various languages.",
        "This year we have proposed a Romanian WSD task.",
        "Five teams with a total of seven systems have tackled this task.",
        "We present in this paper the data used and how it was obtained, and the performance of the participating systems."

        "These examples are presented to the contributors, who are asked to select the most appropriate sense for the target word in each sentence.",

        "and their dictionary definitions were incorporated in the Open Mind Word Expert.",
        "For each annotation task, the contributors could choose from this list of 39 words.",

        "After the user gets familiarized with these senses, the system displays each example sentence, and the list of senses together with their short description, to facilitate the tagging process.",
        "For the coarse grained WSD task, we had the option of using the grouping provided by the dictionary.",
        "A manual analysis however showed that some of the senses in the same group are quite distinguishable, while others that were separated were very similar.",

        "To obtain a better grouping, a linguist clustered the similar senses for each word in our list of forty.",
