        "For example, the back-off estimates for the class of \"Motion verbs\" are constructed by merging the SCF distributions for 4-5 \"Motion verbs\" e.g., move, slide, arrive, travel, and sail.",
        "For (b), we combine the different back-off estimates using linear interpolation (Chen and Goodman, 1996) so that the contribution of each set of estimates is weighted according to the frequency of the corresponding senses in corpus data.",
        "Let pj(scfi), j = 1 ... nbo (where nbo is the number of back-off estimates) be the probabilities of SCFs in different back-off distributions.",
        "The estimated probability of the SCF in the resulting combined back-off distribution is calculated as follows:",
        "where the Aj denote weights for the different distributions and sum to 1.",
        "The values for Aj are determined specific to a verb and are obtained by converting the output of a WSD system into probability distributions on senses for each word.",
        "As a final step, a simple empirically determined threshold is used on the probability estimates after smoothing to filter out noisy SCFs."

        "The test corpus for this task consisted of around 1000 sentences for each verb drawn from the BNC.",
        "For each verb, WSD systems were asked to annotate every occurrence of the verb in its associated corpus, and each annotation is converted into a probability distribution on senses.",

        "A correlation of p = 0.97 was found between the two sets of results, showing a very high correlation between WSD system performance and the performance of SCF acquisition when the WSD system is employed.",
