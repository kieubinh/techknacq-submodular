        "The output of the trained model on some particular input is an array of values that ideally are just 0 or 1.",
        "Actually those values are never exactly 0 and 1, so we are prepared to consider them as an ”activation” of the sense recognizers and consider that the most ”activated” (the sense with highest value) wins and gives the sense we decide on.",
        "In other words, we consider the values an approximation of the true probabilities associated with each sense.",
        "The RLSC solution to this linear regression problem is The first difference between our system and Marius Popescu’s RLSC-LIN is that two of the systems (HTSA3 and HTSA4) use supplementary features, obtained by multiplying up to three of the existing features, because they improved the accuracy on Senseval-2.",
        "Another difference is that the targets have values 0 and 1, while in the Marius Popescu’s RLSC-LIN the targets have values 1 and 1.",
