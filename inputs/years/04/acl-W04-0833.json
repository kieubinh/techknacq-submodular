        "In this paper, we describe our experiments on statistical word sense disambiguation (WSD) using two systems based on different approaches: Naive Bayes on word tokens and Maximum Entropy on local syntactic and semantic features.",
        "In the first approach, we consider a context window and a sub-window within it around the word to disambiguate.",
        "Within the outside window, only content words are considered, but within the sub-window, all words are taken into account.",
        "Both window sizes are tuned by the system for each word to disambiguate and accuracies of 75% and 67% were respectively obtained for coarse and fine grained evaluations.",
        "In the second system, sense resolution is done using an approximate syntactic structure as well as semantics of neighboring nouns as features to a Maximum Entropy learner.",

        "In 1950, Kaplan carried out one of the earliest WSD experiments and showed that the accuracy of sense resolution does not improve when more than four words around the target are considered (Ide and V�eronis, 1998).",
        "While researchers such as Masterman (1961), Gougenheim and Michea (1961), agree with this observation (Ide and V�eronis, 1998), our results demonstrate that this does not generally apply to all words.",
        "A large context window provides domain information which increases the accuracy for some target words such as bank.n, but not others like different.a or use.v (see Section 3).",
        "This confirms Mihalcea’s observations (Mihalcea, 2002).",
        "In our system we allow a larger context window size and for most of the words such context window is selected by the system.",
        "Another trend consists in defining and using semantic preferences for the target word.",
        "For example, the verb drink prefers an animate subject in its imbibe sense.",
        "Boguraev shows that this does not work for polysemous verbs because of metaphoric expressions (Ide and V�eronis, 1998).",
        "Furthermore, the grammatical structures the target word takes part in can be used as a distinguishing tool: “the word ‘keep’, can be disambiguated by determining whether its object is gerund (He kept eating), adjectival phrase (He kept calm), or noun phrase (He kept a record)” (Reifler, 1955).",
        "In our second system we approximate the syntactic structures of a word, in its different senses.",
        "Mooney (Mooney, 1996) has discussed the effect of bias on inductive learning methods.",
        "In this work we also show sensitivity of Naive Bayes to the distribution of samples."

        "In our simple approximate smoothing the probability of seen words is not discounted to compensate for those of unseen words 2.",
        "Finding a proper value to assign to unseen words was done experimentally; for a relatively large training data set, p(an unseen word) = 10-10 and for a small set, 10-9 resulted in the highest accuracy with our 15% validation seta.",
        "The intuition is that, with a small training set, more unseen words are likely to be seen during the testing phase, and in order to prevent the accumulating score penalty value from becoming relatively high, a lower probability value is selected.",
        "Additionally, the selection should not result in large differences in the computed scores of different senses of the target word.",
