        "Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is a task that has recently received a lot of attention in the NLP community.",
        "The SRL task in Senseval-3 used the Framenet (Baker et al., 1998) corpus: given a sentence instance from the corpus, a system’s job would be to identify the phrase constituents and their corresponding role.",
        "The Senseval-3 task was divided into restricted and non-restricted subtasks.",
        "In the non-restricted subtask, any and all of the gold standard annotations contained in the FrameNet corpus could be used.",
        "Since this includes information on the boundaries of the parse constituents which correspond to some frame element, this effectively maps the SRL task to that of a role-labeling classification task: given a constituent parse, identify the frame element that it belongs to.",
        "Due to the lack of time and resources, we chose to participate only in the non-restricted subtask.",
        "This enabled our systems to take the classification approach mentioned in the previous paragraph."

        "This section describes the features that were used for the SRL task.",

        "The features that we used for each sample have been previously shown to be helpful for the SRL task (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).",
        "Some of these features can be obtained directly from the Framenet annotations:",
        "• The name of the frame.",
        "• The lexical unit of the sentence – i.e. the lexical identity of the target word in the sentence.",
        "• The general part-of-speech tag of the target word.",
        "• The “phrase type” of the constituent – i.e. the syntactic category (e.g. NP, VP) that the constituent falls into.",
        "• The “grammatical function” (e.g. subject, object, modifier, etc) of the constituent, with respect to the target word.",
        "• The position (e.g. before, after) of the constituent, with respect to the target word.",
        "In addition to the above features, we also extracted a set of features which required the use of some statistical NLP tools:",
        "• Transitivity and voice of the target word – ",
        "The sentence was first part-of-speech tagged and chunked with the fnTBL transformation-based learning tools (Ngai and Florian, 2001).",
        "Simple heuristics were then used to deduce the transitivity voice of the target word.",
        "• Head word (and its part-of-speech tag) of the constituent – After POS tagging, a syntactic parser (Collins, 1997) was then used to obtain the parse tree for the sentence.",
        "The head word (and the POS tag of the head word) of",
        "the syntactic parse constituent whose span corresponded most closely to the candidate constituent was then assumed to be the head word of the candidate constituent.",
        "The resulting training data set consisted of 51,366 constituent samples with a total of 151 frame element types.",
        "These ranged from “Descriptor” (3520 constituents) to “Baggage” and “Carrier” (1 constituent each).",
        "This training data was randomly partitioned into a 80/20 “development training” and “validation” set."

        "However, on closer examination of the task, it quickly became evident that distinguishing between 151 possible outcomes was a difficult task for any system.",
        "It was also not clear that there was going to be a lot of information that could be generalized across frame types.",
        "We therefore partitioned the data by frame, so that one model would be trained for each frame.",

        "In total, five individual systems were trained for the SRL task, and four ensemble models were generated by using various combinations of the individual systems.",
        "With one exception, all of the individual systems were constructed using off-the-shelf machine learning software.",
