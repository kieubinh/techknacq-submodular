        "Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is the process of identifying the correct meanings of words in particular contexts (Manning and Schütze, 1999).",
        "It is only an intermediate task in NLP, like POS tagging or parsing.",
        "Examples of final tasks are Machine Translation, Information Extraction or Dialogue systems.",
        "WSD has been a research area in NLP for almost the beginning of this field due to the phenomenon of polysemy that means multiple related meanings with a single word (Widdows, 2003).",
        "The most important robust methods in WSD are: machine learning methods and dictionary based methods.",
        "While for English exist some machine readable dictionaries, the most known being Word-Net (Christiane Fellbaum, 1998), for Romanian until now does not exist any.",
        "Therefore for our application we used the machine learning approach."

        "Our system falls in the supervised learning approach category.",
        "It was trained to learn a classifier that can be used to assign a yet unseen example to one or two of a fixed number of senses.",
        "We had a trained corpus (a number of annotated contexts), from where the system learned the classifier, and a test corpus which the system will annotate.",
        "In our system we used the Vector Space Model: a context c was represented as a vector c� of some features which we will present bellow.",
        "By a context we mean the same definition as in Senseval denotation: the content between icontextZ and</context>.",
        "The notations used to explain our method are (Manning and Schütze, 1999):",
        "• w - the word to be disambiguate; • s1, · · · , sNs the senses for w; • c1, · · · , cNc the contexts for w; • v1, · · · , vN f the features selected.",
        "As we treated each word w to be disambiguated separately, let us explain the method for a single word.",
        "The features selected was the set of ALL words used in the trained corpus (nouns, verbs, prepositions, etc) , so we used the cooccurrence paradigm (Dagan, Lee and Pereira ,1994).",
        "The vector of a context c of the target word w is defined as:",
        "• c� = (w1, · · · , w, W,) where wi is the number",
        "of occurences of the word vi in the context c and vi is a word from the entire trained corpus of I W I words.",
        "The similarity between two contexts ca, cb is the normalised cosine between the vectors �ca and �cb (Jurafsky and Martin, 2000):",
        "The number wi is the weight of the feature vi.",
        "This can be the frequency of the feature vi (term frequency or t f ), or ”inverse document frequency ”, denoted by idf.",
        "In our system we considered all the words from the entire corpus, so both these aspects are satisfied."

        "At training time, our k-NN model memorizes all the contexts in the training set by their associated features.",
        "Later, when proceeds a new context cnew, the classifier first selects k contexts in the training set that are closest to cnew, then pick the best sense (senses) for cnew (Jackson and Moulinier, 2002).",
        "• TRAINING: Calculate c� for each context c. • TEST: Calculate",

        "Finally,",
        "We used the value of k set to 3 after some experimental verifications.",
        "A major problem with supervised approaches is the need for a large sense tagged training set.",
        "The bootstrapping methods use a small number of contexts labeled with senses having a high degree of confidence.",
        "These labeled contexts are used as seeds to train an initial classifier.",
        "This is then used to extract a larger training set from the remaining untagged contexts.",
        "Repeating this process, the number of training contexts grows and the number of untagged contexts reduces.",
        "We will stop when the remaining unannotated corpus is empty or any new context can’t be annotated.",
        "In (Tatar and Serban, 2001), (Serban and Tatar, 2003) we presented an algorithm which falls in this category.",
        "The algorithm is based on the two principles of Yarowsky (Resnik and Yarowsky, 1999):",
        "• One sense per discourse: the sense of a target word is highly consistent within a given discourse (document); • One sense per collocation: the contextual features ( nearby words) provide strong clues to the sense of a target word.",
        "Also, for each iteration, the algorithm uses a NBC classifier.",
        "We intend to present a second system based on this algorithm at the next Senseval contest."

        "Our disambiguation system is written in JDK 1.4.",

        "We defined a relation between words as δ: W x W, where W is the set of words.",
        "If w1 E W and w2 E W are two words, we say that (w1, w2) E δ if w1 and w2 have the same grammatical root.",
        "Therefore, if w is a word and C is a context, we say that w occurs in C iff exists a word w2 E C so that (w, w2) E δ.",
        "In other words, we replaced the stemming step with collecting all the words with the same root in a single class.",
        "This collection is made considering the rules for romanian morphology; 2.",
        "The step 3 of the algorithm for choosing the appropriate sense (senses) of a poly-semic word w in a given context C (in fact the sense that maximizes the set S = {Score(C, sj) I j = 1, · · · Ns} of scores for C) is divided in three sub-steps: • If there is a single sense s that maximizes S, then s is reported as the appropriate sense for C; • If there are two senses s1 and s2 that maximize S, then s1 and s2 are reported as the appropriate senses for C; • Consider that Max1 and Max2 are the first two maximum values from S where (Max1 > Max2).",
        "If Max1 is obtained for a sense s1 and if Max2 is obtained for a sense s2 and if",
        "where P = Max1-Min and Min is the",
        "minimum score from S, then s1 and s2 are reported as the appropriate senses for C. Experimentally, we proved that the above improvements grow the precision of the disambiguation process.",
        "Considering as baseline procedure the majority sense (all contexts are solved with the most frequent sense in the training corpus), for the word nucleu (noun) is obtained a precision of 0,78 while our procedure obtained 0,81.",
        "Also, for the word desena (verb) the baseline procedure of the majority sense obtains precision 0,81 while our procedure obtained 0,85.",
        "At this stage our system has not as a goal to label with U (unknown) a context, every time choosing one or two from the best scored senses.",
        "Annotating with the label U is one of our coming improving.",
        "This can be done simply by adding as a new sense for each word the sense U.",
        "A simple experiment reported a number of right annotated contexts.",
        "Another direction to improve our system is to exploit better the senses as they are done in training corpus: our system simply consider the first sense."
