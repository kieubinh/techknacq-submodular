        "The starting point for our research in the Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) area was to explore the use of semantic domains in order to solve lexical ambiguity.",
        "At the Senseval-2 competition we proposed a new approach to WSD, namely Domain Driven Disambiguation (DDD).",
        "This approach consists of comparing the estimated domain of the context of the word to be disambiguated with the domains of its senses, exploiting the property of domains to be features of both texts and words.",
        "The domains of the word senses can be either inferred from the learning data or derived from the information in WORDNET DOMAINS.",
        "For Senseval-3, we refined the DDD methodology with a fully unsupervised technique - Domain Relevance Estimation (DRE) - for domain detection in texts.",
        "DRE is performed by an expectation maximization algorithm for the gaussian mixture model, which is exploited to differentiate relevant domain information in texts from noise.",
        "This refined DDD system was presented in the English all-words task.",
        "Originally DDD was developed to assess the usefulness of domain information for WSD.",
        "Thus it did not exploit other knowledge sources commonly used for disambiguation (e.g. syntactic patterns or collocations).",
        "As a consequence the performance of the DDD system is quite good for precision (it disambiguates well the “domain” words), but as far as recall is concerned it is not competitive compared with other state of the art techniques.",
        "On the other hand DDD outperforms the state of the art for unsupervised systems, demonstrating the usefulness of domain information for WSD.",
        "In addition, the DDD approach requires domain annotations for word senses (for the experiments we used WORDNET DOMAINS, a lexical resource developed at IRST).",
        "Like all manual annotations, such an operation is costly (more than two man years have been spent for labeling the whole WORDNET DOMAINS structure) and affected by subjectivity.",
        "Thus, one drawback of the DDD methodology was a lack of portability among languages and among different sense repositories (unless we have synset-aligned WordNets).",
        "Besides the improved DDD, our other proposals for Senseval-3 constitute an attempt to overcome these previous issues.",
        "To deal with the problem of having a domain-annotated WORDNET, we experimented with a novel methodology to automatically acquire domain information from corpora.",
        "For this aim we estimated term similarity from a large scale corpus, exploiting the assumption that semantic domains are sets of very closely related terms.",
        "In particular we implemented a variation of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) in order to obtain a vector representation for words, texts and synsets.",
        "LSA performs a dimensionality reduction in the feature space describing both texts and words, capturing implicitly the notion of semantic domains required by DDD.",
        "In order to perform disambiguation, LSA vectors have been estimated for the synsets in WORDNET.",
        "We participated in the English all-words task also with a first prototype (DDD-LSA) that exploits LSA instead of WORDNET DOMAINS.",
        "As far as lexical sample tasks are concerned, we participated in the English, Italian, Spanish, Catalan, and Basque tasks.",
        "For these tasks, we explored the direction of pattern abstraction for WSD.",
        "Pattern abstraction is an effective methodology for WSD (Mihalcea, 2002).",
        "Our preliminary experiments have been performed using TIES, a generalized Information Extraction environment developed at IRST that implements the boosted wrapper induction algorithm (Freitag and Kushmerick, 2000).",
        "The main limitation of such an approach is, once more, the integration of different knowledge sources.",
        "In particular, paradigmatic information seems hard to be represented in the TIES framework, motivating our decision to exploit kernel methods for WSD.",
        "Kernel methods is an area of recent interest in Machine Learning.",
        "Kernels are similarity functions between instances that allows to integrate different knowledge sources and to model explicitly linguistic insights inside the powerful framework of support vector machine classification.",
        "For Senseval-3 we implemented the Kernels-WSD system, which exploits kernel methods to perform the following operations: (i) pattern abstraction; (ii) combination of different knowledge sources, in particular domain information and syntagmatic information; (iii) integration of unsupervised term proximity estimation in the supervised framework.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 introduces LSA and its relations with semantic domains.",
        "Section 3 presents the systems for the English all-words task (i.e. DDD and DDD-LSA).",

        "Domains are common areas of human discussion, such as economics, politics, law, science etc., which are at the basis of lexical coherence.",
        "A substantial part of the lexicon is composed by “domain words”, that refer to concepts belonging to specific domains.",
        "In (Magnini et al., 2002) it has been claimed that domain information provides generalized features at the paradigmatic level that are useful to discriminate among word senses.",
        "The WORDNET DOMAINS' lexical resource is an extension of WORDNET which provides such domain labels for all synsets (Magnini and Cavagli`a, 2000).",
        "About 200 domain labels were selected from a number of dictionaries and then structured in a taxonomy according to the Dewey Decimal Classification (DDC).",
        "The annotation methodology was mainly manual and took about 2 person years.",
        "WORDNET DOMAINS has been proven a useful resource for WSD.",
        "However some aspects induced us to explore further developments.",
        "These issues are: (i) it is difficult to find an objective a-priori model for domains; (ii) the annotation procedure followed to develop WORDNET DOMAINS is very expensive, making hard the replicability of the lexical resource for other languages or domain specific sub-languages; (iii) the domain distinctions are rigid in WORDNET DOMAINS, while a more “fuzzy” association between domains and concepts is often more appropriate to describe term similarity.",
        "In order to generalize the domain approach and to overcome these issues, we explored the direction of unsupervised learning on a large-scale corpus (we used the BNC corpus for all the experiments described in this paper).",
        "In particular, we followed the LSA approach (Deerwester et al., 1990).",
        "In LSA, term co-occurrences in the documents of the corpus are captured by means of a dimensionality reduction operated on the term-by-document matrix.",
        "The resulting LSA vectors can be exploited to estimate both term and document similarity.",
        "Regarding document similarity, Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) is a technique that allows one to represent a document by a LSA vector.",
        "In particular, we used a variation of the pseudo-document methodology described in (Berry, 1992).",
        "Each document can be represented in the LSA space by summing up the normalized LSA vectors of all the terms contained in it.",
        "By exploiting LSA vectors for terms, it is possible to estimate domain vectors for the synsets of WORDNET, in order to obtain similarity values between concepts that can be used for synset clustering and WSD.",

        "The basic idea to estimate domain relevance for texts is to exploit lexical coherence inside texts.",
        "A simple heuristic approach to this problem, used in Senseval-2, is counting the occurrences of domain words for every domain inside the text: the higher the percentage of domain words for a certain domain, the more relevant the domain will be for the text.",

        "Indeed irrelevant senses of ambiguous words contribute to augment the final score of irrelevant domains, introducing noise.",

        "Syntactic patterns, like lexical patterns, can be obtained by exploiting pattern abstraction techniques on POS sequences.",

        "Our aim was to combine them into a common framework.",

        "The idea of SVM (Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor, 2000) is to map the set of training data into a higher-dimensional feature space F via a mapping function 0 : R – F, and construct a separating hyperplane with maximum margin (distance between planes and closest points) in the new space.",

        "Since the feature space is high dimensional, performing the transformation has often a high computational cost.",

        "Therefore, a kernel function provides a way to compute (efficiently) the separating hyperplane without explicitly carrying out the map 0 into the feature space - this is called the kernel trick.",
        "In this way the kernel acts as an interface between the data and the learning algorithm by defining an implicit mapping into the feature space.",
        "Intuitively, we can see the kernel as a function that measures the similarity between pairs of objects.",
        "The learning algorithm, which compares all pairs of data items, exploits the information encoded in the kernel.",
