        "The Senseval-3 English Lexical Sample (ELS) task requires disambiguating 57 words, with an average of roughly 140 training examples and 70 testing examples of each word.",
        "Each example is about a paragraph of text, in which the word that is to be disambiguated is marked as the head word.",
        "The average head word has around six senses.",
        "The training examples are manually classified according to the intended sense of the head word, inferred from the surrounding context.",
        "The task is to use the training data and any other relevant information to automatically assign classes to the testing examples.",
        "This paper presents the National Research Council (NRC) Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) system, which generated our four entries for the Senseval-3 ELS task (NRC-Fine, NRC-Fine2, NRC-Coarse, and NRC-Coarse2).",
        "Our approach to the ELS task is to treat it as a classical supervised machine learning problem.",
        "Each example is represented as a feature vector with several hundred features.",
        "Each of the 57 ambiguous words is represented with a different set of features.",
        "Typically, around half of the features are syntactic and the other half are semantic.",
        "After the raw examples are converted to feature vectors, the Weka machine learning software is used to induce a model of the training data and predict the classes of the testing examples (Wit-ten and Frank, 1999).",
        "The syntactic features are based on part-of-speech tags, assigned by a rule-based tagger (Brill, 1994).",
        "The main innovation of the NRC WSD system is the method for generating the semantic features, which are derived from word co-occurrence probabilities.",
        "We estimated these probabilities using the Waterloo MultiText System with a corpus of about one terabyte of unlabeled text, collected by a web crawler (Clarke et al., 1995; Clarke and Cor-mack, 2000; Terra and Clarke, 2003).",

        "Any remaining words in the example are ignored (usually most of the example is ignored).",
        "The window is not allowed to cross sentence boundaries.",
        "If the head word appears near the beginning or end of the sentence, where the window may overlap with adjacent sentences, special null characters fill the positions of any missing words in the window.",

        "A high positive value indicates that the two words tend to co-occur, and hence are likely to be semantically related.",

        "Past work demonstrates that PMI is a good estimator of semantic similarity (Turney, 2001; Terra and Clarke, 2003) and that features based on PMI can be useful for supervised learning (Turney, 2003).",

        "If there is no preceding noun, verb, or adjective within the window, the value is set to zero.",
        "In names of the form avg position sense, the feature value is the average of the feature values of the corresponding features.",
        "For instance, the value of avg pre argument 1 10 02 is the average of the values of all of the pre model features, such that model was extracted from a training window in which the head word was labeled with the sense argument 1 10 02.",
        "The idea here is that, if a testing example should be labeled, say, argument 1 10 02, and is a noun, verb, or adjective that is close to the head word in the testing example, then should be relatively high when is extracted from a training window with the same sense, argument 1 10 02, but relatively low when is extracted from a training window with a different sense.",
        "Thus avg position argument 1 10 02 is likely to be relatively high, compared to other avg position sense features.",
        "All semantic features with names of the form position model are normalized by converting them to percentiles.",
        "The percentiles are calculated separately for each feature vector; that is, each feature vector is normalized internally, with respect to its own values, not externally, with respect to the other feature vectors.",
        "The pre features are normalized independently from the f o l features.",
        "The semantic features with names of the form avg position sense are calculated after the other features are normalized, so they do not need any further normalization.",
        "Preliminary experiments with the ELS data from Senseval-2 supported the merit of percentile normalization, which was also found useful in another application where features based on PMI were used for supervised learning (Turney, 2003)."
