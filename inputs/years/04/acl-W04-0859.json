        "Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is an open research field in Natural Language Processing (NLP).",
        "The task of WSD consists in assigning the correct sense to words in a particular context using an electronic dictionary as the source of words definitions.",
        "This is a difficult problem that is receiving a great deal of attention from the research community.",
        "At the Second International Workshop on Evaluating Word Sense Disambiguation Systems, SENSEVAL-2, several supervised and unsupervised systems took part.",
        "The more successful systems relay on corpus-based and supervised learning methods.",
        "At SENSEVAL-2 the average level of accuracy achieved rounded 70%, which is insufficient for such other NLP tasks as information retrieval, machine translation, or question answering.",
        "The DLSI-UA systems were applied to three SENSEVAL-3 tasks: English all-words, English lexical sample and Spanish Lexical Sample.",
        "Our systems use both corpus-based and knowledge-based approaches: Maximum Entropy(ME) (Lau et al., 1993; Berger et al., 1996; Ratnaparkhi, 1998) is a corpus-based and supervised method based on linguistic features; ME is the core of a bootstrapping algorithm that we call retraining inspired",
        "by co-training (Blum and Mitchell, 1998); Relevant Domains (RD) (Montoyo et al., 2003) is a resource built from WordNet Domains (Magnini and Cavaglia, 2000) that is used in an unsupervised method that assigns domain and sense labels; Specification Marks(SP) (Montoyo and Palo-mar, 2000) exploits the relations between synsets stored in WordNet (Miller et al., 1993) and does not need any training corpora; Commutative Test (CT) (Nica et al., 2003), based on the Sense Discriminators device derived from EWN (Vossen, 1998), disambiguates nouns inside their syntactic patterns, with the help of information extracted from raw corpus.",
        "A resume of which methods and how were used in which SENSEVAL-3 tasks is shown in Table 1.",
        "Most of these methods are relatively new and our goal when participating at SENSEVAL-3 is to evaluate for the first time such approaches.",
        "At the moment of writing this paper we can conclude that these are promising contributions in order to improve current WSD systems.",
        "In the following section each method is described briefly.",
        "Then, details of how the SENSEVAL-3 train and testing data were processed are shown.",

        "Our method is derived from the co-training method.",
        "Our retraining system is based on two different views of the data (as is also the case for co-training), defined using several groups of features from those described in Figure 1, with several filters that ensure a high confidence sense labelling.",
        "• the target word itself • lemmas of content-words at positions f 1, f 2, f3 • words at positions f1, f2, • words at positions f1, f2, f3 • content-words at positions f1, f2, f3 • POS-tags of words at positions f1, f2, f3 • lemmas of collocations at positions (-2, -1), (-1,+1), (+1,+2) • collocations at positions (-2,-1), (-1,+1), (+1,+2) • lemmas of nouns at any position in context, occurring at least m% times with a sense • grammatical relation of the target word • the word that the target word depends on • the verb that the target word depends on • the target word belongs to a multi-word, as identified by the parser • ANPA codes (Spanish only) • IPTC codes (Spanish only)",
        "These two views consist of two weak ME learners, based on different sets of linguistic features, for every possible sense of a target word.",
        "We decided to use ME as the core of our bootstrapping method because it has shown to be competitive in WSD when compared to other machine learning approaches (Su´arez and Palomar, 2002; M`arquez et al., 2003).",
        "The main difference with respect co-training is that the two views are used in parallel in order to get a consensus of what label to assign to a particular context.",
        "Additional filters will ultimately determine which contexts will then be added to the next training cycle.",
        "Retraining performs several binary partial trainings with positive and negative examples for each sense.",
        "These classifications must be merged in a unique label for such contexts with enough evidence of being successfully classified.",
        "This “evidence” relies on values of probability assigned by the ME module to positive and negative labels, and the fact that the unlabeled example is classified as positive for a unique sense only.",
        "The set of new labeled examples feeds the training corpora of the next iteration with positive and negative examples.",
        "The stopping criteria is a certain number of iterations or the failure to obtain new examples from the unlabeled corpus."

        "The disambiguation is resolved with the use of the WordNet lexical knowledge base.",
        "The underlying hypothesis of the method we present here is that the higher the similarity between two words, the larger the amount of information shared by two concepts.",

        "First, the common concept to all the senses of the words that form the context is gathered.",
        "This concept is marked by the initial specification mark (ISM).",
        "If this initial specification mark does not resolve the ambiguity of the word, we then descend through the WordNet hierarchy, from one level to another, assigning new specification marks.",
        "The number of concepts contained within the subhierarchy is then counted for each specification mark.",
        "The sense that corresponds to the specification mark with the highest number of words is the one chosen as the sense disambiguated within the given context We define six heuristics for our system: Heuristic of Hypernym, Heuristic of Definition, Heuristic of Common Specification Mark, Heuristic of Gloss Hypernym, Heuristic of Hyponym and Heuristic of Gloss Hyponym."

        "This resource has already been used on Word Sense Disambiguation (Magnini and Strappa-rava, 2000), but it has not made use of glosses information.",
        "So our approach make use of a new lexical resource obtained from glosses information named Relevant Domains.",
        "First step is to obtain the Relevant Domains resource from WordNet glosses.",
        "For this task is necessary a previous part-of-speech tagging of WordNet glosses (each gloss has associated a domain label).",
        "So we extract all nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs from glosses and assign them their associated domain label.",
        "With this information and using the Association Ratio formula (w=word,D=domain label), in (1), we obtain the Relevant Domains resource.",

        "We obtain a context vector from Relevant Domains and context words (in case of repeated domain labels, they are weighted).",
        "Furthermore we need a sense vector obtained in the same way as context vector from words of glosses of each word sense.",

        "A syntactic pattern is a triplet X-R-Y, formed by two lexical content units X and Y and an eventual relational element R, which corresponds to a syntactic relation between X and Y.",
        "Examples: [X=canal-noun R=de-preposition Y=televisi´on-noun], [X =pasaje-noun R=Ø Y=a´ereo-adjective].",

        "We also assume that inside a syntactic pattern a word will tend to have the same sense: the ”quasi one sense per syntactic pattern” hypothesis.",
        "The method works as follows: Step 1, the identification of the syntactic patterns of the ambiguous occurrence; Step 2, the extraction of information related to it: from corpus and from the sentential context; Step 3, the application of the WSD algorithm on the different information previously obtained; Step 4, the final sense assignment by combining the partial sense proposals from step 3.",
        "For step 1, we POS-tag the test sentence and extract the sequences that correspond to previously defined combinations of POS tags.",
        "We only kept the patterns with frequency 5 or superior.",
        "In step 2, we use a search corpus previously POS-tagged.",
        "For every syntactic pattern of the ambiguous occurrence X, we obtain from corpus two sets of words: the substitutes of X into the pattern (S 1) and the nouns that co-occur with the pattern in any sentence from the corpus (S2), In both cases, we keep only the element with frequency 5 or superior.",
        "We perform step 3 by means of the heuristics defined by the Commutative Test (CT) algorithm applied on each set from 2.",
        "The algorithm is related to the Sense Discriminators (SD) lexical device, an adaptation of the Spanish WordNet, consisting in a set of sense discriminators for every sense of a given noun in WordNet.",
        "The Commutative Test algorithm lays on the hypothesis that if an ambiguous occurrence can be substituted in a syntactic pattern by a sense discriminator, then it can have the sense corresponding to that sense discriminator.",
        "For step 4, we first obtain a sense assignment in relation with each syntactic pattern, by intersecting the sense proposals from the two heuristics corresponding to a pattern; then we choose the most frequent sense between those proposed by the different syntactic patterns; finally, if there are more final proposed senses, we choose the most frequent sense on the base of sense numbers in WordNet.",
        "The method we propose for nouns requires only a large corpus, a minimal preprocessing phase (POS-tagging) and very little grammatical knowledge, so it can easily be adapted to other languages.",
