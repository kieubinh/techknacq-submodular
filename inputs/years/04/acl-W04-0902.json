        "Traditional approaches to natural language understanding (Woods, 1973; Warren and Pereira, 1982; Alshawi, 1992) provided a good account of mapping from surface forms to semantic representations, when confined to a very limited vocabulary, syntax, and world model, and resulting low levels of syntactic/semantic ambiguity.",
        "It is, however, difficult to scale these methods to unrestricted, general-domain natural language input because of the overwhelming problems of grammar coverage, unknown words, unresolvable ambiguities, and incomplete domain knowledge.",
        "Recent work in NLP has consequently focused on more robust, broad-coverage techniques, but with the effect of overall shallower levels of processing.",
        "Thus, state-of-the-art work on probabilistic parsing (e.g., (Collins, 1999)) provides a good solution to robust, broad coverage parsing with automatic and frequently successful ambiguity resolution, but has largely ignored issues of semantic interpretation.",
        "The field of Question Answering (Paşca and Harabagiu, 2001; Moldovan et al., 2003) focuses on simple-fact queries.",
        "And so-called semantic parsing (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002) provides as end output only a flat classification of semantic arguments of predicates, ignoring much of the semantic content, such as quantifiers.",
        "A major research question that remains unanswered is whether there are methods for getting from a robust “parse-anything” statistical parser to a semantic representation precise enough for knowledge representation and automated reasoning, without falling afoul of the same problems that stymied the broad application of traditional approaches.",
        "This paper presents initial work on a system that addresses this question.",
        "The chosen task is solving logic puzzles of the sort found in the Law School Admission Test (LSAT) and the old analytic section of the Graduate Record Exam (GRE) (see Figure 1 for a typical example).",
        "The system integrates statistical parsing, “on-the-fly” combinatorial synthesis of semantic forms, scope and reference-resolution, and precise semantic representations that support the inference required for solving the puzzles.",
        "Our work complements research in semantic parsing and TRECstyle Question Answering by emphasizing complex yet robust inference over general-domain NL texts given relatively minimal lexical and knowledge-base resources."

        "We believe that representations with a well-defined model-theoretic semantics are required.",
        "Finally, the task has a clear evaluation metric because the puzzle texts are designed to yield exactly one correct answer to each multiple-choice question.",
        "Moreover, the domain is another example of “found test material” in the sense of (Hirschman et al., 1999): puzzle texts were developed with a goal independent of the evaluation of natural language processing systems, and so provide a more realistic evaluation framework than specially-designed tests such as TREC QA.",
        "While our current system is not a real world application, we believe that the methods being developed could be used in applications such as a computerized office assistant that must understand requests such as: “Put each file containing a task description in a different directory.”"

        "NP modifiers (including the sentence subject) are combined to the event variable through generic roles: subj, np1, np2, etc.",

        "9.3 Using FOL reasoners There are two reasons for using both theorem provers and model builders.",
        "First, they are complementary reasoners: while a theorem prover is designed to demonstrate the inconsistency of a set of FOL formulas, and so can find the correct answer to “must be true” questions through proof by contradiction, a model builder is designed to find a satisfying model, and is thus suited to finding the correct answer to “could be true” questions.7 Second, a reasoner may take a very long time to halt on some queries, but the complementary reasoner may still be used to answer the query in the context of a multiple-choice question through a process of elimination.",
        "Thus, if the model builder is able to show that the negations of four choices are consistent with the preamble (indicating they are not entailed), then it can be concluded that the remaining choice is entailed by the preamble, even if the theorem prover has not yet found a proof.",
        "We use the Otter 3.3 theorem prover and the MACE 2.2 model builder (McCune, 1998).8 The reasoning module forks parallel subprocesses, two per answer choice (one for Otter, one for MACE).",
        "If a reasoner succeeds for an answer choice, the choice is marked as correct or incorrect, and the dual sub-process is killed.",
        "If all answer-choices but one are marked incorrect, the remaining choice is marked correct even if its sub-processes did not yet terminate."
