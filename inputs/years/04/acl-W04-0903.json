        "Many important tasks in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) such as text categorization, text summarization, (semi-) automatic translation and such require a certain amount of world knowledge and knowledge about text meaning and sense (Allen, 1995; R. Cole et al., 1995).",
        "Handling the amount of textual data in the World Wide Web also increasingly requires advanced automatic text and language processing techniques: successful search engines like Google (Google, Inc., 2004) already employ text retrieval and information extraction methods based on shallow semantic information.",
        "There are many methodologies to generate word sense representations, but efficiency and effectiv-ity of fully automated techniques tends to be low (Diana Zaiu Inkpen and Graeme Hirst, 2003).",
        "Furthermore, formalisation and quantification of evaluation methods is difficult because in general word sense related techniques are only verifyable through theoretical examination, application on language or human judges (Alexander Budanitsky and Graeme Hirst, 2001), i.e. there is no inherent validation because there is no direct connection to the world as perceived by humans.",
        "In the case of frequency based word sense representations corpus related difficulties arise (number of tagged entities, corpus quality, etc.).",
        "In order to overcome these limitations, we developed a methodology to generate and use explicit computer-usable representations of text senses.",
        "A common understanding of the “sense” of words is defined by the ways the word is used in context, i.e. the interpretation of the word that is consistent with the text meaning1 - as summarized by S. G. Pulman in (R. Cole et al., 1995, Section 3.5).",
        "Extending this definition onto full texts, we introduce our notion of “Text Sense Representation” (TSR) as “the set of possible computer usable interpretations of a textwithout respect to a particular linguistic context ”2.",
        "TSR Trees provide detailed answers to questions like “how close are these n words topically related to each other?”, “are these m sentences really about the same topic?” or “how much does paragraph x contribute to topic y?”.",
        "They cannot tell e.g. a telephone is a physical artifact, it’s purpose is to enable distant communication, etc.",
        "TSR Trees are not meant to substitute meaning acquired through conceptual or linguistic analysis but are rather aimed at:",
        "• augmenting deeper (linguistic or conceptual) methodologies by providing additional analysis clues • standalone usage in generic shallow methods (e.g. in shallow text categorization) and specific applications (e.g. anti-spam functionality)"

        "The algorithm for building initial TSR trees is based on the retrieval of pages from a “web directory” A “web directory” (other sources use the term “web catalogue” (Fabrizio Sebastiani, 2003)) is a browsable taxonomy of web pages.",
        "These web pages are parsed and category descriptions and weight values are extracted from them.",
        "The extracted information is then merged into term-specific TSR trees, optionally normalized and pruned.",
        "In the following explanations we will use the notions “input term”, “input word” and “input phrase” as follows: An input term is any text that is used as input to an algorithm or program.",
        "An input word is any singular word that is an input term.",
        "A word is defined as sequence of alphanumeric symbols not interrupted by whitespace.",
        "An input phrase is any sequence of input words that are separated by whitespace or other non-alphanumeric characters.",

        "The labels are short phrases that provide some meaningful context while the weights are simple integer numbers.",
        "Each tree node has exactly one label and one weight attached to it.",
        "The following five steps will explain how to generate initial TSR Trees: a. Retrieval The input term is redirected as input to a web directory.",
        "3",
        "The web directory to use is not assumed to meet strict requirements in terms of sensible category labels, balanced branches, etc.",
        "but can be any taxonomic structure provided it can be transformed into weighted paths and is large enough to cover a substantial subset of the target language.",

        "b.",
        "Tree Construction The lines of the output list returned by the web directory are then parsed and converted into a sequence of weighted category terms.",
        "Because each sequence represents a different contextual use of the word (in the symbolic sense), each sequence also represents a different sense of that word in that topical context.",

        "Figure 2 provides an example hereof.",

        "Even though the uniqueness of this representation cannot be guaranteed in theory, a clash of two different terms representation is highly unlikely.",
        "The tree generation process obviously fails if the input term cannot be found within the web directory and hence no categorical context is available for that term.",
        "c. Normalization In order to enable uniform processing of arbitrary trees, each tree has to be “normalized” by weight adjustment: The sum of all node weights is computed as 100 percent.",
        "All weights are then recalculated as percentage of this overall tree weight sum.",
        "The sum weight is attached to the TSR tree root as “tree weight”.",
        "d. Node Pruning (optional) Due to the nature of the underlying web directory, there are sometimes false positives in wrong categories, i.e. when a term is used in a rather esoteric way (e.g. as part of a figure of speech, etc.",
        ").",
        "In order to sort out such “semantical noise”, “insignificant” nodes can be deleted using a common heuristic.",

List Transformation (optional) It is possible to transform a TSR tree into a list: by iterating the TSR tree and selecting only the nodes with the high4 The labels within this figure might be printed too small to read but it is the shape of the structure that is important rather than individual node labels.",

        "Since this meaning is applicable in most cases, sufficiently robust algorithms may use these lists successfully, e.g. for simple text classification purposes.",
        "An example list, derived from the “account” example (Figure 2), is depicted in Figure 5. f. External Representation (optional) Lastly, the tree is converted into an external representation in the RDF (O. Lassila and R. Swick, 1999) language.",
        "We chose this particular paradigm because it is an open standard and well suited for representing graph and tree based data.",
        "Furthermore, a number of tools for dealing with RDF already exist – RDF is one of the basic building blocks of the Semantic Web (O. Lassila and R. Swick, 1999) and we expect RDF based TSR trees to be of great use in that domain (e.g. for classification and information extraction).",
        "Summary In this section we presented the construction of computer usable complex TSR trees by utilizing an underlying web directory containing explicit world knowledge.",
        "The generated trees are our basic building blocks to represent the “sense” of the input term in a programmatically usable way.",
