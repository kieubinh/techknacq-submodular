        "In this paper we compare programs of work that aim to develop broad coverage cross-linguistic resources for NLP: Ontological Semantics (OntoSem) and SIMPLE.",
        "The approaches taken in these projects differ in three notable respects: the use of an ontology versus a word net as the semantic substrate; the development of knowledge resources inside of as opposed to outside of a processing environment; and the development of lexicons for multiple languages based on a single core lexicon or without such a core (i.e., in parallel fashion).",
        "In large part, these differences derive from project-driven, real-world requirements and available resources – a reflection of their being practical rather than theoretical projects.",
        "However, that being said, we will suggest certain preferences regarding the content and development of NLP resources with a view toward both short and long-term, high-level language processing goals."

        "Ontological Semantics (OntoSem) is a multilingual text processing environment that takes as input unrestricted text and, using a suite of static resources and processors, automatically creates text-meaning representations (TMRs) which can then be used as the basis for any NLP application, including MT, question answering, summarization, etc.",
        "OntoSem knowledge resources are developed in coordination with each other and with the processors they serve.",
        "Some of the resources are fully language independent while others are readily parameterizable, wherein lies the cross-linguistic portability of the system.",
        "Although in this paper, we focus on OntoSem lexicons, a crucial point is that they are not built in isolation but, rather, in an integrated environment where their utility can be tested and evaluated in a variety of practical applications.",
        "The SIMPLE project takes a different approach to achieving the dual goals of multilinguality and resource utility across applications.",
        "It aims to develop compatible (they use the term “harmonised”) lexicons for 12 European languages, attempting to foresee what will be most useful for applications but without referring to any particular processors that will use the information and without building any other knowledge resources to share the burden of semantic specification.",

        "The SIMPLE project is developing 10K-sense “harmonised” semantic lexicons for 12 European Union languages (Catalan, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish, Swedish), continuing the earlier PAROLE project, which developed 20K-sense morphological and syntactic lexicons for these languages.",
        "The lexicons are monolingual and are developed independently, with the word stock based on corpus evidence for each language.",
        "To ensure some overlap of lexical senses, certain Base Concepts of EuroWordNet must be covered in each language (462 nominal, 187 verbal and 185 adjectival Base Concepts that were culled and cleaned from EuroWordNet).",
        "This overlap will permit direct interlinking among languages; interlinking of the rest of the lexical stock is slated as future work.",
        "Pustejovsky’s four Qualia (which are, essentially, properties expressing formal, agentive, constitutive and telic meanings; see Pustejovsky 1995) are used to specify certain aspects of word meaning, and a common library of 140 template types is used to guide acquisition in all languages (Lenci et al. 2000a, 2000b).",
        "Lenci et al.",
        "2000b (p. 5) summarize the information that can be represented in a SIMPLE lexicon entry: “i) semantic type, corresponding to the template the SemU (semantic unit) instantiates; ii) domain information; iii) lexicographic gloss; iv) argument structure for predicative SemUs; v) selectional restrictions on the arguments; vi) event type, to characterise the aspectual properties of verbal predicates; vii) link of the arguments to the syntactic subcategorization frames, as represented in the PAROLE lexicons; viii) Qualia Structure; ix) information about regular polysemous alternation in which a word sense may enter; x) cross-part-of-speech relations (e.g. intelligent - intelligence; writer - to write); xi) synonymy.” Below is the SemU for a sense of lancet, instantiating the template Instrument (from Palmer et al.",
        "2000).",
        "While the SIMPLE project is certainly producing useful resources, we would suggest that the lexical information and structure are being overly constrained by the frameworks selected, which we will comment on briefly in preparation for an extended comparison between OntoSem and SIMPLE in section 4.",
        "EuroWordNet is being used as the anchor for semantic description in SIMPLE.",
        "However, like the original English WordNet, it is not a property-rich ontology but, rather, a hierarchical net of lexical items whose use in NLP has the same pitfalls as any non-ontological word net (e.g., lack of disambiguating power and lack of sufficient relations between entities; see Nirenburg 2004c for a discussion of the insufficiency of WordNet for NLP).",
        "In order to make up for the sparsity of information in the semantic substrate, the SIMPLE lexicons contain what would, we believe, be more efficiently recorded in a single, sufficient ontology.",
        "For example, when the lexicon acquirers for each language use the Instrument template to describe lancet, they must rerecord in the lexicon of each L all of the language-independent property values for this lexical item, like the values for the four Qualia (formal, agentive, constitutive, telic), the domain, the unification path, etc.",
        "This is significant redundancy and, moreover, there is no guarantee that acquirers will arrive at the same decisions, either through error, oversight or competing analyses of the phenomena in question.",
        "Another, in our view, insufficiently explained aspect of SIMPLE is the priority given to Qualia as descriptors of lexical items.",
        "The original inventory of Qualia (from Pustejovsky 1995) consists of only four properties of the hundreds that can usefully be used to link concepts for purposes of NLP.",
        "Lenci et al.",
        "(2000b) address this issue as follows: “Although they [the four Qualia] clearly do not exhaust the semantic content of lexical items, Pustejovsky (1995) has convincingly shown that these four Qualia dimensions play a particularly prominent role in determining the linguistic behavior of word senses, as well as in the explanation of the generative mechanisms at the basis of lexical creativity.",
        "Qualia-based information can be specified for all the parts of speech, although prima facie it seems to be more directly suitable for the characterization of certain types of nominals”.",
        "However, there is large gap between theoretical interest and practical application: in fact, because of this, the SIMPLE project has moved toward an Extended Qualia Structure with more fine-grained subtypes of given Qualia.1 In conclusion, we believe that SIMPLE is pursuing useful goals that could be pursued in even more useful ways by shifting the focus from lexicon-only work to integrated work within an environment in which ontological and lexical resources are developed together and where extant types of processors can be used to test the value of resources as they are developed."

        "Expressive means include mapping to the ontology (which itself is rich in property-value descriptors), mapping to the ontology with lexical supplementation of properties, or referring to extra-ontological microtheories like those that treat time, reference resolution, comparison, ellipsis resolution, modality, aspect, etc.",
        "What must be emphasized, however, is how language neutral – and therefore portable across languages – the semantic descriptions are.",

        "AGENT, and in I might get sick, I am an EXPERIENCER of a DISEASE event, not an AGENT of it.",
        "Stated differently, if we consider sem-strucs – no matter what lexicon they originate from – to be building blocks of the representation of word meaning (as opposed to concept meaning, as is done in the ontology), then the job of writing a lexicon for L2 based on the lexicon for L 1 is in large part limited to a) providing an L2 translation for the head word(s), b) making any necessary syn-struc adjustments and c) checking/modifying the linking among variables in the syn- and sem-strucs.",
        "This conception of cross-linguistic lexicon development derives in large part from the Principle of Practical Effability (Nirenburg and Raskin 2004), which states that what can be expressed in one language can somehow be expressed in all other languages, be it by a word, a phrase, etc.",
        "Apart from this theoretical justification for conceptualizing the sem-strucs as building blocks for lexical representation, there are two practical rationales: supporting consistency of meaning representation across languages and using acquirer time most efficiently in large-scale lexical acquisition.",
        "As regards consistency, the potential for paraphrase must be considered when building multilingual resources.",
        "For instance, ‘weapons of mass destruction’ can be described as the union of CHEMICAL-WEAPON and BIOLOGICAL-WEAPON, or it can be described as WEAPON with the ability to KILL > 10,000 HUMANs (the actual number recorded will be treated by the analyzer in a fuzzy fashion; however, it would be less than ideal for a lexicon for L2 to record 10,000 while a lexicon for L3 recorded 25,000).",
        "While both representations are valid, it is desirable to use the same one in all languages covered.",
        "In addition, the decision of how to describe a notion – whether by ontologizing it, describing it using extra-ontological means, describing it using an existing concept with additional properties and values defined – is often a judgment call.",
        "It would not be desirable for the acquirer of German to map the word Schimmel ‘white horse’ to the concept HORSE with the lexical restriction COLOR: WHITE, while the acquirer of some other language that also has a word for ‘white horse’ introduced an ontological concept specifically for this entity.",
        "Again, while both representations are valid and, in this case, semantically equivalent, the general tendency should be to strive toward uniformity where possible.",
        "As concerns acquirer time, composing sem-strucs is, by far, the most time and effort-intensive aspect of writing OntoSem lexicon entries.",
        "This derives from the wealth of expressive means; the fact that microtheories of time, reference, etc., are naturally built during lexicon development (recall that our environment is fully integrated with processors); and the fact that ontology development occurs hand-in-hand with lexicon development.",
        "Therefore, work on the first lexicon entry that describes a word sense – regardless of the language of origin – takes much more time than editing a word sense for a new language.",
        "Moreover, although in the worst case some editing of entries is necessary for L2, L3, etc., in most cases no such editing is needed.",

        "The primary insight was that while manually porting individual lexical senses is quite straightforward and will save time over acquisition from scratch, porting lexicons wholesale is rather more complex.",
        "That is, manually providing translations for the senses in L1 is a conceptually relatively simple task, complicated only by the need for the occasional remapping of variables, editing of syntactic structures, omission of given senses due to language lacunae (e.g., a phrasal encoded in L1 might not occur in L2 in a fixed form), etc.",
        "However, if one attempts either to (semi-)automate the acquisition process and/or use L1 as a seed lexicon for more “creative” acquisition of L2, the space of options becomes quite broad and must be constrained programmatically in order to actually benefit from the reuse of semantic descriptions.",
        "For example, if a well-trained acquirer of L2 is using L1 as a seed, questions that arise include: Should the base lexicon be left as is (considering that it is known to have incomplete coverage) or should one attempt to improve its quality and coverage while building L2?",
        "Should L2 acquisition be driven by correspondences in head words or simply by the content of sem-struc zones (e.g., all English senses of table will be in one head entry, and typically will be acquired at once; should all senses of all L2 translations of table be handled at once during L2 acquisition or should the L2 acquirer wait until he comes upon sem-strucs that represent the given other meanings of the L2 words)?",
        "To what extent should the regular acquisition process – including ontology supplementation – be carried out on L2?",
        "The answers to all of these, and more such, questions depend entirely upon available resources and should be informed by (a) experiments to determine what works best for a given acquirer, and (b) the goals of a given project.",
        "As regards automation, the experiment found that automatically mapping L2 words to L1 OntoSem entries works very well (at well over 90%) when the machine-tractable L1-L2 resource used to support this process has one sense of the given word in the given part of speech and the OntoSem lexicon also has one sense for the given part of speech.",
        "The extraction and matching of such senses represents a well-defined, extremely time-efficient task, especially for specialized terminology that tends to have only one sense in any language.",
        "When the mapping between senses in the L1-L2 lexicon and the OntoSem lexicon is more than one to one, manual linking of senses (which do not always correspond among the languages) has proved necessary, with the potential benefits of a time-saving interface becoming immediately clear.3"

        "There are two sources it searches: previous TMRs, for a recent semantically viable event, and the ontology itself, for an EVENT (or EVENTs) whose default AGENT is HUMAN and default THEME is PUDDING.",
        "This search procedure in some cases returns more than one candidate event to reconstruct the semantic ellipsis.",
        "While this is not always ideal, it does reflect precisely the type of lexical ambiguity that can be resolved only by contextual clues.",
        "For example, the sentence John refused the pudding could be used in a supermarket context to describe a situation where John refused to take/accept a free box of pudding that was being pushed upon him by a promoter.",
        "The desire to be able to treat this second reading of the sentence is the reason for treating constraints in OntoSem abductively.",
        "As far as one can tell, the constraints in SIMPLE are rigid: “telic = eat” for pudding is a hard constraint.",

        "Although space does not permit us to fully describe the resources, programs and resulting TMRs for sentences (a)-(e), this snapshot of their processing underscores the point that developing resources within an environment where they are tightly coupled with processing has clear advantages over developing resources in the abstract.",
        "Of course, in the absence of a full environment, projects like SIMPLE make sense.",
        "However, the challenges of resource development outside of an environment are keenly felt by developers: as Calzolari (1999:42) reports: “A dichotomy at stake here is the one between generality of a LR [lexical resource] vs. usefulness for applications.",

        "The only aspect of this statement that we would dispute is the unrealistic nature of building resources for particular systems.",
