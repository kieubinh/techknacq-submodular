        "More recently, work in information extraction (IE) and question answering (QA) has triggered a renewed research interest in paraphrases as IE and QA systems typically need to be able to recognise various verbalisations of the content.",
        "Because of the large, open domain corpora these systems deal with, coverage and robustness are key issues and much on the work on paraphrases in that domain is based on automatic learning techniques.",
        "For instance, (Lin and Pantel, 2001) acquire two-argument templates (inference rules) from corpora using an extended version of the distributional analysis in which paths in dependency trees that have similar arguments are taken to be close in meaning.",
        "Similarly, (Barzi-lay and Lee, 2003) and (Shinyanma et al., 2002) learn sentence level paraphrase templates from a corpus of news articles stemming from different news source.",
        "And (Glickman and Dagan, 2003) use clustering and similarity measures to identify similar contexts in a single corpus and extract verbal paraphrases from these contexts.",
        "Such machine learning approaches have known pros and cons.",
        "On the one hand, they produce large scale resources at little man labour cost.",
        "On the other hand, the degree of descriptive abstraction offered by the list of inference or paraphrase rules they output is low.",

        "and its degree of overgeneration (does it generate only the sentences of the described language?)",
        "While corpus driven efforts along the PAR-SEVAL lines (Black et al., 1991) are good at giving some measure of a grammar coverage, they are not suitable for finer grained analysis and in particular, for progress evaluation, regression testing and comparative report generation.",
