        "It gives rise to a variety of readings, which are difficult to capture by one invariant meaning.",

        "Propositions, i.e. truth-conditional content, arise only after that enrichment process has taken place.",
        "NLP applications need to capture the meaning of a linguistic input to adequately work with it in the respective applications.",
        "But the ‘meaning’ relevant in this case, viz. the intended interpretation of an utterance, is underspecified by the lexically given input in at least two ways.",
        "Linguistic meaning underspecifies propositions, i.e. ‘what is said’ (Carston, 2002), and ‘what is said’ in turn underspecifies ‘what is meant’ (Grice, 1989).",
        "Both kinds of underspecification have to be solved by the hearer in natural discourse settings, and by the corresonding algorithms in NLP-applications.",
        "As such applications necessarily rely on linguistically given input, they have to be supplemented by a systematic account of the inferential mechanisms needed to enrich and specify the lexical schemes.",
        "A further difficulty for NLP applications is that, presuming some form of cooperativity, any utterance can be interpreted by appropriately accommodating the context.",
        "Apparently, computing the contextually relevant interpretation of an utterance requires more than capturing and computing lexical input.",

        "The twofold underspecification of natural language expressions is resolved by pragmatic reasoning: ‘implicatures’, derived by inference alone, enrich what is said to what is meant and ‘explicatures’, derived by decoding plus inference, enrich the lexical input to what is said.",
        "Both interact in mutual parallel adjustment, in that the expectation of certain implicatures constrains the possible range of explicatures.",
        "Thus, we are dealing with two kinds of semantics – lexical and propositonal – and with two kinds of pragmatics – explicature and implicature (Carston, 2002):",
        "The pragmatic actions can be captured by Le-vinson’s (2000) heuristics, whose application gives rise to default interpretations by evoking certain inferences.",
        "The heuristics and their corresponding inferences are based on Grice’s Maxims of Conversation: Q-heuristics are based on the first quantity maxim (‘make your statement as informative as possible’) and license inference to the negation or invalidity of a corresponding stronger expression, M-heuristics stem from violations of the manner maxim (esp.",
        "‘avoid obscurity of expression’ and ‘avoid prolixity’), and license the inference from marked expressions to marked interpretations.",
        "I-heuristics are based on the second quantity maxim (‘do not say more than necessary’) and allow for inference to a stereotype.",
        "Contrary to the Gricean view, however, these are assumed to work partly also on the subpropositional level giving rise to ‘explicatures’ (Carston, 2002), thereby enriching and constraining the underspecified lexical representation.",
        "An advantage of using heuristics giving rise to default interpretations is that they capture the fact that real minds have to make decisions under constraints of limited time and knowledge.",
        "In handling tasks like interpretation, humans have to use approximate methods like heuristics that guide the search and determine when it should end, and simple decision rules that make use of the information found.",
        "To behave adaptively in the environment in general, and in interpreting utterances in special, humans must be able to make inferences that are fast, frugal and accurate (Gigerenzer et al., 1999).",
        "These inferences, or the heuristics they are based on, respectively, work well insofar as they make a tradeoff on the dimension of generality vs. specificity.",
        "Their simplicity allows them to be robust when confronted with a change in environment and to generalize to new situations.",
        "Such heuristics are rather suitable means for dealing with underspecified, sense-general linguistic expressions that equally make a tradeoff between underdetermination and preciseness.",
        "Furthermore, heuristics are of the kind NLP applications can deal with (section 4).",
        "Levinson’s heuristics, at least the M and Q-heuristics, are instances of such fast and frugal heuristics that give rise to default inferences which have to be made more specific in the course of interpretation.",
        "This is achieved by the rather specific I-heuristics, that give rise to inferences by referring to assumptions provided by a concept being activated by a lexical item in a certain context and discourse setting."
