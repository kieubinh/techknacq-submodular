        "GETARUNS, the system for text understanding developed at the University of Venice, is equipped with three main modules: a lower module for parsing where sentence strategies are implemented; a middle module for semantic interpretation and discourse model construction which is cast into Situation Semantics; and a higher module where reasoning and generation takes place (Delmont & Bianchi, 2002) .",
        "The system is based on LFG theoretical framework (Bresnan, 2001) and has a highly interconnected modular structure.",
        "It is a top-down depth-first DCG-based parser written in Prolog which uses a strong deterministic policy by means of a lookahead mechanism with a WFST to help recovery when failure is unavoidable due to strong attachment ambiguity.",
        "It is divided up into a pipeline of sequential but independent modules which realize the subdivision of a parsing scheme as proposed in LFG theory where a c-structure is built before the f-structure can be projected by unification into a DAG.",
        "In this sense we try to apply in a given sequence phrase-structure rules as they are ordered in the grammar: whenever a syntactic constituent is successfully built, it is checked for semantic consistency, both internally for head-spec agreement, and externally, in case of a non-substantial head like a preposition dominating the lower NP constituent.",
        "Other important local semantic consistency checks are performed with modifiers like attributive and predicative adjuncts.",
        "In case the governing predicate expects obligatory arguments to be lexically realized they will be searched and checked for uniqueness and coherence as LFG grammaticality principles require (Delmonte, 2002).",
        "In other words, syntactic and semantic information is accessed and used as soon as possible: in particular, both categorial and subcategorization information attached to predicates in the lexicon is extracted as soon as the main predicate is processed, be it adjective, noun or verb, and is used to subsequently restrict the number of possible structures to be built.",
        "Adjuncts are computed by semantic cross compatibility tests on the basis of selectional restrictions of main predicates and adjuncts heads.",
        "As far as parsing is concerned, we purport the view that the implementation of sound parsing algorithm must go hand in hand with sound grammar construction.",
        "Extragrammaticalities can be better coped with within a solid linguistic framework rather than without it.",
        "Our parser is a rule-based deterministic parser in the sense that it uses a lookahead and a Well-Formed Substring Table to reduce backtracking.",
        "It also implements Finite State Automata in the task of tag disambiguation, and produces multiwords whenever lexical information allows it.",
        "In our parser we use a number of parsing strategies and graceful recovery procedures which follow a strictly parameterized approach to their definition and implementation.",
        "Recovery procedures are also used to cope with elliptical structures and uncommon orthographic and punctuation patterns.",
        "A shallow or partial parser, in the sense of (Abney, 1996), is also implemented and always activated before the complete parse takes place, in order to produce the default baseline output to be used by further computation in case of total failure.",
        "In that case partial semantic mapping will take place where no Logical Form is being built and only referring expressions are asserted in the Discourse Model – but see below."

        "The system collapses all entities and their properties, relations and attributes, after the text has been fully analysed, by collecting them for each ontological type under each semantic identifier.",
        "At the same time, each semantic id receives a score for topichood thus allowing a ranking of the entities.",

        "Results reported in the experiment above have been aimed to show the ability of the system to cope with what has always been regarded as the toughest task for an NLP system to cope with, that of reference resolution which is paramount in any system of Q/A.",

        "We are currently experimenting with automatic ontology building from the DM into a Proteg6 database which is then used to answer queries from the web (Delmonte, 2003b).",
        "By weaving natural language into the basic fabric of the Semantic Web, we can begin to create an enormous network of knowledge easily accessible by both machines and humans alike.",
        "Furthermore, we believe that natural language querying capabilities will be a key component of any future Semantic Web system.",
        "By providing “natural” means for creating and accessing information on the Semantic Web, we can dramatically lower the barrier of entry to the Semantic Web.",
        "Natural language support gives users a whole new way of interacting with any information system, and from a knowledge engineering point of view, natural language technology divorces the majority of users from the need to understand formal ontologies.",
        "As we have tried to show in the paper, this calls for better NLP tools where a lot of effort has to be put in order to allow for complete and shallow techniques to coalesce smoothly into one single system.",
        "GETARUNS represents such a hybrid system and its performance is steadily improving."
