        "The paper deals with the latest application of natural language processing (NLP), specifically of ontological semantics (ONSE) to natural language information assurance and security (NL IAS).",
        "It demonstrates how the existing ideas, methods, and resources of ontological semantics can be applied to detect deception in NL text (and, eventually, in data and other media as well).",
        "After stating the problem, the paper proceeds to a brief introduction to ONSE, followed by an equally brief survey of our 5-year-old effort in “colonizing” IAS.",
        "The main part of the paper deals with the following issues:",
        "• human deception detection abilities and NLP modeling of it; • manipulation of fact repositories for this purpose beyond the current state of the art; • acquisition of scripts for complex ontological concepts; • degrees of lying complexity and feasibility of",
        "their automatic detection.",
        "This is not a report on a system implementation but rather an application-establishing proof-of-concept effort based on the algorithmic and machine-tractable recombination and extension of the previously implemented ONSE modules.",
        "The strength of the approach is that it emphasizes the use of the existing NLP applications, with very few domain and goal-specific adjustments, in a most promising and growing new area of IAS.",
        "So, while clearly dealing with a new application, the paper addresses theoretical and methodological extensions of ONSE, as defined currently, that will be useful for other applications as well."

        "The proposed application falls within the rapidly growing domain of cyber forensics, and the inclusion of NLP in it is a desirable and mutually beneficial goal.",
        "Forensic science, in general, encompasses any scientific discipline that is concerned with the direct application of scientific principles and theories to law enforcement (Saferstein 2004), that is, the systematic search for, discovery, and application of clues to event reconstruction – for the purposes of justice.",
        "As with any of the other traditional forensic sciences (e.g., DNA, Serology, Latent Fingerprint Analysis etc.)",
        "the development of the cyber forensics",
        "discipline is based on a sound scientific foundation, compliance with legal requirements, and a unified maturation process (Palmer 2002; Rogers & Seigfried 2004; Whitcomb 2002).",
        "The current foundation for cyber forensics is multidisciplinary in nature and combines established pure sciences (e.g., computer science, math) and applied sciences (e.g., information technology, engineering, and now NLP).",
        "Cyber forensics is still in search of its theory and methodology; NLP comes into it on strong and explicit theoretical foundations (see Nirenburg and Raskin 2004: 34-91).",
        "As far as we know, no similar research has been undertaken yet.",
        "The Patrick group at the University of Sydney reported on a \"bag-ofwords\" system comparing the Nigerian emails with Reuters' financial reports and concluding that the presence of the personal pronouns I/me and you in the former but not in the latter violates the interpersonal relations of the register in the former, thus leading to characterizing them as scams (Herke-Couchman et al.",
        "2003; Whitelaw and Argamon 2004).",
        "The difference in the proposed approach is that it goes beyond treating words as just character strings and represents their meanings, as well as those of the sentences and of their text, explicitly and manipulates them logically, as it were, rather than statistically.",
        "The result, typical for the comparison of computational semantics with computational statistics, is that a semantic forensics system is capable of identifying specific facts/events that contribute to the deception and of understanding what those events are – the characterization of the text as fraudulent comes then as a trivial side effect.",
        "The Patrick approach can, however, be used to assists semantic forensics by pre-identifying some texts as suspicious cheaply and thus reducing the general semantic forensics to a more targeted and feasible task (see Section 6 below).",
        "Also, their ScamSeek Project has declared an intention to move towards true meaning features (http://www.cs.usyd.edu.au/~lkmrl/scamseek.htm).",
        "Outside of NLP, the British-centered linguistic forensics community (IAFL) has been engaged in traditional largely qualitative stylistic research in the spirit of the 1960s’ text attribution, an effort to break the anonymity of a text and to identify its authorship for the purposes of law enforcement (McMenamin 2002, Gibbons 2003, Olsson 2004).",
        "While other disciplines within cyber forensics explore largely non-textual materials – and those which look at texts, with the above-mentioned exceptions.",
        "do not do so linguistically – semantic forensics, as defined here, uses NLP to identify the clues of deception in NL texts in order to reconstruct the described events as they actually occurred.",
        "Now, it can be argued, with reason, that the truthful elements in NL texts are also clues for event reconstruction and should be included in semantic forensics, and, of course, in a way they are.",
        "But those, if indeed truthful, do not come under the task of reconstructing events; rather, they establish the events.",
        "Besides, the truthful elements of NL texts get the text meaning representation (TMR) in the normal course of events, so no special semantic forensic effort needs to be developed with regard to them.",
        "This is not set in concrete, however, because the identification and exploration of deception clues clearly involves the non-deceptive TMRs and their fragments.",
        "Semantic forensics is firmly based on ONSE, and a semantic forensic analysis of the text presupposes and follows the regular ONSE process of automatic meaning representation of each input sentence and, ultimately, the text.",
        "The next section offers a brief introduction into the ONSE process of meaning representation, with an emphasis on analysis rather than generation and with a bias towards IAS applications.",
        "It can be largely skipped by those familiar with ONSE."

        "ONSE contains several modules, with an ontology at the center; the other important modules are lexicons of languages and a fact repository, in which information about the world is stored, and, of course, the analyzer and generator.",
        "The analytical goal of ONSE is to produce a TMR for NL input as well as NL or other output for each TMR (see figure 1).",
        "The ontology is a tangled hierarchy (lattice) of concepts, beginning at the root ALL, branching into OBJECT, EVENT, and PROPERTY, and so forth.",
        "Each node of the hierarchy is a concept with a set of properties, many of which are inherited from its ancestors, and at least one property other than the IS-A property is distinguished from its parent node as well as from its sibling nodes.",
        "The ontological concept for PAY might therefore look like figure 2 (cf. Nirenburg and Raskin 2004: 196ff.).",
        "As we see, the IS-A and SUBCLASSES slots are filled with other ontological concepts, as are AGENT, THEME, and PATIENT, the case-role slots.",
        "VALUE, SEM, RELAXABLE-TO and DEFAULT are all facets of their slots.",
        "Lexicons contain the actual words of a language, in contrast to the ontology’s universal, language-independent concepts.",
        "The entry for each word in the lexicon contains all possible senses of that word, labeled with a part of speech and a sense number.",
        "The lexical entry for the English word pay contains three senses, respectively pay-n1, pay-n2, and pay-v1.",
        "Each of the senses is then assigned, most importantly, the information about the acceptable syntactic environments for the sense, or SYN-STRUC, and information about the word’s meaning, or SEM-STRUC.",
        "It is in SEM-STRUC that each lexical item is linked to one or more ontological concepts, or to literals.",
        "The lexical entry for the English adjective good looks something like figure 3.",
        "When a text is fed into the ONSE system, its lexical items are identified, as well as several TMR parameters, such as discourse relations including modalities, aspect, information about ordering and duration in time, style, and sets of concepts working together.",
        "The first step in building a TMR is finding meanings for heads of clauses in the syntactic representation of input, which are most commonly verbs.",
        "The TMR, however, will typically end up containing more event instances than there are verbs in the original text.",
        "After identifying these events, building the TMR is a (non-trivial) matter of fitting all the other information of the text into the filler slots of the events and the additional parameters.",
        "In figure 4 are the much-simplified TMRs for three related sentences, which demonstrate how small changes in texts affect TMRs.",

        "In the most implemented one, NL watermarking (see Atallah et al.",
        "2002), a sophisticated mathematical procedure, based on a secret large prime number, selects certain sentences in a text for watermark bearing and transforms their TMRs into bitstrings",
        "that contribute up to 4 bits per sentence to the watermark.",
        "The goal of the software is, of course, to embed a robust watermark in the hidden semantic meaning of NL text, represented as its TMR in tree structure.",
        "The NLP role is to “torture” the TMR tree of the sentence, whose contributing bits do not fit the watermark, so that they do.",

        "The former ability is a highly desirable but, interestingly, not necessary precondition for DD (see an explanation below, in the Feasibility section).",
        "The latter functionality is the ultimate goal of SF NLP but, like all full automation in NLP, it may not be easily attainable.",
        "Humans detect lying by analyzing meaning of what they hear or read and compare that meaning to other parts of the same discourse, to their previously set expectations, and to their knowledge of the world.",
        "Perhaps the easiest lie to detect is a direct contradiction: If one hears first that John is in Barcelona today and then that he is not, one should suspect that one of the two statements is incorrect and to investigate – if one is interested, a crucial point.",
        "The harder type of deception to perceive is by omission: The first author was pushed into SF after having read a detailed profile of Howard Dean, then a leading contender for the Democratic nomination in the US 2004 presidential election, and noticed that the occupation of every single adult mentioned in the article was indicated with the exception of the candidate’s father, who had been a stockbroker.",
        "Glossing over, such as saying that one has not had much opportunity to talk to John lately, which may be technically true, while covering up a major fallout with John, is yet more complicated.",

Barwise and Perry 1983)); but what she wants to accomplish is for the wife to infer, incorrectly, that this is all the boss is doing downtown.",
        "It is the latter, linguistically interesting type that was the focus of Raskin (1987).",

        "In principle, it should record all of them.",
        "Realistically, it records them selectively to suit the needs of an implementation.",
        "Thus, in CRESP, a small QA system for queries about the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, the FR remembered all the nations, all the participants, all the competitive events, and all the results.",
        "A SF NLP system may start at the same level of prominence (and detect one’s lie about having participated in the Games and/or achieved a better result), but like almost all NLP systems with reasoning abilities, it will be only as powerful as its FR allows.",
        "A contradiction will be flagged when two TMR (fragments) are discovered: For example, one having been just processed for John is/was/will be in Barcelona at noon on the 25th (of July 2004) and the other in the FR for John is/was/will be in Valencia at noon on the 25th (of July 2004) – or their paraphrases (see figure 5).",
        "In the case of Papa Dean’s occupation, apparently too shameful for the reporter to mention even after he had divulged the Park Avenue childhood, hereditary Republicanism, and discriminatory country club and even though there are still a few stockbrokers on this side of the bars, the FR will easily detect it by presenting this information, very simplistically, as in figure 6.",
        "To detect a gloss-over, it is not quite enough to receive a new TMR which contains an event involving a different interaction between these two individuals at the same time.",
        "The co-reference microtheory (see Nirenburg and Raskin 2004: 301-5) will have to be able to determine or at least to suspect that these events are indeed one and the same event rather than two consecutive or even parallel events.",
        "Even the time parameters are not a trivial task to equate, as in the case of I have not much opportunity to talk to John lately and John insulted me last May.",
        "It would be trivial, of course, if the temporal adverbials were since that night at Maude’s and that night at Maude’s, respectively, but a human sleuth does not get such incredibly easy clues most of the time and has to operate on crude proximity and hypothesizing.",
        "Also helping him or her is a powerful inferencing engine, obviously a must for an NLP system of any reasonable complexity, reinforced by a microtheory of euphemisms, which must contain representative sets of event types that people lie about and of fossilized, cliché-like ways of lying about them, as in How is this paper? – Well... it’s",
        "The reason we think that the loyal secretary’s type of lying is harder to detect is not because it may involve more inferencing of a more complex kind – this is not necessarily so.",
        "It has to do with the notion of the whole truth: It is not realistic to expect a human, let alone an SF NLP to suspect any information to be incomplete and subject every single TMR to the ‘and what else did he do downtown’ type of query.",

        "A main tool for DD, in particular TSF, is the expansion of the ontology by acquiring scripts of complex events, already found necessary for other higher-end NLP tasks (see Raskin et al.",
        "2003).",
        "There are strong connections among elements of many texts.",
        "These have to do with the understanding that individual propositions may hold well-defined places in “routine,” “typical” sequences of events (often called complex events, scripts or scenarios) that happen in the world, with a well-specified set of object-like entities that appear in different roles throughout that sequence.",
        "A script captures the entities of such an event and their temporal and causal sequences, as shown for the complex event BANKRUPTCY in figure 7.",
        "As a general tool in ONSE, the scripts that get instantiated from the text input provide expectations for processing further sentences in a text.",
        "Indeed, if a sentence in a text can be seen as instantiating a script in the nascent TMR, the analysis and disambiguation of subsequent sentences can be aided by the expectation that propositions contained in them are instantiations of event types that are listed as components of the activated script.",
        "In addition, the expectations that scripts provide play a crucial role for DD, namely in the detection of omission, in two complementary ways.",
        "The more obvious one is the need for an expectation of what information is to be found in a text in order to be able to infer gaps.",
        "A common attempt at deception in bankruptcy cases, for example, is concealment of pre-bankruptcy conversions of property from creditors, which is a major factor considered by the courts in determining whether there was an intent to hinder, delay or defraud in a bankruptcy.",
        "Thus, if a sale of assets by a company prior to its filing bankruptcy is found in a text and there is no mention of how closely to the filing this conversion took place, this needs to raise a flag that possibly concealment took place.",
        "This can be established since CONCEALMENT is defined as part of the script BANKRUPTCY, which is instantiated for the TMR of the text.",
        "If it can be established, from the text itself or the FR, that the sale of the assets took place while the company was approaching the state of bankruptcy, the omission of the specific time of sale in the report constitutes deception.",
        "Here, the script facilitates the targeting of SF (see previous section) by mapping where omissions in the text point to the omission of crucial information.",
        "The second mechanism by which scripts facilitate DD is when an event that occurs commonly or exclusively as a subevent of a script, which is otherwise not mentioned, is found in a text.",
        "Here, the inference should be that the larger context of this subevent, captured by the script, is to be concealed.",
        "If, for example, a company issues a report that mentions the layoff of some of its employees, this should lead to the inference that it approaches the state of bankruptcy, for which layoffs are a possible subevent.",
        "Simplified to a few subevents, these two DD mechanisms on the basis of scripts can be summarized as follows (cf. figure 8): 1.",
