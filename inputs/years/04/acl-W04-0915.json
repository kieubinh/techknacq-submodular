        "A classical view on text interpretation is to have a syntactic parsing process followed by semantic interpretation derived from syntactic structures (Allen, 1995).",
        "In practice, however, building broad-coverage syntactically-driven parsing grammars that are robust to the variation in the input is a very difficult task.",
        "Sometimes, it may not be relevant to perform a fine-grained analysis of the semantic content of text.",
        "Indeed, there are cases where what should be recognized is the high-level communicative intentions of the author.",
        "Depending on the kind of interpretation that is targeted",
        "from a text, some semantic distinctions need not be recognized.",
        "For example, the two following sentences found in a drug leaflet may not carry significantly different communicative goals in spite of their clear semantic differences:",
        "• Consult your doctor in case of pregnancy before taking this product.",
        "• Consult a health professional in case of pregnancy before taking this product.",
        "We have identified a domain of application, document normalization, where text interpretation can be limited in many cases to the interpretation of a text in terms of the communicative goals it conveys (Max, 2003a).",
        "We have defined document normalization as the process that first derives the normalized communicative content of a text in a constrained domain (e.g. drug leaflets), and then generates the normalized version of the text in the language of the original document.",
        "We considered three levels in a normalization model for documents in constrained domain:",
        "1.",
        "Communicative goals: the communicative goals that can appear in a document in constrained domain belong to a predefined repertoire.",
        "2.",
        "Communicative structure: the communicative structure describes the content of a document in terms of compatible communicative goals, as well as how these communicative goals are organized in a document.",
        "3.",
        "Natural language: the language used should",
        "be as comprehensible as possible.",
        "To this end, every communicative goal should be associated with an expression that could be considered as ”gold standard”.",
        "Figure 1 shows a warning section found in the drug leaflet for a pain reducer.",
        "Manually deriving a normalized version of this document extract using a normalization model requires identifying the communicative goals present in the document, which may be deduced from textual evidence found at different places in the document.",
        "Once identified, these communicative goals must be compared with the normalized ones in the predefined repertoire.",
        "We consider the four following cases:",
        "1.",
        "A communicative goal in the document is clearly identified as belonging to the predefined repertoire.",
        "2.",
        "A communicative goal in the document belongs to the predefined repertoire, but several normalized communicative goals are in competition due to some evidence found in the document.",
        "3.",
        "A communicative goal in the document does not belong to the predefined repertoire, but it is deemed close to a normalized communicative goal.",
        "4.",
        "A communicative goal in the document cannot be matched with any normalized communicative goal.",
        "Once the normalized communicative goals have been identified, the communicative structure can be built (provided there are no incompatibilities) and the corresponding normalized textual version produced.",
        "A possible normalized text corresponding to the input document of figure 1 is given on figure 2.",
        "The very general Warnings section has been split into several subsections.",
        "Communicative goals that were expressed in the same sentence have been isolated and reformulated in separate sentences, as is the case for the communicative goal indicating that the product should not be taken in case of allergy to aspirin.",
        "This communicative goal was found in a complex sentence, Do not take this product if you have asthma, an allergy to aspirin, stomach problems..., and was reformulated as DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG IF YOUARE ALLERGIC TO ASPIRIN in the section about product warnings.",
        "The communicative goal warning about the risk of Reye’s syndrome in children is expressed in a long and complex sentence: Children and teenagers should not use this medicine for chicken pox or flu symptoms before a doctor is consulted about Reye syndrome, a rare but serious illness reported to be associated with aspirin.",
        "Considering the fact that no other communicative goals should be in competition with this one in this class of documents when Reye’s syndrome is involved, its identification can be quite simple.2 In fact, it illustrates the fact that the interpretation of communicative goals within documents in constrained domains may not always require a very fine-grained semantic analysis, and that some indicators can already be quite informative.",
        "However, it is unquestionable that in general identifying communicative goals and comparing them to predefined communicative goals clearly requires high-level interpretation capabilities, which would normally be those of an expert of the domain.",
        "With our application to normalize documents as target, we have proposed an approach to extract the communicative content of documents in constrained domains automatically.",
        "Considering that we wanted to obtain a practical normalization system, we further defined an approach to allow a human expert identifying the correct communicative content of a document from the set of hypotheses produced automatically.",

        "Another type of approach first performs a syntactic analysis of the text, from which semantic dependencies can be extracted.",
        "The system presented in (Brun and Hag`ege, 2003) derives normalized predicates encoding the meaning of documents from semantic dependencies found by a robust parser.",
        "This allows obtaining identical semantic interpretations for paraphrases such as ProductX is a colorless, non flammable liquid and ProductX is a liquid that has no colour and that does not burn easily.",

        "Importantly, the formalism can encode the three levels for a normalization model that we described in our introduction: semantic objects can be of any granularity and can thus be communicative goals; the communicative structure is described by the abstract semantic syntax, which can be used to express semantic dependencies across subtrees; and the text generated is entirely under control, so normalized texts can be associated with communicative goals.",
