        "The understanding and summarization of stories remains a challenge, in part because of the inability to adequately capture the ‘aboutness’ of information content.",
        "This can result in inappropriate content selection as well as summary incoherence.",
        "This talk sketches a general framework for narrative summarization that relies in part on exploitation of temporal information.",
        "I will show how this framework can help address the above problems.",
        "I go on to discuss how different levels of narrative structure can provide useful information for summarization."
