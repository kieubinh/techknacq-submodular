        "Summarization work has focused primarily on the written words in a document.",
        "However, graphics are an important part of many documents, and they often convey information that is not included elsewhere in the document.",
        "Thus as text summarization branches out, it is essential that it consider the summarization of graphical information in documents.",
        "Graph summarization has received some attention.",
        "(Yu et al., 2002) has used pattern recognition techniques to summarize interesting features of automatically generated graphs of time-series data from a gas turbine engine.",
        "(Futrelle and Nikolakis, 1995) developed a constraint grammar formalism for parsing vector-based visual displays and producing structured representations of the elements comprising the display.",
        "The goal of Futrelle’s project is to produce a graphic that summarizes one or more graphics from a document (Futrelle, 1999).",
        "The summary graphic might be a simplification of a graphic or a merger of several graphics from the document, along with an appropriate summary caption.",
        "Thus the end result of summarization will itself be a graphic.",
        "Our project is concerned with information graphics (non-pictorial graphics such as bar charts or line graphs).",
        "Our current focus is on providing an initial summary of an information graphic, within a larger interactive natural language system that can respond to followup questions about the graphic.",
        "There are several useful applications for a system that can summarize information graphics.",
        "For digital libraries, the initial summary of the graphic will be used in conjunction with the document text/summary to provide a more complete representation of the content of the document to be used for searching and indexing.",
        "In the case of environments with low-bandwidth transmission and miniature viewing facilities, such as cellular telephones for accessing the web, the initial summary and followup capability will provide an alternative modality for access to the document.",
        "However, the most compelling application of the overall system is to provide effective access to information graphics for individuals with sight impairments.",
        "The rapidly growing Information Infrastructure has had a major impact on society and the development of technology.",
        "However, the growing reliance on visual information display paradigms obliges society to ensure that individuals with visual impairments can access and assimilate information resources as effectively as their sighted counterparts.",
        "The underlying hypothesis of our work is that alternative access to what the graphic looks like is not enough – the user should be provided with the message and knowledge that one would gain from viewing the graphic in order to enable effective and efficient use of this information resource.",
        "Thus our system will present the user with an initial summary that includes the primary message that the graphic designer intended to convey, augmented with relevant interesting features of the graphic, and then interactively allow the user to access more detailed summaries of information contained in the graphic.",
        "As an example of the kinds of summaries that we envision, consider the information graphic in Figure 1.",
        "The graphic designer’s communicative goal is ostensibly to convey the sharp increase in bankruptcies in 2001 compared with the previous decreasing trend.",
        "More detailed features that might be of interest include 1) that bankruptcies had been decreasing at a steady rate since 1998, 2) that bankruptcies had been decreasing slowly since 1998, 3) the percentage decrease each year, 4) the percentage increase in bankruptcies in 2001, 5) the absolute increase in bankruptcies in 2001, and 6) the total number of bankruptcies in 2001.",
        "Thus the initial summary of this graphic might be This graphic shows that although Delaware bankruptcy personal filings decreased slowly and steadily from 1998 to 2000, they rose sharply in 2001.",
        "Note that the proposed summary includes the hypothesized intended message of the graphic, along with the first two of the additional interesting features of the graphic.",
        "The selection of additional features to augment the summary is discussed further in Section 3.3.",
        "The system would then respond to user requests for additional information by presenting some or all of the other interesting features that had been identified, as discussed in Section 3.4.",
        "This paper provides an overview of our project.",
        "Section 2 discusses the essential role of intention recognition in graphics summarization.",
        "It argues not only that the intended message of the graphic designer must be inferred and included in a summary of a graphic, but also that the intended message significantly influences the additional propositions that should be included in the summary.",
        "Section 3 presents our approach to graph summarization.",
        "It discusses how we use a computer vision module to construct an XML representation that captures the components of the graphic and their relationship to one another, and how we use a Bayesian belief network to hypothesize the intentions of the graph designer.",
        "The paper then discusses our plans for constructing a summary that includes the graphic designer’s intended message along with highly ranked additional propositions, and how the lesser ranked propositions will be used in an interactive natural language system that responds to the user’s requests for further summaries of additional features of the graphic."

        "Text summarization has generally relied on statistical techniques and identification and extraction of key sentences from documents.",

        "Recent work in text summarization has",
        "begun to address this issue.",
        "For example, (Marcu, 2000) presents algorithms for automatically identifying the rhetorical structure of a text and argues that the hypothesized rhetorical structure can be successfully used in text summarization.",
        "Information graphics are an important component of many documents.",
        "In some cases, information graphics are standalone and constitute the entire document.",
        "This is the case for many graphics appearing in newspapers, such as the graphic shown in Figure 1.",
        "On the other hand, when an article is comprised of text and graphics, the graphic generally expands on the text and contributes to the discourse purpose (Grosz and Sidner, 1986) of the arti",
        "cle.",
        "For example, Figure 2 illustrates a graphic from Newsweek showing that the income of black women has risen dramatically over the last decade and has reached the level of white women.",
        "Although this information is not conveyed elsewhere in the article, it contributes to the overall communicative intention of this portion of the article – namely, that there has been a “monumental shifting of the sands” with regard to the achievements of black women.",
        "Our project is concerned with the understanding and summarization of information graphics: bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, etc.",
        "We contend that analyzing the data points underlying an information graphic is insufficient.",
        "One must instead identify the message that the graphic designer intended to convey via the design choices that were made in constructing the graphic.",
        "(Although one might suggest relying on captions to provide the intended message of a graphic, Corio and Lapalme found in a large corpus study (Corio and Lapalme, 1999) that captions are often missing or are very general and uninformative; our collected corpus of information graphics supports their observations.)",
        "Design choices include selection of chart type (bar chart, pie chart, line graph, etc.",
        "), organization of information in the chart (for example, aggregation of bars in a bar chart), and attention-getting devices that highlight certain aspects of a chart (such as coloring one bar of a bar chart different from the others).",
        "Not only should the graphic designer’s intended message comprise the primary component of any summary, but this intended message has a strong influence on the salience of additional propositions that might be included in the summary.",
        "To see the importance of recognizing the graphic designer’s intended message, consider the two graphics in Figure 3.",
        "The one on the left, Figure 3a, appeared in an NSF publication.",
        "Both graphics were constructed from the same data set.",
        "The intended message of the graphic in Figure 3a is that the salary of females is consistently less than that of males for each of the science and engineering dis-ciplines.' Notice that the graphic designer selected an organization for the graphic in Figure 3a that facilitated the comparison between male and female salaries in each field.",
        "A different display of the same data would facilitate different analyses.",
        "For example, the graph in Figure 3b depicts the same data as the graph in Figure 3a, yet the organization tends to draw attention to comparisons within male and female groups rather than between them, 1 This graphic was constructed by a colleague who served on the NSF panel that prepared the report.",
        "Thus we know the intentions underlying the graphic.",
        "and perhaps an integration/comparison of the messages conveyed by the two subgraphs.",
        "Thus the intended message of the graphic in Figure 3b appears to be that the ranking of the disciplines by salary are about the same for both men and women.",
        "The distinctions between presentation formats illustrate the extent to which the format can itself convey information relevant to the graphic designer’s intended message.",
        "Now let us consider how the intended message influences additional information that might be included in a summary.",
        "Suppose that 1) the salary differential between females and males was significantly larger in the life sciences than in other disciplines and 2) the average salary for both females and males was much larger in engineering than in any of the other disciplines.",
        "Feature 1) would be particularly interesting and relevant to the intended message of Figure 3a, and thus should be included as part of the graphic’s summary.",
        "On the other hand, this aspect would be less relevant to the intended message of Figure 3b and thus not as important to include.",
        "Similarly, Feature 2) would be particularly relevant to the intended message of Figure 3b and thus should be given high priority for inclusion in its summary.",
        "Although an interactive system that could analyze a graphic to any desired level of detail might extract from the graphic the information in both 1) and 2) above, we contend that a summary of the graphic should prioritize content according to its relevance to the designer’s intended message."

        "Thus salience and ease of performance should be taken into account in reasoning about the graphic designer’s intentions.",
        "There are several ways that a task can be made salient.",
        "The graphic designer can draw attention to a component of a graphic (make it salient) by an attention-getting or highlighting device, such as by coloring a bar in a bar chart differently from the other bars as in Figure 1 or by exploding a wedge in a pie chart (Mittal, 1997).",

        "In the future, we plan to capture the influence of surrounding text by identifying the important concepts from the text using lexical chains.",
        "Lexical chains have been used in text summarization (Barzilay et al., 1999), and our linear time algorithm (Silber and McCoy, 2002) makes their computation feasible even for large texts.",
        "Whether a task is salient and the method by which it was made salient are used as evidence in our plan inference system.",
        "The graphic design makes some tasks easier than others.",
        "We use a set of rules, based on research by cognitive psychologists, to estimate the relative effort of performing different perceptual and cognitive tasks.",
        "These rules, described in (Elzer et al., 2004), have been validated by eye-tracking experiments.",
        "Since the viewer is intended to recognize the message that the graphic designer wants to convey, we contend that the designer will choose a graphic design that makes the requisite tasks easy to perform.",
        "This was illustrated in the two graphics in",
        "Our plan inference framework takes the form of a Bayesian belief network.",
        "Bayesian belief networks have been applied to a variety of problems, including reasoning about utterances (Charniak and Goldman, 1993) and observed actions (Albrecht et al., 1997).",
        "The belief network uses plan operators, along with evidence that is gleaned from the information graphic itself (as discussed in the preceding section), to reason about the likelihood that various hypothesized candidate plans represent the intentions of the graphic designer.",
        "Plan Operators for Information Graphics Our system uses plan operators that capture knowledge about how the graphic designer’s goal of conveying a message can be achieved via the viewer performing certain perceptual and cognitive tasks, as well as knowledge about how information-access tasks, such as finding the value of an entity in a graphic, can be decomposed into simpler subgoals.",
        "Our plan operators consist of:",
        "• Goal: the goal that the operator achieves • Data-requirements: requirements that the data must satisfy in order for the operator to be applicable in a graphic planning paradigm • Display-constraints: features that constrain how the graphic is eventually constructed if this operator is part of the final plan • Body: lower-level subgoals that must be accomplished in order to achieve the overall goal of the operator.",
        "Figures 4 and 5 present two plan operators for the goal of finding the value <v> of an attribute <att> for a graphical element <e> (for example, the value associated with the top of a bar in a bar chart).",
        "The body of the operator in Figure 4 specifies that the goal can be achieved by a primitive perceptual task in which the viewer just perceives the value; this could be done, for example, if the element in the graphic is annotated with its value.",
        "On the other hand, the body of the operator in Figure 5 captures a different way of finding the value, one that presumably requires more effort.",
        "It specifies the perceptual task of finding the values <l1> and <l2> surrounding the desired value on the axis along with the fraction <f> of the distance that the desired value lies between <l1> and <l2>, followed by the cognitive task of interpolating between the retrieved values <l1> and <l2>.",
        "Plan inference uses the plan operators to reasons backwards from the XML representation of the observed graphic (constructed by the visual extraction module briefly described in Section 3.1).",
        "The display constraints are used to eliminate operators from consideration – if the graphic does not capture the operator’s constraints on the display, then the operator could not have been part of a plan that produced the graphic.",
        "The data requirements are used to instantiate parameters in the operator – the data must have had certain characteristics for the operator to have been included in the graphic designer’s plan, and these often limit how the operator’s arguments can be instantiated.",
        "The Bayesian Belief Network The plan operators are used to dynamically construct a Bayesian network for each new information graphic.",
        "The network includes the possible top level communicative intentions (with uninstantiated parameters), such as the intention to convey a trend, and the alternative ways of achieving them via different plan operators.",
        "The perceptual tasks of lowest effort and the tasks that are hypothesized as potentially salient are added to the network.",
        "Other tasks are entered into the network as they are inferred during chaining on the plan operators; unification serves to instantiate parameters in higher-level nodes.",
        "Evidence nodes are added for each of the tasks entered into the network, and they provide evidence (such as the degree of perceptual effort required for a task or whether a parameter of the task is a focused entity in the graphic as discussed in Section 3.2.",
        "1) for or against the instantiated tasks to which they are linked.",
        "After propagation of evidence, the top-level intention with the highest probability is hypothesized as the graphic designer’s primary intention for the graphic.",
        "Of course, a Bayesian network requires a set of conditional probabilities, such as 1) the probability that perceptual Task-A will be of low, medium, or high effort given that the graphic designer’s plan includes the viewer performing Task-A, 2) the probability that parameter <x> of Task-A will be a fo",
