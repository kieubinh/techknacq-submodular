        "Research in summarization was one of the first efforts to use computers to “understand” language.",

        "The interest in automatic summarization of text has continued, and currently is enjoying increased emphasis as demonstrated by the numerous summarization workshops held during the last five years.",
        "The DUC summarization evaluations (2001 – 2004)(http : / /duc .",

        "DUC has been guided by a roadmap developed by members of the summarization research community.",
        "Along with the research has come efforts to evaluate automatic summarization performance.",
        "Two major types of evaluation have been used: extrinsic evaluation, where one measures indirectly how well the summary performs by measuring performance in a task putatively dependent on the quality of the summary, and intrinsic evaluation, where one measures the quality of the created summary directly.",
        "Extrinsic evaluation requires the selection of a task that could use summarization and measurement of the effect of using automatic summaries instead of the original text.",
        "Critical issues here are the selection of a real task and the metrics that will be sensitive to differences in the quality of the summaries.",
        "This paper concerns itself with intrinsic evaluations.",
        "Intrinsic evaluation requires some standard or model against which to judge summarization quality and usually this standard is operationalized by finding an existing abstract/text data set or by having humans create model summaries (Jing et al., 1998).",
        "Intrinsic evaluations have taken two main forms: manual, in which one or more people evaluate the system-produced summary and automatic, in which the summary is evaluated without the human in the loop.",
        "But both types involve human judgments of some sort and with them their inherent variability.",
        "Humans vary in what material they choose to include in a summary and in how they express the content.",
        "Humans judgments of summary quality vary from one person to another and across time for one person.",

        "Since the roadmap specified testing in DUC-2001 of both single and multi-document summarization, the data sets and tasks were designed as follows.",
        "Sixty sets of approximately 10 documents each were provided as system input for this task.",
        "Given such a set of documents, the systems were to automatically create a 100-word generic summary for each document.",
        "Additionally they were to create a generic summary of the entire set, one summary at each of four target lengths (approximately 400, 200,",
        "100, and 50 words).",
        "The sets of documents were assembled at NIST by 10 retired information analysts.",
        "Each person selected six document sets, and then created a 100- word manual abstract for each document, and for the entire document set at the 400, 200, 100 and 50 word lengths.",
        "Thirty of the sets (documents and manual abstracts) were distributed as training data and the remaining thirty sets of documents (without abstracts) were distributed as test data.",
        "Fifteen groups participated in DUC-2001, with 11 of them doing single document summarization and 12 of them doing the multi-document task.",
        "The evaluation plan as specified in the roadmap was for NIST to concentrate on manual comparison of the system results with the manually-constructed abstracts.",
        "To this end a new tool was developed by Chin-Yew Lin at the Information Sciences Institute, University of Southern California (http : //www.isi.edu/˜cyl/SEE/).",
        "This tool allows a summary to be rated in isolation as well as compared to another summary for content overlap.",
        "Figure 1 shows one example of this interface.",
        "Human evaluation was done at NIST using the same personnel who created the manual abstracts (called model summaries).",
        "One type of evaluation supported by SEE was coverage, i.e., how well did the peer summaries (i.e., those being evaluated) cover the content of the documents (as expressed by the model summary).",
        "A pairwise summary comparison was used in this part of the evaluation and judges were asked to do detailed coverage comparisons.",
        "SEE allowed the judges to step through predefined units of the model summary (elementary discourse units/EDUs) (Sori-cut and Marcu, 2003) and for each unit of that summary, mark the sentences in the peer summary that expressed [all(4), most(3), some(2), hardly any(1) or none(0)] of the content in the current model summary unit.",
        "The resulting ordered category scale[04] is treated as an interval scale in the coverage score based on feedback from the judges on how it was used.",
        "The coverage score for a given peer summary is the mean of its scores against the EDUs of the associated model ( – 4 EDUs per summary for the 50-word model summaries).",
        "This process is much more complex than doing a simple overall comparison using the entire summary but past evaluation experiences indicated that judges had more difficulty making an overall decision than they did making decisions at each EDU."

        "This is similar to what is seen in relevance assessment for IR evaluations.",
        "To the extent that different judges are consistently more lenient or strict, this problem has been handled in DUC by having the same judge look at all summaries for a given document set so that all peer summaries are affected equally and by having enough document sets to allow averaging over judges to mitigate the effect of very strict or very lenient judges.",
        "If a judge’s leniency varies inconsistently in a way dependent on which system is being judged (i.e., if there is an interaction between the judge and the system), then other strategies are needed.",

        "Summarization has a second source of disagreement and that is the model summaries themselves.",
        "People write models that vary not only in writing style, but also in focus, i.e., what is important to summarize in a document or document set.",
        "To shed light on variability in creation of models and their use, each of the 30 document sets in the test set (plus the 300 individual documents) were summarized independently by three summarizers - the one who had selected the documents plus two others.",
        "These extra summaries were used as additional peer human summaries in the main evaluation and also in a special study of the model effects on evaluation.",
