        "Email for many users has evolved from a mere communication system to a means of organizing workflow, storing information and tracking tasks (i.e. “to do” items) (Bellotti et al., 2003; Cadiz et al., 2001).",
        "Tools available in email clients for managing this information are often cumbersome or even so difficult to discover that users are not aware that the functionality exists.",
        "For example, in one email client, Microsoft Outlook, a user must switch views and fill in a form in order to create a task corresponding to the current email message.",
        "By automatically identifying tasks that occur in the body of an email message, we hope to simplify the use of email as a tool for task creation and management.",
        "In this paper we describe SmartMail, a prototype system that automatically identifies tasks in email, reformulates them, and presents them to the user in a convenient interface to facilitate adding them to a “to do” list.",
        "SmartMail performs a superficial analysis of an email message to distinguish the header, message body (containing the new message content), and forwarded sections.1 SmartMail breaks the",
        "message body into sentences, then determines the speech act of each sentence in the message body by consulting a machine-learned classifier.",
        "If the sentence is classified as a task, SmartMail performs additional linguistic processing to reformulate the sentence as a task description.",
        "This task description is then presented to the user."

        "We collected a corpus of 15,741 email messages.",
        "The messages were divided into training, development test and blind test.",
        "The training set contained 106,700 sentences in message bodies from 14,535 messages.",
        "To avoid overtraining to individual writing styles, we limited the number of messages from a given sender to 50.",
        "To ensure that our evaluations are indicative of performance on messages from previously unencountered senders, we selected messages from 3,098 senders, assigning all messages from a given sender to either the training or the test sets.",
        "Three human annotators labeled the message body sentences, selecting one tag from the following set: Salutation, Chitchat (i.e., social discussion unrelated to the main purpose of the message), Task, Meeting (i.e., a proposal to meet), Promise, Farewell, various components of an email signature (Sig_Name, Sig_Title, Sig_Affiliation, Sig_Location, Sig_Phone, Sig_Email, Sig_URL, Sig_Other), and the default category “None of the above”.",
        "The set of tags can be considered a set of application-specific speech acts analogous to the rather particular tags used in the Verbmobil project, such as “Suggest_exclude_date” and uncommon in our corpus.",
        "Most senders were using Microsoft Outlook, which places the insertion point for new content at the top of the message.",
        "“Motivate_appointment” (Warnke et al., 1997; Mast et al., 1996) or the form-based tags of Stolcke et al.",
        "(1998).",
        "All three annotators independently labeled sentences in a separate set of 146 messages not included in the training, development or blind test sets.",
        "We measured inter-annotator agreement for the assignment of tags to sentences in the message bodies using Cohen’s Kappa.",
        "Annotator 1 and annotator 2 measured 85.8%; annotator 1 and annotator 3 measured 82.6%; annotator 2 and annotator 3 measured 82.3%.",
        "We consider this level of inter-annotator agreement good for a novel set of application-specific tags.",
        "The development test and blind test sets of messages were tagged by all three annotators, and the majority tag for each sentence was taken.",
        "If any sentence did not have a majority tag, the entire message was discarded, leaving a total of 507 messages in the development test set and 699 messages in the blind test set.",
        "The set of tags was intended for a series of related experiments concerning linguistic processing of email.",
        "For example, greetings and chitchat could be omitted from messages displayed on cell phones, or the components of an email signature could be extracted and stored in a contact database.",
        "In the current paper we focus exclusively on the identification of tasks.",
        "Annotators were instructed to mark a sentence as containing a task if it looked like an appropriate item to add to an ongoing “to do” list.",
        "By this criterion, simple factual questions would not usually be annotated as tasks; merely responding with an answer fulfills any obligation.",
        "Annotators were instructed to consider the context of an entire message when deciding whether formulaic endings to email such as Let me know if you have any questions were to be interpreted as mere social convention or as actual requests for review and comment.",
        "The following are examples of actual sentences annotated as tasks in our data: Since Max uses a pseudo-random number generator, you could possibly generate the same sequence of numbers to select the same cases.",
        "Sorry, yes, you would have to retrain.",
        "An even fast [sic] thing would be to assign your own ID as a categorical feature.",
        "Michael, it’d be great if you could add some stuff re MSRDPS.",
        "Could you please remote desktop in and try running it on my machine.",

      "text": [
        "Each sentence in the message body is described by a vector of approximately 53,000 features.",
        "The features are of three types: properties of the message (such as the number of addressees, the total size of the message, and the number of forwarded sections in the email thread), superficial features and linguistic features.",
        "The superficial features include word unigrams, bigrams and trigrams as well as counts of special punctuation symbols (e.g. @, /, #), whether the sentence contains words with so-called “camel caps” (e.g., SmartMail), whether the sentence appears to contain the sender’s name or initials, and whether the sentence contains one of the addressees’ names.",
        "The linguistic features were obtained by analyzing the given sentence using the NLPWin system (Heidorn 2000).",
        "The linguistic features include abstract lexical features, such as part-of-speech bigrams and trigrams, and structural features that characterize the constituent structure in the form of context-free phrase structure rewrites (e.g., DECL:NP-VERB-NP; i.e., a declarative sentence consisting of a noun phrase followed by a verb and another noun phrase).",
        "Deeper linguistic analysis yielded features that describe part-of-speech information coupled with grammatical relations (e.g., Verb-Subject-Noun indicating a nominal subject of a verb) and features of the logical form analysis such as transitivity, tense and mood."

        "We trained support vector machines (SVMs) (Vapnik, 1995) using an implementation of the sequential minimal optimization algorithm (Platt, 1999).",
        "We trained linear SVMs, which have proven effective in text categorization with large feature vectors (Joachims, 1998; Dumais et al., 1998).",
        "Figure 1 illustrates the precision-recall curve for the SVM classifier trained to distinguish tasks vs. non-tasks measured on the blind test set.",
        "We conducted feature ablation experiments on the development test set to assess the contribution of categories of features to overall classification performance.",
        "In particular we were interested in the role of linguistic analysis features compared to using only surface features.",
        "Within the linguistic features, we distinguished deep linguistic features (phrase structure features and semantic features) from POS n-gram features.",
        "We conducted experiments with three feature sets:",
        "1. all features (message level features + word unigram, bigram and trigram 2. features + POS bigram and trigram features + linguistic analysis features) 3. no deep linguistic features (no phrase structure or semantic features) 4. no linguistic features at all (no deep linguistic features and no POS n gram features)",
        "Based on these experiments on the development test set, we chose the feature set used for our runtime applications.",
        "Figure 1 shows final results for these feature sets on the blind test set: for recall between approximately 0.2 and 0.4 and between approximately 0.5 and 0.6 the use of all features produces the best results.",
        "The distinction between the “no linguistic features” and “no deep linguistic features” scenarios is negligible; word n-grams appear to be highly predictive.",
        "Based on these results, we expect that for languages where we do not have an NLPWin parser, we can safely exclude the deeper linguistic features and still expect good classifier performance.",
        "Figure 2 illustrates the accuracy of distinguishing messages that contain tasks from those that do not, using all features.",
        "A message was marked as containing a task if it contained at least one sentence classified as a task.",
        "Since only one task has to be found in order for the entire message to be classified as containing a task, accuracy is substantially higher than on a per-sentence basis.",
        "In section 6, we discuss the scenarios motivating the distinction between sentence classification and message classification."
