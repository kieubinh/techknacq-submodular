        "In this paper, we present algorithms to address the shortcomings of both purely structural and purely statistical methods of sentence extraction summarization.",
        "We present the PALSUMM hybrid summarization algorithms that use structural methods based on discourse parsing to construct a representation of the text, apply conventional statistical methods to identify salient information (See discussion and references in Marcu 2003) and then construct a partial discourse tree that includes the information identified as most salient along with the text at all nodes dominating that salient information.",
        "Optionally, sentence compression techniques are applied to the resulting summary to further compress text length (Grefenstette, 1998; Knight and Marcu, 2002).",
        "The novelty of our approach lies in combining text structural methods with sentence extraction methods which evaluate relevance on the basis of external factors such as lexical frequency or lexical field information in the specific document, in related or documents in general or, alternatively by matching lexical items in a query against lexical items in a document.",
        "The sentences selected by the external oracle are then providing context for anaphora resolution and reference interpretation through inclusion of hierarchically superordinate information from the structural tree."

        "PALSUMM summarization algorithms operate on data structures generated by FX Palo Alto’s Linguistic Discourse Analysis System (LIDAS).",
        "LIDAS is a computational discourse parser implementing the Unified Linguistic Discourse Model (U-LDM).",
        "A description of the LIDAS system and the U LDM as well as a summary of an article from the New Yorker are described in earlier work (Polanyi et al., 2004a, b, Thione 2004).",
        "Due to space limitations we can only sketch the main points of the system here.",
        "The LIDAS parser itself is purely symbolic.",
        "It parses a text discourse segment by discourse segment to construct a tree that captures discourse continuity and accessibility relations between the segments.",
        "The tree identifies what discourse constituents are available for further development and what information given by discourse constituents is available to be referred to.",
        "We use the fact that the resulting tree encodes (semantic) accessibility relations between the segments, and not rhetorical relations, to guarantee that the pruning algorithm used to summarize preserve antecedents for ana-phors thus fostering readability.",
        "The basic units of this theory (Basic Discourse Unit or BDUs) are the syntactic reflexes of linguistically realized minimal semantic unit of meaning1 or functions, interpreted relative to the context given by the preceding discourse.",
        "To identify the BDUs in a text, LIDAS relies on the Xerox Linguistic Environment to parse sentences from a text (Maxwell and Kaplan, 1989).",
        "After sentential parsing is complete, the XLE sentence parse trees are segmented into BDUs using a set of robust sentence and discourse level rules described in detail in Polanyi et al. 2004a, b.",
        "After parsing, BDUs (which need not be contiguous) are recombined into one or more discourse trees corresponding to (parts of) the sentence, called BDUtrees.",
        "For each BDU-tree, one BDU, normally the main clause of a sentence or a compound unit of discourse directly derived from it, is designated as the Main-BDU (M-BDU) and is represented by the root node of the BDU-tree.",
        "The entire BDU-tree is attached as a unit to the emerging Open Right Tree representation of the structure of the discourse by relating syntactic, semantic and lexical information in the M-BDU (and preposed adverbial modifiers, clauses and “cue” words) to information available in nodes along the right edge of the tree using formal linguistic discourse attachment rules involving relationships among semantic, syntactic and lexical information to compute both the site of attachment and the attachment relation.",
        "Although a full discussion of these rules lies beyond the scope of this paper, Table 1 sketches some simple principles which are both language and domain independent.",
        "These rules are weighted and ordered in application, and multiple rules may “vote” for the same or different attachment points and discourse relations.",
        "The precise relationships among the rules remains a subject for future research.",
        "The U-LDM is similar in form to RST, but its primitives are rather different.",
        "Whereas RST takes rhetorical relations as primitives, the LDM takes its primitives from syntactic structure.",
        "The ontology of LDM relations has three top relations: coordination, subordination and nary.",
        "1 We understand a minimum unit of Meaning to communicate information about not more than one “event” or state of affairs in a “possible world” of some type (roughly event-type predicates); while a minimal Functional unit encodes information about how previously occurring (or possibly subsequent) utterances relate structurally, semantically, interactionally or rhetorically to other units in the discourse or context in which the discourse takes place (Greetings, discourse PUSH/POP markers, connectives etc.",
        "are all Functional segments).",
        "2 One reviewer remarked, quite correctly: “how a sentence is attached to the emerging representation of the structure of the discourse ... is the heart of the algorithm”.",
        "This issue is discussed in detail in Polanyi et al., 2004a,b ; Thione et al.",
        "2004.",
        "Evidence attachment is a subordination Syntactic promotion: If the subject of an M-BDU co-refers with the object of the AP.",
        "Sub-cases: If the subject of the M-BDU refers to a sub-case of the subject of the AP.",
        "Sub-cases include subsets (all children/some children), subtypes (people/children), etc.",
        "Verbal properties: If the tense, aspect, modality or genericity of the verbs are different.",
        "Evidence attachment is a coordination Narrative: If the verbs express events.",
        "Lists: If the subjects are synonyms/antonyms and/or the syntactic structures of M-BDU and AP are sufficiently similar.",
        "Coordinations express a symmetric relationship between the children, including: lists, narratives, etc.",
        "Subordinations express an asymmetric relationship between children, including: elaborations, interruptions, etc.",
        "Finally, n-aries include a number of cases where the structure is defined by specific language constructions.",
        "Note that these constructions are not arbitrary, and often follow from (sentence) syntactic constructions.",
        "Examples include scope setting operators and units (when john comes, he will be happy), and more or less fixed forms like greetings and question-answer pairs, etc.",
        "It is the practice to also consider genre-specific structures (e.g. “a paper consists of a title, an abstract, an introduction, some sections, a conclusion, and references”) to be n-aries.",
        "Because to characterize the large structure of the discourse we only need to refer to coordina-tions, subordinations and n-aries, it is often claimed that the number of relations in the LDM is much smaller than in RST, even though strictly speaking this depends on which versions of LDM and RST one compares.",
        "The real difference between the two theories lies in the rather different origins of the rules.",
        "All non-terminal nodes in U-LDM trees are first class citizens and contain, in addition to a node label, content and context information inherited from child nodes.",
        "Under RST only terminal nodes have content; non-terminal nodes that represent the relationships obtaining among spans of the text longer than one sentence are labeled for the relationship between daughter nodes only.",
        "As in Summarist (Hovy and Lin, 1999), once the source text has been parsed and a discourse tree incrementally constructed, text summarization algorithms are applied to the resulting tree.",
        "However, the difference between constructing a semantic rather than a rhetorical representation of the text accounts for how PALSUMM summaries preserve readability and reference resolution: because the entire analysis involves matching semantically defined contextual units to the appropriate contexts available on the tree, nodes that structurally dominate other nodes necessarily contain the information needed to contextually interpret the dominated units."
