        "Automated text summarization has at its disposal, electronic documents that allow the use of all the techniques of computational linguistics.",
        "Diagrams in documents are in a more primitive state.",
        "The overwhelming majority of diagrams available in the electronic forms of the research literature today are in raster format.",
        "What is needed are diagrams in vector format in which an object such as a line is represented not by pixels, but as a line object defined by its endpoints and width.",
        "We found only 52 pages containing vector-based diagrams in a collection of 20,000 recent Biology papers in PDF format (Futrelle, Shao, Cieslik, & Grimes, 2003).",
        "Vectorization converts raster diagrams to vector format, much as OCR converts rasters to characters.",
        "But the resulting vectorized diagram is an unordered collection of objects in a two dimensional space.",
        "An additional analysis step of parsing is required.",
        "Our system for parsing diagrams (Futrelle & Nikolakis, 1995) produces descriptions for a data graph, for example, by discovering structures such as scale lines and sets of data points.",
        "There appear to be no non-proprietary vectorization systems that are up to the task of vectorizing the diagrams from the scientific literature, so our group is currently focused on developing a system for this in Java.",
        "We are also redeveloping our parsing system in Java.",
        "Until this work is completed, there will be few diagrams available for the application of diagram summarization techniques.",
        "This notwithstanding, diagram summarization is an interesting and ultimately important task, which is why we are discussing it here.",
        "This work is part of our laboratory's long-term effort to characterize the conceptual content of the Biology literature, including the text and figural content."

        "But any more detailed summarization decisions would require parsed representations of the diagrams.",
        "For example, our parser can discover and analyze the two bar charts in Fig. 3, allowing a system to extract only one of them, though without any knowledge as to which is the most salient.",
        "The parser can also locate keys, such as the ones in Fig. 3, so they can be extracted also.",
        "Standard strategies from text summarization, such as extracting the diagrams most often referred to, diagrams appearing near the beginning and end of a paper, etc., are all possible.",

        "The generation of coordinated explanations involving text and graphics offers insight into the relations between them (Feiner & McKeown, 1990).",
        "This task involves dealing with the internal structure of diagrams, as do problems of image retrieval, which can be aided by developing ontology-based descriptions of the images (Hyvönen, Styrman, & Saarela, 2002).",
        "Diagrams form a part of a coordinated discourse, so that diagram summarization can profit from the work done on text summarization that focuses on discourse structure.",
        "Examples of discourse-related approaches include (Boguraev & Neff, 2000; Marcu, 1997a, 1997b; Teufel & Moens, 2002)."
