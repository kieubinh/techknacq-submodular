        "Document summarization has been the focus of many researchers for the last decade, due to the increase in on-line information and the need to find the most important information in a (set of) document(s).",
        "One of the biggest challenges in text summarization research is how to evaluate the quality of a summary or the performance of a summarization tool.",
        "There are different approaches to evaluate overall quality of a summarization system.",
        "In general, there are two types of evaluation categories: intrinsic and extrinsic (Sparck- Jones and Galliers, 1996).",
        "Extrinsic approaches measure the quality of a summary based on how it affects certain tasks.",
        "In intrinsic approaches, the quality of the summarization is evaluated based on analysis of the content of a summary itself.",
        "In both categories human involvement is used to judge the summarization outputs.",
        "The problem with having humans involved in evaluating summaries is that we can not hire human judges every time we want to evaluate summaries (Mani and Maybury, 1999).",
        "In this paper, we discuss a new automated way to evaluate machine-generated summaries without the need to have human judges being involved which decreases the cost of determining which summarization system is best.",

        "Recall, on the other hand, measures the percent of sentences in the ideal summary that have been recalled in the summary.",
        "Even though sentence precision/recall factors can give us an idea about a summary’s quality, they are not the best metrics to evaluate a system’s quality.",
        "This is due to the fact that a small change in the output summary can dramatically affect the quality of a summary (Jing et al., 1998).",
        "For example, it is possible that a system will pick a sentence that does not match with a model sentence chosen by an assessor, but is equivalent to it in meaning.",
        "This, of course, will affect the score assigned to the system dramatic ally.",

        "They achieved their best results by giving more credit to longer n-gram matches with the use of Porter stemmer.",
        "A problem raised in the evaluation approaches that use the cosine measure is that the summaries may use different key terms than those in the original documents or model summaries.",

        "This is done by penalizing the summary less in the reduced dimension model when there are infrequent terms synonymous to frequent terms.",

        "Notice that the F-factors obtained by experiments using DGs are higher than those calculated based on sentence matching.",
