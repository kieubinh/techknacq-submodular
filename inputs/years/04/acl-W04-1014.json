        "Several projects on text summarization have been carried out.",
        "1 In these project, text summarization has so far focused on summarizing single documents through sentence extraction.",
        "Recently, summarizing multiple documents with the same topic has been made a target.",
        "The major approach to extracting sentences that have significant information is statistical, i.e., supervised learning from parallel corpora consisting of original texts and their summarization (Kupiec et",
        "al., 1995) (Aone et al., 1998) (Mani and Bloedorn, 1998).",
        "Several summarization techniques for multimedia including image, speech, and text have been researched.",
        "Manually transcribed newswire speech (TDT data) and meeting speech (Zechner, 2003) have been set as summarization targets.",
        "The need to automatically generate summaries from speech has led to research on summarizing transcription results obtained by automatic speech recognition instead of manually transcribed speech (Hori and Furui, 2000a).",
        "This summarization approach is word extraction (sentence compaction) that attempts to extract significant information, exclude acoustically and linguistically unreliable words, and maintain the meanings of the original speech.",
        "The summarization approaches that have been mainly researched so far are extracting sentences or words from original text or transcribed speech.",
        "There has also been research on generating an “abstract” like the much higher level summarization composed freely by human experts (Jing, 2002).",
        "This approach includes not only extracting sentences but also combining sentences to generate new sentences, replacing words, reconstructing syntactic structure, and so on."

        "Metrics that can be used to accurately evaluate the various appropriateness to summarization are needed.The simplest and probably the ideal way of evaluating automatic summarization is to have human subjects read the summaries and evaluate them in terms of the appropriateness of summarization.",
        "However, this type of evaluation is too expensive for comparing the efficiencies of many different approaches precisely and repeatedly.",
        "We thus need automatic evaluation metrics to numerically validate the efficiency of various approaches repeatedly and consistently.",
        "Automatic summaries can be evaluated by comparing them with manual summaries generated by humans.",

        "To create correct answers for automatic summarization, humans generate manual summaries through sentence or word extraction.",
        "However, references consisting of manual summaries vary among humans.",
        "The problems in validating automatic summaries by comparing them with various references are as follows:",
        "• correct answers for automatic results cannot be unified because of subjective variation, • the coverage of correct answers in the collected manual summaries is unknown, and • the reliability of references in the collected manual summaries is not always guaranteed.",
        "When the similarity between automatic results and references is used for the evaluation metrics, the similarity determination function counts overlapping of each component or sequence of components in the automatic results.",
        "If concatenations between components in a summary had no meaning, the overlap of a single component between the automatic results and the references can represent the extent of summarization.",
        "However, concatenations between sentences or words have meanings, so some concatenations of sentences or words in the automatic summaries sometimes generate meanings different from the original.",
        "The evaluation metrics for summarization should thus consider each concatenation between components in the automatic results.",
        "To evaluate sentence automatically generated with taking consideration word concatenation into by using references varied among humans, various metrics using n-gram precision and word accuracy have been proposed: word string precision (Hori and Furui, 2000b) for summarization through word extraction, ROUGE (Lin and Hovy, 2003) for abstracts, and BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) for machine translation.",
        "Evaluation metrics based on word accuracy, summarization accuracy (SumACCY), using a word network made by merging manual summaries has been proposed (Hori and Furui, 2001).",
        "In addition, to solve the problems for the coverage of correct answers and the reliability of manual summaries as correct answers, weighted summarization accuracy (WSumACCY) in which SumACCY is weighted by the majority of the humans’ selections, has been proposed (Hori and Furui, 2003a).",
        "In contrast, summarization through sentence extraction has been evaluated using only single sentence precision.",
        "Sentence extraction should also be evaluated using measures that take into account sentence concatenations, the coverage of correct answers, and the reliability of manual summaries.",
