      "text": [
        "The practices of automatic summarization vary widely across many dimensions, including source length, summary length, style, source, topic, language, and structure.",
        "Most typical are summaries of a single news document down to a headline or short summary, or of a collection of news documents down to a headline or short summary (Hahn and Harman, 2002).",
        "A few researchers have focused on other aspects of summarization, including single sentence (Knight and Marcu, 2002), paragraph or short document (Daum´e III and Marcu, 2002), query-focused (Berger and Mittal, 2000), or speech (Hori et al., 2003).",
        "The techniques relevant to, and the challenges faced in each of these tasks can be quite different.",
        "Nevertheless, they all rely on one critical assumption: there exists a notion of (relative) importance between pieces of information in a document (or utterance), regardless of whether we can detect this or not.",
        "Indeed, recent research has looked at this question in detail, and can be rather cleanly divided into two partitions.",
        "The first partition aims to develop manual evaluation criteria for determining the quality of a summary, and is typified by the extensive research done in single-document summarization by Halteren and Teufel (2003) and by the evaluation strategy proposed by Nenkova and Passonneau (2004).",
        "The other half aims to develop automatic evaluation criteria to imitate the manual evaluation methods (or at least to complement them).",
        "Work in this area includes that of Lin and Hovy (2003) and Pastra and Saggion (2003), both of whom inspect the use of Bleu-like metrics (Papineni et al., 2002) in summarization.",
        "The results of these investigations have been mixed.",
        "In the DUC competitions (Hahn and Harman, 2002), when manual evaluation has been employed, it has been commonly observed that human-written summaries grossly outscore any machine-produced summary.",
        "All machine-produced summaries tend to show little (statistically significant) difference from one another.",
        "Moreover, a baseline system that simply takes the first sentences of a document performs just as well or better than intelligently crafted systems when summarizing news stories.",
        "Additionally, studies of vast numbers of summaries of the same document (Halteren and Teufel, 2003) have shown that there is little agreement among different humans as to what information belongs in a single document summary.",
        "This has been leveraged by Nenkova and Passonneau (2004) to produce a manual scoring method for summaries, though the fact that humans show so little agreement in this task is somewhat disheartening.",
        "All of these evaluations rely strongly on the issue of multiple references, in order to achieve consensus.",
        "Opinions voiced at DUC meetings indicate that different researchers attribute this apparent lack of agreement to one (or more) of many factors (in addition, see (Mani and Maybury, 1999)).",
        "Many believe that the fact that we are typically working in a news genre is to blame, though this complaint tends to be directed more at the excellent performance of the baseline than at the issue of human agreement.",
        "Others believe that in order to observe more agreement, one needs to move to query-focused summaries; it seems reasonable that if the person writing the summary knew how it would be used, he would be more guided in what information to retain.",
        "Yet others attribute the lack of agreement sim",
        "ply to the vast space of possible choices a summarizer could make, and see the disagreement simply as par for the course."

        "We would like to show that this task is well-defined: if we show many humans the same two sentences, they will produce similar summaries.",
        "Of course we do not penalize one human for using different words than another.",
        "The sentence fusion task is interesting after performing sentence extraction, the extracted sentences often contain superfluous information.",
        "It has been further observed that simply compressing sentences individually and concatenating the results leads to suboptimal summaries (Daum´e III and Marcu, 2002).",
        "The use of sentence fusion in multi-document summarization has been extensively explored by Barzilay in her thesis (Barzilay, 2003; Barzilay et al., 1999), though in the multi-document setting, one has redundancy to fall back on.",
        "Additionally, the sentence fusion task is sufficiently constrained that it makes possible more complex and linguistically motivated manipulations than are reasonable for full document or multi-document summaries (and for which simple extraction techniques are unlikely to suffice)."

        "Based on these alignments (be they manually created or automatically created), we are able to look for examples of sentence fusions within the data.",
        "In particular, we search for sentences in the abstracts which are aligned to exactly two document sentences, for which at least 80% of the summary sentence is aligned and for which at least 20% of the words in the summary sentence come from each of the two document sentences.",

        "This can be attributed either to the lack of context available to the non-experts, or to their respective lack of expertise.",
        "Regardless, the level of agreement between such non-expert humans is so low that this matters little.",

        "Second, the LONGER baseline outperforms the reference summary.",
        "As before, we can explain this first discrepancy by the issue of grammaticality.",

        "As we have observed, this act is very imprecise, and it is likely the people performing the evaluation have recognized this.",
        "Since there is no longer a clear cut distinction between important and unimportant information, and since they are required to make a decision, they have no choice but to fall back on grammaticality as the primary motivating factor for their decisions.",

        "However, we have calculated the results separately for pairs derived from human alignments and from automatic alignments, and observe no differences.",

        "First, the original summary is created by a trained human professional, who is very familiar with the domain (while our elicited data comes from technologically proficient adults, the topics discussed in the data are typically about technical systems from the late eighties, topics our summarizers know very little about).",
        "Second, the original summarizers had the rest of the document available when creating these fusions.",
        "Though without performing relevant experiments, it is impossible to say what the results would be.",
        "However, from a system-building perspective, one can view fusion in many applications and it is highly desirable to be able to perform such fusions without knowing the rest of the document.",
        "From a document summarization perspective, one might wish to perform sentence extraction to reduce the document to a few sentences and then use sentence fusion to compress these further.",
        "In this case, the primary motivation for performing this in a pipelined fashion would be to remove the complexity of dealing with the entire document when the more complex fusion models are applied.",
        "In another possible application of question answering, one can imagine answering a question by fusion together several sentences returned as the result of an information retrieval engine.",

        "However, one of the goals of this methodology for automatically extracting pairs of sentences from automatically aligned corpora is to be able to get data on which to train and test a system without having humans write it.",
        "To require one to elicit multiple references to obtain any agreement obviates this goal (moreover, that agreement between humans and the original summary sentence is even lower than between a pair of humans makes this practice questionable).",
        "Regarding context, it is reasonable to hypothesize (though this would need to be verified) that the addition of context would result in higher kappa scores.",
        "Unfortunately, if a human is given access to this information, it would only be fair to give a system access to the same information.",
        "This means that we would no longer be able to view generic sentence fusion as an isolated task, making fusion-specific research advances very difficult."
