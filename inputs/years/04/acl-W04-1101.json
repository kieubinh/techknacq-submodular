        "In addition, the work for clause segmentation is also rather different compared with other languages.",
        "However, in written Chinese, the comma is used more frequently (Lin, 2000).",
        "In English, the average use of comma per sentence is 0.869 (Jones, 1996a)1 – 1.04(Hill, 1996), and in Chinese it is 1.792, which is one and a half to two more times as it is used in English.",
        "In Korean, the comma is used even less than it is in English (Lin, 2000).",
        "Since Chinese has less morphology and no case marker, and the comma is frequently used, the comma becomes an important cue for long Chinese sentence parsing.",
        "Because more commas may appear in longer sentences, the necessity of analyzing the comma also increases.",
        "Some handbooks about standard Chinese grammars list ten to twenty uses of the comma, according to the context.",
        "Among these uses, is occurrence at the end of a clause3 in a sentence (Lin, 2000).",
        "About 30% of commas are used to separate the clause from its main sentence or neighbor clause(s).",
        "If the comma appears at the end of a clause, the position can naturally be set as the clause segmentation point.",
