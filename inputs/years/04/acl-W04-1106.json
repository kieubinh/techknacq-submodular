        "Sense tagging is an important task in NLP.",
        "It is supposed to provide semantic information useful to the application tasks like IR and MT.",
        "As generally acknowledged, sense tagging is to assign a certain sense to a word in a certain context by using a semantic lexicon (Yarowsky, 1992, Wilks and Stevenson, 1997).",
        "In addition to word sense disambiguation (WSD) for known words, sense determination for words unknown to the lexicon poses another challenge in sense tagging.",
        "This is especially the case in NLP of Chinese, a language rich in compound words.",
        "According to the data in (Chen and Lin, 2000), about 5.51% of unknown words is encountered in their sense-tagging task of Chinese corpus.",
        "Instead of proper names, the cross-linguistically most common type of unknown words, compound words constitute the majority of unknown words in Chinese text.",
        "According to Chen and Chen (2000), the three most dominant types of Chinese unknown words are: compound nouns (about 51%), compound verbs (about 34%), and proper names (about 15%).",
        "While the identification and classification of proper names is an issue already well discussed in Chinese NLP researches, the sense determination of unknown compounds remains a subject relatively less tackled."

      "text": [
        "While word sense might be conceptually vague and controversial in linguistics and difficult to define (Manning and Schütze, 1999), sense tag is more concrete and can be defined according to the specific need of the NLP tasks in question.",
        "For example, in a task of semantic tagging or classification, sense tag can be the semantic class from a thesaurus.",
        "Or otherwise, in a task of machine translation, the equivalent foreign word from a bilingual dictionary can be chosen as sense tag.",
        "In this paper, it is the sense tag so defined that is meant by the term sense.",
        "The notion sense determination then refers to the assignment of sense tag to a word without using contextual information.",
        "It is so called to be distinguished from sense tagging, which requires contextual information.",
        "Under such a definition, semantic classification can be regarded as a case of sense determination using the taxonomy of a certain thesaurus, in which a semantic class is a sense tag.",
        "According to Wilks and Stevenson (1997), a task assigning broad sense tags like HUMAN, ANIMATE in WordNet is referred to as semantic tagging, different from sense tagging, which assigns more particular sense tags.",
        "In fact, a similar distinction can also be made for semantic classification according to the target level of the semantic classes in the taxonomy tree: a task aiming at the top-level classes can be called shallow semantic classification (like Lua, 1997), while a task aiming at the bottom-level classes can be called a deep semantic classification1 (like Chen and Chen, 2000).",
        "Since many top-level semantic classes, like TIME, SPACE, QUALITY, ACTION, etc., are often already reflected in the syntactic information, a shallow semantic classification does not actually provide much semantic information independent of syntactic tagging.",
        "It is therefore the deep semantic classification that the paper is concerned about."

        "In the previous researches of automatic semantic classification of Chinese compounds, compounds are generally presupposed to be endocentric, composed of a head and a modifier.",
        "Determining the class of the head is therefore determining the class of the target compound (Lua, 1997, Chen and Chen, 2000).",
        "This head-determination approach has two advantages: (1) it is simple and easy to implement (2) it works effectively for compound nouns, the dominant type of compounds, since most of them are head-final endocentric words.2 However, there exist considerable exocentric compounds, for which such a simple algorithm does not work successfully.",
        "It is especially the case for compound verbs like V-Vs3.",
        "For example, #T � is a V-V compound meaning ‘to kill by beating’.",
        "Obviously, neither the sense of #T (‘beat’) nor that of �(‘die’) is appropriate to be assigned to the compound #T � as the sense of * (‘car’) can be assigned to � * (‘tram’, literally ‘electricity-car’) as a general meaning.",
        "A second problem encountered in compound semantic classification is that there are considerable out-of-coverage morphemes, which are not listed in the lexicon, as remarked in (Chen and Chen, 2000).",
        "Moreover, even a morpheme is listed, the given senses are not necessarily appropriate to the task.",
        "For example, in the search of compound morphological rules in (Chen and Chen, 1998), some appropriate senses of morphemes have to be added manually to facilitate the task.",
        "Obviously this causes a great difficulty to an automatic task, especially to the example-based models which rely on the similarity measurement of the modifier morphemes to disambiguate the head senses (Chen and Chen, 1998, 2000).",
        "An alternative approach is thus needed to solve the problems of exocentric compounds and lexicon incompleteness.",
        "Therefore in this paper I will present a non head-oriented model of Chinese compound sense determination, in which lexicon incompleteness will be overcome by exploring the association between",
        "characters and senses in a MRD.",
        "The sense of an unknown compound can be approximated by retrieved synonyms.",
        "Its sense tag can be assigned according to a certain MRD.",
        "This model facilitates an automatic system of deep semantic classification for unknown compounds.",
        "In this paper, a system for V-V compounds is implemented and evaluated.",
        "The model can however be extended to handle general Chinese compounds, like V-N and N-N, as well."

        "Most of the Chinese compounds are composed of two constituents, which can be bound morphemes of one character or free words of one or more characters.",
        "The two-character compound is a most representative type because its components can be bound morphemes as well as free words.",
        "The handling of two-character compounds becomes therefore the focus in this paper.",
        "As in general Chinese compounding, a two-character compound is usually semantically compositional, with each character conveying a certain sense.",
        "The principle of semantic composition implies that under each compound lies a semantic pattern, which can be represented as the combination of the sense tags of the two component characters.",
        "The combination pattern is referred to as compounding semantic template (denoted by S-template) in this paper; compounds of the same S-template are then referred to as template-similar (denoted by T-similar).",
        "Since T-similar compounds are alike in their semantic compositions, they are supposed to possess roughly the same meaning and to be put under a considerably fine-grained semantic class.",
        "Take the compound verb #TZ#, for example.",

        "This S-template can also be found in many other compounds with a similar meaning:#T�,��,�Z#,, � � ... etc.",

        "As a critical technique, word similarity is generally used in the example-based models of semantic classification.",
        "The measure of word similarity can be divided into two major approaches: taxonomy-based lexical approach (Resnik 1995, Lin 1998a, Chen and Chen 1998) and context-based syntactic approach (Lin 1998b,Chen and You 2002), which is not the concern in this context-free model.",
        "However, two problems arise here for the taxonomy-based lexical approach.",
        "First, such similarity measures risk the failure to capture the similarity among some semantically highly related words, if they happen to be put under classes distant from each other according to a specific ontology 4.",
        "Second, as mentioned, the appropriate senses of some characters just cannot be found in the thesaurus.",
        "One major reason why dictionaries do not include certain character senses is that many of such characters are used in contemporary Chinese only as bound morphemes not as free words, when the senses in question are involved.",
        "However, such senses could be kept in the compounds in the lexicon, so they might be covert but not inextricable.",
        "To remedy the effects of such lexicon incompleteness, I propose an approach to retrieve the latent senses5 of characters and the latent synonymy among characters by exploring association among characters and senses.",
        "The idea is that if a character C appears in a compound W, then according to semantic composition, the sense of C must somehow contributes to S, the sense of W. Therefore the association strength between character C and sense S in a MRD is supposed to reflect the potentiality of S to be a sense of C. By transitivity, such association between characters and senses allows to capture association among characters.",
        "A new way to measure word similarity of two compounds can be thus derived based on the association strength of the corresponding component characters.",
        "This measure actually reflects the S-template similarity between two compounds and can be used to retrieve for a compound its T-similar words, which are potentially synonymous.",
        "4 Take an example in CILIN (a Chinese thesaurus, see 3.1).",
        "KILL(Arkk), BUTCHER(*�), and EXCUTE(� �) are three concepts all meaning ‘cause to die’.",

        "We wonder if any measurement based on that hierarchy can capture the similarity among the words situated in these three small classes in CILIN, for those words share only a common major class H, denoting vaguely Activities, which includes 296 small classes and 836 subclasses.",
        "5 Here the term latent is used only to mean ‘hidden, potential, and waiting to be discovered’.",

        "Through this example, we can see that the high inclusion rate of the correct answer in the top ranked classes has in fact a great significance: the ranking of the top candidates can be further adjusted and eventually ameliorated by context information, and thus the task of class determination can become a pseudo-WSD problem, in which domain various techniques are well available (Manning and Schütze, 1999).",

        "compounds using compounding template similarity.",
        "Based on this model, a system of deep semantic classification for V-V compounds is implemented, which classifies compounds according to the taxonomy of CILIN to its deep-level (level-3 and level-4) classes.",
        "The evaluation experiment reports a fairly satisfactory precision rate of the first ranked predicted semantic class (about 38% in outside test and 61% in inside test) against the baseline one (about 18%).",
        "The results also show a high inclusion rate of correct answer in the top3 ranked classes, which suggests that in the future the present non-contextual system can cooperate with a WSD module using context information.",
        "Though the model is only tested on a partial system for V-V compounds, it can be extended to work for general compounds, like V-N and N-N, with the association network further established for N characters.",
        "The model proposed in this paper has the following advantages: (1) It proposes a similarity measure of compounding template to retrieve potential synonyms for sense approximation, which avoids the inherent difficulty of head determination in a head-oriented approach and is thus capable of handling exocentric compounds.",
        "(2) It establishes a network of character-sense association, which allows the discovery of latent senses of characters, latent synonymy, and latent polysemy, thus remedying the incompleteness effect of the MRD in use.",
        "(3) It can carry out deep semantic classification, not just shallow classification assigning general and vague categories.",
        "(4) It requires only a simple format of idealized dictionary, which facilitates the conversion from a general MRD and allows an easy enhancement of the system by adding a new MRD.",
        "However, as can be remarked in the discussion of classification errors, the performance of the model relies much on the productivity of compounding semantic templates of the target compounds.",
        "To correctly predict the semantic class of a compound with an unproductive semantic template is no doubt very difficult due to a sparse existence of the T-similar compounds.",
        "How to remedy such an effect is thus a challenging task in the future.",
        "In addition, how to generalize the present character-based model to make it applicable to compounds with multi-character component morphemes will be another essential task to undertake.",
        "Besides, a task of automatic lexical translation for Chinese unknown compounds will also be carried out in the future.",
        "The task can be executed under the very same structure of the present model, since the only difference will be the change of working dicox (from dico2 to dico1) in the Module-B.",
        "A pilot experiment has already shown encouraging results."
