        "The low precision rate is mainly due to the low precision rate of word bi-gram extractions as only about 30% - 40% precision rate can be achieved for word bi-grams.",
        "In this paper, we propose a different approach to find collocations with low recurrences.",
        "The main idea is to make use of synonym relations to extract synonymous collocations.",

        "2002) defined the word similarity as two words that can substitute each other in the context and keep the sentence consistent in syntax and semantic structure.",
