        "The characters of the unsegmented Chinese text are grouped into pairs with the highest value of mutual information.",
        "This mutual information can be learned from an unsegmented Chinese corpus.",
        "We will present a new method for segmenting the Chinese text without using a manually segmented corpus or a predefined dictionary.",
        "In statistical machine translation, we have a bilingual corpus available, which is used to obtain a segmentation of the Chinese text in the following way.",
        "First, we train the statistical translation models with the unsegmented bilingual corpus.",
        "As a result, we obtain a mapping of Chinese characters to the corresponding English words for each sentence pair.",
        "By using this mapping, we can extract a dictionary automatically.",
        "With this self-learned dictionary, we use a segmentation tool to obtain a segmented Chinese text.",
        "Finally, we retrain our translation system with the segmented corpus.",
        "Additionally, we have performed experiments without explicit word segmentation.",
        "In this case, each Chinese character is interpreted as one “word”.",
        "Based on word groups, our machine translation system is able to work without a word segmentation, while having only a minor translation quality relative loss of less than 5%."
