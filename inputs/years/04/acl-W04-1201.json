        "In the biomedical domain, we care about entities like gene, protein, virus, etc.",

        "However, few of them have achieved satisfactory performance due to the special characteristics in the biomedical domain, such as long and descriptive naming conventions, conjunctive and disjunctive structure, causal naming convention and rapidly emerging new biomedical names, abbreviation, and cascaded construction.",

        "In order to deal with the special phenomena in the biomedical domain, various evidential features are explored.",
        "• Word Formation Pattern (FWFP): The purpose of this feature is to capture capitalization, digitalization and other word formation",
        "information.",
        "This feature has been widely used in the biomedical domain (Kazama et al. 2002; Shen et al. 2003; Zhou et al. 2004).",
        "In this paper, the same feature as in Shen et al. 2003 is used.",
        "• Morphological Pattern (FMP): Morphological information, such as prefix and suffix, is considered as an important cue for terminology identification and has been widely applied in the biomedical domain (Kazama et al. 2002; Lee et al. 2003; Shen et al. 2003; Zhou et al. 2004).",
        "Same as Shen et al. 2003, we use a statistical method to get the most useful prefixes/suffixes from the training data.",
        "• Part-of-Speech (FPOS): Since many of the words in biomedical entity names are in lowercase, capitalization information in the biomedical domain is not as evidential as that in the newswire domain.",
        "Moreover, many biomedical entity names are descriptive and very long.",
        "Therefore, POS may provide useful evidence about the boundaries of biomedical entity names.",
        "• Head Noun Trigger (FHEAD): The head noun,",
        "which is the major noun of a noun phrase, often describes the function or the property of the noun phrase.",
        "In this paper, we automatically extract unigram and bigram head nouns from the training data, and rank them by frequency.",
        "For each entity class, we select 50% of top ranked head nouns as head noun triggers.",
        "Table 1 shows some of the examples.",
        "PROTEIN interleukin activator protein interferon binding protein kinase cell receptor DNA DNA X chromosome cDNA binding motif chromosome promoter element",
        "• Name Alias Feature (FALIAS): Besides the",
        "above widely used features, we also propose a novel name alias feature.",
        "The intuition behind this feature is the name alias phenomenon that relevant entities will be referred to in many ways throughout a given text and thus success of named entity recognition is conditional on success at determining when one noun phrase refers to the very same entity as another noun phrase.",
        "During decoding, the entity names already recognized from the previous sentences of the document are stored in a list.",
        "When the system encounters an entity name candidate (e.g. a word with a special word formation pattern), a name alias algorithm (similar to Schwartz et al. 2003) is invoked to first dynamically determine whether the entity name candidate might be alias for a previously recognized name in the recognized list.",
        "This is done by checking whether all the characters in the entity name candidate exist in a recognized entity name in the same order and whether the first character in the entity name candidate is same as the first character in the recognized name.",
        "For a relevant work, please see Jacquemin (2001).",
        "The name alias feature FALIAS is represented as ENTITYnLm (L indicates the locality of the name alias phenomenon).",
        "Here ENTITY indicates the class of the recognized entity name and n indicates the number of the words in the recognized entity name while m indicates the number of the words in the recognized entity name from which the name alias candidate is formed.",
        "For example, when the decoding process encounters the word “TCF”, the word “TCF” is proposed as an entity name candidate and the name alias algorithm is invoked to check if the word “TCF” is an alias of a recognized named entity.",
        "If “T cell Factor” is a “Prote;n” name recognized earlier in the document, the word “TCF” is determined as an alias of “T cell Factor” with the name alias feature Protein3L3 by taking the three initial letters of the three-word “prote;n ” name “T cell Factor”."

        "Here, the Viterbi algorithm (Viterbi 1967) is implemented to find the most likely tag sequence.",
        "The problem with the above HMM lies in the data sparseness problem raised by P(s; |O,) in the third term of Equation (3).",

        "When a few features and/or a long context are considered, the number of different information sources is exponential.",

        "The main contributions of our work are the novel name alias feature in the biomedical domain, the SVM plus sigmoid approach in the effective resolution of the data sparseness problem in our system and its integration with the Hidden Markov Model.",
        "In the near future, we will further improve the performance by investigating more on conjunction and disjunction construction, the synonym phenomenon, and exploration of extra resources (e.g. dictionary)."
