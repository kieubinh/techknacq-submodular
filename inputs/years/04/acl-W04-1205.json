        "Information extraction (IE) in the biomedical domain is now regarded as an essential technique for utilizing information contained in archived journal articles and abstract collections such as MEDLINE.",
        "Major domain databases often contain incomplete and inconsistent results.",
        "Also, a majority of the reported experimental results are only available in unstructured full-text format.",
        "These being combined, scientists need to check with source journal articles to obtain and confirm factual information.",
        "Furthermore, they often need to start with document retrieval and face an overwhelming number of candidate articles.",
        "Thus, the significance of dynamic management of factual information, specifically an integration and update of experimental results, is self-evident.",
        "It would not only save researchers much time used for retrieval and redundant experiments but also help them use the information more effectively.",
        "Given the limitations of manual work in terms of both efficiency and accuracy, IE focusing on factual information is of critical importance.",
        "Researches in bioNLP have made major progress mainly in the extraction of bio-named entity biological interactions (e.g. Craven et al.",
        "1999; Humphreys et al., 2000; Tanabe et al., 2002).",
        "But further progress aimed at pinpointing and organizing factual information remains a challenge.",
        "We aim to provide a basis for this purpose.",
        "As the first step, we proposed in (Mizuta and Collier, 2004) annotating biology texts in terms of rhetorical zones with a shallow nesting, and provided an annotation scheme.",
        "In this paper, we explore a qualitative analysis of zone identification (ZI) in biology articles and provide stronger support for our framework toward automatic annotation of zones.",
        "Specifically we; 1) illustrate the linguistic and other features of each zone, which have been extracted through our pilot study of a total of 20 articles randomly selected from four major online journals (EMBO, PNAS, NAR and JCB), 2) discuss controversial cases for ZI and nested annotation to elaborate the scheme, 3) discuss multiple features relevant to ZI, and 4) summarize the investigation and outline future steps related to machine learning and applications.",
        "Previous work on rhetorical analysis of scientific articles focus on either; 1) hierarchical discourse relations between sentences (e.g. Mann and Thompson, 1987), 2) genre analysis within a descriptive framework (e.g. Swales 1990), or 3) ZI in a flat structure and a statistical evaluation of the annotation scheme from a machine learning perspective (e.g. Teufel and Moens, 2002).",
        "We follow the lines of (Teufel and Moens, 2002) and apply ZI to the domain of biology.",
        "But our approach is unique in that we focus on experimental results and on a qualitative analysis of ZI as a basis for automatic ZI."

        "We discuss below the critical issues in bioNLP involved in pinpointing and organizing factual information and show how ZI can be applied.",
        "First, articles provide information in various rhetorical statuses (e.g. new vs. old results; own vs. previous work).",
        "Current IE relies on surface lexical",
        "and syntactic patterns, neglecting the rhetorical status of information.",
        "Thus, we are in danger of extracting old results mixed with new ones.",
        "(1) Recent data suggest that ... ~ is involved in DPC removal in mammalian cells (ref.",
        "), ...",
        "...",
        "The data presented here suggest that ...",
        "The data (1) provide statements in different rhetorical statuses (boldfaced by us).",
        "Preprocessing the text in terms of such information helps filter out old results (i.e. the first statement).",
        "Secondly, so far the scope of bioNLP largely bear on abstracts.",
        "But arguably, the final goal should be full texts, given their much richer sources of information and the increasing ease of access (e.g. open access to collections such as PUBMED-central; online journals such as EMBO, PNAS, and JCB).",
        "This involves exploring new techniques because there are some essential differences from abstracts.",
        "Among others, full texts present much more complexity in the sentence structure and vocabulary (e.g. inserted phrases, embedded sentences, nominalization of verbs, more anaphoric expressions).",
        "Thus, we expect that the analysis of the whole text requires a much more complex set of patterns and algorithms,1 resulting in errors.",
        "A solution to this problem is to identify the subset of the article relevant to further analysis at issue.",
        "For example, in order to extract certain kinds of biological interactions found by the author, we could skip statements about previous work as seen in the Introduction section.",
        "Thirdly, experimental results make sense in their relation to the experimental goal and procedure.",
        "Also, there are usually a sequence of experiments performed, each of which obtains complex results.",
        "Therefore, it is important to extract a set of experimental results in an organized manner.",
        "This also helps identify the reference of demonstratives (e.g. this) and pronouns (e.g. it).",
        "From these points of view, ZI in articles plays an essential role in extracting factual information of different sorts from different zone classes."
