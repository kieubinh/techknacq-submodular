        "Having reliable part-of-speech (POS) information is critical to successful implementation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for processing unrestricted text in the biomedical domain.",
        "State-of-the-art automated POS taggers achieve accuracy of 93% - 98% and the most successful implementations are based on statistical approaches to POS tagging.",
        "Taggers based on Hidden Markoff Model (HMM) technology currently appear to be in the lead.",
        "The prime public domain examples of such implementations include the Trigrams’n’Tags tagger (Brandts 2000), Xerox tagger (Cutting et al.",
        "1992) and LT POS tagger (Mikheev 1997).",
        "Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) based taggers also seem to perform very well (Ratnaparkhi 1996, Jason Baldridge, Tom Morton, and Gann Bierner http://maxent.sourceforge.net ).",
        "One of the issues with statistical POS taggers is that most of them need a representative amount of hand-labeled training data either in the form of a comprehensive lexicon and a corpus of untagged data or a large corpus of text annotated for POS or a combination of the two.",
        "Currently, most of the POS tagger accuracy reports are based on the experiments involving Penn Treebank data (Marcus, 1993).",
        "The texts in Treebank represent the general English domain.",
        "It is not entirely clear how representative the general English language vocabulary and structure are of a specialized sub-domain such as clinical reports.",
        "A well-recognized problem is that the accuracy of all current POS taggers drops dramatically on unknown words.",
        "For example, while the TnT tagger performs at 97% accuracy on known words in the Treebank, the accuracy drops to 89% on unknown words (Brandts, 2000).",
        "The LT POS tagger is reported to perform at 93.6-94.3% accuracy on known words and at 87.7-88.7% on unknown words using a cascading unknown word “guesser” (Mikheev, 1997).",
        "The overall results for both of these taggers are much closer to the high end of the spectrum because the rate of the unknown words in the tests performed on the Penn Treebank corpus is generally relatively low – 2.9% (Brandts, 2000).",
        "From these results, we can conclude that the higher the rate of unknown vocabulary, the lower the overall accuracy will be, necessitating the adaptation of the taggers trained on Penn Treebank to sublanguage domains with vocabulary that is substantially different from the one represented by the Penn Treebank corpus.",
        "Based on the observable differences between the clinical and the general English discourse and POS tagging accuracy results on unknown vocabulary, it is reasonable to assume that a tagger trained on general English may not perform as well on clinical notes, where the percentage of unknown words will increase.",
        "To test this assumption, a “gold standard” corpus of clinical notes needs to be manually annotated for POS information.",
        "The issues with the annotation process constitute the primary focus of this paper.",
        "We describe an effort to train three medical coding experts to mark the text of clinical notes for part-of-speech information.",
        "The motivation for using medical coders rather than trained linguists is threefold.",
        "First of all, due to confidentiality restrictions, in order to develop a corpus of hand labeled data from clinical notes one can only use personnel authorized to access patient information.",
        "The only way to avoid it, is to anonymize the notes prior to POS tagging which in itself is a difficult and expensive process (Ruch et al.",
        "2000).",
        "Second, medical coding experts are well familiar with",
        "clinical discourse, which helps especially with annotating medicine specific vocabulary.",
        "Third, the fact that POS tagging can be viewed as a classification task makes the medical coding experts highly suitable because their primary occupation and expertise is in classifying patient records for subsequent retrieval.",
        "We show that, given a good set of guidelines, medical coding experts can be trained in a limited amount of time to perform a linguistic task such as POS annotation at a high level of agreement on both clinical notes and Penn Treebank data.",
        "Finally, we report on a set of training experiments performed with the TnT tagger (Brandts, 2000) using the Penn Treebank as well as the newly developed medical corpus.."

        "Prior to this study, the three annotators who participated in it had a substantial experience in coding clinical diagnoses but virtually no experience in POS markup.",
        "The training process consisted of a general and rather superficial introduction to the issues in linguistics as well as some formal training using the POS tagging guidelines developed by Santoriny (1991) for tagging Penn Treebank data.",
        "The formal training was followed by informal discussions of the data and difficult cases pertinent to the clinical notes domain which often resulted in slight modifications to the Penn Treebank guidelines.",
        "The annotation process consisted of preprocessing and editing.",
        "The preprocessing includes sentence boundary detection, tokenization and priming with part-of-speech tags generated by a MaxEnt tagger (Maxent 1.2.4 package (Baldridge et al.))",

        "If both tests show relatively high levels of agreement, then we can safely assume that the annotators in this study are able to generate part-of-speech tags for biomedical data that will be consistent with a widely recognized standard and can work independently of each other thus tripling the amount of manually annotated data."

        "5,463 lexical items are found in both corpora.",
