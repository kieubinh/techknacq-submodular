        "The accelerating growth in biomedical literature is stimulating efforts both to screen individual papers quickly for useful information and to use aggregations of papers for the collective information they provide.",
        "Aggregative use may involve what one might call “binning” classification, where one decides which of N bins an entity should be slotted into (Raychaudhuri et al., 2002).",
        "Most often these tasks have been done on titles and abstracts, simply because that is what is most freely available.",
        "However the nature of titles and abstracts means that they may lack information that is relevant to the task.",
        "The present study considers this issue, taking as its starting point work done by Raychaudhuri, Chang, Sutphin and Altman (2002).",
        "In this work: (i) articles were associated with GO codes; and then (ii) GO codes were assigned to new genes on the basis of the GO-code associations with articles about related genes.",
        "This paper reconsiders the basis for Step (i), to see if this can be done more accurately, using full text rather than titles and abstracts.",
        "Raychaudhuri et al.",
        "(2002) investigated how statistical natural language techniques could be applied to assign GO codes to genes using the titles and abstracts of articles about related genes.",
        "GO codes are terms drawn from three controlled vocabularies (biological processes, cellular components and molecular functions) developed by the Gene Ontology Consortium (Ashburner et al., 2000).",
        "The Gene Ontology Consortium’s aim is for gene products to be described in a consistent manner across independent databases and species.",
        "Each controlled vocabulary is organised as a directed acyclic graph (DAG).",
        "The GO codes that Raychaudhuri et al.",
        "chose to assign to articles (and hence to genes) were from the biological process vocabulary, an approximate horizontal cut through the biological process DAG.",
        "However, some departures were made from the horizontal when the authors found difficulties in precisely defining the associated literature.",
        "In departing from the horizontal, parent/child dependencies were introduced.",
        "For example, GO code transport is a parent of intracellular protein traffic.",
        "MEDLINE queries on these GO codes were manually created in order to retrieve approximately 1000 articles related to each topic.",
        "The queries contained both MeSH terms and keywords.",
        "Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) (Hutchinson, 1998) is a controlled vocabulary from the National Library of Medicine used to aid indexing and searching biological information.",
        "MEDLINE articles are indexed by MeSH headings, among other annotations.",
        "The PubMed search tool allows a user to specify desired search fields, of which Raychaudhuri et al.",
        "used title (TI), Major MeSH Heading (MAJR), MeSH Heading (MH) and date of publication (DP).",
        "The first three fields were used to specify the subject of the article while the DP field was used to limit the number of articles retrieved to approximately 1000.",
        "Raychaudhuri et al.",
        "experimented with three machine learning approaches (Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbours and Maximum Entropy) to classify articles according to the 21 GO codes.",
        "Each classifier was trained on articles retrieved using the described queries from 1999 and earlier, and tested on articles from 2000.",

        "The Introduction section can conceivably contain any type of information, including similar/opposite studies, ultimate goal of the present study, other processes related to the gene(s)/protein(s) in question and so can have many positive and negative indicators of category.",
