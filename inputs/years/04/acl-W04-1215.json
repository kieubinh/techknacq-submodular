        "The volumn of on-line material in the biomedical field has been growing steadily for more than 20 years.",
        "Several attempts have been made to mine knowledge from biomedical documents, such as identifying gene/protein names, recognizing protein interactions, and capturing specific relations in databases.",
        "Among these, named entity recognition is a fundamental step to mine knowledge from biological articles.",
        "Previous approaches on biological named entity extraction can be classified into two types – rule-based (Fukuda et al., 1998; Olsson et al., 2002; Tanabe and Wilbur, 2002) and corpus-based (Collier et al., 2000; Chang et al., 2004).",
        "Yapex (Olsson et al., 2002) implemented some heuristic steps described by Fukuda, et al., and applied filters and knowledge bases to remove false alarms.",
        "Syntactic information obtained from the parser was incorporated as well.",
        "GAPSCORE (Chang et al., 2004) scored words on the basis of statistical models that quantified their appearance, morphology and context.",
        "The models includes Naive Bayes (Manning and Schütze, 1999), Maximum Entropy (Ratnaparkhi, 1998) and Support Vector Machines (Burges, 1998).",
        "GAPSCORE also used Brill’s tagger (Brill, 1994) to get the POS tag to filter out some words that are clearly not gene or protein names.",
        "Efforts have been made (Hou and Chen, 2002, 2003; Tsuruoka and Tsujii, 2003) to improve the performance.",
        "The nature of classification makes it possible to integrate existing approaches by extracting good features from them.",
        "Several works employing SVM classifier have been done (Kazama et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2003; Takeuchi and Collier, 2003; Yamamoto et al., 2003), and will be discussed further in the rest of this paper.",
        "Collocation denotes two or more words having strong relationships (Manning and Schütze, 1999).",
        "Hou and Chen (2003) showed that protein/gene collocates are capable of assisting existing protein/gene taggers.",
        "In this paper, we addressed this task as a multi-class classification problem with SVMs and extended the idea of collocation to generate features at word and pattern level in our method.",
        "Existing protein/gene recognizers were used to perform feature extraction as well.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "The methods used in this study are introduced in Section 2.",

        "Most of the works in the past on recognizing named entities in the biomedical domain focused on identifying a single type of entities like protein and/or gene names.",
        "It is obviously more challenging to annotate multiple types of named entities simultaneously.",
        "Intuitively, one can develop a specific recognizer for each type of named entities, run the recognizers one by one to annotate all types of named entities, and merge the results.",
        "The problem results from the boundary decision and the annotation conflicts.",
        "Instead of constructing five individual recognizers, we regarded the multiple-class annotation as a classification problem, and tried to learn a",
        "classifier capable of identifying all the five types of named entities.",
        "Before classification, we have to decide the unit of classification.",
        "Since it is difficult to correctly mark the boundary of a name to be identified, the simplest way is to consider an individual word as an instance and assign a type to it.",
        "After the type assignment, continuous words of the same type will be marked as a complete named entity of that type.",

        "The first step in classification is to extract informative and useful features to represent an instance to be classified.",
        "In our work, one word is represented by the attributes carried per se, the attributes contributed by two surrounding words, and other contextual information.",
        "The details are as follows.",
        "The word “attribute” is sometimes used interchangeably with “feature”, but in this article they denote two different concepts.",
        "Features are those used to represent a classification instance, and the information enclosed in the features is not necessarily contributed by the word itself.",
        "Attributes are defined to be the information that can be derived from the word alone in this paper.",
        "The attributes assigned to each word are whether it is part of a gene/protein name, whether it is part of a species name, whether it is part of a tissue name, whether it is a stop word, whether it is a number, whether it is punctuation, and the part of speech of this word.",
        "Instead of using a lexicon for gene/protein name annotation, we employed two gene/protein name taggers, Yapex and GAPSCORE, to do this job.",
        "As for part of speech tagging, Brill’ s part of speech tagger was adopted.",
        "Contextual information has been shown helpful in annotating gene/protein names, and therefore two strategies for extracting contextual information at different levels are used.",
        "One is the usual practice at a word level, and the other is at a pattern level.",
        "Since the training data released in the beginning does not define the abstract boundary, we have to assume that sentences are independent of each other, and the contextual information extraction was thus limited to be within a sentence.",
        "For contextual information extraction at word level (Hou and Chen, 2003), collocates along with 4 statistics including frequency, the average and standard error of distance between word and entity and t-test score, were extracted.",
        "The frequency and t-test score were normalized to [0, 1].",
        "Five lists of collocates were obtained for cell-line, cell-type, DNA, RNA, and protein, respectively.",
        "As for contextual information extraction at pattern level, we first gathered a list of words constituting a specific type of named entities.",
        "Then a hierarchical clustering with cutoff threshold was performed on the words.",
        "Edit distance was adopted as the measure of dissimilarity (see Figure 1).",
        "Afterwards, common substrings were obtained to form the list of patterns.",
        "With a list of patterns at hand, we estimated the pattern distribution, the occurrence frequencies at and around the current position, given the type of word at the current position.",
        "Figure 2 showed an example of the estimated distribution.",
        "The average KL-Divergence between any two distributions was computed to discriminate the power of each pattern.",

        "Since there is a huge amount of training instances and we do not have enough time to tune the parameters and train a model with all the training instances available, we first randomly selected one tenth and one fourth of the complete training data.",
        "The results, as we expected, showed that model trained with more instances performed better (see Table 2).",
        "However, we noticed that the performances vary among the 6 types and one of the possible causes is the imbalance of training data among classes (see Table 1).",
        "Therefore we decided to balance the training data.",
        "First, the training data was constructed to comprise equal number of instances from each class.",
        "However, it didn’t perform well and lots of type ‘O’ words were misclassified, indicating that using only less than 1 % of type ‘O’ training instances is not sufficient to train a good model.",
        "Thus two more models were trained to see if the performance can be enhanced.",
        "One model has slightly more type ‘O’ instances than the equally balanced one, and the other model has the ratio among classes being 4:8:4:1:8:16.",
        "The results showed increase in recall but drop in precision.",
        "Kazama et al.",
        "(2002) addressed the data imbalance problem and sped up the training process by splitting the type ‘O’ instances into subclasses using part-of-speech information.",
        "However, we missed their work while we were doing this task, and hence didn’t have the chance to use and extend this idea.",
        "After carefully examining the classification results, we found that many of the ‘DNA’ instances were classified as ‘protein’ and many of the ‘protein’ instances were classified as ‘DNA’.",
        "For example, 904 out of 2,845 ‘DNA’ instances were categorized as ‘protein’ under ‘model 1/4’.",
        "The reason may be that Yapex and GAPSCORE do not distinguish gene name from protein names.",
        "Even humans don’t do very well at this (Krauthammer et al., 2002).",
        "We originally planned to verify the contribution of each type of features.",
        "For example, how much noise was introduced by using existing taggers instead of lexicons.",
