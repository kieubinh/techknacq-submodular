        "The explosion of information in the fields of molecular biology and genetics has provided a unique opportunity for natural language processing techniques to aid researchers and curators of databases in the biomedical field by providing text mining services.",
        "Yet typical natural language processing tasks such as named entity recognition, information extraction, and word sense disambiguation are particularly challenging in the biomedical domain with its highly complex and idiosyncratic language.",
        "With the increasing use of shared tasks and shared evaluation procedures (e.g., the recent BioCreative, TREC, and KDD Cup), it is rapidly becoming clear that performance in this domain is markedly lower than the field has come to expect from the standard domain of newswire.",
        "The Coling 2004 shared task focuses on the problem of Named Entity Recognition, requiring participating systems to identify the five named entities of protein, RNA, DNA, cell line, and cell type in the GENIA corpus of MEDLINE abstracts (Ohta et al., 2002).",
        "In this paper we describe a machine learning system incorporating a diverse set of features and various external resources to accomplish this task.",
        "We describe our system in detail and also discuss some sources of error."

        "Unlike the above two tasks, many of the entities in the current task do not have good internal cues for distinguishing the class of entity: various systematic pol-ysemies and the widespread use of acronyms mean that internal cues are lacking.",
        "The challenge was thus to make better use of contextual features, including local and syntactic features, and external resources in order to succeed at this task."

        "We used a variety of features describing the immediate content and context of each word, including the word itself, the previous and next words, word prefixes and suffix of up to a length of 6 characters, word shapes, and features describing the named entity tags assigned to the previous words.",
        "Word shapes refer to a mapping of each word onto equivalence classes that encodes attributes such as length, capitalization, numerals, greek letters, and so on.",

        "So while the information that a token was seen in a gazetteer is an unreliable indicator of whether it is an entity, less frequent words are less likely to be ambiguous than more frequent ones.",
        "Additionally, more frequent words are likely to have been seen often in the training data and the system should be better at classifying them, while less frequent words are a common source of error and their classification is more likely to benefit from the use of external resources.",
        "We assigned each word in the training and testing data a frequency category corresponding to its frequency in the British National Corpus, a 100 million word balanced corpus, and used conjunctions of this category and certain other features."

        "The final gazetteer contained 1,731,496 entries.",
        "Because it contained only gene names, and for the reasons discussed earlier, we suspect that it was not terribly useful for identifying the presences of entities, but rather that it mainly helped to establish the exact beginning and ending point of multi-word entities recognized mainly through other features."

        "We fully parsed the training and testing data using the Stanford Parser of (Klein and Manning, 2003) operating on the TnT part-of-speech tagging – we believe that the un-lexicalized nature of this parser makes it a particularly suitable statistical parser to use when there is a large domain mismatch between the training material (Wall Street Journal text) and the target domain, but have not yet carefully evaluated this.",
        "Then, for each word in the sentence which is inside a noun phrase, the head and governor of the noun phrase are extracted.",
        "These features are not very useful when identifying only two classes (such as GENE and OTHER in the BioCreative task), but they were quite useful for this task because of the large number of classes which the system needed to distinguish between.",
        "Because the classifier is now",
        "choosing between classes where members can look very similar, longer distance information can provide a better representation of the context in which the word appears.",
        "For instance, the word phospho-rylation occurs in the training corpus 492 times, 482 of which it is was classified as other.",
        "However, it is the governor of 738 words, of which 443 are protein, 292 are other and only 3 are cell line.",
        "We also made use of abbreviation matching to help ensure consistency of labels.",
        "Abbreviations and long forms were extracted from the data using the method of (Schwartz and Hearst, 2003).",

        "When training our classifier, we merged the B and I - labels for each class, so it did not learn how to differentiate between the first word of a class and internal word.",

        "Foremost was memory concerns; our final system trained on just the six classes had 1.5 million features – we just did not have the resources to train it over more classes without giving up many of our features.",
        "Our second motivation was that by merging the beginning and internal labels for a particular class, the classifier would see more examples of that class and learn better how to identify it.",
        "The drawback of this move is that when two entities belonging to the same class are adjacent, our classifier will automatically merge them into one entity.",

        "Otherwise confusions between some named entity and being nothing are most of the errors, although protein/DNA and cell-line/cell-type confusions are also noticeable.",
        "Analysis of performance in biomedical Named Entity Recognition tends to be dominated by the perceived poorness of the results, stemming from the twin beliefs that performance of roughly ninety percent is the state-of-the-art and that performance of 100% (or close to that) is possible and the goal to be aimed for.",
        "Both of these beliefs are questionable, as the top MUC 7 performance of 93.39%",
        "(Mikheev et al., 1998) in the domain of newswire text used an easier performance metric where incorrect boundaries were given partial credit, while both the biomedical NER shared tasks to date have used an exact match criterion where one is doubly penalized (both as a FP and as a FN) for incorrect boundaries.",
        "However, the difference in metric clearly cannot account entirely for the performance discrepancy between newswire NER and biomedical NER.",
        "Biomedical NER appears to be a harder task due to the widespread ambiguity of terms out of context, the complexity of medical language, and the apparent need for expert domain knowledge.",
        "These are problems that more sophisticated machine learning systems using resources such as ontologies and deep processing might be able to overcome.",
        "However, one should also consider the inherent “fuzziness” of the classification task.",
        "The few existing studies of inter-annotator agreement for biomedical named entities have measured agreement between 87%(Hirschman, 2003) and 89%(Demetrious and Gaizauskas, 2003).",
        "As far as we know there are no inter-annotator agreement results for the GENIA corpus, and it is necessary to have such results before properly evaluating the performance of systems.",
        "In particular, the fact that BioNLP sought to distinguish between gene and protein names, when these are known to be systematically ambiguous, and when in fact in the GENIA corpus many entities were doubly classified as “protein molecule or",
        "region” and “DNA molecule or region”, suggests that inter-annotator agreement could be low, and that many entities in fact have more than one classification.",
        "One area where GENIA appears inconsistent is in the labeling of preceding adjectives.",
        "The data was selected by querying for the term human, yet the term is labeled inconsistently, as is shown in Table 4.",
        "Of the 1790 times the term human occurred before or at the beginning of an entity in the training data, it was not classified as part of the entity 110 times.",
        "In the test data, there is only on instance (out of 130) where the term is excluded.",
        "Adjectives are excluded approximately 25% of the time in both the training and evaluation data.",
