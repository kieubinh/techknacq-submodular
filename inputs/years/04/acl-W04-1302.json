        "In recent years there has been a growing amount of work focusing on the computational modeling of language processing and acquisition, implying a cognitive and theoretical relevance both of the models as such, as well as of the language properties extracted from raw linguistic data.1 In the computational linguistic literature several attempts to induce grammar or linguistic knowledge from such data have shown that at different levels a high amount of information can be extracted, even with no or minimal supervision.",
        "Different approaches tried to show how various puzzles of language induction could be solved.",
        "From this perspective, language acquisition is the process of segmentation of non-discrete acoustic input, mapping of segments to symbolic representations, mapping representations on higher-level representations such as phonology, morphology and syntax, and even induction of semantic properties.",
        "Due to space restrictions, we cannot discuss all these approaches in detail.",
        "We will focus on the close domain of morphology.",
        "Approaches to the induction of morphology as presented in e.g. Schone and Jurafsky (2001) or Goldsmith (2001) show that the morphological",
        "properties of a small subset of languages can be induced with high accuracy, most of the existing approaches are motivated by applied or engineering concerns, and thus make assumptions that are less cognitively plausible: a.",
        "Large corpora are processed all at once, though unsupervised incremental induction of grammars is rather the approach that would be relevant from a psycholinguistic perspective; b.",
        "Arbitrary decisions about selections of sets of elements are made, based on frequency or frequency profile rank,2 though such decisions should rather be derived or avoided in general.",
        "However, the most important aspects missing in these approaches, however, are the link to different linguistic levels and the support of a general learning model that makes predictions about how knowledge is induced on different linguistic levels and what the dependencies between information at these levels are.",
        "Further, there is no study focusing on the type of supervision that might be necessary for the guidance of different algorithm types towards grammars that resemble theoretical and empirical facts about language acquisition, and processing and the final knowledge of language.",
        "While many theoretical models of language acquisition use innateness as a crutch to avoid outstanding difficulties, both on the general and abstract level of I-language as well as the more detailed level of E-language, (see, among others, Lightfoot (1999) and Fodor and Teller (2000), there is also significant research being done which shows that children take advantage of statistical regularities in the input for use in the language-learning task (see Batchelder (1997) and related references within).",
        "In language acquisition theories the dominant view is that knowledge of one linguistic level is bootstrapped from knowledge of one, or even several different levels.",
        "Just to mention such approaches: Grimshaw (1981), and Pinker (1984) 2 Just to mention some of the arbitrary decisions made in various approaches, e.g. Mintz (1996) selects a small set of all words, the most frequent words, to induce word types via clustering ; Schone and Jurafsky (2001) select words with frequency higher than 5 to induce morphological segmentation.",
        "assume that semantic properties are used to bootstrap syntactic knowledge, and Mazuka (1998) suggested that prosodic properties of language establish a bias for specific syntactic properties, e.g. headedness or branching direction of constituents.",
        "However, these approaches are based on conceptual considerations and psycholinguistc empirical grounds, the formal models and computational experiments are missing.",
        "It is unclear how the induction processes across linguistic domains might work algorithmically, and the quantitative experiments on large scale data are missing.",
        "As for algorithmic approaches to cross-level induction, the best example of an initial attempt to exploit cues from one level to induce properties of another is presented in 13éjean (1998), where morphological cues are identified for induction of syntactic structure.",
        "Along these lines, we will argue for a model of statistical cue-based learning, introducing a view on bootstrapping as proposed in Elghamry (2004), and Elghamry and Cavar (2004), that relies on identification of elementary cues in the language input and incremental induction and further cue identification across all linguistic levels."

        "Presupposing input driven learning, it has been shown in the literature that initial segmenations into words (or word-like units) is possible with unsupervised methods (e.g. Brent and Cartwright (1996)), that induction of morphology is possible (e.g. Goldsmith (2001), Schone and Jurafsky (2001)) and even the induction of syntactic structures (e.g. Van Zaanen (2001)).",
        "As mentioned earlier, the main drawback of these approaches is the lack of incrementality, certain arbitrary decisions about the properties of elements taken into account, and the lack of integration into a general model of bootstrapping across linguistic levels.",
        "As proposed in Elghamry (2004), cues are elementary language units that can be identified at each linguistic level, dependent or independent of prior induction processes.",
        "That is, intrinsic properties of elements like segments, syllables, morphemes, words, phrases etc.",
        "are the ones available for induction procedures.",
        "Intrinsic properties are for example the frequency of these units, their size, and the number of other units they are build of.",
        "Extrinsic properties are taken into account as well, where extrinsic stands for distributional properties, the context, relations to other units of the same type on one, as well as across linguistic levels.",
        "In this model, extrinsic and intrinsic properties of elementary language units are the cues that are used for grammar induction only.",
        "As shown in Elghamry (2004) and Elghamry and Cavar (2004), there are efficient ways to identify a kernel set of such units in an unsupervised fashion without any arbitrary decision where to cut the set of elements and on the basis of what kind of features.",
        "They present an algorithm that selects the set of kernel cues on the lexical and syntactic level, as the smallest set of words that co-occurs with all other words.",
        "Using this set of words it is possible to cluster the lexical inventory into open and closed class words, as well as to identify the subclasses of nouns and verbs in the open class.",
        "The direction of the selectional preferences of the language is derived as an average of point-wise Mutual Information on each side of the identified cues and types, which is a self-supervision aspect that biases the search direction for a specific language.",
        "This resulting information is understood as derivation of secondary cues, which then can be used to induce selectional properties of verbs (frames), as shown in Elghamry (2004).",
        "The general claim thus is:",
        "• Cues can be identified in an unsupervised fashion in the input.",
        "• These cues can be used to induce properties of the target grammar.",
        "• These properties represent cues that can be",
        "used to induce further cues, and so on.",
        "The hypothesis is that this snowball effect can reduce the search space of the target grammar incrementally.",
        "The main research questions are now, to what extend do different algorithms provide cues for other linguistic levels and what kind of information do they require as supervision in the system, in order to gain the highest accuracy at each linguistic level, and how does the linguistic information of one level contribute to the information on another.",
        "In the following, the architectural considerations of such a computational model are discussed, resulting in an example implementation that is applied to morphology induction, where morphological properties are understood to represent cues for lexical clustering as well as syntactic structure, and vice versa, similar to the ideas formulated in 13éjean (1998), among others."

        "Such constraining characteristics make ABL attractive from a cognitive point of view, both because hopefully the computational complexity is reduced on account of the smaller set of potential hypotheses, and also because learning of new items, rules, or structural properties is related to a general learning strategy and previous experience only.",

        "The average scores of words in each such window were calculated as the window advanced.",
        "The purpose of this method was to allow the performance of the algorithm to be judged at a given point without prior performance in the corpus affecting the analysis of the current window.",
        "The following graph shows how the average performance of the windows of analyzed words as the algorithm progresses through five randomly chosen chapters of general fiction in the Brown Corpus amounting to around 10,000 words.",

        "The evaluations on two related morphology systems show that with a restrictive setting of the parameters in the described algorithm, approx 99% precision can be reached, with a recall higher than 60% for the portion of the Brown corpus, and even higher for the Peter corpus.",
        "We are able to identify phases in the generation of rules that turn out to be for English: a. initially inflectional morphology on verbs, with the plural “s” on nouns, and b. subsequently other types of morphemes.",
        "We believe that this phenomenon is purely driven by the frequency of these morphemes in the corpora.",
        "In the manually segmented portion of the Brown corpus we identified on the token level 11.3% inflectional morphemes, 6.4% derivational morphemes, and 82.1% stems.",
        "In average there are twice as many inflectional morphemes in the corpus, than derivational.",
        "Given a very strict parameters, focusing on the description length of the grammar, our system would need long time till it would discover prefixes, not to mention infixes.",
        "By relaxing the weight of description length we can inhibit the",
        "generation and identification of prefixing rules, however, to the cost of precision.",
        "Given these results, the inflectional paradigms can be claimed to be extractable even with an incremental approach.",
        "As such, this means that central parts of the lexicon can be induced very early along the time line.",
        "The existing signatures for each morpheme can be used as simple clustering criteria.10 Clustering will separate dependent (affixes) from independent morphemes (stems).",
        "Their basic distinction is that affixes will usually have a long signature, i.e. many elements they co-occur with, as well as a high frequency, while for stems the opposite is true.11 Along these lines, morphemes with a similar signature can be replaced by symbols, expressing the same type information and compressing the grammar further.",
        "This type information, especially for rare morphemes is essential in subsequent induction of syntactic structure.",
        "Due to space limitations, we cannot discuss in detail subsequent steps in the cross-level induction procedures.",
        "Nevertheless, the model presented here provides an important pointer to the mechanics of how grammatical parameters might come to be set.",
        "Additionally, we provide a method by which to test the roles different statistical algorithms play in this process.",
        "By adjusting the weights of the contributions made by various constraints, we can approach an understanding of the optimal ordering of algorithms that play a role in the computational framework of language acquisition.",
        "This is but a first step to what we hope will eventually finish a platform for a detailed study of various induction algorithms and evaluation metrics."
