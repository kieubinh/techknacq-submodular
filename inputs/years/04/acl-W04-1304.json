        "One argument for parametric models of language has been learnability in the context of first language acquisition.",
        "The claim is made that “logical” arguments from learnability theory require non-trivial constraints on the class of languages.",
        "Initial formalisations of the problem (Gold, 1967) are however inapplicable to this particular situation.",
        "In this paper we construct an appropriate formalisation of the problem using a modern vocabulary drawn from statistical learning theory and grammatical inference and looking in detail at the relevant empirical facts.",
        "We claim that a variant of the Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning framework (Valiant, 1984) with positive samples only, modified so it is not completely distribution free is the appropriate choice.",
        "Some negative results derived from cryptographic problems (Kearns et al., 1994) appear to apply in this situation but the existence of algorithms with provably good performance (Ron et al., 1995) and subsequent work, shows how these negative results are not as strong as they initially appear, and that recent algorithms for learning regular languages partially satisfy our criteria.",
        "We then discuss the applicability of these results to parametric and nonparametric models."

        "For some years, the relevance of formal results in grammatical inference to the empirical question of first language acquisition by infant children has been recognised (Wexler and Culicover, 1980).",
        "Unfortunately, for many researchers, with a few notable exceptions (Abe, 1988), this begins and ends with Gold’s famous negative results in the identification in the limit paradigm.",
        "This paradigm, though still widely used in the grammatical inference community, is clearly of limited relevance to the issue at hand, since it requires the model to be able to exactly identify the target language even when an adversary can pick arbitrarily misleading sequences of examples to provide.",
        "Moreover, the paradigm as stated has no bounds on the amount of data or computation required for the learner.",
        "In spite of the inapplicability of this particular paradigm, in a suitable analysis there are quite strong arguments that bear directly on this problem.",
        "Grammatical inference is the study of machine learning of formal languages.",
        "It has a vast formal vocabulary and has been applied to a wide selection of different problems, where the “languages” under study can be (representations of) parts of natural languages, sequences of nucleotides, moves of a robot, or some other sequence data.",
        "For any conclusions that we draw from formal discussions to have any applicability to the real world, we must be sure to select, or construct, from the rich set of formal devices available an appropriate formalisation.",
        "Even then, we should be very cautious about making inferences about how the infant child must or cannot learn language: subsequent developments in GI might allow a more nuanced description in which these conclusions are not valid.",
        "The situation is complicated by the fact that the field of grammti-cal inference, much like the wider field of machine learning in general, is in a state of rapid change.",
        "In this paper we hope to address this problem by justifying the selection of the appropriate learning framework starting by looking at the actual situation the child is in, rather than from an a priori decision about the right framework.",
        "We will not attempt a survey of grammatical inference techniques; nor shall we provide proofs of the theorems we use here.",
        "Arguments based on formal learnability have been used to support the idea of parameter based theories of language (Chomsky, 1986).",
        "As we shall see below, under our analysis of the problem these arguments are weak.",
        "Indeed, they are more pertinent to questions about the autonomy and modularity of language learning: the question whether learning of some level of linguistic knowledge – morphology or syntax, for example – can take place in isolation from other forms of learning, such as the acquisition of word meaning, and without interaction, grounding and so on.",
        "Positive results can help us to understand how humans might learn languages by outlining the class of algorithms that might be used by humans, considered as computational systems at a suitable abstract level.",
        "Conversely, negative results might be helpful if they could demonstrate that no algorithms of a certain class could perform the task – in this case we could know that the human child learns his language in some other way.",
        "We shall proceed as follows: after briefly describing FLA, we describe the various elements of a model of learning, or framework.",
        "We then make a series of decisions based on the empirical facts about FLA, to construct an appropriate model or models, avoiding unnecessary idealisation wherever possible.",
        "We proceed to some strong negative results, well-known in the GI community that bear on the questions at hand.",
        "The most powerful of these (Kearns et al., 1994) appears to apply quite directly to our chosen model.",
        "We then discuss an interesting algorithm (Ron et al., 1995) which shows that this can be circumvented, at least for a subclass of regular languages.",
        "Finally, after discussing the possibilities for extending this result to all regular languages, and beyond, we conclude with a discussion of the implications of the results presented for the distinction between parametric and non-parametric models."

        "Let us first examine the phenomenon we are concerned with: first language acquisition.",
        "In the space of a few years, children almost invariably acquire, in the absence of explicit instruction, one or more of the languages that they are exposed to.",
        "A multitude of subsidiary debates have sprung up around this central issue covering questions about critical periods – the ages at which this can take place, the exact nature of the evidence available to the child, and the various phases of linguistic use through which the infant child passes.",
        "In the opinion of many researchers, explaining this ability is one of the most important challenges facing linguists and cognitive scientists today.",
        "A difficulty for us in this paper is that many of the idealisations made in the study of this field are in fact demonstrably false.",
        "Classical assumptions, such as the existence of uniform communities of language users, are well-motivated in the study of the “steady state” of a system, but less so when studying acquisition and change.",
        "There is a regrettable tendency to slip from viewing these idealisations correctly – as counter-factual idealizations – to viewing them as empirical facts that need to be explained.",
        "Thus, when looking for an appropriate formulation of the problem, we should recall for example the fact that different children do not converge to exactly the same knowledge of language as is sometimes claimed, nor do all of them acquire a language competently at all, since there is a small proportion of children who though apparently neurologically normal fail to acquire language.",
        "In the context of our discussion later on, these observations lead us to accept slightly less stringent criteria where we allow a small probability of failure and do not demand perfect equality of hypothesis and target."

        "The general field of machine learning has a specialised subfield that deals with the learning of formal languages.",
        "This field, Grammatical Inference (GI), is characterised above all by an interest in formal results, both in terms of formal characterisations of the target languages, and in terms of formal proofs either that particular algorithms can learn according to particular definitions, or that sets of language cannot be learnt.",

        "In summary it is not just about language, and accordingly it has developed a rich vocabulary to deal with the wide range of its subject matter.",
        "In particular, researchers are often concerned with formal results – that is we want algorithms where we can prove that they will perform in a certain way.",
        "Often, we may be able to empirically establish that a particular algorithm performs well, in the sense of reliably producing an accurate model, while we may be unable to prove formally that the algorithm will always perform in this way.",
        "This can be for a number of reasons: the mathematics required in the derivation of the bounds on the errors may be difficult or obscure, or the algorithm may behave strangely when dealing with sets of data which are ill-behaved in some way.",
        "The basic framework can be considered as a game played between two players.",
        "One player, the teacher, provides information to another, the learner, and from that information the learner must identify the underlying language.",

        "in some way from a possibly infinite class of languages, L, which is a set of formal mathematical objects.",
        "The teacher selects one of these languages, which we call the target, and then gives the learner a certain amount of information of various types about the target.",
        "After a while, the learner then returns its guess, the hypothesis, which in general will be a language drawn from the same class L. Ideally the learner has been able to deduce or induce or abduce something about the target from the information we have given it, and in this case the hypothesis it returns will be identical to, or close in some technical sense, to the target.",
        "If the learner can conistently do this, under whatever constraints we choose, then we say it can learn that class of languages.",
        "To turn this vague description into something more concrete requires us to specify a number of things.",
        "• What sort of mathematical object should we use to represent a language?",
        "• What is the target class of languages?",
        "• What information is the learner given?",
        "• What computational constraints does the learner operate under?",
        "• How close must the target be to the hypothesis, and how do we measure it?",
        "This paper addresses the extent to which negative results in GI could be relevant to this real world situation.",
        "As always, when negative results from theory are being applied, a certain amount of caution is appropriate in examining the underlying assumptions of the theory and the extent to which these are applicable.",

        "This is very standard in most fields of machine learning.",
        "The second problem relates not to the amount of information but to the computation involved.",
        "Results derived from cryptographic limitations on computational complexity, can be proved based on widely held and well supported assumptions that certain hard cryptographic problems are insoluble.",

        "lems such as factoring Blum integers, inverting RSA function, recognizing quadratic residues or learning noisy parity functions.",
        "There may be algorithms that will learn with reasonable amounts of data but that require unfeasibly large amounts of computation to find.",
        "There are a number of powerful negative results on learning in the purely distribution-free situation we considered and rejected above.",
        "(Kearns and Valiant, 1989) showed that acyclic deterministic automata are not learnable even with positive and negative examples.",
        "Similarly, (Abe and Warmuth, 1992) showed a slightly weaker representation dependent result on learning with a large alphabet for non-deterministic automata, by showing that there are strings such that maximising the likelihood of the string is NP-hard.",
        "Again this does not strictly apply to the partially distribution free situation we have chosen.",
        "However there is one very strong result that appears to apply.",
        "A straightforward consequence of (Kearns et al., 1994) shows that Acyclic Deterministic Probabilistic FSA over a two letter alphabet cannot be learned under another cryptographic assumption (the noisy parity assumption).",
        "Therefore any class of languages that includes this comparatively weak family will not be learnable in out framework.",
        "But this rests upon the assumption that the class of possible human languages must include some cryptographically hard functions.",
        "It appears that our formal apparatus does not distinguish between these cryptographic functions which hav been consciously designed to be hard to learn, and natural languages which presumably have evolved to be easy to learn since there is no evolutionary pressure to make them hard to decrypt – no intelligent predators eavesdropping for example.",

        "The use of distinguishability seems innocuous; in syntactic terms it is a consequence of the plausible condition that for any pair of distinct non-terminals there is some fairly likely string generated by one and not the other.",

        "If the parameters are shallow and relate to easily detectable properties of the languages and are independent then learning can occur efficiently (Yang, 2002).",
        "If they are “deep” and inter-related, learning may be impossible.",
        "Learn-ability depends more on simple statistical properties of the distributions of the samples than on the structure of the class of languages.",
