        "Neither the trigger nor the mechanism that takes a child from one stage to the next are known.",
        "Stages arise gradually with no precise start or end points, overlapping one another (Ingram, 1989).",
        "The aim of this research is to develop a system that autonomously acquires conceptual representations of individual words (the \"one-word stage\") and also, simultaneously, is capable of developing representations of valid multi-word structures i.e. simple syntax (the \"two-word stage\").",
        "Two-word descriptions are expected to emerge as a result of the system state and not be artificially triggered.",
        "The system accepts sentences containing a maximum of two words.",
        "It is designed to be scalable, allowing larger, more natural sentence sizes also.",
        "System input is therefore a mixture of both one-word and two-word sentences.",
        "The system is required to produce valid descriptions, particularly in the two-word stage.",
        "Rules that enforce syntactic order, and allow for the production of semantically correct descriptions from novel concepts, are desirable.",
        "This paper is sectioned as follows; pre-oneword stage linguistic abilities in children are briefly discussed to explain why initial system functionality assumptions are made; the defining characteristics of both the one-word stage and two-word stage in children are introduced as possible benchmarks for the system; a detailed description of system design and implementation with examples of the learning process and games played by the system are presented; a discussion of current results along with their possible implications follows; a brief review of related works that have influenced this research, citing major influences; the direction and aims of future research is described briefly; and finally, conclusions are drawn."

        "They also show categorical perception to voice, can use formant transition information to mark articulation, and show intonation sensitivity (Pinker, 1994, Jusczyk, 1999).",
        "In terms of production, children produce noises, such as discomfort noises (0-2 months), comfort noises (2-4 months), and \"play\" vocally with pitch and loudness variations (4-7 months) (Pinker, 1994).",

        "Overextension, similarly, is an association that is too broad, such as \"dog\" referring to all four legged animals.",
        "Mismatches, or idiosyncratic referencing also occur, resulting in a word being associated with an unrelated concept, such as \"dog\" referring to a table (Pinker, 1994).",

        "The two-word stage (18-24 months) introduces simple syntax into the child's language faculty.",

        "The system uses syntactic matching alone, but syntactic matching includes holophrastic matching, as discussed earlier.",
        "To determine whether holophrastic data is being used, or syntactic data when a syntactic match is run, the matching algorithm has been split.",
        "The number of correct strings produced using holophrastic data and the number of correct strings produced using syntactic data alone are compared (see Figure 2).",
        "The data demonstrate that the system uses mostly holophrastic matches in early rounds (comparable to the one-word stage).",
        "This is eliminated in further rounds, in favour or syntactic matches alone (the two-word stage).",

        "The syntactic data continues to rise, until it achieves full production.",
        "The holophrastic stage never achieves full production, but peaks, then reduces to zero.",
