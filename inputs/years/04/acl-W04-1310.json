        "Given the restrictions on the subjects and objects that any given verb may take, it seems likely that children might learn verbs partly by exploiting statistical regularities in co-occurrences between verbs and noun phrases.",
        "Pronouns are the most common NPs in the speech that children hear.",
        "We demonstrate that pronouns systematically partition several important classes of verbs, and that a simple statistical learner can exploit these regularities to narrow the range of possible verbs that are consistent with an incomplete utterance.",
        "Taken together, these results suggest that children might use regularities in pronoun/verb co-occurrences to help learn verbs, though whether this is actually so remains a topic for further research."

        "Pronouns stand for central elements of adult conceptual schemes – as Quine pointed out, pronouns \"are the basic media of reference\" (Quine, 1980, p. 13).",
        "In fact, most syntactic subjects in spontaneous spoken adult discourse are pronouns (Chafe, 1994), and English-speaking mothers often begin with a high-frequency pronoun when speaking to their children, with you and I occurring most frequently (e.g., Valian, 1991).",
        "Parents use the inanimate pronoun it far more frequently as the subject of an intransitive sentence than of an transitive one (Cameron-Faulkner et al., 2003, p. 860).",
        "As Cameron-Faulkner et al.",
        "note, this suggests that intransitive sentences are used more often than transitives for talking about inanimate objects.",
        "It also suggests, we would note, that the use of the inanimate pronoun might be a cue for the child as to whether the verb is transitive or intransitive.",
        "Similarly, Lieven and Pine (Lieven et al., 1997; Pine and Lieven, 1993) have suggested that pronouns may form the fixed element in lexically-specific frames acquired by early language learners – soto-speak \"pronoun islands\" something like Tomasello's (1992) \"verb islands.\" Many researchers have suggested that word-word relations in general, and syntactic frames specifically, are particularly important for learning verbs (e.g., Gleitman, 1990; Gleitman and Gillette, 1995).",
        "What has not been studied, to our knowledge, is how pronouns specifically may help children learn verbs by virtue of systematic co-occurrences.",
        "We have begun to address this issue in two steps.",
        "First, we measured the statistical regularities among the uses of pronouns and verbs in a large corpus of parent and child speech.",
        "We found strong regularities in the use of pronouns with several broad classes of verbs.",
        "Second, using the corpus data, we trained a connectionist network to guess which verb belongs in a sentence given only the subject and object, demonstrating that it is possible in principle for a statistical learner to use the regularities in parental speech to deduce information about an unknown verb.",
        "2 Experiment 1 The first experiment consisted of a corpus analysis to identify patterns of co-occurrence between pronouns and verbs in the child's input."

        "Parental utterances from the CHILDES database (MacWhinney, 2000) were coded for syntactic categories, then subjected to cluster analysis.",
        "The mean age of target children represented in the transcripts that were coded for this experiment was 3;0 (SD 1;2).",
        "2.1.1 Materials The following corpora were used: Bates, Bliss, Bloom 1970, Brown, Clark, Cornell, Demetras Working, Gleason, Hall, Higginson, Kuczaj, MacWhinney, Morisset, New England, Post, Sachs, Suppes, Tardiff, Valian, Van Houten, Van Kleeck and Warren-Leubecker.",
        "Coding was performed using a custom web application that randomly selected transcripts, assigned them to coders as they became available, collected coding",
        "input, and stored it in a MySQL database.",
        "The application occasionally assigned the same transcript to all coders, in order to measure reliability.",
        "Five undergraduate coders were trained on the coding task and the use of the system.",
        "The syntactic frames were: no verb, question, passive, copula, intransitive, transitive and ditransitive.",
        "These were considered to be mutually exclusive, i.e., each clause was tagged as belonging to one and only one frame, according to which of the following frames it matched first: (1) The no verb frame included clauses – such as \"Yes\" or \"OK\" – with no main verb.",
        "(2) The question frame included any clause using a question word – such as \"Where did you go?\" – or having inverted word order – such as \"Did you go to the bank?\" – but not merely a question mark – such as \"You went to the bank?\" (3) The passive frame included clauses in the passive voice, such as \"John was hit by the ball.\" (4) The copula frame included clauses with the copula as the main verb, such as \"John is angry.\" (5) The intransitive frame included clauses with no direct object, such as \"John ran.\" The transitive frame included clauses with a direct object but no indirect object, such as \"John hit the ball.\" (6) The ditransitive frame included clauses with an indirect object, such as \"John gave Mary a kiss.\" All nouns were coded in their singular forms, whether they were singular or plural (e.g., \"boys\" was coded as \"boy\"), and all verbs were coded in their infinitive forms, whatever tense they were in (e.g., \"ran\" was coded as \"run\").",
        "In total, 59,977 utterances were coded from 123 transcripts.",
        "All of the coders coded 7 of those transcripts for the purpose of measuring reliability.",
        "Average inter-coder reliability (measured for each coder as the percentage of items coded exactly the same way they were coded by each other coder) was 86.1 %.",
        "Given the number of variables, the number of levels of each variable (3 speakers, 3 addressees, 7 frames, and 6 syntactic relations), and the number of coders (5), the probability of chance agreement is very low.",
        "Although there are some substantive errors (usually with complex embedded clauses or other unusual constructions), many of the discrepancies are simple spelling mistakes or failures to trim words to their roots.",
        "We only considered parental child-directed speech (PCDS), defined as utterances where the speaker was a parent and the addressee was a target child.",
        "A total of 24,286 PCDS utterances were coded, including a total of 28,733 clauses.",
        "More than a quarter (28.36%) of the PCDS clauses contained no verb at all; these were excluded from further analysis.",
        "Clauses that were questions (16.86%), passives (0.02%), and copulas (11.86%) were also excluded from further analysis.",
        "The analysis was conducted using only clauses that were intransitives (17.24% of total PCDS clauses), transitives (24.36%) or ditransitives (1.48%), a total of 12,377 clauses."

        "Absent and omitted arguments were counted among the 50, so, for example, the utterance \"John runs\" would have 3 units activated even though it only has 2 words – the third unit being the \"no object\" unit.",
        "With 50 units each for subject, verb and object, there were a total of 150 input units to the network.",
        "Active input units had a value of 1, and inactive input units had a value of 0.",
        "The network consisted of a two-layer 150-8-150 unit autoassociator with a logistic activation function at the hidden layer and a three separate softmax activation functions (one each for the subject, verb and object) at the output layer – see",
        "Figure 3.",
        "Using the softmax activation function, which ensures that all the outputs in the bank sum to 1, together with the cross-entropy error measure, allows us to interpret the network outputs as probabilities (Bishop, 1995).",
        "The network was trained by the resilient backpropagation algorithm (Riedmiller and Braun, 1993) to map its inputs back onto its outputs.",
        "We chose to use eight units in the hidden layer on the basis of some pilot experiments that varied the number of hidden units.",
        "Networks with fewer hidden units either did not learn the problem sufficiently well or took a long time to converge, whereas networks with more than about 8 hidden units learned quickly but tended to overfit the data.",
        "The data was randomly assigned to two groups: 90% of the data was used for training the network, while 10% was reserved for validating the network's performance.",
        "Starting from different random initial weights, five networks were trained until the cross-entropy on the validation set reached a minimum for each of them.",

        "Similarly, tell, make and say are the most activated verbs when networks are tested with the clause unit activated in the object position (figure not shown), and they are also among the verbs most commonly associated with a clause in the input (see Table 2).",
        "However, the network does not merely learn the relative frequencies of pronouns with verbs.",
        "For example, the verbs most activated by the subject you are have and get (see Figure 5 on page 8 below), neither of which appears in Table 3.",
        "The reason for this, we believe, is that the subject you is strongly associated with the object it (note the strong activation of it in the right column of Figure 5), and the object it, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, is strongly associated with the verbs have and get.",
        "The difference may be observed most clearly when the network is prompted simultaneously with you as the subject and clause as the object (see Figure 6 on page 8 below).",

      "heading": "4 Conclusion",
      "text": [
        "We have shown that there are statistical regularities in co-occurrences between pronouns and verbs in the speech that children hear from their parents.",
        "We have also shown that a simple statistical learner can learn these regularities, including subtle higher-order regularities that are not obvious in a casual glance at the input data, and use them to predict the verb in an incomplete sentence.",
        "How might this help children learn",
        "verbs?",
        "In the first place, hearing a verb framed by pronouns may help the child isolate the verb itself – having simple, short consistent, and high-frequency slot fillers could make it that much easier to segment the relevant word in frames like \"He _ it.\" Second, the information provided by the particular pronouns that are used in a given utterance might help the child isolate the relevant event or action from the blooming, buzzing confusion around it – in English, pronouns can indicate animacy, gender and number, and their order can indicate temporal or causal direction or sequence (e.g., \"You _ it\" versus \"It – you\").",
        "Finally, if we suppose that the child has already learned one verb and its pattern of correlations with pronouns, and then hears another verb being used with the same or a similar pattern of correlations, the child may hypothesize that the unknown verb is similar to the known verb.",
        "For example, a child who understood \"want\" but not \"need\" might observe that \"you\" is usually the subject of both and conclude that \"want,\" like \"need,\" has to do with his desires and not, for example, a physical motion or someone else's state of mind.",
        "The pronoun/verb co-occurrences in the input may thus help the child narrow down the class to which an unknown verb belongs, allowing the learner to focus on further refining her grasp of the verb through subsequent exposures.",
        "Whether children are actually sensitive to these regularities remains an open question.",
        "To the extent that children have actually picked up on the regularities, two predictions should follow.",
        "The first is that children's utterances should exhibit roughly the same co-occurrence patterns as we found in their parents' speech to them.",
        "Therefore, the next step in our research is to determine whether children are using pronouns and verbs together with roughly the same frequencies that they hear in their parents' speech.",
        "This is the subject of research in progress using the coded corpus data from Experiment 1.",
        "Because our hypothesis concerns broad-class verb acquisition, we are focusing on children younger than the age of 3, by which time most children can produce the most common verbs (Dale and Fenson, 1996).",
        "The second prediction that follows from the hypothesis that children might be sensitive to the regularities demonstrated in this paper is that children's comprehension of ordinary verbs should be better when they are used in frames that are consistent with the regularities in the input than when they are used in frames that are inconsistent with those regularities.",
        "Assessing whether this is true requires an experiment testing children's comprehension of real but relatively infrequent verbs in two conditions: a \"consistent\" condition (in which the verb is used with nouns or pronouns that are consistent with the regularities in the corpus) and an \"inconsistent\" condition (in which the verb is used with nouns or pronouns that are inconsistent with the regularities in the corpus).",
        "This experiment is in the planning stages.",
        "Even if children are sensitive to the regularities, this knowledge might not help them learn new verbs.",
        "That is, whether these regularities actually play a role in language acquisition also remains an open question.",
        "To the extent that they do, a third prediction follows: children should be better able to generalize comprehension of novel verbs when they are presented in frames consistent with these regularities.",
        "We are designing an experiment to test this hypothesis.",
        "The argument that the frequency of pronouns and their co-occurrences with verb classes play a role in the acquisition of verbs could be strengthened by showing that it is true in many languages.",
        "The present study considered only English, which is a relatively noun-heavy language in which argument ellipsis is rare.",
        "Some other languages, by contrast, tend to emphasize verbs and frequently drop nominal arguments.",
        "We are especially keen to find out what sorts of cues children might be using to identify verb classes in such languages.",
        "Hence, work is underway to collect comparable data from Japanese and Tamil, verb-heavy languages with frequent argument dropping and case-marked pronouns reflecting various degrees of social status."
