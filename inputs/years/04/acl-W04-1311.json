      "text": [
        "The largely unsupervised, amazingly fast and almost invariably successful learning stint that is language acquisition by children has long been the envy of computer scientists (Bod, 1998; Clark, 2001; Roberts and Atwell, 2002) and a daunting enigma for linguists (Chomsky, 1986; Elman et al., 1996).",
        "Computational models of language acquisition or “grammar induction” are usually divided into two categories, depending on whether they subscribe to the classical generative theory of syntax, or invoke “general-purpose” statistical learning mechanisms.",
        "We believe that polarization between classical and statistical approaches to syntax hampers the integration of the stronger aspects of each method into a common powerful framework.",
        "On the one hand, the statistical approach is geared to take advantage of the considerable progress made to date in the areas of distributed representation and probabilistic learning, yet generic “connection-ist” architectures are ill-suited to the abstraction and processing of symbolic information.",
        "On the other hand, classical rule-based systems excel in just those tasks, yet are brittle and difficult to train.",
        "We are developing an approach to the acquisition of distributional information from raw input (e.g., transcribed speech corpora) that also supports the distillation of structural regularities comparable to those captured by Context Sensitive Grammars out of the accrued statistical knowledge.",
        "In thinking about such regularities, we adopt Langacker’s notion of grammar as “simply an inventory of linguistic units” ((Langacker, 1987), p.63).",
        "To detect potentially useful units, we identify and process partially redundant sentences that share the same word sequences.",
        "We note that the detection of paradigmatic variation within a slot in a set of otherwise identical aligned sequences (syntagms) is the basis for the classical distributional theory of language (Harris, 1954), as well as for some modern work (van Zaanen, 2000).",
        "Likewise, the pattern – the syntagm and the equivalence class of complementary-distribution symbols that may appear in its open slot – is the main representational building block of our system, ADIOS (for Automatic DIstillation Of Structure).",
        "Our goal in the present short paper is to illustrate some of the capabilities of the representations learned by our method vis a vis standard tests used by developmental psychologists, by second-language instructors, and by linguists.",
        "Thus, the main computational principles behind the ADIOS model are outlined here only briefly.",
        "The algorithmic details of our approach and accounts of its learning from CHILDES corpora appear elsewhere (Solan et al., 2003a; Solan et al., 2003b; Solan et al., 2004; Edelman et al., 2004)."

      "heading": "2 The principles behind the ADIOS algorithm",
      "text": [
        "The representational power of ADIOS and its capacity for unsupervised learning rest on three principles: (1) probabilistic inference of pattern significance, (2) context-sensitive generalization, and (3) recursive construction of complex patterns.",
        "Each of these is described briefly below.",
        "Probabilisticeinference of pattern significance.",
        "AmoS represents a corpus of sentences as an initially highly redundant directed graph, which can be informally visualized as a tangle of strands that are partially segregated into bundles.",
        "Each of these consists of some strands clumped together; a bundle is formed when two or more strands join together and 5353 run in parallel and is dissolved when more strands leave the bundle than stay in.",
        "In a given corpus, there will be many bundles, with each strand (sentence) possibly participating in several.",
        "Our algorithm, described in detail in (Solan et al., 2004), identifies significant bundles that balance high compression (small size of the bundle “lexicon”) against good generalization (the ability to generate new grammatical sentences by splicing together various strand fragments each of which belongs to a different bundle).",
        "Context sensitivity of patterns.",
        "A pattern is an abstraction of a bundle of sentences that are identical up to variation in one place, where one of several symbols – the members of the equivalence class associated with the pattern – may appear (Figure 1).",
        "Because this variation is only allowed in the contextt specifiedobysthe pattern, the generalization afforded by a set of patterns is inherently safer than in approaches that posit globally valid categories (“parts of speech”) and rules (“grammar”).",
        "The reliance of Amos onomany context-sensitive patterns rather than on traditional rules can be compared both to the Construction Grammar (discussed later) and to Langacker’s concept of the grammar as a collection of “patterns of all intermediate degrees of generality” ((Langacker, 1987), p.46).",
        "Hierarchical structure of patterns.",
        "The ADIOS graph is rewired every time a new pattern is detected, so that a bundle of strings subsumed by it is represented by a single new edge.",
        "Following the rewiring, which is context-specific, potentially far-apart symbols that used to straddle the newly abstracted pattern become close neighbors.",
        "Patterns thus become hierarchically structured in that their elements may be either terminals (i.e., fully specified strings) or other patterns.",
        "Moreover, patterns may refer to themselves, which opens the door for recursion."

      "heading": "3 Related computational and linguistic formalisms and psycholinguistic findings",
      "text": [
        "Unlike ADIOS, very few existing algorithms for unsupervised language acquisition use raw, unannotated corpus data (as opposed, say, to sentences converted into sequences of POS tags).",
        "The only work described in a recent review (Roberts and Atwell, 2002) as completely unsupervised – the GraSp model (Henrichsen, 2002) – does attempt to induce syntax from raw transcribed speech, yet it is not completely data-driven in that it makes a prior commitment to a particular theory of syntax (Cate-gorial Grammar, complete with a pre-specified set of allowed categories).",
        "Because of the unique nature of our chosen challenge – finding structure in language rather than imposing it – the following brief survey of grammar induction focuses on contrasts and comparisons to approaches that generally stop short of attempting to do what our algorithm does.",
        "We distinguish between approaches that are motivated computationally (Local Grammar and Variable Order Markov models, and Tree Adjoining Grammar, discussed elsewhere (Edelman et al., 2004), and those whose main motivation is linguistic and cognitive psychological (Cognitive and Construction grammars, discussed below).",
        "Local Grammar and Markov models.",
        "In capturing the regularities inherent in multiple crisscrossing paths through a corpus, ADIOS superficially resembles finite-state Local Grammars (Gross, 1997) and Variable Order Markov (VOM) models (Guyon and Pereira, 1995).",
        "The VOM approach starts by postulating a maximum-n structure, which is then fitted to the data by maximizing the likelihood of the training corpus.",
        "The ADIOS philosophy differs from the VOM approach in several key respects.",
        "First, rather than fitting a model to the data, we use the data to construct a (recursively structured) graph.",
        "Thus, our algorithm naturally addresses the inference of the graph’s structure, a task that is more difficult than the estimation of parameters for a given configuration.",
        "Second, because ADIOS works from the bottom up in a recursive, data-driven fashion, it is less susceptible to complexity issues.",
        "It can be used on huge graphs, and may yield very large patterns, which in a VOM model would correspond to an unmanageably high order n. Third, ADIOS transcends the idea of VOM structure, in the following sense.",
        "Consider a set of patterns of the form b1[c1]b2[c2]b3, etc.",
        "The equivalence classes [·] may include vertices of the graph (both words and word patterns turned into nodes), wild cards (i.e., any node), as well as ambivalent cards (any node or no node).",
        "This means that the terminal-level length of the string represented by a pattern does not have to be of a fixed length.",
        "This goes conceptually beyond the variable order Markov structure: b2 [c2] b3 do not have to appear in a Markov chain of a finite order 1 1b211 + 1 1c211 + 1 1 b311 because the size of [c2] is ill-defined, as explained above.",
        "Fourth, as we showed earlier (Figure 2), ADIOS incorporates both context-sensitive substitution and recursion.",
        "Tree Adjoining Grammar.",
        "The proper place in the Chomsky hierarchy for the class of strings accepted by our model is between Context Free and Context Sensitive Languages.",
        "The pattern-based representations employed by ADIOS have counterparts for each of the two composition operations, substitution and adjoining, that characterize a Tree Adjoining Grammar, or TAG, developed by Joshi and others (Joshi and Schabes, 1997).",
        "Specifically, both substitution and adjoining are subsumed in the relationships that hold among ADIOS patterns, such as the membership of one pattern in another.",
        "Consider a pattern Pi and its equivalence class £(Pi); any other pattern P; E £(Pi) can be seen as substitutable in Pi.",
        "Likewise, if P; E £(Pi), Pk E £(Pi) and Pk E £ (P; ), then the pattern P; can be seen as adjoinable to Pi.",
        "Because of this correspondence between the TAG operations and the ADIOS patterns, we believe that the latter represent regularities that are best described by Mildly Context-Sensitive Language formalism (Joshi and Schabes, 1997).",
        "Importantly, because the ADIOS patterns are learned from data, they already incorporate the constraints on substitution and adjoining that in the original TAG framework must be specified manually.",
        "Psychological and linguistic evidence for pattern-based representations.",
        "Recent advances in understanding the psychological role of representations based on what we call patterns, or constructions (Goldberg, 2003), focus on the use of statistical cues such as conditional probabilities in pattern learning (Saffran et al., 1996; G´omez, 2002), and on the importance of exemplars and constructions in children’s language acquisition (Cameron-Faulkner et al., 2003).",
        "Converging evidence for the centrality of pattern-like structures is provided by corpus-based studies of prefabs – sequences, continuous or discontinuous, of words that appear to be prefabricated, that is, stored and retrieved as a whole, rather than being subject to syntactic processing (Wray, 2002).",
        "Similar ideas concerning the ubiquity in syntax of structural peculiarities hitherto marginalized as “exceptions” are now being voiced by linguists (Culicover, 1999; Croft, 2001).",
        "The main methodological tenets of ADIOS – populating the lexicon with “units” of varying complexity and degree of entrenchment, and using cognition-general mechanisms for learning and representation – fit the spirit of the foundations of Cognitive Grammar (Langacker, 1987).",
        "At the same time, whereas the cognitive grammarians typically face the chore of hand-crafting structures that would reflect the logic of language as they perceive it, ADIOS discovers the primitives of grammar empirically and autonomously.",
        "The same is true also for the comparison between ADIOS and the various Construction Grammars (Goldberg, 2003; Croft, 2001), which are all hand-crafted.",
        "A construction grammar consists of elements that differ in their complexity and in the degree to which they are specified: an idiom such as “big deal” is a fully specified, immutable construction, whereas the expression “the X, the Y” – as in “the more, the better” (Kay and Fillmore, 1999) – is a partially specified template.",
        "The patterns learned by ADIOS likewise vary along the dimensions of complexity and specificity (e.g., not every pattern has an equivalence class)."

        "After 14 real-time days, the algorithm (version 7.3) identified 3400 patterns and 3200 equivalence classes.",
        "The outcome was encouraging: the algorithm found intuitively significant patterns and produced semantically adequate corresponding equivalence sets.",

        "We first trained the model on 10, 000 sentences from CHILDES, then compared its performance on (1) 1000 previously unseen sentences and (2) the same sentences in each of which a single random word order switch has been carried out.",
        "The results, shown in Figure 5, indicate a substantial sensitivity of the ADIOS input module to simple deviations from grammaticality in novel data, even after a very brief training.",

        "We replicated this experiment by training ADIOS on 432 strings from L1, with |X |= 2, 6,12, 24.",
        "The stimuli were the same strings as in the original experiment, with the individual letters serving as the basic symbols.",

        "Furthermore, the variance in the scores of the randomly permuted sentences was significantly larger (p < 0.005), suggesting that this kind of permutation violates the sentence structure more severely, but may also sometimes create acceptable sentences by chance.",
        "Previous tests showed that ADIOS is very good at recognizing perturbed CFG-generated sentences as such, but it remains to be seen whether or not ADIOS also exhibits differential behavior on the adjacent and non-adjacent permutations.",

        "Indeed, the scores in a magnitude experiment must be composites of several factors – at the very least, well-formedness and meaningfulness.",
        "We are presently exploring various means of acquiring and dealing with such multidimensional “acceptability” data.",
        "ADIOS is sensitive to the presentation order of the training sentences, 30 instances were trained on randomized versions of the training set.",
        "Eight human subjects were then asked to estimate acceptability of 20 sentences from the original corpus, intermixed randomly with 20 sentences generated by the trained versions of ADIOS.",
        "The precision, calculated as the average number of sentences accepted by the subjects divided by the total number of sentences in the set (20), was 0.73 f 0.2 for sentences from the original corpus and 0.67 f 0.07 for the sentences generated by ADIOS.",

        "The ADIOS approach to the representation of linguistic knowledge resembles the Construction Grammar in its general philosophy (e.g., in its reliance on structural generalizations rather than on syntax projected by the lexicon), and the Tree Adjoining Grammar in its computational capacity (e.g., in its apparent ability to accept Mildly Context Sensitive Languages).",
        "The representations learned by the ADIOS algorithm are truly emergent from the (unannotated) corpus data.",
        "Previous studies focused on the algorithm that makes such learning possible (Solan et al., 2004; Edelman et al., 2004).",
        "In the present paper, we concentrated on testing the input module that allows the acquired patterns to be used in processing novel stimuli.",
        "The results of the tests we described here are encouraging, but there is clearly room for improvement.",
        "We believe that the most pressing issue in this regard is developing a conceptually and computationally well-founded approach to the notion of cover (that is, a distributed representation of a novel sentence in terms of the existing patterns).",
        "Intuitively, the best case, which should receive the top score, is when there is a single pattern that precisely covers the entire input, possibly in addition to other evoked patterns that are only partially active.",
        "We are currently investigating various approaches to scoring distributed representations in which several patterns are highly active.",
        "A crucial constraint that applies to such cases is that a good cover should give a proper expression to the subtleties of long-range dependencies and binding, many of which are already captured by the ADIOS learning algorithm.",
