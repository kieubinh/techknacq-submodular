        "The design of speech segmentations methods has been much studied ever since Harris’ seminal propositions (1955).",
        "Research conducted since the mid 1990’s by cognitive scientists (Brent and Cartwright, 1996; Saffran et al., 1996) has established it as a paradigm of its own in the field of computational models of language acquisition.",
        "In this paper, we investigate two boundary-based approaches to speech segmentation.",
        "Such methods “attempt to identify individual word-boundaries in the input, without reference to words per se” (Brent and Cartwright, 1996).",
        "The first approach we discuss relies on the utterance-boundary strategy, which consists in reusing the information provided by the occurrence of specific phoneme sequences at utterance beginnings or endings in order to hypoth'To avoid a latent ambiguity, it should be stated that speech segmentation refers here to a process taking as input a sequence of symbols (usually phonemes) and producing as output a sequence of higher-level units (usually words).",
        "esize boundaries inside utterances (Aslin et al., 1996; Christiansen et al., 1998; Xanthos, 2004).",
        "The second approach is based on the predictability strategy, which assumes that speech should be segmented at locations where some measure of the uncertainty about the next symbol (phoneme or syllable for instance) is high (Harris, 1955; Gammon, 1969; Saffran et al., 1996; Hutchens and Adler, 1998; Xanthos, 2003).",
        "Our implementation of the utterance-boundary strategy is based on n-grams statistics.",
        "It was previously found to perform a “safe” word segmentation, that is with a rather high precision, but also too conservative as witnessed by a not so high recall (Xanthos, 2004).",
        "As regards the predictability strategy, we have implemented an incremental interpretation of the classical successor count (Harris, 1955).",
        "This approach also relies on the observation of phoneme sequences, the length of which is however not restricted to a fixed value.",
        "Consequently, the memory load involved by the successor count algorithm is expected to be higher than for the utterance-boundary approach, and its performance substantially better.",
        "The experiments presented in this paper were inspired by the intuition that both algorithms could be combined in order to make the most of their respective strengths.",
        "The utterance-boundary typicality could be used as a computationally inexpensive preprocessing step, finding some true boundaries without inducing too many false alarms; then, the heavier machinery of the successor count would be used to accurately detect more boundaries, its burden being lessened as it would process the chunks produced by the first algorithm rather than whole utterances.",
        "We will show the results obtained for a word segmentation task on a phonetically transcribed and child-oriented French corpus, focusing on the effect of the preprocessing step on precision and recall, as well as its impact on",
        "memory load and processing time.",
        "The next section is devoted to the formal definition of both algorithms.",
        "Section 3 discusses some issues related to the space and time complexity they involve.",
        "The experimental setup as well as the results of the simulations are described in section 4, and in conclusion we will summarize our findings and suggest directions for further research."

        "However, the actual gain depends on the redundancy of the corpus at utterances level, and even in an acquisition corpus, many utterances occur only once.",
        "The time needed to compute the frequency of an n-gram is reduced accordingly, and due to the average efficiency of hash coding, the time involved by the storage of an utterance is approximately as low as in the naive case above.",
        "It is possible to store not only the frequency of utterances, but also that of their subparts.",
        "In this approach, storing an n-gram and retrieving its frequency need comparable time resources, expected to be low if hashing is performed.",
        "Of course, from the point of view of memory load, this is much more expensive than the two previous implementations discussed.",

        "Besides complexity issues, there is a problem of data sparseness with the successor count, as it decreases very quickly while the size n of the context grows.",
        "In the case of our quite redundant child-oriented corpus, the (weighted) average of the successor count12 for a random n-gram �w�Sn f(w) succ(w) gets lower than 1 for n > 9 (see figure 5).",
        "This means that in most utterances, no more boundary can be inserted after the first 9 phonemes (respectively before the last 9 phonemes) unless we get close enough to the other extremity of the utterance for the predecessor (respectively successor) count to operate.",
        "As regards the utterance-boundary typicality, on the other hand, the position in the utterance makes no difference.",
        "As a consequence, many examples can be found in our corpus, where the middle part of a long utterance would be undersegmented by the successor count alone, whereas preprocessing provides it with more tractable chunks.",
        "This is illustrated by the following segmentations of the utterance (Daddy doesn’t",
        "like carrots), where vertical bars denote boundaries predicted by the utterance-boundary typicality (for r = 5), and dashes represent boundaries inferred by the successor count:",
        "This suggests that the utterance-boundary strategy could be more than an additional device that safely predicts some boundaries that the successor count alone might have found or not: it could actually have a functional relationship with it.",
        "If the predictability strategy has some relevance for speech segmentation in early infancy (Saffran et al., 1996), then it may be necessary to counterbalance the data sparseness; this is what these authors implicitely do by using first-order transition probabilities, and it would be easy to define an nth order successor count in the same way.",
        "Yet another possibility would be to “reset” the successor count after each boundary inserted.",
