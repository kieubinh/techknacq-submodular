        "Corporations willing to go multilingual face two main difficulties, especially at the beginning.",
        "The first one is that many organisations are not acquainted with the processes behind internationalising their many products, documents, web pages and database interfaces effectively, so they opt to reduce the costs of localisation (and some even do not dare to step in and consequently remain monolingual).",
        "The second problem, which may derive from problem number one, relates to the fact that the corporation is then likely to end up hiring the wrong translation team or language service vendor after promising a top quality product1 quickly and inexpensively.",
        "Unfortunately, qualified and truly skilled candidates for posts in translation, localisation, internationalisation, and language-related project management are very difficult to find.",
        "Despite the growing competition among language service",
        "vendors and providers, the language industry is relatively immature.",
        "It is composed of young language service companies that are highly project-driven.",
        "The lessons learned in one project may be left behind and are often not assembled in a baseline knowledge solution to be retrieved and leveraged later.",
        "The fact that most companies, regardless of whether they outsource2 their translation jobs or have their own inhouse language service department, pay little attention to the integration, reusability of and interaction with language resources for translation (LR4Trans) within a project, let alone from project to project, constitutes a less than desirable panorama for the creation of corporate multilingual content.",
        "So far, the leverage of LR4Trans has been limited to translation memory systems, where previously translated content is available to the translator through a software tool.",
        "This technology is not by any means new or highly sophisticated.",
        "While insufficient attention has been given to the integration of translation memories with other language resources and technologies3 in the workflow, modes of accessing translation memory databases have evolved from purely standalone to distributed data, either synchronised with a central database or as a remotely4 accessed central database.",
        "2 Since the 1980s and 1990s, outsourcing of translation, as of many highly specialised business processes, has become prevalent.",
        "In an attempt to lower translation-mediated communication costs, most activities, even the application of translation memory tools, are managed outside the boundaries of the corporate firewall.",
        "As a result, translation memories have gradually become widely adopted and almost the indispensable tool of the trade.",
        "Commercial producers of translation memory packages claim that, if properly used and maintained, they are valuable corporate knowledge resources.",
        "The question is whether translation memories constitute the only possible corporate language resource containing corporate knowledge, or whether there can be other components, agents and processes that play an important role in multilingual content as well.",
        "In the next section we would like to carefully examine the notion of knowledge in connection with those of LR4Trans and multilingual content."

      "heading": "2.1 Language resources and Knowledge",
      "text": [
        "The breadth and depth of knowledge required today in order to perform a good quality technical or specialised corporate translation relies upon a panoply of language resources (LR) in machine-readable form, which are self-created in the corporation or purchased from external parties (sister organisations, domain-specific specialist groups and societies, applied software and solution companies, etc.).",
        "In this panoply of corporate LR4Trans, one may find domain specific terminology, source and target language dictionaries of corporation-dependant word meanings, source and target language structures and rules, a corporate language stylesheet, appendix of phrases and expressions denoting cultural differences within a (multinational) corporation or when attempting global expansion, prescriptive and descriptive notes about the corporation “culture”, among others.",
        "All these resources contain precious corporate knowledge that should be taken into consideration and be made accessible to all corporate members and partners accordingly.",
        "Tagging or flagging the knowledge in those language resources will be extremely useful for optimising - on a constant basis - not only the resources themselves but the whole of the multilingual content production process.",
        "Tags or flags, normally called content properties, content attibutes or metadata, are aimed at retrieving a content unit when necessary and preventing loss of content.",
        "It is precisely thanks to these attributes, often visualised to the content repository into an external translation process, and then returns in one or more new languages – a further challenge, especially if there is not yet an effective content management system in place.",
        "user by means colours or other agreed conventions, that a content management system can manage content even if it moves across multiple languages or sites.",
        "Capturing that knowledge will thus be helpful when developing scalable and adaptive applications for managing corporate multilingual content.",
        "2.2 From LR4Trans to knowledge repositories and content management systems A corporate knowledge-geared multilingual content strategy is open to a varying degree of automation, in terms of not only linguistic processing but also in content transaction5 operations, on the basis of the type of documentation, business conditioning factors, etc.",
        "It usually combines tightly integrated translation technologies (and maybe other kind of human language technologies) with human specialist intervention, i.e. unique6 language work processes, which have to be driven by highly skilled linguists.",
        "This form of knowledge-based translation work aims to bridge the gap between low cost, poor output machine-only translation and costly high-quality human-only translation.",
        "Although this could be seen as a type of machine-aided human translation (MAHT), we would like to emphasise the issue of knowledge, corporate knowledge in particular, which precisely ought to be captured into the translation system’s knowledge base.",
        "This corporate knowledge base, characterised for being configurable and updatable, will detect and classify the knowledge present in the language resources into: general knowledge, domain-specific knowledge and, knowledge specific to each individual customer or department within the organisation.",
        "The knowledge base will nonetheless be acting as a single repository with the following possible functions7: automated identification of terms that 5 Transaction costs can outweigh translation costs, especially when the creation and maintenance of multilingual content is required for e-learning or e-customer support.",
        "6 Ideally tailor-made and customisable, that is, conceived for the corporation or the client they work in or for.",
        "7 These functions will be linked to one another and called according to the stage of multilingual content creation we are in.",
        "A function or component may be called more than once within the multilingual content are candidates for once-only translation; spotting of translation for terms from previously translated, aligned texts; semi or automated creation of domain and/or customer-specific terminology, dictionaries and glossaries; creation and regular update of domain and/or customer-specific language rules; implementation of domain and/or customer-specific translation memories; dynamic and integrative machine translation, making use of customised dictionaries (lexicons) and language rules; translation and edition application, ideally increasing ease of use by showing colour-coded aligned bi-texts (bilingual) or multi-texts (multilingual) with a context expansion feature and highlighting terminology; and, most importantly, automated and user-dependant feedback of new knowledge into the knowledge base.",
        "3 The envisaged scenario: workflows, content management systems, and agents Having the corporate knowledge base linked to various LR4Trans, as presented in section 2 makes us think of a procedural and very agile multilingual content workflow.",
        "But let us examine it in greater detail starting to look at the simplest of workflows first (figure 1):",
        "Typically authors do not edit or approve content for translation.",
        "The texts to translate, usually from an unstructured document collection, are handed over to the translator, who does translate without having the chance to get feedback from the authorship department.",
        "There is neither an obvious use of language resources in machine-readable form nor a corporate knowledge detection and exploitation strategy in operation.",
        "This poor production process will have negative consequences in terms of the quality of the product translation (e.g. lacking consistency, production lifecycle.",
        "frequent content losses, etc.)",
        "and costs, particularly in the long run.",
        "In order to streamline the procurement and management of corporate multilingual content we propose the following workflow (see figure 2 in the appendix).",
        "Its main assets would be an overall corporate knowledge base linked to various LR4Trans, as appropriate, and maintained by all agents8 intervening in the workflow, plus a content management system, or CMS, that would reflect the business roles controlling the workflow, data production and update flow, user roles and access privileges, costing rules, etc.",
        "In contrast to figure 1, the following features can be found in the workflow presented in figure 2:",
        "• Cyclic nature of content, from monolingual to multilingual, and back to enhance and expand the first; • Corporate content is traceable and its state and structure can be followed-up at all times; • Authors are aware of what happens at the other end, and so are capable of “writing for translation”, that is, editing or approving content that will be later received by an audience or market of another language and culture.",
        "In other words, the package of the content starts being taken care of from the beginning; • Translators are connected with the authoring department: the concepts of content negotiation and feedback are essential here.",
        "Translators, being intercultural mediators, have a strong say in issues of international content relevancy.",
        "CMS are meant to work seamlessly in the background, automatically identifying changes in the content (e.g. keeping track of the content production or processing stage, keeping a log of agent participation, etc.)",
        "by means of a built-in feedback loop mechanism.",
        "Besides, a multilingual CMS comes to live action when, as some kind of document gate keeper and donor, passes on the content from one agent to another,",
        "notifying him or her of any vital new piece of information: “a new translation has been received”, “glossary validated by expert XY and saved today at 18:27 hours”, “not possible to close up project before client acceptancy test”.",
        "CMS are usually dependant on the corporate knowledge base.",
        "Together, they define the workflow and have interaction capabilities with the various users by means of secure interfaces, usually very similar to a web portal for internal and very often external use, too (mainly for workers or at different sites and clients).",
        "Concerning language work, it is extremely important that both online and offline editing and review of content are allowed.",
        "In other words, the corporate knowledge base has to be centralised (online use) and yet distributed at times (offline use).",
        "It will be the system, which will manage the synchronisation of content and knowledge base alterations and updates across all the different user types.",
        "The CMS thus relies heavily upon automated mechanisms (e.g. automatic updating of the translation memory once the project translations have gone through the review process) but needs skilled human intervention to improve its efficiency over time."

        "After introducing some commonplace problematic issues surrounding the creation, managing and leveraging of multilingual content, we have analysed the interrelation of corporate knowledge and language resources for translation in a corporate setting.",
        "It has been argued that the corporate knowledge residing in the corporation documentation and language resources has to be captured and introduced in a corporate knowledge base, which has to be made accessible to and constantly cared for by all agents intervening in the multilingual content workflow, not only by linguists.",
        "We have gone on to underline the importance of having a content management system in place, in order to account for and dynamise the tasks and processes within the workflow.",
        "Other relevant issues such as linkage between resources, knowledge base and CMS, and balance between automation and human intervention have been discussed."
