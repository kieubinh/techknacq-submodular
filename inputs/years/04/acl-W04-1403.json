        "Since its emergence in the mid 1980s, localisation has largely been defined as the linguistic and cultural adaptation of products for specific locales.",
        "Over the past 20 years, Localisation has become one of the engines driving the development of the multilingual information society and probably the first industrial sector where language resources have been used widely and consistently on large-scale commercial projects.",
        "Localisation professionals must prepare very large amounts of digital content simultaneously for different markets in acceptable quality and at affordable costs.",
        "This is only possible with the support of language resources, such as written and spoken corpora, translation memories and terminology databases, as well as the appropriate software tools for the acquisition, preparation, collection, management, customisation and use of these resources.",
        "In the following paragraphs, we will provide an overview of the current state of the localisation industry and its requirements, and focus on those aspects of the localisation process where the successful use of language resources is crucial for the timely delivery of multilingual digital content.",
        "We will describe some of the most widely used language resources in localisation.",
        "Finally, we will describe major current research efforts relating to language resources and localisation, and highlight the opportunity for the establishment of a Language Resources Centre for Localisation.",
        "2 The changing face of localisation In this section, we will provide some background information which will help to explain the reasons for the changing needs of the localisation industry, particularly in relation to language resources."

        "Any content made available on the digital networks (e.g. the internet) becomes instantly available to millions of people across the globe.",
        "To make this content accessible, however, it needs to be localised.",
        "In today’s cyberspace, posting digital content in just one language is not sufficient anymore.",
        "Of a total online language population of 680 million in September 2003, only 35.5% spoke English as a mother tongue, but 25% spoke Chinese, Japanese or Korean (CJK) and another",
        "25% Spanish, German, French, Italian and Portuguese.",
        "In this scenario, localisation is a prerequisite for the provision of equal access to the digital information society independently of an individual’s cultural and linguistic background or their geographical location and, at the same time, offers enormous business potential.",
        "In addition, it is evident that localised digital content (applications and systems) is a prerequisite for the preservation of linguistic and cultural diversity in the digital world.",
        "According to US-analysts Allied Business Intelligence, the worldwide market for translation and software or web localisation is growing from US$11 billion (1999) to US$20 billion this year.",
