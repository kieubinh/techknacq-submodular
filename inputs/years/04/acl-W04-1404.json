        "Machine Translation (MT) was nominated on the first place among the 10 emerging technologies who will change the world (Technical Review 2004).",
        "It is expected that with the increased number of official language in Europe, and the continuous growth of non-English Internet resources, machine translation systems will become an indispensable tool in everyday work.",
        "For the moment high-quality MT-systems are on one hand expensive and on the other hand domain oriented.",
        "The on-line existent tools produce poor-quality translation, and very often offer a false image of current translation engines capabilities.",
        "The main reason why on-line machine translation tools offer so poor results is that they rely either on corpus-based methods trained on a limited number of examples or they infer rules from a limited linguistic knowledge base (Gaspari 2002).",
        "Following the statistics published in (McLaughlin and Schwall 1998) already in 1998 there were at least 25 countries with more than 500 000 Internet users, and in at least half of these countries English is neither the first nor the second spoken language.",
        "This statistic shows clearly that access to on-line information can be guaranteed only through high-quality on-line machine translation tools.",
        "However, an on-line translation system has a number of specific requirements (i.e. different from the “traditional” ones): - It has to be fast but not always perfect.",
        "The translation of web-documents is more a kind of “translation for assimilation” in the Carbonell’s classification (Carbonell 1994).",
        "However it has to go beyond the word-to-word quality offered by the actual on-line systems - A large number of languages / pair of languages have to be covered - The system has to be a “fully integrated black box”.",
        "Most part of the users do not have the expertise to tune different parameters.",
        "There are different approaches to automatic translation, however not all of them are suited to be used for on-line translation.",
        "1.",
        "Rule-based MT systems are based on complex linguistic modules both in the analysis and generation phase",
        "(morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics).",
        "Such modules are developed for only few languages and they are not commercially –free available.",
        "The implementation of such modules requires deep linguistic knowledge in both languages (especially for the transfer rules)",
        "2.",
        "Knowledge-based MT systems are strongly domain dependent and rely on domain-specific ontologies.",
        "Most part of the ontologies were developed previously only for commercial products, and therefore are not free available 3.",
        "Corpus-based MT systems (example – based and statistical-based) are younger on the market, and provide good translation quality, especially for assimilation purposes.",
        "They are based on large parallel aligned corpora, or on translation databases.",
        "In the first case considerable amount of text is aligned usually at the paragraph level; in the latter translation chunks are collected (usually the chunks are sentences or even smaller units.)",
        "Most part of the currently existent on-line translation systems adopt a very simplistic rule-based approach, i.e. the translation is reduced to dictionary lookup followed by a morphological processing, and very simple syntactic transfer rules.",
        "Within the Semantic Web activities it is assumed that a big amount of internet resources will be semantically annotated.",
        "This opens new perspectives for the corpus-based MT Systems, and makes them a serious candidate for on-line translation.",
        "This paper is organised as follows: in section 2 we present the main principles of semantic web.",
        "In section 3 we describe a type of MT-System who can benefit from the Semantic Web activities.",
        "and show how Semantic Web technologies can be used to improve the quality of on-line Machine Translation systems.",
        "In section 4 we present directions of future work."

        "The main aim of Semantic Web is to enrich documents with semantic information about the content and to develop powerful mechanisms capable of interpreting this information.",
