      "text": [
        "As a trainer for translation tools, I usually hold one or two-day training classes to teach the participants how to use translation memory systems, alignment systems and terminology databases.",
        "It is a mix of overview presentations, hands-on training - either trainer and participants in parallel or participants on their own - and question and answer sessions on topics that arise out of the use of the tools or specific issues the participants have had in the past.",
        "Many of my participants tell me that they finally decided to a take training class, after having tried to get along with the tools by themselves for quite some time and finding that they cannot use the tools efficiently as they don't know how to use all the features available.",
        "Some had used the tools for years and found during our class that there would have been an easier way of doing things if they had just known it.",
        "Also, many would like to go to a training class, but either have no local dealer/training center that offers such a training or simply cannot afford to be away from work for 2 or 3 days.",
        "For freelancers especially, the cost of training, travel and time away from work is sometimes prohibitive."

        "Video conferencing was one possibility, but the equipment for that was just too expensive, so I turned to the internet.",
        "Taping classes was another idea, but here amount of time and money that had to be spent on keeping the tapes up-to-date was too high.",
        "And it lacked the interactive component that is crucial to software training classes.",
        "I found a technology that is often called \"virtual meeting center\" and that promised to offer all the things I needed.",
        "The ability to meet on the internet in real time independent of country or time, an accompanying phone conference functionality and an \"application sharing\" feature that would allow me to show the software to be worked with.",
        "A virtual meeting basically is a website where all participants log into at the same time, password protected of course.",
        "They come to a meeting space that shows a window where the trainer can load documents or presentations.",
        "Also there are usually a chat window for written conversation and a list of participants to one side of the screen.",
        "For collaborative work there is a whiteboard feature that lets all participants draw onto the same space in the presentation window.",
        "To train software this way, the trainer can use the \"application sharing\" feature.",
        "Whichever application he/she starts will be visible on the screens of all participants (with a small delay depending on the speed of the internet connections).",
        "It is also possible to have some of the participants show their screen to the rest of the group.",
        "The voice part of the meeting can be managed by a phone conference in parallel or by also using the internet with so-called \"voice-over-IP\", so that no additional phone call is necessary.",
        "The usage of the platform is usually billed per minute per user.",
        "Phone conferences are billed extra, voice-over-IP is included in the meeting minute price.",
        "There are now many platforms that offer virtual meeting space.",
        "To find the one that suits trainer and participants best, I tested several of them (please find a list of some meeting platforms at the end of this document).",
        "To be able to use this technology effectively, I found it useful for the trainer to use a headset instead of holding the phone receiver, to keep both hands free for typing and navigating the applications.",
        "For voice-over-IP this is a must anyway.",

        "(For technical difficulties at login and such the provider of the platform usually has a technical hotline - the trainer might need a separate phone line to contact this hotline without leaving the group alone.)",
        "As the screen for the trainer and the participants may look differently (number of menus or buttons available), the trainer should know what the participants can see and what they can't see.",
        "For the first meetings it might make sense for the trainer to be logged in twice - once as a trainer and once as a participant.",
        "This will increase cost, as the platform has to be paid for by minute per participant, but it helps the trainer to control what the group can see or do.",
        "As an absolute MUST, the trainer has to include a \"get-to-know-the-technology\" session for each group at the beginning of a new class or whenever a new participant joins the group.",
        "This should include a short introduction of the meeting window with all the functionalities that are available, i.e. chat area, participants list, question button (to signal the trainer that one wants to ask a question), menus and commands to share an application and so on.",
        "Another obstacle might be screen size.",
        "If the trainer has a larger screen than the participants and works in full screen mode for application sharing for example, the participants will not be able to see all of the trainer's screen.",
        "This has to be checked in the first meeting as well, so that the trainer can adjust the window size of what he/she is showing, to the size of what all participants can see on their screens.",
        "This can take up to 10 minutes and should be included in the session schedule.",
        "On the first meeting a short round of introductions should be held.",
        "If available the participants / trainer can show a video picture or a picture in a graphics file to the group and introduce themselves.",

        "This time span has to be kept in mind during the complete session.",

        "In which time the other person might have decided that nothing was coming forth and started talking again.",
        "In this case the two sound information pieces would overlay each other, making it very hard to understand who said what.",

        "All applications that will be shown, all documents and presentations that will be loaded to the meeting window have to be present and open before the meeting starts.",
        "Looking for a file to show during a meeting does not give a very professional impression as well as costing time and money.",
        "All along the session, from the greeting of the participants, the introduction to the technology and throughout the session, the trainer will always have to explain what he/she is doing at the moment.",
        "Especially if some of the participants have a slower connection than others, the next screen to be shown should be explained until everybody can see it on their screens.",
        "Asking often if there are any questions or if anybody cannot see the screen or complete the task in a hands-on period, helps to bridge those silences that tend to come up in phone conferences when nobody knows what is coming next.",
        "And it also helps participants to ask their questions which they might not dare ask otherwise for fear of interrupting the trainer.",
        "Again this is very demanding on the trainer, so that a 2 hour session is probably the most an internet session should last.",
        "Also the trainer needs to be very aware of his/her actions on the screen.",
        "Using the mouse pointer to show or circle some item on the screen should be done deliberately and slowly otherwise the participants will only see a fuzzy, uncoordinated motion on their screens.",
