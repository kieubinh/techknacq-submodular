        "Among the variety of proposals currently making the dependency perspective on grammar more concrete, there are several treebanks whose annotation exploits some form of Relational Structure that we can consider a generalization of the fundamental idea of dependency at various degrees and with reference to different types of linguistic knowledge.",
        "The paper describes the Relational Structure as the common underlying representation of treebanks which is motivated by both theoretical and task-dependent considerations.",
        "Then it presents a system for the annotation of the Relational Structure in treebanks, called Augmented Relational Structure, which allows for a systematic annotation of various components of linguistic knowledge crucial in several tasks.",
        "Finally, it shows a dependency-based annotation for an Italian treebank, i.e. the Turin University Treebank, that implements the Augmented Relational Structure."

      "text": [
        "Different treebanks use different annotation schemes which make explicit two distinct but interrelated aspects of the structure of the sentence, i.e. the function of the syntactic units and their organization according to a part-whole paradigm.",
        "The first aspect refers to a form of Relational Structure (RS), the second refers to its constituent or Phrase Structure (PS).",
        "The major difference between the two structures is that the RS allows for several types of relations to link the syntactic units, whilst the PS involves a single relation ”part-of”.",
        "The RS can be seen as a generalization of the dependency syntax with the syntactic units instantiated to individual words in the dependency tree (Mel’ˇcuk, 1988).",
        "As described in many theoretical linguistic frameworks, the RS provides a useful interface between syntax and a semantic or conceptual representation of predicate-argument structure.",
        "For example, Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) (Bresnan, 1982) collocates relations at the interface between lexicon and syntax, Relational Grammar (RG) (Perl-mutter, 1983) provides a description of the sentence structure exclusively based on relations and syntactic units not structured beyond the string level.",
        "This paper investigates how the notion of RS has been applied in the annotation of treebanks, in terms of syntactic units and types of relations, and presents a system for the definition of the RS that encompasses several uses in treebank schemata and can be viewed as a common underlying representation.",
        "The system, called Augmented Relational Structure (ARS) allows for an explicit representation of the three major components of linguistic structures, i.e. morpho-syntactic, functional-syntactic and semantic.",
        "Then the paper shows how a dependency-based annotation can descend on ARS, and describes the ARS-based annotation of a dependency treebank for Italian, the Turin University Treebank (TUT), which is the first available treebank for Italian, with a few quantitative results.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "The next section investigates both the annotation of RS in treebanks and the major motivations for the use of RS from language-specific issues and NLP tasks implementation; then we present the ARS system; finally, we show the dependency annotation of the TUT corpus.",
        "2 Annotation of the Relational Structure In practice, all the existing treebank schemata implement some form of relational structure.",
        "Annotation schemata range from pure (dependency) RS-based approaches to RS-PS combinations (Abeill´e, 2003).",
        "Some treebanks consider the relational information as the exclusive basis of the annotation.",
        "The Prague Dependency Treebank ((Hajiˇcov´a and Ceplov´a, 2000), (B¨ohmov´a et al., 2003)) implements a three level annotation scheme where both the analytical (surface syntactic) and tectogrammatical level (deep syntactic and topic-focus articulation) are dependency-based; the English Dependency Treebank (Rambow et al., 2002) implements a dependency-based mono-stratal analysis which encompasses surface and deep syntax and directly represents the predicate-argument structure.",
        "Other projects adopt mixed formalisms where the sentence is split in syntactic subunits (phrases), but linked by functional or semantic relations, e.g. the Ne-gra Treebank for German ((Brants et al., 2003), (Skut et al., 1998)), the Alpino Treebank for Dutch (van der Beek et al., 2002), and the Lingo Redwood Treebank for English (Oepen et al., 2002).",
        "Also in the Penn Treebank ((Marcus et al., 1993), (Marcus et al., 1994)) a limited set of relations is placed over the constituency-based annotation in order to make explicit the (morpho-syntactic or semantic) roles that the constituents play.",
        "The choice of a RS-based annotation schema can depend on theoretical linguistic motivations (a RS-based schema allows for an explicit, fine-grained representation of several linguistic phenomena), task-dependent motivations (the RS-based schema represents the linguistic information involved in the task(s) at hand), language-dependent motivations (the relational structure is traditionally considered as the most adequate representation of the object language).",
        "Theoretical motivations for exploiting representations based on forms of RS was developed in the several RS-based theoretical linguistic frameworks (e.g. Lexical Functional Grammar, Relaional Grammar and dependency grammar), which allow for capturing information involved at various level (e.g. syntactic and semantic) in linguistic structures, and grammatical formalisms have been proposed with the aim to capture the linguistic knowledge represented in these frameworks.",
        "Since the most immediate way to build wide-coverage grammars is to extract them directly from linguistic data (i.e. from treebanks), the type of annotation used in the data is a factor of primary importance, i.e. a RS-based annotation allows for the extraction of a more descriptive grammar1.",
        "Task-dependent motivations rely on how the annotation of the RS can facilitate some processing aspects of NLP applications.",
        "The explicit representation of predicative structures allowed by the RS can be a powerful source of disambiguation.",
        "In fact, a large amount of ambiguity (such as coordination, Noun-Noun compounds and relative clause attachment) can be resolved using such a kind of information, and relations can provide a useful interface between syntax and semantics.",
        "(Hindle and Rooth, 1991) had shown the use of dependency in Prepositional Phrase disambiguation, and the experimental results reported in (Hock-enmaier, 2003) demonstrate that a language model which encodes a rich notion of predicate argument structure (e.g. including long-range relations arising through coordination) can significantly improve the parsing performances.",
        "Moreover, the notion of predicate argument structure has been advocated as useful in a number of different large-scale language-processing tasks, and the RS is a convenient intermediate representation in several applications (see (Bosco, 2004) for a survey on this topic).",
        "For instance, in Information Extraction relations allows for recognizing different guises in which an event can appear regardless of the several different syntactic patterns that can be used to specify it (Palmer et al., 2001)2.",
        "In Question Answering, systems usually use forms of relation-based structured representations of the input texts (i.e. questions and answers) and try to match those representations (see e.g. (Litkowski, 1999), (Buchholz, 2002)).",
        "Also the in-depth understanding of the text, necessary in Machine Translation task, requires the use of relation-based representations where an accurate predicate argument structure is a critical factor (Han et al., 2000)3.",
        "Language-dependent motivations rely on the fact that the dependency-based formalisms has been traditionally considered as the most adequate for the representation of free word order languages.",
        "With respect to constituency-based",
        "formalisms, free word order languages involves a large amount of discontinuous constituents (i.e. constituents whose parts are not contiguous in the linear order of the sentence).",
        "In practice, a constituency-based representation was adopted for languages with rather fixed word order patterns, like English (Penn Treebank), while a dependency representation for languages which allow variable degrees of word order freedom, such as Czech (see Prague Dependency Treebank) or Italian (as we will see later, TUT).",
        "Nevertheless, in principle, since the representation of a discontinuous constituent X can be addressed in various ways (e.g. by introducing lexically empty elements co-indexed with the moved parts of X), the presence to a certain extent of word order freedom does not necessarily mean that a language has to be necessarily annotated according to a relation-based format rather than a constituency-based one.",
        "Moreover, free word order languages can present difficulties for dependency-based as well as for constituency-based frameworks (e.g. non-projective structures).",
        "The development of dependency-based treebanks for English (see English Dependency Treebank) together with the inclusion of relations in constituency-based treebanks (see Penn Treebank) too, confirms the strongly prevailing relevance of motivations beyond the language-dependent ones."

        "A RS consists of syntactic units linked by relations.",
        "An Augmented Relational Structure (ARS) organizes and systematizes the information usually associated in existing annotations to the RS, and includes not only syntactic , but also linguistic information that can be represented according to a dependency paradigm and that is proximate to semantics and underlies syntax and morphology.",
        "Therefore the",
        "ARS expresses the relations and syntactic units in terms of multiple components.",
        "We describe the ARS as a dag where each relation is a feature structure including three components.",
        "Each component of the ARS-relations is use",
        "The types of knowledge that many applications actually need are RS-based representations where predicate argument structure and the associated morphological and syntactic information can operate as an interface to a semantic-conceptual representation.",
        "All these types of knowledge have in common the fact that they can be described according to the dependency paradigm, rather than according to the constituency paradigm.",
        "The many applications (in particular those referring to the Penn Treebank) which use heuristics-based translation schemes from the phrase structure to lexical dependency (”head percolation tables”) (Rambow et al., 2002) show that the access to comprehensive and accurate extended dependency-based representations has to be currently considered as a critical issue for the development of robust and accurate NLP technologies.",
        "Now we define our proposal for the representation of the RS in treebank annotation.",
        "ful in marking both similarities and differences among the behavior of units linked by the dependency relations.",
        "The morpho-syntactic component of the ARS describes morpho-syntactic features of the words involved in relations, such as their grammatical category.",
        "This component is useful for making explicit the morpho-syntactic variants of predicative structures.",
        "Instances of this kind of variants often occur in intransitive, transitive and di-transitive predicative structures, e.g. esplosione-esplodere (explosion - to explode) are respectively nominal and verbal variants of the intransitive structure ”something explodes”.",
        "By referring to the TUT, we can evaluate the frequency of this phenomenon: in 1,500 sentences 944 Verbs occur (for a total of 4169 occurrences) and around the 30% of them are present in the nominal variant too¢.",
        "The functional-syntactic component identifies the subcategorized elements, that is it keeps apart arguments and modifiers in the predicative structures.",
        "Moreover, this component makes explicit the similarity of a same predicative structure when it occurs in the sentence in different morpho-syntactic variants.",
        "In fact, the functional-syntactic components involved, e.g., in the transitive predicative structure ”someone declares something”, are the same in both the nominal (dichiarazione /di innocenza]OBi /di John]SUBi - John’s declaration of innocence) and verbal realization (/John]SUBi dichiara /la sua innocenza]OBi - John declares his innocence) of such a predication, i.e. SUBJ and OBJ.",
        "The distinction between arguments and modifiers has been considered as quite problematic in the practice of the annotation, even if relevant from the applicative and theoretical point of views, and is not systematically annotated in the Penn Treebank (only in clear cases, the use of semantic roles allows for the annotation of argument and modifier) and in the Negra Treebank.",
        "This distinction is instead usually marked in dependency representations, e.g. in the English Dependency Treebank and in the Prague Dependency Treebank.",
        "The semantic component of the ARS-relations specifies the role of words in the syntax-semantics interface and discriminates among different kinds of modifiers and oblique complements.",
        "We can identify at least three levels of generality: verb-specific roles (e.g. Runner, Killer, Bearer); thematic roles (e.g.",
        "Agent, Instrument, Experiencer, Theme, Patient); generalized roles (e.g. Actor and Undergoer).",
        "The use of specific roles can cause the loss of useful generalizations, whilst too generic roles do not describe with accuracy the data.",
        "An example of annotation of semantic roles is the tectogrammatical layer of the Prague Dependency Treebank.",
        "ARS features a mono-stratal approach.",
        "By following this strategy, the annotation process can be easier, and the result is a direct representation of a complete predicate argument structure, that is a RS where all the information (morpho-syntactic, functional-syntactic and semantic) are immediately available.",
        "An alternative approach has been followed by the Prague",
        "Dependency Treebank, which is featured by a three levels annotation.",
        "This case shows that the major difference between the syntactic (analytic) and the semantic (tectogrammatical) layer consists in the inclusion of empty nodes for recovering forms of deletion ((B¨ohmova et al., 1999), (Hajiˇcov´a and Ceplov´a, 2000)).",
        "But this kind of information does not necessarily requires a separated semantic layer and can be annotated as well in a mono-stratal representation, like the English Dependency Treebank (Rambow et al., 2002) does.",
        "The tripartite structure of the relations in ARS guarantees that different components can be accessed separately and analyzed independently (like in (Montemagni et al., 2003) or in (Rambow et al., 2002)).",
        "Furthermore, the ARS allows for forms of annotation of relations where not all the features are specified too.",
        "In fact, the ARS-relations which specify only a part of components allow for the description of syntactic grammatical relations which do not correspond with any semantic relation, either because they have a void semantic content or because they have a different structure from any possible corresponding semantic relation (i.e. there is no semantic relation linking the same ARS-units linked by the syntactic one).",
        "Typical relations void of semantic content can link the parts of expressions not compositionally interpretable (idioms), for instance together with with in together with.",
        "While a classic example of a non-isomorphic syntactic and semantic structure is one which involves the meaning of quantifiers: a determiner within a NP extends its scope beyond the semantic concept that results from the interpretation of the NP.",
        "Another example is the coordination where the semantic and syntactic structure are often considered as non isomorphic in several forms of representation.",
        "The ARS-relations including values for both functional-syntactic and semantic components may be used in the representation of grammatical relations which participate into argument structures and the so-called oblique cases (see Fillmore and (Hudson, 1990)), i.e. where the semantic structures are completely isomorphic to the syntactic structures.",
        "For example, a locative adjunct like in the garden in John was eating fish in the garden is represented at the syntactic level as a Prepositional Phrase playing the syntactic function locative in the Verb Phrase (in the Penn Treebank it could be annotated as a PP-LOC); the semantic concept corresponding to the garden plays the semantic role LOCATION in the ”eating” event stated by the sentence."

        "Although the",
        "SVC order is well over the others, the fact that all the other orders are represented quantitatively confirms the assumption of partial con-figurationality intuitively set in the literature.",

        "• the sentence is represented by a tree where each node represents a word and each edge represents a dependency labelled by a grammatical relation which involves a head and a dependent, • each single word and punctuation mark is represented by a single node, the so-called amalgamated words, which are words composed by lexical units that can occur both in compounds and alone, e.g. Verbs with clitic suffixes (amarti (to love-you) or Prepositions with Article (dal (from-the)), are split in more lexical units7, • since the constituent structure of the sentence is implicit in dependency trees, no phrases are annotated8.",
        "If the partial configurationality makes the dependency-based annotation more adequate for Italian, other features of this language should be well represented by exploiting a Negra-like format where the syntactic units are phrases rather than single words.",
        "For instance, in Italian, Nouns are in most cases introduced by the Article: the relation between Noun and Determiner is not very relevant in a dependency perspective, while it contributes to the definition of a clearer notion of NP in Italian than in languages poorer of Determiners like, e.g., Czech.",
        "The major motivation of a dependency-based schema is therefore theoretical and, in particular, to make explicit in the treebank annotation a variety of structures typical of the object language.",
        "Moreover, in order to make explicit in cases of deletion and ellipsis the predicate argument structure, we annotate in the TUT null elements.",
        "These elements allow for the annotation of a variety of phenomena: from the ”equi” deletion which affects the subject of infinitive Verb depending on a tensed Verb (e.g. John(1) vuole T(1) andare a casa - John(1) want to T(1) go home), to the various forms of gap-ping that can affect parts of the structure of the sentence (e.g. John va(1) a casa e Mario T(1) al cinema - John goes(1) home and Mario",
