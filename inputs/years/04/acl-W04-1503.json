        "Dependency grammar has a long tradition in syntactic theory, dating back to at least Tesni`ere’s work from the thirties.",
        "Recently, it has gained renewed attention as empirical methods in parsing have emphasized the importance of relations between words (see, e.g., (Collins, 1997)), which is what dependency grammars model explicitly, but context-free phrase-structure grammars do not.",
        "In this paper, we address an important issue in using grammar formalisms: the compact representation of the parse forest.",
        "Why is this an important issue?",
        "It is well known that for non-toy grammars and non-toy examples, a sentence can have a staggeringly large number of analyses (for example, using a context-free grammar (CFG) extracted from the Penn Treebank, a sentence of 25 words may easily have 1,000,000 or more analyses).",
        "By way of an example of an ambiguous sentence (though with only two readings), the two dependency representations for the ambiguous sentence (1) are given in Figure 1.",
        "(1) Pilar saw a man with a telescope",
        "It is clear that if we want to evaluate each possible analysis (be it using a probabilistic model or a different method, for example a semantic checker), we cannot efficiently do so if we enumerate all cases.' We have two options: we can either use a greedy heuristic method for checking which does not examine all possible solutions, which entails we may miss the optimal solution, or we perform our checking operation on a representation which encodes all options in a compact representation.",
        "This is possible because the exponential number of possible analyses (exponential in the length of the input sentence) share subanalyses, thus making a polynomial-size representation possible.",
        "This representation is called the shared parse forest and it has been extensively studied for CFGs (see, for example, (Lang, 1991)).",
        "To our knowledge, there has been no description of the notion of shared parse forest for dependency trees to date.",
        "In this paper, we propose a formalization which is very closely based on the shared parse forest for CFG.",
        "We achieve this by defining a generative string-rewriting formalism whose derivation trees are dependency trees.",
        "The formalism, and the corresponding shared parse forests, are used in a probabilistic chart parser for dependency grammar, which is described in (Nasr and Rambow, 2004b).",
        "While there has been much work on formalizing dependency grammar and on parsing algorithms for dependency grammars in the past, we observe that there is not, to our knowledge, a complete generative formalization2 of dependency grammar based on string-rewriting in which the derivation structure is exactly the desired dependency structure.",
        "The most salient reason for the lack of such a generative dependency grammar is the absence of non",
        "terminal symbols in a dependency tree, which prevents us from interpreting it as a derivation structure in a system that distinguishes between terminal and nonterminal symbols.",
        "The standard solution to this problem, proposed by Gaifman (1965), is to introduce nonterminal symbols denoting lexical categories, as depicted in figure 2 (called the “labelled phrase-structure trees induced by a dependency tree” by Gaifman (1965)).",
        "Clearly, the “pure” dependency tree can be derived in a straightforward manner.",
        "The string rewriting system described in (Gaifman, 1965) generates as derivation structures this kind of trees.",
        "There is however a deeper problem when considering dependency trees as derivation structures, following from the fact that in a dependency tree, modifiers3 are direct dependents of the head they modify, and (in certain syntactic contexts) the number of modifiers is unbounded.",
        "Thus, if we wish to obtain a tree as shown in Figure 2, we need to have productions whose right-hand side is of unbounded size, which is not possible in a context-free grammar.",
        "Indeed, the formalization of dependency grammar proposed by Gaifman (1965) is unsatisfactory in that it does not allow for an unbounded number of modifiers!",
        "In this paper, we follow a suggestion made by Abney (1996) and worked out in some detail in (Lombardo, 1996)4 to extend Gaifman’s notation with regular expressions, similar to the approach used in extended context-free grammars.",
        "The result is a simple generative formalism which has the property that the derivation structures are dependency trees, except for the introduction of pre-terminal nodes as shown in Figure 2.",
        "We do not mean to imply that our formalism is substantially different from previous formalizations of dependency grammar; the goal of this paper is to present a clean and easy-to-use generative formalism with a straightforward notion of parse forest.",
        "In particular, our formalism, Generative Dependency Grammar, allows for an unbounded number of daughter nodes in the derivation tree through the use of regular expressions in its rules.",
        "The parser uses the",
        "corresponding finite-state machines which straightforwardly allows for a binary-branching representation of the derivation structure for the purpose of parsing, and thus for a compact (polynomial and not exponential) representation of the parse forest.",
        "This formalism is based on previous work presented in (Kahane et al., 1998), which has been substantially reformulated in order to simplify it.5 In particular, we do not address non-projectivity here, but acknowledge that for certain languages it is a crucial issue.",
        "We will extend our basic approach in the spirit of (Kahane et al., 1998) in future work.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "We start out by surveying previous formalizations of dependency grammar in Section 2.",
        "In Section 3, we introduce several formalisms, including Generative Dependency Grammar.",
        "We present a parsing algorithm in Section 4, and mention empirical results in Section 5.",
        "We then conclude."

        "We start out by observing that “dependency grammar” should be contrasted with “phrase structure grammar”, not “CFG”, which is a particular formalization of phrase structure grammar.",
        "Thus, just as it only makes sense to study the formal properties of a particular formalization of phrase structure grammar, the question about the formal properties of dependency grammar in general is not well defined, nor the question of a comparison of a dependency formalism with dependency grammar.",
        "There have been (at least) four types of formalizations of dependency grammars in the past.6 None of these approaches, to our knowledge, discuss the notion of shared parse forest.",
        "The first approach (for example, (Lombardo and Lesmo, 2000)) follows Gaifman (1965) in proposing traditional string rewriting rules, which however do not allow for an unbounded number of adjuncts.",
        "In the second approach, the dependency structure is constructed in reference to a parallel (“deeper”) structure (Sgall et al., 1986; Mel’ˇcuk, 1988).",
        "Because the rules make reference to other struc",
        "tures, these approaches cannot be formalized in a straightforward manner as context-free rewriting formalisms.",
        "In the third approach, which includes formalizations of dependency structure such as Dependency Tree Grammar of Modina (see (Dikovsky and Modina, 2000) for an overview), Link Grammar (Sleator and Temperley, 1993) or the tree-composition approach of Nasr (1996), rules construct the dependency tree incrementally; in these approaches, the grammar licenses dependency relations which, in a derivation, are added to the tree one by one, or in groups.",
        "In contrast, we are interested in a string-rewriting system; in such a system, we cannot add dependency relations incrementally: all daughters of a node must be added at once to represent a single rewrite step.",
        "In the fourth approach, the dependency grammar is converted into a headed context-free grammar (Abney, 1996; Holan et al., 1998), also the Basic Dependency Grammar of Beletskij (1967) as cited in (Dikovsky and Modina, 2000).",
        "This approach allows for the recovery of the dependency structure both from the derivation tree and from a parse forest represented in polynomial space.",
        "(In fact, our parsing algorithm draws on this work.)",
        "However, the approach of course requires the introduction of additional nonterminal nodes.",
        "Finally, we observe that Recursive Transition Networks (Woods, 1970) can be used to encode a grammar whose derivation trees are dependency trees.",
        "However, they are more a general framework for encoding grammars than a specific type of grammar (for example, we can also use them to encode CFGs).",
        "In a somewhat related manner, Alshawi et al.",
        "(2000) use cascaded head automata to derive dependency trees, but leave the nature of the cascading under-formalized.",
        "Eisner (2000) provides a formalization of a system that uses two different automata to generate left and right children of a head.",
        "His formalism is very close to the one we present, but it is not a string-rewriting formalism (and not really generative at all).",
        "We are looking for a precise formulation of a generative dependency grammar, and the question has remained open whether there is an alternate formalism which allows for an unbounded number of adjuncts, introduces all daughter nodes at once in a string-rewriting step, and avoids the introduction of additional nonterminal nodes."

Feature structures are of course useful for other reasons as well, such as expressing morphological features.",
        "In terms of our formalism, the use of bounded feature structures can be seen as a shorthand notation for an increased set of nonterminal symbols.",
        "The use of feature structures (rather than simple nonterminal symbols) allows for a more perspicuous representation of linguistic relations through the use of underspecification.",
