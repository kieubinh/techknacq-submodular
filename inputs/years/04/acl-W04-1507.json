        "We have been investigating existing Italian treebanks in order to assess their potential usefulness for bootstrapping the CORIS/CODIS annotation tasks.",
        "We are aware of two such treebanks that are relevant to our purposes: the TUT corpus developed at Torino University, and ISST (Italian Syntactic-Semantic treebank) developed under the national program SI-TAL by a consortium of companies and research centers coordinated by the “Consorzio Pisa Ricerche” (CPR)2.",

        "Despite its small size, TUT can serve as a training corpus for creating larger annotated resources.",
        "Our goal is to annotate CORIS with part-of-speech (PoS) tags and semi-automatically build a treebank for a fragment of it.",
        "To achieve this twofold task we start from TUT exploiting its information on dependency relations.",
        "We are still in a preliminary phase of the project and so far attention has been focused on the first task.",

        "We have compared the tag sets used by these groups with Monachini’s guidelines.",

        "A similar procedure has been applied on Italian in (Tamburini et al., 2002).",
        "The novelty of this work is that it derives the distributional information on words from a very basic set of PoS tags, namely nouns, verbs and adjectives.",
        "This method, completely avoiding the sparseness of the data affecting Brill and Marcus’ method, uses general information about the distribution of lexical words to study the internal subdivisions of the set of grammatical words, and results more stable than the method based only on lexical co-occurrence.",
