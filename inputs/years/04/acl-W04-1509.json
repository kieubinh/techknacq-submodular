        "We describe a comprehensive, implemented, dependency grammar of English, using 14 part-of-speech categories, 26 relation types, and 168 constraints on the combinations of these.",
        "It is work-in-progress and, in particular, the necessary lexicon for evaluating against a large corpus (the Penn Treebank) has not been finished.",
        "Acknowledgements Kilian Foth has given much help with the grammar development, and Wolfgang Menzel commented on a draft version of the paper."
