        "Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR) systems facilitate matching between queries and documents that do not necessarily share the same language.",
        "To accomplish this matching between distinct vocabularies, a translation step is required.",
        "The preferred method is to translate the query language into the document language by using machine translation, or lexicon lookup.",
        "While machine translation may work reasonably well on full sentences, queries tend to be short lists of keywords, and are often more suited for lexical lookup (Oard and Diekema, 1998).",
        "This paper describes a preliminary framework for the creation of a lexical resource through the combination of other lexical resources.",
        "The preliminary Framework will be applied to create a translation lexicon for use in an English-Arabic CLIR system.",
        "The resulting lexicon will be used to translate English queries into (unvocalized) Arabic.",
        "It will also provide the user of the system with lexical semantic information about each of the possible translations to aid with disambiguation of the Arabic query.",
        "While the combination of lexical resources is nothing new, establishing a sound methodology for resource combination, as presented in this paper on English-Arabic semantic resource construction, is an important contribution.",
        "Once the Framework has been evaluated for English-Arabic resource construction, it can be extended to additional languages and resource types."

        "As pointed out previously, translation plays an important role in CLIR.",
        "Most of the CLIR systems participating in the (Arabic) Cross-Language Information Retrieval track1 at the Text REtrieval Conference (TREC)2 used a query translation dictionary-based approach where each source query term was looked up in the translation resource and replaced by all or a subset of the available translations to create the target query (Larkey, Ballesteros, and Connell, 2002), (Gey and Oard, 2001), (Oard and Gey, 2002).",
        "The four main sources of translation knowledge that have been applied to CLIR are ontologies, bilingual dictionaries, machine translation lexicons, and corpora.",
        "Research shows that combining translation resources increases CLIR performance (Larkey et al., 2002) Not only does this combination increase translation coverage, it also refines translation probability calculations.",
        "Chen and Gey used a combination of dictionaries for query translation and compared retrieval performance of this dictionary combination with machine translation (Chen and Gey, 2001).",
        "The dictionaries outperformed MT.",
        "Small bilingual dictionaries were created by Larkey and Connell (2001) for place names and also inverted an Arabic-English dictionary to English-Arabic.",
        "They found that using dictionaries that have multiple senses,",
        "though not always correct, outperform bilingual term lists with only one translation alternative.",
        "Combining dictionaries is especially important when working with ambiguous languages such as Arabic.",
        "Many TREC teams used translation probabilities to deal with translation ambiguity and term weighting issues, especially since a translation lexicon with probabilities was provided as a standard resource.",
        "However, most teams combined translation probabilities from different sources and achieved better retrieval results that way (Xu, Fraser, and Weischedel, 2002), (Chowdhury et al., 2002), (Darwish and Oard, 2002).",
        "Darwish and Oard (2002) posit that since there is no such thing as a complete translation resource one should always use a combination of resources and that translation probabilities will be more accurate if one uses more resources."

        "Recall that WordNet synsets are formed by groups of terms with similar meaning (Miller, 1990).",
        "By translating each of the synonyms into Chinese, Ruiz created a frequency-ranked list of translations, and assumed that the most frequent translations were most likely to be correct.",
        "By establishing certain translation evidence thresholds, mappings of varying reliability were created.",
        "This method was later augmented with additional translation evidence from a Chinese-English parallel corpus.",

        "The preliminary Framework provides a methodology for the automatic combination of various lexical semantic resources such as machine readable dictionaries, ontologies, encyclopedias, and machine translation lexicons.",
        "While these individual resources are all valuable individually, automatic intelligent lexical combination into one single lexical knowledge base will provide an enhancement that is larger than the sum of its parts.",
        "The resulting resource will provide better coverage, more reliable translation probability information, and additional information leveraged through the process of lexical triangulation.",
        "In an initial evaluation of the preliminary Framework, it was applied to the combination of English and Arabic lexical resources as described in section 4.",
        "The preliminary Framework consists of 9 stages:",
        "1) establish goals 2) collect resources 3) create resource feature matrix 4) develop evidence combination strategies and thresholds 5) construct combinatory lexical resource 6) manage problems that arise during creation 7) evaluate combinatory lexical resource 8) implement possible improvements 9) create final version of combinatory lexical resource.",
        "Stage 1: The first stage of the Framework is intended to establish the possible usage of the combinatory lexical resource (resulting form the combination of multiple resources).",
        "The requirements of this resource will drive the second stage: resource collection.",
        "Stage 2: Two types of resources should be collected: language processing resources such as stemmers and tokenizers; and lexical semantic resources such as dictionaries and lexicons.",
        "While not every resource may seem particularly useful at first, different resources can aid in mapping other resources together.",
        "During the second stage, conversion into a single encoding (such as UTF-8) will also take place.",
        "Stage 3: Once a set of resources has been collected, the resource feature matrix can be created.",
        "This matrix provides an overview of the types of information found in the collected resources and of certain resource characteristics.",
        "For example, it is important to note what base form the dictionary entries have.",
        "Some dictionaries use the singular form (for nouns) or indefinite form (for verbs), some use roots, others use stems, and free resources from the web often use a combination of all of the above.",
        "By studying the feature matrix the evidence combination strategies for stage four can be developed.",
        "Stage 4: An intelligent resource combination strategy should be informed by the features of the different resources.",
        "It may be, for example, that one resource uses vocalized Arabic only and that another resource uses both vocalized and unvocalized Arabic.",
        "This fact should be taken into account by the combination strategy since the second resource can serve as an intermediary to map the first resource.",
        "Thresholding decisions are also part of stage four because the certainty of some combinations will be higher than others.",
        "Stage 5: Stage five involves writing programs based on the findings in stage four that will automatically create the combinatory lexical resource.",
        "The combination programs should provide output concerning problematic instances that occur during the creation i.e. words that only occur in a single resource, so that these problems may be handled by alternative strategies in stage six.",
        "Stage 6: Most of the problems in stage six are likely to be uncommon words, such as named entities or transliteration.",
        "A transliteration step, where for example English letters, i.e. r, are mapped to the closest Arabic sounding letters, i.e. , may be applied for languages that do not share the same orthographies.",
        "Stage 7: After the initial combinatory lexical resource has been created it needs to be evaluated.",
        "First the accuracy (quality) of the combination mappings of the various resources needs to be assessed in an intrinsic evaluation.",
        "After it has been established that the combination has been successful, an extrinsic evaluation can be carried out.",
        "In this evaluation the combinatory lexical resource is tested as part of the actual application the source was intended for, i.e. CLIR.",
        "(For a more detailed description of evaluation see Section 5 below.)",
        "Stage 8: These two evaluations will inform stage eight where possible improvements are added to the combination process.",
        "Stage 9: The final version of the combinatory lexical resource can be created in stage nine."

        "The preliminary Framework as described in section 3 was applied to five English and Arabic language resources as a kind of feasibility test.",
        "Following the Framework, we first established the goals of the combinatory lexical resource.",
        "It was determined that the resource would be used as a translation resource for CLIR that would aid query translation as well as manual translation disambiguation by the user.",
        "This meant that the combinatory lexical resource would need translation probabilities as well as English definitions for Arabic translations to enable an English language user to select the correct Arabic translation.",
        "We collected five different resources: WordNet 2.03, the lexicon included with the Buckwalter Stemmer4, translations mined from Ajeeb5, the wordlist from the Arabeyes project6, and the LDC Arabic Gigaword corpus7.",
        "After the resources were collected the feature matrix was developed (see Table 1).",
        "The established combinatory lexical resource goals and resource feature matrix were used to determine the combination strategy.",

        "Evidence used for mapping the Ajeeb and Buckwalter lexicons is part-of-speech information.",
        "Additionally, these two resources also provide vocalized Arabic terms/stems that can be used for a more reliable (less ambiguous) match.",
        "The Arabeyes lexicon is not terribly rich but was used as additional evidence for a certain translation through frequency weighting.",

        "After examining the combinatory lexical resource we found that the Arabeyes Arabic terms could not be compared directly to the Arabic terms in the other lexical resources since the determiner prefixes are still attached to the terms (as in �����1 for example).",
        "More problematic were the translations mined from Ajeeb since the part-of-speech information of the Arabic term did not necessarily match the part-of-speech of the translations:",
        "The first problem is easily fixed by applying a light stemmer to the dictionary.",
        "At this point it is not clear however, how to fix the second problem.",
        "It was also decided that the translation reliability weighting by frequency is too limited to be useful.",
        "A back-translation lookup needs to determine how many other terms can result in a certain translation.",
