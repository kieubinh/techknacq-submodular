        "In the present state of the art in the development of software and language resources in Arabic, there is an urgent need for evaluation and validation criteria based on solid analytic grounds: there exists nowadays a subsequent number of Arabic lexical databases, and more are under completion.",
        "Existing lexical dB-s are not always, for the time being, available as such to researchers and/or developers, because they are usually embedded in software (such as a morphological analyser or a parser), and are still very difficult to make use of independently.",
        "It is to be expected, though, that the issue of availability will be overcome in a reasonably near future, and that a number of Arabic lexical databases will be found on the market, or on catalogues such as, in Europe, that of ELRA1, and in the USA, that of LDC2.",
        "The ongoing European project NEMLAR is presently working on the availability of language resources including lexical databases3.",
        "As a result, the crucial question of the quality and consistency of these databases should be met as soon as possible."

        "This paper is a contribution to the issue – which has, in the course of the last decade, become critical – of the basic requirements and validation criteria for lexical language resources in Standard Arabic.",
        "The work is based on a critical analysis of the architecture of the DIINAR.1 lexical database, the entries of which are associated with grammar-lexis relations operating at word-form level (i.e. in morphological analysis).",
        "Investigation shows a crucial difference, in the concept of ‘lexical database’, between source program and generated lexica.",
        "The source program underlying DIINAR.1 is analysed, and some figures and ratios are presented.",
        "The original categorisations are, in the course of scrutiny, partly revisited.",
        "Results and ratios given here for basic entries on the one hand, and for generated lexica of inflected word-forms on the other.",
        "They aim at giving a first answer to the question of the ratios between the number of lemma-entries and inflected word-forms that can be expected to be included in, or generated by, a Standard Arabic lexical dB.",
        "These ratios can be considered as one overall language-specific criterion for the analysis, evaluation and validation of lexical dB-s in Arabic.",
        "Keywords: Arabic lexical databases – Arabic script – word-formatives grammar – lemma-entries – morphosyntactic specifiers.",
        "One of the criteria for the evaluation and validation of a lexical database for Arabic is both quantitative (how many?)",
        "and qualitative (what of, precisely?).",
        "In this paper, which refers to previous work on the processing of Arabic and the related lexical resources4, we will try and give evidence on the structure of a lexical database, founded on an analysis of the DIINAR.1 database5.",
        "Quantitative results are only interesting if they can be interpreted in such a way as to yield information on the actual structure and categories of the lexicon of the language under consideration.",
        "We will endeavour to show that a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the lexical categories incorporated in DIINAR.1 can be interpreted with this respect.",
        "Moreover, the investigation leads to proposing a more consistent organisation of lexical information and relations, which should be included in future versions of DIINAR.",
        "2 The type of lexical dB required by the automatic analysis of Arabic What are the fundamental requirements of a lexical database in Arabic?",
        "The first challenge to be met upon endeavouring to build language resources in Arabic is that of the structure of the writing system of the language (Dichy, 1990), the two main features of which are: non diacriticized script in standard texts (§ 2.1) and the structure of the word-form (§ 2.2).",
        "The combined effect of these features entails the need for a lexical database that includes a subsequent number of gram-mar-lexis relations (§ 2.3).",
        "Such a dB is to be considered as a sine qua non condition of high-level and elaborate Arabic NLP.",
        "4 The research and development work referred to in the SILAT research group goes back to the 1980ies and has been going on since (Desclés et alii 1983, Dichy & Hassoun, eds.",

        "It is well-known that Arabic script belongs to a group of Semitic writings originating from ancient Phoenician alphabets, such as Hebrew, Aramaic or Syriac.",
        "Phonographic translation is basically restricted to the notation of consonants and “long vowels”.",
        "In the course of time, these writing systems have developed additional diacritic symbols, mainly for the needs of the oral reading of sacred texts (Bible, New Testament, Koran).",
        "Arabic writing has thus been provided with a sophisticated system of diacritical marks (comparable to the Massora diacritics which were later devised for the Hebrew Bible).",
        "Standard writing nevertheless disregards these symbols.",
        "This results in a high degree of homography, accounting for the multiple analyses encountered in a majority of single words by morphological analysers (which are, needless to recall, bound to consider every word off-context)."

      "text": [
        "Unlike automatic recognition software, human readers are, of course, able to combine semantic, syntactic and morphological analyses.",
        "They are helped in their reading of Arabic written utterances by another major feature of the writing system: the very regular structure of the word-form.",
        "This structure has been introduced and extensively described previously (Desclés ed., 1983; Dichy 1984, 1990; Hassoun, 1987 – after the pioneering work of Cohen, 1961/70), and is only recalled here for the sake of clarity.",
        "Word-forms in Arabic can be described on the whole as consisting of a nucleus formative (henceforth NF) to which extension formatives (henceforth EF) are added, either to the left or to the right (Dichy, 1997).",
        "Ante-positioned EF-s are abbreviated as aEF, and post-positioned ones as pEF.",
        "The nucleus formative, usually called stem, can be represented in terms of prosodic or non-concatenative morphology (after J. McCarthy’s original and much discussed insights, 1981).",
        "In Semitic morphology, the stem is considered, according to a somewhat recent, but very widely followed tradition, as a compound of root and pattern.",
        "One must keep in mind, though, that many nouns cannot be analysed in such a way: they are referred to as quasi-stems (Dichy & Hassoun, eds., 1989).",
        "Arabic word-forms consist of: – proclitics (PCL), which include mono-consonantal conjunctions, e.g. wa-, ‘and’ , li-, ‘in order to’, or prepositions, i.e. bi-, ‘in, at’ or ‘by’, etc.",
        "; – a prefix (PRF).",
        "The category, after D. Cohen’s representation of the word-form, only includes the prefixes of the imperfective, e.g., ya-, prefixed morpheme of the 3rd person; – a stem, which can be represented in terms of a ROOT (an ordered triple of consonants, or, by extension of the system, a quadruple) and a PATTERN (roughly: a template of syllables, the consonants of which are the triple of the ROOT to which monoconsonantal affixes are added).",
        "The stem takabbar, ‘to be haughty’, thus consists of the 3-consonant ROOT /k-b-r/ and of the PATTERN /taR1aR2R2aR3/, where R1, R2 and R3 stand for ‘radical consonant 1, 2, 3’, and are instantiated by the triple of the ROOT (R1=k, R2=b, R3=r).",
        "Nouns that cannot be analysed in ROOT and PATTERN are conventionally referred to as quasi-stems, e.g.: ’ismâ ‘îl, ‘Ishmael’, yûnîskû, ‘UNESCO’, kahramân, ‘amber’; – suffixes (SUF), such as verb endings, nominal cases, the nominal feminine ending -at, etc.",
        "; – enclitics (ECL).",
        "In Arabic, enclitics are complement pronouns.",
        "In the table below two apparently equivalent representations of the structure of the Arabic word-form are given.",
        "The main difference between them lies in the fact that (2) aims at highlighting the relations between nucleus and extension formatives (NF and EF-s), featuring a triangle (in boldface below).",
        "The rules governing the relations between morphemes embedded in the word-form are included in a word formatives grammar (henceforth WFG – Dichy, 1987, 1997).",
        "These rules, and the features they involve, are distributed along these three relations, a great number of which are related to the lexical nucleus, and have to rely upon the finite set of grammar-lexis relations operating at word-level (formalised in Dichy, 1990)."

        "In fact, the word-formatives grammar (WFG) accounts for the regular structure of the word-form.",
        "Rules involving word-formatives (the above nucleus and extension formatives, NF and EF) are based on three fundamental types of relations (Dichy, 1987): ‘entails’, ≠> ‘excludes’, ** ‘is compatible with’ (or ‘admits’), the third of which is attached to the opposed pair of the first two as an ‘elsewhere’ relation of a special kind, directly connected to ambiguity in language analysis processes (Dichy, 2000).",
        "In generation, all ‘compatibility’ (or ‘admit’) relations can in fact be rewritten in terms of ‘entail’ or ‘exclude’ rules associated with specific sets of word-formatives.",
        "‘Compatibility’ relations are mostly useful in the formalisation of recognition rules, when ambiguity is at stake7.",

        "A few exceptive compound items exist, but they are kept marginal by the structure of the language, for the obvious reasons hinted at here, unlike what has happened in Modern Hebrew, as opposed to the Biblical and Medieval state of the language (Kirtchuk, 1997).",

        "NF NF linking combinations, which have to be encoded whenever the morphological variation is not rule-predictable (cf. Mel uk’s concept of syntactic, 1982).",
        "This is the case in a majority of singular ‘broken plural’ links in nouns or adjectives, as well as in ‘perfective’ ‘imperfective’ (mâdî mudâri ‘) links, in verbs belonging to ‘simple’ PATTERNS (al-fi‘l al-mujarrad).",
        "In an Arabic lexical dB, lexical entries (NF-s or STEMS in the above representation) need to be associated with morphosyntactic specifiers ensuring their insertion in word-forms, and their morphological variation (conjugation or declension).",
        "Morphosyntactic specifiers, in other words, account for: – grammar-lexis relations, i.e. NF EF combinations; – morpho-lexical variation, i.e. NF NF linking combinations.",
        "Lexical entries thus ‘entail’, ‘exclude’ or ‘admit’ a number of grammatical morphemes listed in the various fields of the word-form as word-formatives, either on a non regular basis, or on the basis of rules founded on semantic features that cannot be deduced from the formal structure of the morpheme.",
        "As shown in Dichy (1997), morphosyntactic specifiers make up formally, in a lexical database, for information associated in the speaker’s memory to various levels of linguistic analysis (morpho-phonological, syntactic or semantic features).",
        "This structure has often been disregarded in the elaboration of Arabic lexical databases on the assumption that the representation of lexical entries as a mere combination of PATTERN and ROOT (plus a number of suffixes) is sufficient.",
        "This is definitely not the case: evidence recalled in this paragraph (also in Hassoun & Dichy, eds.",
        "1989, Dichy, 1997, Dichy & Fergaly, 2003) show that grammar-lexis relations operating at word-form level can only be taken into account if information is associated to whole stems (or nuclei), or to stem+suffix ‘frozen’ compounds.",
        "These relations cannot be predicted on the sole basis of patterns.",
        "The description of the WFG outlined in this paragraph has led to the elaboration of exhaustive and finite sets of morphosyntactic specifiers liable to be associated to the non finite lexical entries of an Arabic database (Dichy, 1997).",
