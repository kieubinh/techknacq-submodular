        "In this paper, Naive Bayes (NB) which is a statistical machine learning algorithm, is used to classify non-vocalized Arabic web documents (after their words have been transformed to the corresponding canonical form, i.e., roots) to one of five predefined categories.",
        "Cross validation experiments are used to evaluate the NB categorizer.",
        "The data set used during these experiments consists of 300 web documents per category.",
        "The results of cross validation in the leave-one-out experiment show that, using 2,000 terms/roots, the categorization accuracy varies from one category to another with an average accuracy over all categories of 68.78 %.",
        "Furthermore, the best categorization performance by category during cross validation experiments goes up to 92.8%.",
        "Further tests carried out on a manually collected evaluation set which consists of 10 documents from each of the 5 categories, show that the overall classification accuracy achieved over all categories is 62%, and that the best result by category reaches 90%."

        "Automatic text (or document) categorization attempts to replace and save human effort required in performing manual categorization.",
        "It consists of assigning and labeling documents using a set of predefined categories based on document contents.",
        "As such, one of the primary objectives of automatic text categorization has been the enhancement and the support of information retrieval tasks to tackle problems, such as information filtering and routing, clustering of related documents, and the classification of documents into pre-specified subject themes.",
        "Automatic text categorization has been used in search engines, digital library systems, and document management systems (Yang, 1999).",
        "Such applications have included electronic email filtering, newsgroups classification, and survey data grouping.",
        "Barq for instance uses automatic categorization to provide similar documents feature (Rachidi et al., 2003).",

        "Section 3 describes the preprocessing undergone by documents for the purpose of categorization; it describes in particular the preprocessing specific to the Arabic language.",

        "The bulk of the text categorization work has been devoted to cope with automatic categorization of English and Latin character documents.",
        "For example, (Fang et al., 2001) discusses the evaluation of two different text categorization strategies with several variations of their feature spaces.",
        "A good study comparing document categorization algorithms can be found in (Yang and Liu, 1999).",
        "More recently, (Sebastiani, 2002) has performed a good survey of document categorization; recent works can also be found in (Joachims, 2002), (Crammer and Singer, 2003), and (Lewis et al., 2004).",
        "Concerning Arabic, one automatic categorizer has been reported to have been put under operational use to classify Arabic documents; it is referred to as \"Sakhr's categorizer\" (Sakhr, 2004).",
        "Unfortunately, there is no technical documentation or specification concerning this Arabic categorizer.",
        "Sakhr's marketing literature claims that this categorizer is based on Arabic morphology and some research that has been carried out on natural language processing.",
        "The present work evaluates the performance on Arabic documents of the Naïve Bayes algorithm (NB) - one of the simplest algorithms applied to English document categorization (Mitchell, 1997).",
        "The aim of this work is to gain some insight as to whether Arabic document categorization (using NB) is sensitive to the root extraction algorithm used or to different data sets.",
        "This work is a continuation of that initiated in (Yahyaoui, 2001), which reports an overall NB classification correctness of 75.6%, in cross validation experiments, on a data set that consists of 100 documents for each of 12 categories (the data set is collected from different Arabic portals).",
        "A 50% overall classification accuracy is also reported when testing with a separately collected evaluation set (3 documents for each of the 12 categories).",
        "The present work expands the work in (Yahyaoui, 2001) by experimenting with the use of a better root extraction algorithm (El Kourdi, 2004) for document preprocessing, and using a different data set, collected from the largest Arabic site on the web: aljazeera.net."

        "Prior to applying document categorization techniques to an Arabic document, the latter is typically preprocessed: it is parsed, in order to remove stopwords (these are conjunction and disjunction words etc.).",
        "In addition, at this stage in this work, vowels are stripped from the full text representation when the document is (fully or partially) voweled/vocalized.",
        "Then roots are extracted for words in the document.",
        "In Arabic, however, the use of stems will not yield satisfactory categorization.",
        "This is mainly due to the fact that Arabic is a non-concatenative language (Al-Shalabi and Evens, 1998), and that the stem/infix obtained by suppression of infix and prefix add-ons is not the same for words derived from the same origin called the root.",
        "The infix form (or stem) needs further to be processed in order to obtain the root.",
        "This processing is not straightforward: it necessitates expert knowledge in Arabic language word morphology (Al-Shalabi and Evens, 1998).",
        "As an example, two close roots (i.e., roots made of the same letters), but semantically different, can yield the same infix form thus creating ambiguity.",
        "The root extraction process is concerned with the transformation of all Arabic word derivatives to their single common root or canonical form.",
        "This process is very useful in terms of reducing and compressing the indexing structure, and in taking advantage of the semantic/conceptual relationships between the different forms of the same root.",
        "In this work, we use the Arabic root extraction technique in (El Kourdi, 2004).",
        "It compares favorably to other stemming or root extraction algorithms (Yates and Neto, 1999; Al-Shalabi and Evens, 1998; and Houmame, 1999), with a performance of over 97% for extracting the correct root in web documents, and it addresses the challenge of the Arabic broken plural and hollow verbs.",
        "In the remainder of this paper, we will use the term \"root\" and \"term\" interchangeably to refer to canonical forms obtained through this root extraction process."
