        "This paper offers a transcription system for Persian, the target language in the Transonics project, a speech-to-speech translation system developed as a part of the DARPA Babylon program (The DARPA Babylon Program; Narayanan, 2003).",
        "In this paper, we discuss transcription systems needed for automated spoken language processing applications in Persian that uses the Arabic script for writing.",
        "This system can easily be modified for Arabic, Dari, Urdu and any other language that uses the Arabic script.",
        "The proposed system has two components.",
        "One is a phonemic based transcription of sounds for acoustic modelling in Automatic Speech Recognizers and for Text to Speech synthesizer, using ASCII based symbols, rather than International Phonetic Alphabet symbols.",
        "The other is a hybrid system that provides a minimally-ambiguous lexical representation that explicitly includes vocalic information; such a representation is needed for language modelling, text to speech synthesis and machine translation."

        "Speech-to-speech (S2S) translation systems present many challenges, not only due to the complex nature of the individual technologies involved, but also due to the intricate interaction that these technologies have to achieve.",
        "A great challenge for the specific S2S translation system involving Persian and English would arise from not only the linguistics differences between the two languages but also from the limited amount of data available for Persian.",
        "The other major hurdle in achieving a S2S system involving these languages is the Persian writing system, which is based on the Arabic script, and hence lacks the explicit inclusion of vowel sounds, resulting in a very large amount of one-to-many mappings from transcription to acoustic and semantic representations.",
        "In order to achieve our goal, the system that was designed comprised of the following components: Fig 1.",

        "Our vision is that only the doctor will have access to the GUI and the patient will only be given a phone handset.",
        "(1) a visual and control Graphical User Interface (GUI); (2) an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) subsystem, which works both using Fixed State Grammars (FSG) and Language Models (LM), producing n-best lists/lattices along with the decoding confidence scores; (3) a Dialog Manager (DM), which receives the output of the speech recognition and machine translation units and subsequently “re-scores\" the data according to the history of the conversation; (4) a Machine Translation (MT) unit, which works in two modes: Classifier based MT and a fully Stochastic MT; and finally (5) a unit selection based Text To Speech synthesizer (TTS), which provides the spoken output.",

      "text": [
        "Persian is an Indo-European language with a writing system based on the Arabic script.",
        "Languages that use this script have posed a problem for automated language processing such as speech recognition and translation systems.",
        "For instance, the CSLU Labeling Guide (Lander, http://cslu.cse.ogi.edu/corpora/corpPublications.ht ml) offers orthographic and phonetic transcription systems for a wide variety of languages, from German to Spanish with a Latin-based writing system to languages like Mandarin and Cantonese, which use Chinese characters for writing.",
        "However, there seems to be no standard transcription system for languages like Arabic, Persian, Dari, Urdu and many others, which use the Arabic script (ibid; Kaye, 1876; Kachru, 1987, among others).",
        "Because Persian and Arabic are different, Persian has modified the writing system and augmented it in order to accommodate the differences.",
        "For instance, four letters were added to the original system in order to capture the sounds available in Persian that Arabic does not have.",
        "Also, there are a number of homophonic letters in the Persian writing system, i.e., the same sound corresponding to different orthographic representations.",
        "This problem is unique to Persian, since in Arabic different orthographic representations represent different sounds.",
        "The other problem that is common in all languages using the Arabic script is the existance of a large number of homographic words, i.e., orthographic representations that have a similar form but different pronunciation.",
        "This problem arises due to limited vowel presentation in this writing system.",
        "Examples of the homophones and homographs are represented in Table 1.",
        "The words “six” and “lung” are examples of homographs, where the identical (transliterated Arabic) orthographic representations (Column 3) correspond to different pronunciations [SeS] and [SoS] respectively (Column 4).",
        "The words “hundred” and “dam” are examples of homophones, where the two words have similar pronunciation [sad] (Column 4), despite their different spellings (Column 3).",
        "and their limitation.",
        "Purely orthographic transcription schemes (such as USCPers) fail to distinctly represent homographs while purely phonetic ones (such as USCPron) fail to distinctly represent the homophones.",
        "The former is the sample of the cases in which there is a many-to-one mapping between orthography and pronunciation, a direct result of the basic characteristic of the Arabic script, viz., little to no representation of the vowels.",
        "As is evident by the data presented in this table, there are two major sources of problems for any speech-to-speech machine translation.",
        "In other words, to employ a system with a direct 1-1 mapping between Arabic orthography and a Latin based transcription system (what we refer to as USCPers in our paper) would be highly ambiguous and insufficient to capture distinct words as required by our speech-to-speech translation system, thus resulting in ambiguity at the text-to-speech output level, and internal confusion in the language modelling and machine translation units.",
        "The latter, on the other hand, is a representative of the cases in which the same sequence of sounds would correspond to more than one orthographic representation.",
        "Therefore, using a pure phonetic transcription, e.g., USCPron, would be acceptable for the Automatic Speech Recognizer (ASR), but not for the Dialog Manager (DM) or the Machine Translator (MT).",
        "The goal of this paper is twofold (i) to provide an ASCII based phonemic transcription system similar to the one used in the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), in line of Worldbet (Hieronymus, http://cslu.cse.ogi.edu/corpora/corpPublications.ht ml) and (ii) to argue for an ASCII based hybrid transcription scheme, which provides an easy way to transcribe data in languages that use the Arabic script.",
        "We will proceed in Section 2 to provide the USCPron ASCII based phonemic transcription system that is similar to the one used by the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), in line of Worldbet (ibid).",
        "In Section 3, we will present the USCPers orthographic scheme, which has a one-to-one mapping to the Arabic script.",
        "In Section 4 we will present and analyze USCPers+, a hybrid system that keeps the orthographic information, while providing the vowels.",
        "Section 5 discusses some further issues regarding the lack of data."

        "In order to assign a symbol to each letter of the alphabet, the corresponding letter representing the sound of that letter was chosen.",

        "This paper argues that the best way to represent data at phonological/lexical level for language modeling and MT in languages that employ the Arabic script, is by using a hybrid system, which combines information provided by orthography and includes the vowels that are not represented in orthography.",
        "The schemes proposed can significantly aid in speech-to-speech applications in a multitude of different ways: (1) the internal pronunciations of the ASR and the TTS components can employ the USCPron scheme, (2) the internal transcription of the Persian language – for purposes of language modeling and statistical machine translation among others – can employ the USCPers+ scheme and (3) in the case of a standalone TTS, in which case the input is pure Persian text, automated transliteration to the USCPers+ scheme, and hence to the pronunciation, can be generated with statistical language augmentation techniques, which are based on prior model training, as we describe further in Georgiou, 2004.",
