        "Large-vocabulary automatic speech recognition (ASR) for conversational Arabic poses several challenges for the speech research community.",
        "The most difficult problems in developing highly accurate speech recognition systems for Arabic are the predominance of non-diacritized text material, the enormous dialectal variety, and the morphological complexity.",
        "Most available acoustic training material for Arabic ASR is transcribed in the Arabic script form, which does not include short vowels and other diacritics that reflect differences in pronunciation, such as the shadda, tanween, etc.",
        "In particular, almost all additional text data that can easily be obtained (e.g. broadcast news corpora) is represented in standard script form.",
        "To our knowledge, the only available corpus that does include detailed phonetic information is the CallHome (CH) Egyptian Colloquial Arabic (ECA) corpus distributed by the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC).",
        "This corpus has been transcribed in both the script form and a so-called romanized form, which is an ASCII representation that includes short vowels and other diacritic information and thus has complete pronunciation information.",
        "It is quite challenging to create such a transcription: native speakers of Arabic are not used to writing their language in a ”romanized” form, or even in fully diacritized script form.",
        "Consequently, this task is considered almost as difficult as phonetic transcription.",
        "Transcribing a sufficiently large amount of training data in this way is therefore labor-intensive and costly since it involves (re)-training native speakers for this purpose.",
        "The constraint of having mostly non-diacritized texts as recognizer training material leads to problems for both acoustic and language modeling.",
        "First, it is difficult to train accurate acoustic models for short vowels if their identity and location in the signal is not known.",
        "Second, the absence of diacritics leads to a larger set of linguistic contexts for a given word form; language models trained on non-diacritized material may therefore be less predictive than those trained on diacritized texts.",
        "Both of these factors may lead to a loss in recognition accuracy.",
        "Previous work (Kirchhoff et al., 2002; Lamel, 2003) has shown that ignoring available vowel information does indeed lead to a significant increase in both language model perplexity and word error rate.",
        "Therefore, we are interested in automatically deriving a diacritized transcription from the Arabic script representation when a manual diacritization is not available.",
        "Some software companies (Sakhr, Apptek, RDI) have developed commercial products for the automatic diacritization of Arabic.",
        "However, these products use only text-based information, such as the syntactic context and possible morphological analyses of words, to predict diacritics.",
        "In the context of diacritization for speech recognition, by contrast, acoustic data is available that can be used as an additional knowledge source.",
        "Moreover, commercial products concentrate exclusively on Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), whereas a common objective of Arabic ASR is conversational speech recognition, which is usually dialectal.",
        "For this reason, a more flexible set of tools is required in order to diacritize dialectal Arabic prior to speech recognizer training.",
        "In this work we investigate the relative benefits of a variety of knowledge sources (acoustic, morphological, and contextual) to automatically diacritize MSA transcriptions.",
        "We evaluate the different approaches in two different ways: (a) by comparing the automatic output against a manual reference diacritization and computing the diacritization error rate, and (b) by using automatically diacritized training data in a cross-dialectal speech recognition application.",
        "The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: Section 2 gives a detailed description of the motivation as well as prior work.",
        "Section 3 describes the corpora used for the experiments reported in this paper.",
        "The automatic diacritization procedures and results are explained in Section 4.",
        "The speech recognition experiments and results are reported in Section 5.",

      "text": [
        "The Arabic alphabet consists of twenty-eight letters, twenty-five of which represent consonants and three of which represent the long vowels (/i:/,/a:/,/u:/).",
        "A distinguishing feature of Arabic-script based writing systems is that short vowels are not represented by the letters of the alphabet.",
        "Instead, they are marked by so-called diacritics, short strokes placed either above or below the preceding consonant.",
        "Several other pronunciation phenomena are marked by diacritics, such as consonant doubling (phonemic in Arabic), which is indicated by the “shadda” sign, and the “tanween”, i.e. word-final adverbial markers that add /n/ to the pronunciation of the word.",
        "These diacritics are listed in Table 1.",
        "Arabic texts are almost never fully diacritized; normally, diacritics are used sparingly and only to prevent misunderstandings.",
        "Exceptions are important religious and/or political texts or beginners’ texts for",
        "students of Arabic.",
        "The lack of diacritics may lead to considerable lexical ambiguity that must be resolved by contextual information, which in turn presupposes knowledge of the language.",
        "It was observed in (Debili et al., 2002) that a non-diacritized dictionary word form has 2.9 possible diacritized forms on average and that an Arabic text containing 23,000 word forms showed an average ratio of 1:11.6.",
        "The form ■✳for instance, has 21 possible diacritiza✏ tions.",
        "The correspondence between graphemes and phonemes is relatively transparent compared to other languages like English or French: apart from certain special graphemes (e.g. laam alif), the relationship is one to one.",
        "Finally, it is worth noting that the writing system described above is that of MSA.",
        "Arabic dialects are primarily oral varieties in that they do not have generally agreed-upon writing standards.",
        "Whenever there is the need to write down dialectal speech, speakers will try to approximate the standard system as far as possible and use a phonetic spelling for non-MSA or foreign words.",
        "The lack of diacritics in standard Arabic texts makes it difficult to use non-diacritized text for training since the location and identity of short vowels and other phonetic segments are unknown.",
        "One possible approach is to use acoustic models for long vowels and consonants only, where the acoustic signal portions corresponding to unwritten segments are implicitly incorporated into the acoustic models for consonants (Billa et al., 2002).",
        "However, this leads to less discriminative acoustic and language models.",
        "Previous work (Kirchhoff et al., 2002; Lamel, 2003) has compared the word error rates of two CH ECA recognizers: one trained on script transcriptions and another trained on romanized transcriptions.",
        "It was shown that the loss in information due to training on script forms results in significantly worse performance: a relative increase in word error rate of almost 10% was observed.",
        "It seems clear that diacritized data should be used for training Arabic ASR systems whenever possible.",
        "As explained above, however, it is very expensive to obtain manually transcribed data in a diacritized form.",
        "Therefore, the corpora that do include detailed transcriptions are fairly small and any dialectal data that might become available in the future will also very likely be of limited size.",
        "By contrast, it is much easier to collect publicly available data (e.g. broadcast news data) and to transcribe it in script form.",
        "In order to be able to take advantage of such resources, we need to restore short vowels and other missing diacritics in the transcription."

        "Various software companies have developed automatic diacritization products for Arabic.",
        "However, all of these are targeted towards MSA; to our knowledge, there are no products for dialectal Arabic.",
        "In a previous study (Kirchhoff et al., 2002) one of these products was tested on three different texts, two MSA texts and one ECA text.",
        "It was found that the diacritization error rate (percentage of missing and wrongly identified or inserted diacritics) on MSA ranged between 9% and 28%, depending on whether or not case vowel endings were counted.",
        "However, on the ECA text, the diacritization software obtained an error rate of 48%.",
        "A fully automatic approach to diacritization was presented in (Gal, 2002), where an HMM-based bigram model was used for decoding diacritized sentences from non-diacritized sentences.",
        "The technique was applied to the Quran and achieved 14% word error (incorrectly diacritized words).",
        "A first attempt at developing an automatic diacritizer for dialectal speech was reported in (Kirchhoff et al., 2002).",
        "The basic approach was to use a small set of parallel script and diacritized data (obtained from the ECA CallHome corpus) and to derive diacritization rules in an example-based way.",
        "This entirely knowledge-free approach achieved a 16.6% word error rate.",
        "Other studies (El-Imam, 2003) have addressed problems of grapheme-to-phoneme conversion in Arabic, e.g. for the purpose of speech synthesis, but have assumed that a fully diacritized version of the text is already available.",
        "Several knowledge sources are available for determining the most appropriate diacritization of a script form: analysis of the morphological structure of the word (including segmentation into stems, prefixes, roots and patterns), consideration of the syntactic context in which the word form appears, and, in the context of speech recognition, the acoustic data that accompanies the transcription.",
        "Specific dictionary information could in principle be added (such as information about proper names), but this knowledge source is ignored for the purpose of this study.",

        "It is transcribed in two different ways: (a) using standard Arabic script, and (b) using a romanization scheme developed at LDC and distributed with the corpus.",
        "The romanized transcription contains short vowels and phonetic segments corresponding to other diacritics.",
        "It is not entirely equivalent to a diacritized Arabic script representation since it includes additional information.",

        "Training is done in an unsupervised way, i.e. the correct morphological tag assignment for each word is not known.",
        "Instead, all possible assignments are initially considered and the Expectation-Maximization (EM) training procedure iteratively trains the probability distributions in the above model (the probability of word given tag, P(wilti), and the tag sequence probability, P(tilti-1,ti-2)) until convergence.",
        "During testing, only the word sequence is known and the best tag assignment is found by maximizing the probability in Equation 1.",

        "In order to account for the fact that we had much more data, and also more dissimilar data, we increased the model size to 300 genones.",
        "For training the CH+FBIS acoustic models, we first used the whole data set with weight 2 for CH utterances and 1 for FBIS utterances.",
        "Models were then MAP adapted on the CH-only data (Digalakis et al., 1995).",
        "Since training involves several EM iterations, we did not want to keep the diacritization fixed from the first pass, which used CH-only models.",
        "At every iteration, we obtain better acoustic models which can be used to realign the data.",
        "Thus, for the first two approaches, where the size of the pronunciation networks is limited due to the use of morphological information, the EM forward-backward counts were collected using the whole diacritization network and the best diacritization path was allowed to change at every iteration.",
        "In the last case, where only acoustic information was used, the pronunciation networks were too large to be run efficiently.",
        "For this reason, we updated the diacritized references once during training by realigning the networks with the newer models after the first training iteration.",
        "As reported in (Kirchhoff and Vergyri, 2004) the CH+FBIS trained system by itself did not improve much over the baseline (we only found a small improvement on the eval03 test-set) but it provided sufficiently different information, so that ROVER combination (Fiscus, 1997) with the baseline yielded an improvement.",
        "As we can see in Table 4, all diacritization procedures performed practically the same: there was no significant difference in the word error rates obtained after the combination with the CH-only baseline.",
        "This suggests that we may be able to obtain improvements with automatically diacritized data even when using inaccurate diacritization, produced without the use of morphological constraints."

        "In this study we have investigated different options for automatically diacritizing Arabic text for use in acoustic model training for ASR.",
        "A comparison of the different approaches showed that more linguistic information (morphology and syntactic context) in combination with the acoustics provides lower diacritization error rates.",
        "However, there is no significant difference among the word error rates of ASR sys",
        "tion with the baseline system.",
        "FBIS1, FBIS2 and FBIS3 correspond to the diacritization procedures described in Sections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 respectively.",
        "For the first approach we report results using the tagger probabilities with weights 1 and 5. tems trained on data resulting from the different methods.",
        "This result suggests that it is possible to use automatically diacritized training data for acoustic modeling, even if the data has a comparatively high diacritization error rate (23% in our case).",
        "Note, however, that one reason for this may be that the acoustic models are finally adapted to the accurately transcribed CH-only data.",
        "In the future, we plan to apply knowledge-poor diacritization procedures to other dialects of Arabic, for which morphological analyzers do not exist."
