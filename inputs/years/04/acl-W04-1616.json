        "Stemming has been widely used in several fields of natural language processing such as data mining, information retrieval, and multivariate analysis.",
        "Some applications of multivariate analysis of text involve the identification of lexical occurrences of word stems in a text.",
        "Such lexical analysis, in which the frequency of word occurrences is significant, cannot be done without some form of stemming.",
        "In morphology, variants of words which have similar semantic interpretations are considered to belong to the same stem and to be equivalent for purposes of text analysis and information retrieval.",
        "For this reason, a number of stemming algorithms have been developed in an attempt to reduce such morphological variants of words to their common stem.",
        "Various stemming algorithms for a number of languages have been proposed.",
        "The structure of these stemmers range from the simplest technique, such as removing suffixes, to a more complicated design which uses the morphological structure of words to derive a stem.",
        "In case of Arabic, several stemming algorithms have been developed.",
        "The major inadequacy of existing systems to stem the Qur’an results from the fact that most of them deal with Modern Standard Arabic as their input text; the language of the Qur’an is Classical Arabic.",
        "Orthographic variations and the use of diacritics and glyphs in the representation of the language of Classical Arabic increase the difficulty of stemming.",
        "In many respects, the Qur’an, with its unique lexicon and orthography requires dedicated attention.",
        "Therefore, I have developed a new light stemmer that uses the Qur’an in western transliteration to improve the effectiveness of the stemming of the text."

        "Most of these roots are made up of three consonants which convey semantics.",

        "Several stemming algorithms for Arabic have been proposed based on different principles; each produces rather different sets of stem classifications.",
        "It is possible to evaluate these stemming algorithms by the accuracy of the results they produce.",
        "Larkey et al.",
        "gives a good summary of stemming approaches for the Arabic language [9].",
        "The most common approaches used in Arabic stemming are the light and the root-based stemmers.",
        "Root-based Stemming is based on removing all attached prefixes and suffixes in an attempt to extract the root of a given Arabic surface word.",
        "Several morphological analyzers have been developed, e.g. Buckwalter [3], Khoja and Garside [7] and Darwish [5].",
        "Light Stemming is used not to produce the linguistic root of a given Arabic surface form, but to remove the most frequent suffixes and prefixes.",
        "The most common suffixation includes duals and plurals for masculine and feminine, possessive forms, definite articles, and pronouns.",
        "Several light stemmers have been developed, all based on suffix and prefix removal and normalization.",
        "Examples of light stemmers include: Aljlayl & Frieder’s Stemmer [2], Darwish’s Al-Stem [6], Chen & Gey’s TREC 2002 Stemmer [4], and Larkey et al.’s U Mass Stemmer [8, 9].",
        "All light stemmers adhere to the same steps of normalization and stemming.",
        "The main difference among them is the number of prefixes and suffixes removed from each one.",
        "During the normalization process, all diacritics, punctuation, and glyphs are removed.",
        "The light stemmers had different stopword lists consisting of Arabic pronouns, particles and the like removed after minimal normalization.",
        "Test results of previous researchers as in [2, 8], proved that the light stemmer achieved superior performance over the root-based approach since it reduces sense ambiguity by grouping semantically related words into the same class.",
        "Although light stemming can correctly classify many variants of words into large stem classes, it can fail to classify other forms that should go together.",
        "For example, broken plurals for nouns and adjectives do not get conflated with their singular forms, and past tense verbs do not get conflated with their present tense forms, because they retain some affixes and internal differences."

      "text": [
        "My main objective for stemming the Qur’an is to prepare the text as data for multivariate analysis of the lexical semantics of the Qur’an using self-organizing maps in which words with similar meanings are placed at the same or neighbouring points so that the topological relations among them represent degrees of semantic similarity.",
        "This work requires the construction of vector space models of the suras (chapters) of the Qur’an such that each sura is represented by a vector indicating the occurrence frequency of variables.",
        "This involves counting the occurrences of lexical items in the Qur’an.",
        "Such a task cannot be done accurately without some sort of stemming of words in the text.",
        "The Qur’an has two significant textual features.",
        "The first is that the Classical Arabic language in which the Qur’an is written has created difficulty in reading and understanding it, even for the Arabs themselves.",
        "Its lexicon, morphology and grammar are more complicated than Modern Standard Arabic.",
        "It, therefore, requires specific attention.",
        "The second significant point is the wide use of vocalization.",
        "Diacritics (�, �, ,, ', r, �, �, ') representing short vowels are prevalent in the Qur’an.",
        "Every word, even every letter is marked with a diacritic.",
        "The meanings of the words in the Qur’an require the use of such diacritical marks; otherwise it becomes very difficult to comprehend their meanings especially when out of context.",
        "Vocalized text, in Arabic includes diacritics for short vowels and other details.",
        "Thus, a word could have several meanings when marked with different diacritics.",
        "(see Table 1).",
        "For those reasons stemming the Qur’an is not an easy task.",
        "In principal, the way existing Arabic stemmers are structured indicates that they will not work reliably on the stemming of the Qur’an.",
        "Most of the existing stemmers rely on Modern Standard Arabic as their input script.",
        "This modern form of Arabic is a simplified form of Classical Arabic.",
        "The main differences between both forms are that Modern Standard Arabic has less orthographic variation, a less complicated lexicon and a more modern vocabulary.",
        "The following two points are also significant regarding the use of existing stemmers to stem the Qur’an.",
        "First, the root-based algorithm increases word ambiguity.",
        "The root algorithm stems the surface form to a base form from which the word variants are derived.",
        "A major problem with this type of stemmer is that many word variants are different in meaning, though they originate from one identical root.",
        "For example words like hasib (he thought), hasaba (he counted), and hasab (of noble origin) are all derived from the same root hsb.",
        "Therefore, the over-stemming of the root algorithm results in the deterioration of the retrieval performance as compared to the light stemming algorithm.",
        "As noted by Khoja [7], another problem that the stemmer faces is that some of the letters that appear to be affixes are in fact part of the word.",
        "Second, the light stemmers perform better than the root-based algorithms, though not entirely efficiently.",
        "All initial steps of the light-based algorithms require normalization which involves the removal of diacritics.",
        "Thus, if diacritics were removed from the words listed in Table 1 above, there would be no other way to indicate the difference in meaning of all word variants.",
        "The normalization technique, though it appears simple, increases ambiguity.",
        "If normalization was applied to the Qur’an, it would leave the text highly ambiguous.",
        "As the case with root-based algorithms, some of the suffixes and prefixes to be removed using light stemmers are originally part of the word.",
        "Therefore, I propose a new light stemming approach that gives better results, particularly when applied to a rich vocalized text as the Qur’an.",
        "The stemmer is basically a light stemmer to remove prefixes and suffixes and is applied to a version of the Qur’an transliterated into western script.",
        "The use of the transliteration is highly significant for resolving the problem of diacritics in the Qur’an.",
        "Given that the transliteration of the Qur’an is available in western script, the problem of diacritics is resolved, since in the transliterated version of the Qur’an, each diacritic is translated into a letter in Roman script.",
        "Thus, the ambiguity that arises when removing the diacritics from the Arabic text is avoided.",
        "So, while the word '�L could have three different meanings when it appears without diacritics in Arabic, in transliteration each meaningful word has a single representation.",
        "(see Table 1).",
        "Another advantage of using transliteration is avoiding the removal of suffixes and prefixes that sometimes could be part of the word.",
        "The prefix � (pronounced as “bi”) is very common in Arabic.",
        "This preposition resembles the letter Y of the Arabic alphabet.",
        "Thus, removing this letter indistinguishably would cause ambiguity if the letter is part of a word.",
        "For example, in words as -)=:4 (sea), �U�f� (proof), the letter 4 is part of the word, whereas, in �I��� (with a pen) the 4 is a preposition.",
        "If the diacritics that are marking the letter Y were removed, the first letter in each word would be exactly the same, though different in pronunciation.",
        "Therfore, stemming the words from the prefix ,, in general, would be incorrect.",
        "When transliterating the same three words (�=:�, ���f�, �I���) the prefix 4 would be represented as ba (bahr), bu (burhan), and bi (biqalam) respectively.",
        "The proposed light stemmer would only include “bi” as a prefix thus, avoiding removing the other representations of that letter.",
        "A few stems in Arabic begin with “bi”; those are added to a stopword list to be removed before stemming.",
        "The same process would be applied to the other prefixes to be removed such as ( I, 5, 9, �, J►), (la/li, ka, fa, sa, al)."
