        "Language Weaver has produced a high-performance statistical Arabic-to-English machine translation system, based on research work conducted at the University of Southern California, Information Sciences Institute (USC/ISI).",
        "Getting resource-unlimited laboratory systems to run in real time, on a typical desktop Windows machine, is among Language Weaverâ€™s contributions.",
        "The system is designed to provide broad general coverage of Arabic news, and is currently used at various sites within the U.S. Government.",
        "The Arabic->English translation system to be demonstrated has been prepared in versions that require 1 or 2 GB of RAM, and run on a 1.5GHz or faster processor and translates at a minimum rate of 500 words per minute.",
        "The system includes an option to trade off speed for quality in the translation process allowing users to select the fastest possible gisting-quality output, or the best possible translation quality for each sentence."
