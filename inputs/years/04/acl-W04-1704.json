        "Ideally, a language teaching system should both “encourage the creative use of language in communicatively relevant settings” (Menzel and Schroeder, 1998) and also provide detailed and adaptive feedback (cf. (Michaud, 2002)).",
        "Many systems resolve the issue by means of complex parsing.",
        "In what follows, we describe VINCI, a multilingual generation environment which represents a complementary approach in that it assumes conversational control, dynamically producing more or less complex texts and asking information of users.",
        "VINCI is based on a collection of metalanguages which define the semantics, syntax, lexicon and morphology of a language.",
        "Text files defining the language are read by an interpreter (written in C) and output is presented either orthographically or phonetically.",
        "When used in a teaching context, VINCI creates an utterance and presents it to a learner.",
        "It also creates a series of questions based on each utterance, together with some hidden answers.",
        "The learner is prompted to respond to each question, and his or her response is compared with the hidden one (or ones) and a detailed report is produced on the relation between the two.",
        "This report provides information on a learner’s comprehension and language skills, as well as guidance for subsequent generation.",
        "VINCI is capable of generation in many languages, and has been tested on such diverse languages as Spanish, Italian, Russian and Chinese.",
        "Our work to date has been carried out in both English and French, predominantly the latter.",
        "For the generation of simple utterances, VINCI constructs a syntax tree using context-free rules and syntactic transformations.",
        "The nodes of the tree may be decorated with attributes, whose role is to maintain grammatical and perhaps semantic agreement by restricting the choice of lexical items and controlling morphology.",
        "Once a tree is formed, its leaves are assigned suitable lexical choices which are inflected by morphology rules.",
        "In the most basic situation, choices among syntactic alternatives and among possible lexical entries are made at random.",
        "In such a model, the semantic control exercised by attributes is minimal.",
        "They can, for example, ensure that the subject of a verb such as eat is animate and its object edible, but they cannot influence the overall meaning of the utterance produced.",
        "To achieve this, VINCI makes use of preselections."

      "heading": "1.1 Preselections",
      "text": [
        "Preselections may be thought of as forming a metaphoric blackboard on which the person requiring an utterance writes some choices about its features.",
        "Lexical entries corresponding to these features are selected before the syntax tree is formed, and syntax rules have access both to the words themselves and to information about them obtained from the lexicon.",
        "We will illustrate this by showing the steps in the generation of a short fairy tale, although other sorts of texts are also possible.",
        "In a typical fairy tale we have a collection of characters, including a pompous twit (a king or a rich merchant), a victim or heroine (the twit’s daughter), a villain (a sorcerer or witch), a hero (a prince or a brave woodcutter), a goodfairy (the victim’s fairy godmother), a magicobj (a sword or a silver goblet).",
        "These form the basis for a set of preselections such as:",
        "These preselections presuppose a database of characters/objects which are simply entries in a lexicon:",
        "Preselections can be specified with more or less precision.",
        "In this example, only Midas can be chosen for the role of twit, but any member of the class PN (proper names) having the attributes male, brave and handsome can be selected as hero.",
        "We might well have written twit: PN [rich] /@14: daughter making the twit any PN who is rich and has a pointer to a daughter in lexical field 14.",
        "These preselections are global, in that they persist across several utterances.",
        "If the hero is a prince in one sentence, he cannot be a woodcutter in the next.",
        "In contrast, the local preselections described below associate these characters with a semantic role in a particular sentence, for example, the agent or the patient.",
        "We can envisage a user typing/editing a global preselections file to select favorite characters for a story.",
        "Alternatively, there may be an interface which allows a user to choose characters from a set of menus.",
        "In the following tale, we assume that Wanda has been preselected as the goodfairy and magic sword as magicobj."

      "text": [
        "A semantic expression is a representation of the content of an utterance in a form in which the grammatical constraints of any particular natural language have been abstracted away, leaving only some expression of meaning behind.",
        "A simple functional notation is used, described more fully in (Levison et al., 2001b).",
        "These expressions are transformed into VINCI preselections, triggering syntax rules which, in their turn, yield sentences in some language.",
        "The same sequence of expressions can transformed into paragraphs in different languages or different paragraphs in the same language.",
        "The plot for the fairy tale can be specified as a sequence of these expressions: exists(twit) Once upon a time there was a twit.",

        "action(victim) She went for a walk in the forest.",
        "exists(villain) In the forest there lived a villain.",
        "describe(villain) He was strong and evil.",
        "kidnap(villain, victim) The villain kidnapped the victim.",
        "exists(hero) In the same area, there lived a hero.",
        "seekhelp(twit, hero) The twit sought his help.",

        "rescue(hero, victim) The hero rescued the victim, ... marry(hero, victim) married her, ... livehappily(hero, victim) and lived happily ever after.",

        "Indeed there might be alternative plots or sections, perhaps chosen by a user or produced by a text planner.",
        "Let us repeat that these expressions are language-independent.",
        "The names of the functions and parameters are, in fact, VINCI attributes, and although English words have been used here, any string of letters or digits could have been substituted.",

        "Among other things, this allows the system to capture constraints on word order, argument structure, and agreement.",
        "This is accomplished by means of inheritance of attributes down the nodes of a syntax tree, and guarded syntax rules, in which attributes present on a parent node are used to determine the nature of child nodes.",
        "For example, given a parent node such as NP (noun phrase) containing the attribute ’p1’ (first person), a guarded syntax rule (these are headed by the symbol <) will determine that the only possible child node is a pronoun.",
        "However, in the default case (these are headed by the symbol >), the child may take either the form of a pronoun or a full noun phrase.",
        "Let us now return to the example of preselections developed above and resume with the action of syntax rules on the output of preselections and semantic expressions.",
        "The section of the context-free rules corresponding to vtdi describe the structure of a sentence with a vtdi verb in terms of the its agent, theme and beneficiary.",
        "Thus, assuming the local preselections given above:",
        "The root of the utterance (the top of its syntax tree) has four child nodes, two of them proper noun phrases (NPP), a third a common noun phrase (NP).",
        "To the first it passes a Number-value, sing, a Function-value, agent, and a Detkind-value.",
        "When this NPP is developed into its two children, it assigns these attribute values to Nu, Fn and De, passing De to DET (hence a or the) and Nu to the child noun, which will therefore be singular.",
        "This noun is also directed to obtain its lexical entry from the preselection labelled Fn (i.e. agent, which in turn refers to goodf airy, and hence to Wanda).",
        "Furthermore, rather than using Wanda itself, the chosen noun must be replaced the lexical entry indicated by tag type in field 13 (fairy godmother).",
        "The other noun phrases obtain their nouns similarly from beneficiary and theme, though the last (NP) uses the preselected magicobj directly.",
        "The root’s verb-child, which will be third person singular past tense, will obtain its lexical entry from the preselection labelled act.",
