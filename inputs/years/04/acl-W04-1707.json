        "On the other hand, the available eLearning platforms such as WebCT [1], CISCO [2], and the freeware HotPotatoes [3], are far from the application of advanced language technologies that might provide interfaces based on speech and language processing.",

        "Recently on-line voice communication between teachers and students has been made available as well, via fast Internet in virtual classrooms, but no speech or language processing has been considered.",
        "So there is a deep, principle gap between the advanced research on tutoring systems and the typical market eLearning environments addressing primarily the communication needs of the mass user.",
        "In what follows we will concentrate on research prototypes integrating language technologies in eLearning environments.",

        "The project is oriented to learners who need English language competence as well as expertise in correct usage of English financial terms.",
        "This ambitiously formulated paradigm required the integration of some formal techniques for NL understanding, allowing for analysis of the users answers o drills where he student is given the opportunity to enter free natural language text (normally short discourse of 2-3 sentences).",
        "The morphological, syntax and semantic analysis is performed by the system Parasite (Ramsay, 2000), developed in UMIST.",
        "After the logical form has been produced for each correct sentence, the CALL environment has to determine whether the students utterance matches the expected appropriate answer in the current learning situation.",

        "Unlike MILT (Dorr, 1995), we think that the correct answer has to be subsumed by the maximum expected one, i.e. there is not only a lower but also an upper limit on the correctness.",

        "Proofs are certainly based on a predefined ontology of the domain terms, which in this case is a lexical one since the terms are treated as words with special lexical meaning encoded in the meaning postulates thus forming a hidden hierarchy of meanings.",
        "The conceptual and lexical hierarchy of meanings are further discussed in (Angelova, 2004).",
        "However, we discovered that deep semantic analysis is difficult to integrate in CALL.",
        "First, this requires enormous amount of efforts for the meaning postulates acquisition.",
        "While hierarchy of terms is reusable, as it is in fact the domain model, the propositions, which encode the lexical semantics are somewhat application and domain specific and therefore difficult to reuse or to transfer to another domain (moreover they are bound to the domain words).",

        "Second, the result is not perfect from the perspective of the user who has to answer with correct and full sentences (see section 5 for details).",
        "Thus our recent work (Boytcheva, 2004) is directed towards integration of shallow and deep semantic techniques in CALL systems.",
        "We use shallow parsing, which allows for the processing of both syntactically incorrect and incomplete answers.",
        "However, during the user s utterances evaluation we use deep semantic analysis concerning the concepts and the relations that are important for the domain only.",
        "Users answers are represented as logical forms, convenient for the inference mechanism, which takes into account the type hierarchy and is elaborated in domain-specific points only.",
        "Thus the combination of shallow and deep techniques gives the users more freedom in answering, i.e. various utterances to express themselves without impeding the evaluation process.",
        "The idea to apply the shallow NLP techniques in CALL was inspired by their successful application in IE for template filling.",
        "The assessment of user knowledge in a specific domain can be viewed as a kind of template filling, where the templates correspond to concepts and relations relevant to the tested domain."

        "Unfortunately, there are only few research prototypes that address the problem from this perspective, which are very expensive and have delivered only partially applicable results so far.",
        "Another option is to try to exploit the IR techniques we have at hand in order to check for instance whether the students answer contains the right words(in which case it would be a good writing, since it would be similar to the expectation).",
        "A natural choice for assessing the usage of the right words is the so-called Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) as it reveals the latent links between the words and phrases, especially when it is trained with enough samples.",
        "Below we briefly overview the application of LSA in eLearning and our experiments in this direction.",
        "The classical LSA method, as proposed in (Deerwester, 1990) is a bag-of-words technique, which represents the text semantics by assigning vectors to words and texts (or text fragments).",
        "Indeed, knowing how words are combined to encode the document knowledge is a kind of semantic representation of the word meaning and text semantics.",
        "The underlying idea is that words are semantically similar, if they appear in similar texts, and texts are semantically similar, if they contain similar words.",
        "This mutual word-text dependency is investigated by building a word-text matrix, where each cell contains the number of occurrences of word X in document Y, after which the original matrix is submitted to Singular Value Decomposition a transformation that isis meant to reveal the hidden (latent) similarity between words and texts.",
        "This produces a vector of low dimensionality (the claim is that 300 is near optimal) for each word and for each text.",
        "The similarity between two words, two texts, or a word and a text, is given by the cosine of the angle between their corresponding vectors (the cosine is the most popular similarity measure).",
        "Therefore, the similarity between two words or two sets of words is a number between 1 (lowest similarity) and 1 (highest similarity).",
        "Without morphology and grammar rules, syntactical analysis, and manually encoded implicit knowledge, LSA is considered successful in various experiments including assessment of student essays.",
        "For the purposes of assessment, usually a high-dimensional space is computed from texts describing the domain (most often the available electronic version of the course).",

        "The teachers were very pleased to have concordancers with contiguously updated term usages; they would gladly see such a language resource integrated in a further authoring tool, because searching suitable texts in Internet is a difficult and time-consuming task.",
        "Unfortunately the learners were not very enthusiastic regarding the free NL input, as it permits relatively restricted simple answers and does not go beyond the human capacity of the teacher.",
        "The main disappointment of both learners and teachers is the systems nability o answer why, i.e. while the formal semantics and reasoning tools provide extremely comprehensive diagnostic about the error type, they tell nothing about the reason.",
        "Fortunately, all users liked the fact that there were numerous examples of terms usages from real texts whenever morphological or syntax errors were encountered in the free NL input.",
        "Thus we conclude with a certain pessimism concerning the appropriateness of todays formal semantic approaches in ITS and much optimism that data-driven corpus techniques, if properly applied, fit quite well to the adaptive ITS.",
        "What is still desirable regarding the filtering module is to restrict the genre of the suggested readings, since the current texts are freely collected from the Internet and some of them should be used as teaching materials (LSA cannot recognise the text educational appropriateness since it considers the termsoccurrences only; other upervised techniques such as text categorisation might improve the filtering, if properly integrated).",
        "As a possible improvement of the current paradigm for formal analysis, we turned recently to partial analysis, which gives more flexibility to the students to enter phrases instead of full sentences (Boytcheva, 2004)."

        "The conclusion is that teachers as well as learners like CALL systems that are easy to integrate in the typical educational tasks, i.e. the area of language learning has well-established traditions and the experimental software is well-accepted, only if it is really useful and facilitates the learning process.",
        "Our feeling is that all attempts to integrate language technologies in CALL should be closely related to testing the laboratory software with real students.",
        "At the same time, cooperation with teachers is an obligatory condition as the necessary pedagogical background is often missing in the research environments where normally the NLP applications and language resources appear.",
        "Language technologies have a long way to go, until they find the proper wrappings for integration of advanced applications and the necessary resources into useful CALL systems."
