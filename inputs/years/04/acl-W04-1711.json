        "To a first approximation CL/NLP technologies split into two broad categories – A and B.",
        "Category A (sometimes referred to as CL proper) typically includes small coverage, proof of concept, often hand-crafted, knowledge or rule-based systems.",
        "They are usually used to test a particular linguistic theory, tend to be of limited coverage and are often quite brittle.",
        "Example technologies include DCGs and many (but not all) formal grammar-based parsing and generation systems.",
        "Category B (sometimes referred to as NLP) typically includes broad coverage systems where the lingware is often (but not always – see e.g. FST) automatically induced and processed using statistical approaches.",
        "They are usually large scale engineering applications and very robust.",
        "Example technologies include speech processing, HMM taggers, probabilistic parsing and FST.",
        "This distinction is, of course, nothing more than a useful over-generalisation with an entire and interesting grey area existing between the two extremes.",
        "Khader et al.",
        "(2004), for example, show how a wide-coverage, robust rule-based system is used in CALL.",

        "For the most part, use of their tools for language learning/teaching applications is not high on their research agenda.",

        "Furthermore, as Schulze (2003) points out, within the unspoken hierarchy that exists in Computer Science departments throughout the world, working with CALL is considered less prestigious than say, working on cryptography.",
        "Thus, sociocultural factors may have played a part in limiting the number of CL/NLP researchers interested in CALL.",
        "From a CALL researcher’s or practitioner’s point of view, attempts to integrate CL/NLP resources into CALL have not been very successful.",
        "Many remain unconvinced about the benefits of using CL/NLP techniques in CALL and whether they can be integrated successfully or not.",
        "They sometimes expect an ‘all-singing, all-dancing’ machine and are disappointed /disillusioned with the results of ICALL research, especially when they incorporate category A CL technologies.",
        "CALL practitioners generally come from a language teaching background and are often more interested in pedagogy than technology.",

        "Even if they are favourably disposed to the use of CL/NLP resources in CALL, it is often very difficult to reuse existing resources, as they demand that a certain (often non-standard) format be used for data (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2 below).",
        "Also, the interfaces to the resources may have assumed a techno-savvy or CL/NLP-savvy user, which mitigates against their (re)use.",
        "In summary, apart from notable exceptions (e.g. Glosser (Dokter & Nerbonne, 1998) and FreeText (2001), for various technical and non-technical reasons, CL/NLP resources have not been extensively deployed in mainstream CALL applications.",
        "One of the problems in using CL/NLP resources in CALL materials is that the coverage achieved by the CL/NLP tools has to be broad to be able to handle a general range of learner language.",
        "Furthermore, the resources must be robust as learner language will contain input that is not well-formed and this can cause problems for some CL resources.",
        "Observations such as these point to type B NLP technologies as being the better type of technologies to employ in the context of language learning.",

        "Considering the other end of the language-learning spectrum, that of primary school learners, it may be perceived that CL/NLP resources could not be so easily deployed with linguistically less advanced learners - these students will not be interested in viewing concordances, morphological annotations or parse trees.",
        "However, it can be argued that there are certain natural circumstances supporting the use of even type A CL technology in CALL in this environment.",

        "The target primary school students are aged between 7 and 13 years (second to sixth class in the Irish primary school system).",
        "They tend to produce simpler sentences and have a smaller range of vocabulary than an adult.",
        "These L1 features have a number of implications – the students’ L 1 knowledge further constrains their emerging L2 production.",
        "Complex linguistic constructs are less likely to transfer into the target language.",
        "Effectively, the target language amounts to a controlled language.",
        "Controlled languages are easier suited to type A CL systems and produce better results (Arnold et al., 1994).",
        "Secondly, the students’ target language(s) (Irish and German in this context) represent a limited domain or sublanguage.",
        "The Irish curriculum is followed in primary schools from the age of 4/5.",
        "Students can take German (where it’s available) during their senior years of primary school (aged 10-13) and the language domain is limited to a 2 year beginners’ curriculum.",
        "It is possible to anticipate students’ L2 knowledge, especially since they have been following set curricula.",
        "Machine Translation (MT) can be used to highlight an example of the success of sublanguages with CL/NLP.",
        "The Météo translation system is used successfully in Canada to translate weather forecasts bidirectionally between French and English (Hutchins and Somers, 1992).",
        "The ‘weather’ sublanguage has a small vocabulary and uses a telegraphic style of writing and omits tense.",
        "Primary school students’ L 1 and L2 performance characteristics – controlled language and limited domain – imply that some scalability problems that are sometimes encountered in certain type A CL resources can be avoided.",
        "While primary school learners will not be interested in viewing concordances or parse trees – technology can be used but hidden from the learner, to generate exercises and learner feedback and to present students with an animation based on information computed by the underlying CL/NLP engines embedded (but not visible) in the CALL application.",

        "Examples of type B-like systems include a broad-coverage English LFG-based grammar for grammar checking (Khader et al., 2004), the Systran MT system to improve translation skills (La Torre, 1999) and using speech recognition for pronunciation training (Menzel et al., 2001).",
        "It is relatively straightforward to integrate type B (NLP) technology into CALL applications for primary school learners.",
        "In Section 4 of this paper we show how broad-coverage FST technology can be used to morphologically analyse word forms or to generate all inflected forms given a root form.",
        "Output from a FST morphology engine is fed into an interface engine which sends the information in the appropriate format to an XML/Flash environment for animation (Koller, 2004).",
        "The learner input can be collated over time into a learner corpus and later analysed by the teacher to detect common errors amongst students.",
        "Part-Of-Speech (POS) taggers can be used to identify the parts of speech in electronic versions of learners’ textbooks or a corpus collated around their curriculum (Section 5).",
        "The output can then be used for a variety of uses, including the automatic generation of online exercises (e.g. hangman) and together with the FST morphological engine - automatic dictionary extraction.",
        "Mainly due to scalability problems, type A CL technologies can be difficult to deploy in general ICALL systems.",
        "However, they can be used in the primary school context quite effectively.",
        "As outlined in Section 2.4, the limited linguistic performance knowledge of the learners’ L1 and especially their L2 amounts to a ‘controlled’ language scenario and type A CL technologies can be deployed successfully.",
        "Curricula used in primary schools (in Ireland and elsewhere) represent a limited domain in which type A technologies can be highly appropriate.",
        "Small coverage DCGs, for example, can be written for the anticipated L2 learner input and can be used to provide immediate feedback to the learner.",
        "Problems associated with difficulties in building wider-coverage grammars do not present themselves in this context, as the curriculum is limited.",
        "The are many other potential uses of CL/NLP in this context, but this paper will focus on the FST and POS tagging examples mentioned above."
