        "The following semantic relationships are sought: 1. verbs that refer to activities carried out by the nouns (e.g., \"serveur d�marre\"; \"server starts\"); 2. verbs that refer to uses of the nouns (e.g., \"activer une option\"; \"activate an option\" or \"naviguer sur Internet\"; \"surf the Internet\"); 3. verbs that refer to activities carried out by means of the nouns (e.g., \"activer l'option au moyen de cette commande\"; \"activate this option with this com-mand\"); and, finally, 4. verbs that refer to the processes by",

        "ASARES is based on a Machine Learning technique, Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) (Muggleton and De-Raedt, 1994), which infers general morpho-syntactic patterns from a set of examples (this set is noted E+ hereafter) and counterexamples (E – ) of the elements one",
        "wants to acquire and their context.",
        "The contextual patterns produced can then be applied to the corpus in order to retrieve new elements.",
        "The acquisition process can be summarized in 3 steps:",
        "1. construction of the sets of examples (and counter-examples); 2. inference of extraction patterns with ASARES; and 3. extraction of N-V pairs from the corpus with the inferred patterns.",
        "ASARES has been previously applied to the acquisition of word pairs sharing semantic relations defined in the Generative Lexicon framework (Pustejovsky, 1995) and called qualia relations (Bouillon et al., 2001).",
        "Here, we propose to use ASARES in a quite similar way to retrieve our valid N-V pairs.",
        "However, the N-V combinations sought are more specific than those that were identified in these previous experiments.",
        "Formally, ILP aims at inferring logic programs (sets of Horn clauses, noted H) from a set of facts (examples and counterexamples of the concept to be learnt) and background knowledge (B), such that the program H logically entails the examples with respect to the background knowledge and rejects (most of) the counterexamples.",
        "This is transcribed by the two logical formulae B n H�= E+, B n H��= E – , which set the aim of an ILP algorithm.",

        "transcribes the fact that a noun and a verb may be a valid N-V pair if N is a common noun (common_noun (N)) and V is contiguous to N (contiguous(N,V).",

        "This pattern covers the case in which N precedes V, such as \"les utilisateurs lancent tour-a-tour leurs programmes\" (\"users launch in turn their programs\") or in which V precedes N, such as \"il est donc necessaire d'executer la commande depmod\" (\"thus� it is necessary to run the depmod command\".",

        "Another frequent clue in the patterns produced is, unsurprisingly, that N must be the head of a noun phrase.",
        "For example, realiza-tion(N,V) :- near_word(N,V), near_verb(N,V), precedes(V,N), noun_ ph_head(N), pred(N,C), preposition(C), V�=C, N�=C, N�=V.",

        "+ (preposition) + N head of a noun phrase and retrieves pairs such as: \"les dispositifs d'impression n'etaient pas controles par ordinateur\" (\"the printing devices were not controlled by computer\").",
        "Prepositions also play an important part and appear frequently in the patterns: re-alization(N,V):- near_verb(N,V), pred(N,C), lemma(C,\"sur\"), V�=C, N�=C, N�=V.",
        "(that is V + (anything but a verb)* + sur + N) covers for example \"un terminal (...) permet de travailler sur",

        "5.2 Methodology for evaluation In order to evaluate the quality of the extracted N-V pairs, we are interested in two different measures.",
        "The first one expresses the completeness of the set of retrieved N-V pairs, that is, how many valid pairs are found with respect to the total number of pairs which should have been found; this is the recall rate.",
        "The second measure indicates the reliability of the set of retrieved N-V pairs, that is, how many valid pairs are found with respect to the total number of retrieved pairs; this is the precision rate (defined below).",
        "These two rates were evaluated using a test sample containing all this information.",
        "CompuTerm 2004 - 3rd International Workshop on Computational Terminology 43 To construct this test set, we have focused our attention on ten domain-specific terms: commande (command), configuration, fichier (file), Internet, logiciel (software), option, ordinateur (computer), serveur (server), systeme (system), utilisateur (user).",
        "The terms have been identified as the most specific to our corpus by a program developed by Drouin (2003) and called TER1vloSTAT.",
        "The ten most specific nouns have been produced by comparing our corpus of computing to the French corpus Le Monde, composed of newspaper articles (Lemay et al., 2004).",
        "Note that to prevent any bias in the results, none of these terms were used as positive examples during the pattern inference step.",
        "(They were removed from the example set.)",
        "For each of these 10 nouns, a manual identification of valid and invalid pairs was carried out.",
        "Linguists were asked to analyze the sentences and decide whether the highlighted pairs were valid N-V pairs.",
        "Examples of the sentences produced are given in Table 2 for the term utilisateur (user).",
        "A pair is considered as valid if at least one of its occurrences has the desired semantic (and syntactic) relationship (cf. section 2).",
        "Finally, 603 of the N-V pairs examined are valid and 4446 are considered not to be valid.",
        "The results for each noun are detailed in Table 3.",
        "To compare the results obtained by our technique with the analysis carried out manually, we use the traditional precision/recall approach.",
        "Thus we applied the patterns to the corpus and kept all the pairs retrieved when N is one of the ten specific nouns.",
        "The results of the comparison are summarized with the help of confusion matrices like the one presented in Table 43.",
        "It is important to note here that the values in this confusion matrix depend on a parameter: a detection threshold.",
        "Indeed, a single occurrence of a N-V pair with the patterns is not sufficient for a pair to be considered as valid.",
        "The threshold, called s, represents the minimal number of occurrences to be detected to consider a pair as valid.",
        "The recall and precision rates (respectively R and P), measured on our test set, are thus defined according to s. In order to represent every possible value of R and P according to s, we draw a recall-precision graph in which each value of P is related to its corresponding value of R. Figure 1 gives the graph obtained when applying the inferred patterns to the test set.",
        "For comparison purposes, Figure 1 also indicates the recall-precision graphs obtained by two common statistical techniques for collocation acquisition (the Loglike et Mutual Information coefficients presented in section 4.3).",
        "As a baseline, this graph also gives the density, computed as AP/S, which represents the precision that would be obtained by a system deciding randomly if a pair is valid or not.",
        "The recall-precision graph shows that our symbolic technique outperforms the two statistical ones; for a fixed recall, the precision gain is up to 45% with respect to the Loglike results and is even higher with respect the MI coefficient.",
        "Thus, our acquisition technique meets the objective of offering assistance to the terminog-rapher, since it provides many reliable N-V pair candidates.",
        "However, results show that invalid pairs are also retrieved; thus a manual analysis remains unavoidable."

        "For example, in the sentence \"la première solution est d'utiliser la commande date\" (\"the first solution is to use the date command\") the noun date was incorrectly tagged as a verb, and the N-V pair commande-dater was retrieved by one of the inferred patterns.",
        "Even if this kind of error does not come directly from our acquisition technique and does not call into question our approach, it is still a factor that should be taken into account, especially when considering the choice of CompuTerm 2004 - 3rd International Workshop on Computational Terminology 45 the tagger and the quality of the texts composing our corpus.",
        "Secondly, in a few cases, there is no syntactic link between N and V, as is the case with logiciel-garantir (software-guarantee) in \"cette phase garantit la verification du logiciel\" (\"this step guarantees the software verification\").",
        "Even if these errors are rare in the retrieved pairs examined, our symbolic extraction system could certainly be enhanced with information about the syntactic function of nouns (subject, direct object...).",
        "The learning algorithm could then incorporate this information and produce more relevant patterns.",
        "Thirdly, some N-V pairs are retrieved, although there is no semantic link between N and V, or at least, not a semantic link that would be encoded by a terminographer in a dictionary.",
        "This is the case for ordinateur-savoir (computer-know) in \"l'ordinateur ne sait pas où chercher\" (\"the computer does not know where to look\").",
        "Again, morpho-syntactic information is not always sufficient to distinguish between semantically related pairs and non-semantically (but syntactically) related ones.",
        "Finally, other very frequent errors are caused by the fact that there actually is an interesting semantic link between N and V in a retrieved pair, but not the realization link we are looking for.",
        "Indeed, some nouns belonging to specific semantic classes will often cooccur with verbs expressing realization meanings (and thus often appear in valid N-V pairs) while others do not.",
        "For example, nouns like ordinateur (computer) and utilisateur (user) often appear in valid N-V pairs.",
        "On the other hand, other nouns clearly do not appear in combinations with realization verbs (e.g., configuration; Internet, refer to Table 3).",
        "These last two kinds of error clearly illustrate the limitations of our symbolic approach (but are also very frequent errors in statistical approaches since cooccurrence is not enough to capture subtle semantic distinctions).",
        "In fact, they tend to show that our method could be enhanced if it could incorporate richer linguistic information.",
        "Indeed, morpho-syntactic information is not always sufficient to operate fine-grained sense distinctions.",
        "For example, the two sentences below have the same combination of Part-of-Speech tags: \"vous pouvez utiliser la commande exit\" (\"you can use the exit command\") and \"vous devez choisir l'option 64MB\" (\"you must choose the 64MB option\"); in the first one the underlined N-V pair is valid whereas this is not the case in the second one.",
        "Realization verbs for option would be valider (validate) and activer (activate), for example.",
        "Here again, these subtle distinctions could be handled by our symbolic method provided that some semantic information is given on nouns This could be supplied by a semantic tagger."
