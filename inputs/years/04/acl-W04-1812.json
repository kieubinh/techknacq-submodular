        "The main goal of literature mining is to retrieve knowledge that is “buried” in a text and to present the distilled knowledge to users in a concise form.",
        "Its advantage, compared to “manual” knowledge discovery, is based on the assumption that automatic methods are able to process an enormous amount of texts.",
        "It is doubtful that any researcher could process such huge amount of information, especially if the knowledge spans across domains.",
        "For these reasons, literature mining aims at helping scientists in collecting, maintaining, interpreting and curating information.",
        "In this paper, we introduce a knowledge integration and structuring system (KISS) we designed, in which terminology-driven knowledge acquisition (KA), knowledge retrieval (KR) and knowledge visualization (KV) are combined using automatic term recognition, automatic term clustering and terminology-based similarity calculation is explained.",

        "The main purpose of the knowledge structuring system is 1) accumulating knowledge in order to develop huge knowledge bases, 2) exploiting the accumulated knowledge efficiently.",
        "Our approach to structuring knowledge is based on:",
        "• automatic term recognition (ATR) • automatic term clustering (ATC) as an ontology1 development • ontology-based similarity calculation • visualization of relationships among documents (KSs)",
        "One of our definitions to structuring knowledge is discovery of relevance between documents (KSs) and its visualization.",
        "In order to achieve real time processing for structuring knowledge, we adopt terminology / ontology-based similarity calculation, because knowledge can also be represented as textual documents or passages (e.g. sentences, subsections) which are efficiently characterized by sets of specialized (technical) terms.",
        "Further details of our visualization scheme will be mentioned in Section 4.",
        "The system architecture is modular, and it integrates the following components (Figure 1) : - Ontology Development Engine(s) (ODE) – components that carry out the automatic ontology development which includes recognition and structuring of domain terminology; - Knowledge Data Manager (KDM) – stores index of KSs and ontology in a ontology information database (OID) and provides the corresponding interface; - Knowledge Retriever (KR) – retrieves KSs from TID and calculates similarities between keywords and KSs.",
        "Currently, we adopt tf*idf based similarity calculation; - Similarity Calculation Engine(s) (SCE) – calculate similarities between KSs provided from KR component using ontology developed by ODE in order to show semantic similarities between each KSs.",
        "Semantic clusters of KSs are also provided.",
        "- Graph Visualizer – visualizes knowledge structures based on graph expression in which relevance links between provided keywords and KSs, and relevance links between the KSs themselves can be shown.",
        "Linguistic preprocessing within the system is performed in two steps.",
        "In the first step, POS tagging2, i.e. the assignment of basic parts of speech (e.g. noun, verb, etc.)",
        "to words, is performed.",
        "In the second step, an ontology development engine is used to perform ATR and ATC.",

        "The lack of clear naming standards in a domain (e.g. biomedicine) makes ATR a nontrivial problem [1].",
        "Also, it typically gives rise to many-to-many relationships between terms and concepts.",
        "In practice, two problems stem from this fact: 1) there are terms that have multiple meanings (term ambiguity), and, conversely, 2) there are terms that refer to the same concept (term variation).",
        "Generally, term ambiguity has negative effects on IE precision, while term variation decreases IE recall.",
        "These problems point out the impropriety of using simple keyword-based IE techniques.",
        "Obviously, more sophisticated techniques, identifying groups of different terms referring to the same (or similar) concept(s), and, therefore, could benefit from relying on efficient and consistent ATR/ATC and term variation management methods are required.",
        "These methods are also important for organising domain specific knowledge, as terms should not be treated isolated from other terms.",
        "They should rather be related to one another so that the relations existing between the corresponding concepts are at least partly reflected in a terminology.",

        "It is implemented as a two-step procedure.",
        "In the first step, term candidates are extracted by using a set of linguistic filters, implemented using a LFG-based GLR parser, which describe general term formation patterns.",
        "In the second step, the term candidates are assigned termhoods (referred to as C-values) according to a statistical measure.",
        "The measure amalgamates four numerical corpus-based characteristics of a candidate",
        "term, namely the frequency of occurrence, the frequency of occurrence as a substring of other candidate terms, the number of candidate terms containing the given candidate term as a substring, and the number of words contained in the candidate term.",
        "The NC-value method further improves the C-value results by taking into account the context of candidate terms.",
        "The relevant context words are extracted and assigned weights based on how frequently they appear with top-ranked term candidates extracted by the C-value method.",
        "Subsequently, context factors are assigned to candidate terms according to their co-occurrence with top-ranked context words.",
        "Finally, new termhood estimations, referred to as NC-values, are calculated as a linear combination of the C-values and context factors for the respective terms.",
