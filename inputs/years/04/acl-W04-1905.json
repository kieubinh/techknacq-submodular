        "The TiGer Dependency Bank (henceforth TiGer DB) consists of a part of the TiGer Treebank, currently about 40,000 syntactically annotated sentences of German newspaper texts (Brants et al., in press).",
        "It is annotated with so-called dependency triples, i.e. a functor representing a grammatical relation or feature and two arguments representing the head and the value of this feature respectively.",
        "The format of these dependency triples is the same as in the PARC 700 Dependency Bank (King et al., 2003), which makes it possible to use the tools for displaying and pruning structures that are available together with this English dependency bank.",
        "The grammatical relations encoded in the TiGer DB are to a fair extent identical to the edge labels used in the TiGer Treebank; in order to make it more suitable as a basis for the evaluation of German parsers, additional distinctions have to be made in the set of grammatical relations, which leads to an enlarged set of features compared to the TiGer Treebank.l The TiGer DB is created because the graphs of the TiGer Treebank themselves are difficult to use as a gold standard for German parsers for a number of reasons: The constituency annotation in the TiGer graphs has the advantage of being fairly theory-neutral, but (i) since it includes discontinuous constituents and secondary edges, it cannot be mimicked by any of the German parsers we are aware of.",
        "Besides, (ii) the to-kenization (and lemmatization) of certain multi-word expressions, compounds etc.",
        "differs from the analyses most parsers obtain.",
        "The functional annotation in the TiGer graphs is more suitable for the evaluation and comparison of parsers across theoretical frameworks, but (iii) it is intimately tied to the constituency annotation, including edge labels such as ADC2 (multi-token adjective component), which only exist due to the lemmatization decisions mentioned above, and (iv) it does not encode all information and distinctions that (deep) parsers are supposed to obtain.",
        "Similar problems arise with other syntactically annotated corpora of German text and speech, such as the Negra Corpus (Skut et al., 1998; Brants et al., 1999), the Verbmobil Corpus (Wahlster, 2000) and the Tubingen Treebank of Written German (Telljohann et al., 2003),",
        "notation encoded in the TiGer Treebank and lower case labels for the dependencies encoded in the TiGer DB.",
        "since they all encode constituency and dependency information in one structure, the latter being biased by the former.",
        "Grammar developers, however, are interested in pure dependency representations, which allow for a much more meaningful evaluation than the bracketing of constituents, and are therefore clearly moving away from treebanks to dependency banks (Carroll et al., 1999; Carroll et al., 2003).",
        "In this paper we present the strategy that has been adopted in the TiGer project for semi-automatically obtaining a dependency bank that will be of use for a wide variety of applications, in particular parser evaluation for various formalisms.",
        "2 Constructing the TiGer DB In this section, the method for producing the TiGer DB is presented.",
        "It is a combination of automatic and manual techniques in order to achieve the most accurate and consistent results in a reasonable amount of time.",
        "The basic process is as follows:",
        "1.",
        "Convert the TiGer graph into an f-structure chart (packed representation of one or several f-structures) .",
        "2.",
        "Match the resulting f-structure chart against the output of a broad-coverage LFG for German and bank the compatible reading(s).",
        "3.",
        "For all sentences for which there are either several or no compatible readings, select the correct/best analysis manually.",
        "4.",
        "Fully automatically convert the selected f-structure into dependency triples.",
        "5.",
        "Manually check/correct each structure using the pretty-printing and validation tools that are distributed with the PARC 700 Dependency Bank.",
        "2.1 Automatic derivation of f-structure charts from the TiGer Treebank",
        "The conversion of TiGer graphs into f-structure charts is described in Forst (2003a) and Forst (2003b).",
        "It takes the TiGer graphs encoded in TiGer XML as input and produces f-structure charts, i.e. packed representations of one or several f-structures.",
        "The ambiguity in the mapping from TiGer graphs to f-structures is due to information lacking in the TiGer Treebank, such as information concerning the decomposition of compounds, the nature of phrases labeled as MOs (modifiers), the subjects of infinite verb forms etc.",
        "In the conversion process it can be dealt with by means of optional rules, but for its use as a gold standard the output of the conversion has to be disambiguated, of course.",
        "How this can be done is discussed in 2.2 and 2.3.",
        "Apart from changes due to the shift from one representation to another, we have decided to perform some changes to the analyses chosen by the TiGer Treebank annotators as well.",
        "They are motivated by the fact that the treatment given to these phenomena by all German parsers we are aware of differs from the analysis in the TiGer Treebank in a systematic way.",
        "One of these changes concerns PPs that are extracted from NPs, such as statt lessen in Statt lessen gestand ihnen die Regierung eine Entschddigung zu: (TiGer Corpus sentence #14839).",
        "In the TiGer Treebank, this PP is attached as an MNR (noun modifier) to the NP eine Entschddigung.",
        "Current German parsers, however, would attach this PP to the verb, since the attempt of attaching it to the NP would result in a massive increase of ambiguity.",
        "For a gold standard for German parsers, we consider it reasonable to encode the latter attachment rather than one that no parser would be able to achieve."

      "text": [
        "As a first step towards disambiguating the f-structure charts resulting from the fully automatic treebank conversion, these are matched against the output of a broad-coverage LFG for German (Dipper, 2003) and the compatible reading(s) are saved.",
        "This is done with the help of a Perl script that has been specifically developed for this purpose.",
        "Of course, this mapping can only be performed for sentences that are assigned a full parse by the broad-coverage LFG, and although the information both in the TiGer graphs and in the LFG parses is relatively detailed it can be impossible to fully disambiguate.",
        "Typical remaining ambiguities are due to the decomposition of compounds and to person and number ambiguities of possessive determiners and pronouns, these informations not being included in the TiGer Treebank.",
        "Moreover, it has to be kept in mind that the mapping against the LFG output does not always retain the correct analysis, although most ambiguities can be resolved correctly in this way.",
        "This is particularly true for the mo (modifier) vs. op (prepositional object) distinction; an incomplete lexicon entry in the LFG can lead to the selection of the mo reading, even if the op reading is more adequate.",
        "Nevertheless, the matching of the TiGer-derived f-structure charts is extremely useful.",
        "Not only does it help to disambiguate the ambiguous representations, but it also helps to increase consistency in the gold standard, since every time a match between the TiGer-derived structure and the grammar output is expected, but cannot be achieved, the human annotators can pay special attention to the phenomenon that caused the match to fail.",
        "2.3 Manual disambiguation of TiGer-derived f-structure charts All ambiguous TiGer-derived f-structure charts that cannot be fully disambiguated in the previous step have to be disambiguated manually.",
        "This is performed by visualizing the structures in the grammar development tool XLE (Maxwell III and Kaplan, 1993).",
        "It displays the packed representation of all f-structures encoded, the currently selected f-structure and an additional window, where the alternatives with the information differing among them are visualized.",
        "This allows human annotators to choose and save the correct reading in a relatively comfortable way.",
        "When none of the readings can be considered correct, the best analysis is selected and the annotator puts the sentence number on a list of structures to be reconsidered in the validation step.",
        "2.4 Conversion into dependency triples and validation The conversion from f-structures to dependency triples is fully automatic and unambiguous.",
        "It is carried out in basically the same way as it was done for the PARC 700 Dependency Bank (King et al., 2003).",
        "It mainly involves a certain amount of \"flattening\", i.e. articulate f-structures without a PRED have to be restructured, but this can be done without any loss of information.",
        "In addition to the flattening, a certain amount of renaming and reorganizing has to be carried out in order to make the structures meet the annotation principles outlined in Section 3.",
        "In a final (and very important) step, each TiGer DB structure is manually evaluated by two people.",
        "If the structure is not correct, changes are made in the text-based representation of the structure.",
