        "In this work, we introduce a model for sense assignment which relies on assigning senses to the contexts within which words appear, rather than to the words themselves.",
        "We argue that word senses as such are not directly encoded in the lexicon of the language.",
        "Rather, each word is associated with one or more stereotypical syntagmatic patterns, which we call selection contexts.",
        "Each selection context is associated with a meaning, which can be expressed in any of various formal or computational manifestations.",
        "We present a formalism for encoding contexts that help to determine the semantic contribution of a word in an utterance.",
        "Further, we develop a methodology through which such stereotypical contexts for words and phrases can be identified from very large corpora, and subsequently structured in a selection context dictionary, encoding both stereotypical syntactic and semantic information.",
        "We present some preliminary results."

        "Each pattern is specified in terms of lexical sets for each argument, shallow semantic typing of these sets, and other syntagmatically relevant criteria (e.g., adverbials of manner, phrasal particles, genitives, negatives).",
        "The procedure consists of three subtasks: (1) the manual discovery of selection context patterns for specific verbs; (2) the automatic recognition of instances of the identified patterns; and (3) automatic acquisition of patterns for unanalyzed cases.",
        "Initially, a number of patterns are manually formulated by a lexicographer through corpus pattern analysis of about 500 occurrences of each verb lemma.",
        "Next, for higher frequency verbs, the remaining corpus occurrences are scrutinized to see if any low-frequency patterns have been missed.",
