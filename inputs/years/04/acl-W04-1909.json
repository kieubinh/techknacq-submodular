        "Natural language texts can be viewed as resources containing uniform data in such a way that methods similar to those used in Data Base Knowledge Extraction can be applied to them.",
        "The adaptation of these methods to texts is known as Text Mining (Tan, 1999).",
        "Machine learning techniques are applied to document collections aiming at extracting patterns that may be useful to organize or recover information from the collections.",
        "Tasks related to this area are text categorization, clustering, summarization, and information extraction.",
        "One of the first steps in text mining tasks is the preprocessing of the documents, as they need to be represented in a more structured way.",
        "Our work proposes a new technique to the preprocessing phase of documents and we compare it with usual preprocessing methods.",
        "We focus on two text mining tasks, namely text categorization and clustering.",
        "In the categorization task we associate each document to a class from a predefined set, in the clustering task the challenge is to identify groups of similar documents without being aware of predefined classes.",
        "Usually, the preprocessing phase in these tasks are based on the approach called bag-of-words, in which just simple techniques are used to eliminate uninteresting words and to reduce various semantically related terms to the same root (stop-words and stemming, respectively).",
        "As an alternative, we propose the use of linguistic information in the preprocessing phase, by selecting words according to their category (nouns, adjectives, proper names, verbs) and using its canonical form.",
        "We ran a series of experiments to evaluate this proposal over Brazilian Portuguese texts.",

        "Text mining processes are usually divided in five major phases: A) Document collection: consists of the definition of the set of the documents from which knowledge must be extracted.",
        "B) Preprocessing: consists of a set of actions that transform the set of documents in natural language into a list of useful terms.",
        "C) Preparation and selection of the data: consists in the identification and selection of relevant terms form the preprocessed ones.",
        "D) Knowledge Extraction: consists of the application of machine learning techniques to identify patterns that can classify or cluster the documents in the collection.",
        "E) Evaluation and interpretation of the results: consists of the analysis of the results.",
        "The preprocessing phase in text mining is essential and usually very expensive and time consuming.",
        "As texts are originally non-structured a series of steps are required to represent them in a format compatible with knowledge extraction methods and tools.",
        "The usual techniques employed in phase B are the use of a list of stop-words, which are discarded from the original documents and the use of stemming which reduces the words to their root.",
        "Having the proper tools to process Portuguese texts, we investigate whether linguistic information can have an impact on the results of the whole process.",

        "The linguistic knowledge we use in the experiments is based on the syntactic analysis performed by the PALAVRAS parser (Bick, 2000).",

        "It has a comparatively low percentage of errors (less than 1% for word class and 3-4% for surface syntax) (Bick, 2003).",
        "We also used another tool that makes easier the extraction of features from the analyzed texts: the Palavras Xtractor (Gasperin et.",
        "al.",
        "2003).",
        "This tool converts the parser output into three XML files, containing: a) the list of all words from the text and their identifier; b) morpho-syntactic information for each word; c) the sentence´s syntactic structures.",

        "The resulting lists of terms according to each combination are then passed to phases C, D and E. The experiments are described in detail in the next section."

        "In general, the results show that the presence of nouns is crucial, the worst classification errors are based on groups that do not contain the category nouns, and here the confidence level for the differences reported reaches 95%.",
        "The groups containing nouns present results comparable to those found in the experiments based on usual methods of preprocessing.",
        "The use of verbs, either alone or with other grammatical groups is not an interesting option.",
        "It can be observed that usually the best results are obtained when the documents are represented by a larger number of terms (90, 120 and 150), for the group nouns, however, the best results were obtained for vectors containing just 60 terms.",
        "We looked at the terms resulting from different selection methods and categories to check the overlap among the groups.",
        "From PD1 to PD2 based on nouns and adjectives (the one with the best results) we could see that we had around 50% of different terms.",
        "That means that 50% of terms in PD1 are terms included in the categories nouns and adjectives and 50% of the terms selected on the basis of stop-words and stemming are from other grammatical categories.",

        "Similarly, (Aizawa, 2001) uses morphological analysis to aid the extraction of compound terms.",
        "Our approach differs from those since we propose single terms selection based on different part of speech information.",
        "The results show that a selection made solely on the basis of category information produces results at least as good as those produced by usual methods (when the selection considers nouns and adjectives or nouns and proper nouns) both in categorization and clustering tasks.",
        "In the categorization experiments we obtained the lowest error rate for PD2 when the preprocessing phase was based on the selection of nouns and adjectives, 18,01%.",
        "However, the second best score in the case of categorization was achieved by the traditional methods, 19,77%.",
        "Due to the small corpus, further experiments are needed to verify the statistical significance of the reported gains.",
        "The results of the clustering experiments show a difference in precision from 50,52% to 63,15%.",
        "As we are planning to test our techniques with a larger number of documents and consequently a larger number of terms, we are considering applying other machine-learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines that are robust enough to deal with a large number of terms.",
        "We are also planning to apply more sophisticated linguistic knowledge than just grammatical categories, as, for instance, the use of noun phrases for terms"
