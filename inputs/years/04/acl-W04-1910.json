        "Treebanks have become valuable resources in natural language processing (NLP) in recent years (Abeill¶e, 2003).",
        "A treebank is a collection of syntactically annotated sentences in which the annotation has been manually checked so that the treebank can serve as training corpus for natural language parsers, as repository for linguistic research, or as evaluation corpus for NLP systems.",
        "The current interest in treebanks is documented in international workshop series like “Linguistically Interpreted Corpora (LINC)” or “Treebanks and Linguistic Theories” (TLT).",
        "But also the recent international CL conferences have seen a wide variety of papers that involved treebanks.",
        "Treebanks have become a necessary resource for many research activities in NLP.",
        "On the other hand recent years have seen an increasing interest in parallel corpora (often called bitexts).",
        "See for example (Melamed, 2001) or (Borin, 2002) for a broad picture of this area.",
        "But surprisingly little work has been reported on combining these two areas: parallel treebanks.",
        "We define a parallel treebank as a bi-text where the sentences of each language are annotated with a syntactic tree, and the sentences are aligned below the clause level.",
        "This leaves room for various kinds of tree structure (e.g. dependency structure trees or constituent structure trees) and does not specify a precise requirement for tree alignments but rather for some sort of sub-clausal alignment (e.g. word alignment or phrase alignment).",
        "But why has there been so little work done on parallel treebanks?",
        "The benefits of having such a treebank for training statistical machine translation systems, experimenting with example-based translation systems, or evaluating word alignment programs seem so overwhelming.",
        "We speculate that this scarcity is mainly due to the expenses necessary for building a parallel treebank (in terms of time and human resources).",
        "It is well known that the manual labor involved in building a monolingual treebank is high (For the Penn Treebank (Taylor et al., 2003) report on 750 - 1000 words per hour for an experienced annotator, which translates to 35 - 50 sentences per hour).",
        "And the cross-language alignment requires additional work.",
        "Therefore every approach to facilitate and speed up this process will be highly welcome.",
        "The goal of this paper is to summarize the (little) work that has been done on parallel treebanks and related areas such as annotation projection.",
        "In particular we will report on our experiments for building a Swedish-German parallel treebank.",
        "As a side issue we investigated whether the German treebank annotation guidelines (from the NEGRA / TIGER projects) can be applied to Swedish.",
        "We have chosen Swedish and German because they are our mother tongues, but also because they are similar and still interestingly different."

        "The field of parallel treebanks is only now evolving into a research field.",
        "(Cmejrek et al., 2003) at the Charles University in Prague have built a treebank for the specific purpose of machine translation, the Czech-English Penn Treebank with tectogrammatical dependency trees.",
        "They have asked translators to translate part of the Penn Treebank into Czech with the clear directive to translate every English sentence with one in Czech and to stay as close as possible to the original.",
        "This directive seems strange at first sight but it makes sense with regard to their objective.",
        "Since they specifically construct the treebank for training and evaluating machine translation systems, a close human translation is a valid starting point to get good automatic translations.",
        "At the University of MÄunster (Germany) (Cyrus et al., 2003) have started working on FuSe, a syntactically analyzed parallel corpus.",
        "The goal is a treebank with English and German texts (currently with examples from the Eu-roparl corpus).",
        "The annotation is multi-layered in that they use PoS-tags, constituent structure, functional relations, predicate-argument structure and alignment information.",
        "However their focus is on the predicate-argument structure.",
        "The Nordic Treebank Network1 has started an initiative to syntactically annotate the first chapter of “Sophie´s Worlds2 in the nordic languages.",
        "This text was chosen since it has been translated into a vast number of languages and since it includes interesting linguistic properties such as direct speech.",
        "Currently a prototype of this parallel treebank with the first 50 sentences in Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Estonian and German has been finished.",
        "The challenge in this project is that all involved researchers annotate the Sophie sentences of their language in their format of choice (ranging from dependency structures for Danish and Swedish to constituency structures for Estonian and German).",
        "In order to make the results exchangeable and comparable all results have been converted into TIGER-XML so that TIGERSearch3 can be used to display and search the annotated sentences monolingually.",
        "The alignment across languages is still open."

      "text": [
        "We have built a small German-Swedish parallel treebank with 25 sentence pairs taken from the Europarl corpus.",
        "First, the German sentences",
        "were tokenized and loaded into the Annotate treebank editor4.",
        "Annotate includes Thorsten Brants’ Part-of-Speech Tagger and Chunker for German.",
        "The PoS tagger employs the STTS, a set of around 50 PoS-tags for German.",
        "The set is so large because it incorporates some morpho-syntactic features (e.g. it distinguishes between finite and non-finite verb forms).",
        "The chun-ker assigns a flat constituent structure with the usual node labels (e.g. AP, NP, PP, S, VP), but also special labels for coordinated phrases (e.g. CAP, CNP, CPP, CS, CVP).",
        "In addition the chunker suggests syntactic functions (like subject, object, head or modifier) as edge labels.",
        "The human treebank annotator controls the suggestions made by the tagger and the chunker and modifies them where necessary.",
        "Tagger and chunker help to speed up the annotation process for German sentences enormously.",
        "The upper tree in figure 1 shows the structure for the following sentence (taken from Europarl):",
        "(EN: But citizens of some of our member states have become victims of terrible natural disasters.)",
        "Now let us look at the resources available for Swedish.",
        "First there is SUC (the Stockholm-Umeºa-Corpus), a 1 million word corpus of written Swedish designed as a representative corpus along the lines of the Brown corpus.",
        "SUC contains PoS-tags, morphological tags and lemmas for all tokens as well as proper name classes.",
        "All the information is hand-checked.",
        "So this is proper training material for a PoS tagger.",
        "Compared to the 50 tags of the STTS, the 22 SUC PoS-tags (e.g. only one verb tag) are rather coarse-grained, but of course we can use the combination of PoS-tags and morphological information to automatically derive a richer tag set.",
        "Training material for a Swedish chunker is harder to come by.",
        "There are two early Swedish treebanks, Mamba and SynTag (dating back to the 1970s (!)",
        "and 1980s respectively), but they are rather small (about 5000 sentences each), very heterogeneously annotated and somewhat faulty (cf. (Nivre, 2002)).",
        "Therefore, the most serious attempt at training a",
        "chunker for Swedish was based on an automatically created “treebank” which of course contained a certain error rate (Megyesi, 2002).",
        "Essentially there exists no constituent structure treebank for Swedish that could be used for training a chunker with resulting structures corresponding to the German sentences.",
        "Therefore we have worked with a different approach (described in detail in (Samuelsson, 2004)).",
        "We first trained a PoS tagger on SUC and used it to assign PoS-tags to our Swedish sentences.",
        "We then converted the Swedish PoS-tags in these sentences into the corresponding German STTS tags.5 We loaded the Swedish sentences into Annotate (now with STTS tags), and we were then able to reuse the German chunker to make structural decisions over the Swedish sentences.",
        "This worked surprisingly 5 An alternative approach could have been to map all tags in the SUC to STTS and then train a Swedish tagger on this converted material.",
        "well due to the structural similarities of Swedish and German.",
        "After the semi-automatic annotation of the syntactic structure, the PoS-tags were converted back to the usual Swedish tag set.",
        "This is a straightforward example of how resources for one language (in this case German) can be reused to bootstrap linguistic structure in another albeit related language (here Swedish).",
        "The lower tree in figure 1 shows the structure for the Swedish sentence which corresponds to the German sentence in example 1.",
        "(2) D¨aremot har inv˚anarna i ett antal av",
        "Since the German STTS is more fine-grained than the SUC tag set, the mapping from the SUC tag set to STTS does not entail loosing any information.",
        "When converting in this direction the problem is rather which option to choose.",
        "For example, the SUC tag set has one tag for adjectives, but the STTS distinguishes between attributive adjectives (ADJA) and adverbial or predicative adjectives (ADJD).",
        "We decided to map all Swedish adjectives to ADJA since the information in SUC does not give us any clue about the usage difference.",
        "The human annotator then needs to correct the ADJA tag to ADJD if appropriate, in order to enable the chunker to work as intended.",
        "Other tag mapping problems come with the SUC tags for adverb, determiner, pronoun and possessive all of which are marked as “interrogative or relative” in the guidelines.",
        "There is no clear mapping of these tags to STTS.",
        "We decided to use the mapping in table 1.",
        "The benefit of using the German chunker for annotating the Swedish sentences is hard to quantify.",
        "A precise experiment would require one group of annotators to work with this chunker and another to work without it on the same sentences for a comparison of the time needed.",
        "We performed a small experiment to see how often the German chunker suggests the correct node labels and edge labels for the Swedish sentences (when the children tags/nodes were manually selected).",
        "In 100 trials we observed 89 correct node labels and 93% correct edge labels (for 305 edges).",
        "If we assume that manual inspection of correct suggestions takes about a third of the time of manual annotation, and if we also assume that the correction of erroneous suggestions takes the same amount of time as manual annotation, then the employment of the German chunker for Swedish saves about 60% of the annotation time.",
        "Reusing a chunker for bootstrapping a parallel treebank between closely related languages like German and Swedish is only a first step towards reusing annotation (be it automatic or manual) in one language for another language.",
        "But it points to a promising research direction.",
        "(Yarowsky et al., 2001) have reported interesting results of an annotation-projection technique for PoS tagging, named entities and morphology.",
        "And (Cabezas et al., 2001) have explored projecting syntactic dependency relations from English to Basque.",
        "This idea was followed by (Hwa et al., 2002) who investigated English to Chinese projections based on the direct correspondence assumption.",
        "They conclude that annotation projections are nearly 70% accurate (in terms of unlabelled dependencies) when some linguistic knowledge is used.",
        "We believe that annotation projection is a difficult field but even if we only succeed in a limited number of cases, it will be valuable for increased speed in the development of parallel treebanks."
