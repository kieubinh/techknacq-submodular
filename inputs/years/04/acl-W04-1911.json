        "Word order variation has been described in great detail by theoretical linguists.",
        "There is, however, also an increasing interest in the topic from both computational linguists and psycholinguists (e.g. Kaiser and Trueswell (submitted); Keller (2000); Kruiff and Duchier (2003); Pechmann et al.",
        "(1996); Roder et al.",
        "(2000)).",
        "Nevertheless, the empirical resources that researchers can draw from for their studies are still very limited, since only a few studies report on the actual amount of word order variation (see Kempen and Harbusch (2004); Kurz (2000)).",
        "This paper therefore presents a corpus study on the linear order of subjects and objects in German, and factors related to the positioning of complements before or after the verb.",
        "Our study is also new in that it looks at main clauses rather than the Mittelfeld, for which most ordering principles were originally intended.",
        "German is a language with a relatively free word order in which the subject usually precedes the object, but can also follow it: In (1), the subject “Turnverein Neuronnebeck” precedes the object “Fairne pokal”; in (2) the same object precedes the subject, without changing the original meaning of the sentence.",
        "For a German newspaper corpus, we investigate subject-verb-object (SVO) and object-verb-subject (OVS) sequences, and examine the extent to which certain ordering constraints influence the positioning of verb complements.",
        "In particular, we investigate the validity of the well-known constraints to place given before new, definite before indefinite, and pronoun before full noun phrase (NP) complements (cf. Muller (1999); Uszkoreit (1987)) using the Ne-gra corpus (Brants et al., 1999)."

        "In this section, we describe the three ordering principles tested in this study.",
        "Whereas the first principle attends to the contextual dependencies of a sentence, the scope of the second and the third principle is a sentence.",
        "In scrambling languages, the position of verb complements can reflect their connection to the preceding context.",
        "In these languages, discourse new information tends to occur towards the end of a sentence, whereas discourse old information is more likely to occur at the beginning (cf. Birner and Ward (1998)).",
        "Thus, the information structure of a sentence in a scrambling language such as German, can reflect its fit within a given discourse (Selkirk (1984); Steed-man (1991))1: When an object precedes a subject, the object is likely to be given and the 'Different terms and concepts such as theme/rheme, background/focus and given/new are used in the lit-subject new; when a subject precedes an object, the subject is likely to be given and the object new, although the canonical subject-first order is also expected when both complements are either new or given.",
        "We establish for Ne-gra how often both SVO and OVS main clauses adhere to this basic order pattern.",
        "German is also a language with definite and indefinite articles.",
        "According to a second linear ordering principle, definite NPs should tend to precede indefinite NPs.",
        "We also presume, that definiteness is correlated to the information status of complements.",
        "As already Chafe (1976) pointed out, indefiniteness often goes together with newness, and definiteness with givenness or newness.",
        "Thus, on the NP itself information status can be partially encoded by the choice of article.",
        "If the correlation with givenness drives the positioning of definite and indefinite complements, we should find for both SVO and OVS sentences that definite complements tend to precede indefinite ones.",
        "Another possibility is, however, that definiteness is bound to grammatical functions (i.e. subjects are usually definite).",
        "In that case, we would expect to find a reversal of the ordering principle for definiteness in OVS sentences.",
        "A third common linear ordering principle states that pronouns tend to precede full NPs.",
        "Similarly to definiteness, the use of pronouns can potentially encode information structure.",
        "Almost by definition, pronouns refer to an antecedent in the discourse and represent therefore given information (with the possible exception of indefinite pronouns).",
        "Whereas pronoun complements usually represent given information, full NP complements are not necessarily new.",
        "Again, if the correlation with givenness drives the positioning of pronominalized complements, we should find that pronouns tend to precede full NPs in both SVO and OVS sentences.",
        "If, however, for example grammatical functions determine which complements are pronominalized, we might not find this tendency."
