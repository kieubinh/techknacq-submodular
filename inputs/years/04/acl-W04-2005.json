        "GREVAL, the test suite of 500 English sentences taken from SUSANNE Corpus and made available by John Carroll and Ted Briscoe at their website, has been used to test the performance of a symbolic linguistically-based parser called GETARUNS presented in (Delmonte, 2002).",
        "GETARUNS is a symbolic linguistically-based parser written in Prolog Horn clauses which uses a strong deterministic policy by means of a lookahead mechanism and a WFST.",
        "The grammar allows the specification of linguistic rules in a highly declarative mode: it works topdown and by making a heavy use of linguistic knowledge may achieve an almost complete deterministic policy: in this sense it is equivalent to an LR parser.",
        "The results obtained fare higher that the ones reported in (Preis, 2003) and this we argue is due basically to the symbolic rule-based approach: we reach 96% precision (coverage) and 84% recall (accuracy).",
        "We assume that from a psycholinguistic point of view, parsing requires setting up a number of disambiguating strategies, to tell arguments apart from adjuncts and reduce the effects of backtracking.",
        "To do that the system is based on LFG theoretical framework and uses Grammatical Functions information to help the parser cope with syntactic ambiguity.",
        "In the paper we shall comment on some shortcomings of the Greval corpus annotation and more in general we shall criticize some aspects of the Dependency Structure representation."

        "In this paper we will present the parser used by the system GETARUN and discuss its performance with the test suite called GREVAL set up by Carroll & Briscoe.",
        "We will also discuss the mapping algorithm from LFG to Dependency Grammatical Relations (DGRs), which we have been obliged to develop in order to be able to evaluate our parser.",
        "Greval is a benchmark for parser evaluation based on Grammatical Relations in a Head Dependency Structure style output, i.e. a word based Head-Dependent flat representation enriched with Grammatical Relation information, where each relation is represented as follows,",
        "where a deep relation is introduced basically for passive constructions, dative shift, and potentially other structures, according to the “Movement” approach invoked by chomskians.",
        "The annotation adopted by the authors is a surface level GRs approach where for instance, in cases of Locative Inversion as in sentence 284,",
        "(1) Here, in the old days - when they had come to see the moon or displays of fireworks - sat the king and his court while priests, soldiers, and other members of the party lounged in the smaller alcoves between.",
        "the SUBJect NP ‘the king and his court” is assigned to DOBJ and then receives an additional deep-relation label as NCSUBJ to indicate its original deep structure position.",
        "However the same relation is “wrongly” marked as NCSUBJ in a subsequent case of Locative Inversion (the only other one, sentence 445), which we report below,",
        "(2) In his stead is a milquetoast version known as the corporation.",
        "where the inverted subject NP “a milquetoast version” is annotated straightforwardly as NCSUBJ.",
        "The inconsistency denounced by this case of double annotation lingers on other types of ambiguous GRs that we will comment below.",
        "In our experiment, for reasons already explained in (Crouch et al., 2002) and further commented below, we restricted our mapping algorithm to all “pred-only” f-structures, i.e. only to semantic heads with primary GRs.",
        "This is because we assume that the most difficult task a parser is faced with when parsing a sentence is to operate the argument-adjunct distinction: thus the subset of GRs we will take into account is the following: NCSUBJ, DOBJ, IOBJ, ARG_MOD, XCOMP, CCOMP Difficulties in building up a comparable version of our output, include the inconsistencies present in the non typographical text distributed for the test.",
        "We also had to give up using the internally provided tool for evaluation because our system builds multiword expressions which are almost totally absent in the annotated Gold version.",
        "So even though the authors admit to the need of improving this aspect, its lack makes it impossible for real systems to use automatic evaluation tools."

      "text": [
        "However the most difficult part of the work was the mapping itself.",
        "The mapping from LFG to DGRs requires the setting up of a principled distinction between GRs.",
        "The main difficulties were due to the treatment of OBLiques vs. PP adjuncts: LFG erases the preposition of oblique arguments which is no longer available for comparison, on the contrary, the preposition is preserved in case it is semantically needed to identify the semantic role associated to PP adjuncts.",
        "In DGRs instead we have two options reported below and taken from the online Readme document, ncmod(type, head, dependent) is the most common relation type and is used to encode PP, adjectival/adverbial modification, nominal modifiers, and so on.",
        "ncmod is also used to indicate a particle `modifier' in a verb particle combination, e.g. Bill looked the word up is encoded as ncmod(prt, look, up); of in consist of is treated as a particle.",
        "iobj(type, head, dependent) is the relation between a predicate and a non-clausal complement introduced by a preposition; iobj(in, arrive, Spain) arrive in Spain iobj(into, put, box) put the tools into the box iobj(to, give, poor) give to the poor The definitions do not respect the actual decisions taken in the annotation process because only adjective and verb predicates are assigned complement labels like nsubj, dobj and iobj.",
        "Nouns are only assigned generic modifiers, apart from 9 cases of “wrongly” labeled IOBJ complements which we comment in more detail below.",
        "On the contrary, in our representation, possessor relations and other agent-like relations in noun modification are computed as SUBJ.",
        "The remaining “of” headed PPs are all computed as OBJ in case the noun is a deverbal predicate and is transitive; other prepositions introduce OBLiques and ADJuncts again according to the governing noun.",
        "As to verb and adjective predicates, in order to be able to sort out NCMODs from IOBJs, all subcategorization relations must be suitably encoded, be it obligatory or optional ones, as can be understood from the examples of IOBJs listed above and taken from the online accompanying document.",
        "In particular, ARRIVE would be computed as taking a Locative PP complement at the same level of PUT, whereas only the latter requires the complement obligatorily.",
        "As to the third example, GIVE, a ditransitive verb allowing Dative Shift, its indirect object would be computed as a case of IOBJ thus collapsing an important linguistic distinction existing between OBLiques and Indirect Objects.",
        "However, given the generic criteria followed by the annotators, we still wanted to verify the consistency of annotation of IOBJs, so we checked with COMLEX subcategorization frames whether the relation would be predicted or not.",
        "When collecting the IOBJs of the corpus we soon discovered that 9 IOBJS constitute cases of non verbal complementation which we report below, (iobj to akin future) ;;; non-verbal complementation (iobj to adherence principle)",
        "then, there is one dubious case of IOBJ: in sentence 316 the ellipsed governing adjective predicate “atune” is done away with and the IOBJ relation is assigned to the verb BE,",
        "(3) Indeed, the old Jeffersonians were far more atune to the Hamilton oriented Whigs than they were to the Jacksonian Democrats.",
        "From the search in COMLEX of the remaining 127 predicates governing IOBJ relations, we derived 20 predicates missing the preposition required for the complement discriminative choice.",
        "In more than one case the choice of complement (iobj) vs. adjunct (ncmod) is highly disputable.",
        "This situation makes the comparison and evaluation of IOBJs very uncertain and bound to low scoring as happened with the parsers included in the test reported under (Preis, 2003).",
        "As an additional remark, from the definition it would appear that OBLiques are treated as DOBJ of a preposition particle which is in turn treated itself as ncmod.",
        "To better clarify the issue we partially report the annotation of example 244 from the corpus, where we italicize the relevant relations,",
        "(4) Meanwhile, the experts speak of wars triggered by false pre-emption, escalation, unauthorized behavior and other terms that will be discussed in this report.",
        "ncsubj(trigger, war, obj) arg_mod(by, trigger, pre-emption, subj) arg_mod(by, trigger, escalation, subj) arg_mod(by, trigger, behaviour, subj) arg_mod(by, trigger, term, subj) ncsubj(discuss, term, obj) ncmod(prt, speak, of) So we decided that in our evaluation we treat as IOBJs both those actually produced by our parser and matched directly with the Gold corpus, as well as those which appear in the Gold corpus as DOBJ governed by a preposition NCMOD and also those that have been computed as NCMODs directly, as long as the head and the dependent are identical.",
        "We then individuated a number of mismatches in the Gold annotation which would not receive a suitable mapping in our output, which were then interpreted as mistakes by Ted Briscoe (p.c.)",
        "in particular cases of secondary predication for the class of ECM verbs (consider, believe, term, etc) which were treated as OBJ2, as well as the relation of DOBJ associated to complements of verb HAVE, which we compute as copulative verb.",
        "(5) Sunday he had added, We can love Eisenhower the man, even if we considered him a mediocre president... but there is nothing left of the Republican Party without his leadership.",
        "For this reason we didn’t include data for OBJ2 in our comparison which required too many changes in our parser architecture in order to have the appropriate mapping.",
        "As to clause level GRs, we computed both open and closed sentential (CCOMP) and small clause (XCOMP) complements, but we did not compute open adjuncts – XMODS – which again did not seem to be easily comparable in our mapping.",
        "As a matter of fact, these clausal complements have not been separated in the published test and only figure as CLAUSAL.",
        "For comparison reasons we had to erase all subject relations made available by our LFG-based representation for all open predicative complements which were however not represented in the Gold manually annotated GREVAL corpus."

        "The reason for this being that we need to prevent as much as possible failures at the I_bar level.",

        "The parser parses 89% of all text top down: then it parses 9.3% of the remaining linguistic material bottom up and adds it up to the parsed portion of the current sentence.",
        "That may produce wrong results in case a list has been partially parsed by the top down parser.",
        "But it produces right results whenever any additional complete subordinate or coordinate sentence structure has been left over – which constitutes the majority of cases.",
        "Overall almost the whole text – 98.3% - is turned into semantically consistent structures which have already undergone Pronominal Binding at sentence level in their DAG structural representation.",
        "We find it very important to remark the fact that the performance of our parser is mainly to be appreciate for the high coverage.",
        "None of the statistically and stochastically based parser reported under (Preis, 2003) reached such a high score.",
        "For the sake of comparison we also report the main data taken from the table presented under (Preis, 2003) to allow the reader to appreciate the results of our parser.",
        "In particular, the number of main Grammatical Relations treated in the previous test is half the number in comparison with ours.",
        "If we look at the easiest GR to parse, i.e. the NCSUBJ GR, we see that the number of cases found by the best parser in the previous test is by far lower that our result.",
        "The highest case of precision is for DOBJ in the BU parser which reaches 88.42% which is 8 points lower that our result.",
        "In absolute terms, limiting the comparison to the two most frequent GRs, the best parser – BU - has found 361 DOBJs against our 394; 891 NCSUBJs against our 1038.",
        "The recall is also accordingly lower in absolute terms: there are 277 cases of correct DOBJs in BU against our 331, and 702 cases of correct NCSUBJs – in this case it is the BC parser that gets best recall – against our 883.",
        "And 277 and 702 are slightly better than chance - 67.72 and 67.63 respectively.",
        "The impression one gets from the performance of statistically and stochastically based parsers is that they are inherently unable to cope with deep linguistic information.",
        "They are certainly impossible to undergo substantial improvements.",
        "On the contrary, rule based parsers would benefit from additional subcategorization frames as in our case: and for all those constructions which require setting up of new additional peripheral rules in the grammar, they would typically increase their coverage, as did our parser.",
        "As a last comment, we started evaluating subsets of GREVAL corpus with the online version of “Connexor” dependency parser, on the assumption that that version would be identical or even better than the one commercially available.",
        "We did that because this parser is regarded the best dependency parser on the market.",
        "We tried out a subset of 50 sentences, and on a first perusal of the output we discovered that only 40 sentences contained correct, and fully connected representations.",
        "The remaining 10 sentences either presented unconnected heads, or misconnected ones due to wrong attachments.",
        "Some remarks on the possible reasons for that:",
        "• bottom up local parsing techniques are good at coping with typically hard to parse structures for a top down parser like coordinate structures but they are bad at computing long distance dependencies; • they are good at computing attachment whenever it is local, but they make mistakes when there are extraposed elements; • dependency parsing does not seem to obey",
        "to generally accepted grammaticality principles like the obligatoriness of SUBJect constituents, nor the need to provide some landing site for extracted wh- elements in relative and interrogative clauses; ❑ control structures like small clauses for predicative complements and adjuncts are all attached locally, which is not always the case.",
        "So, even though word-level parsing may be more effective as to the number of connections (constituents) safely produced, without leaving off any fragment or skimmed fragment, it is nonetheless faced with the hard task of recomposing clause level control mechanisms which in a top down constituency-based parser are given for granted.",
        "The F-measure derived from our P and R according to the usual formula: 2rp",
        "r+p is 89.38%, which is by far higher than the 75% reported in (Crouch et al., 2002) as being the best result obtained by linguistic parsers today.",
        "We are currently experimenting with a “mildly” topdown/bottomup version of the parser in which rather than starting from Clause level we search recursively for Arguments and Adjuncts.",
        "In other words, we look for fully semantically interpreted constituents in which choice for argumenthood has already been partially performed.",
        "In addition to collecting Arguments/Adjuncts, the new parser scatters in the output list punctuation marks and coordinate/subordinate words which are deemed responsible to determine clause boundaries.",
        "To that aim, we devised a procedure for clause creation under the restriction that a main tensed Verb constituent complex has been found.",
        "This can be iterated on the input list and the procedure may decide to fuse portion of the output list which have been left stranded without independent clause status, and append it to the preceding prospective clause.",
        "Interpretation procedures follows by recovering subcategorization frames for the main tensed verb and assignment of grammatical function and semantic roles takes place.",
        "The Clause level procedure is then followed by an Utterance level procedure that produces simple utterance or complex ones – coordinated or subordinated – according to the Clause input list.",
        "We experimented the new version of the parser with the Greval Corpus and discovered that in some cases it was much slower than the fully topdown version.",
        "However, we also recovered parsing time in highly ambiguous and complex sentences, where the “mildly” bottomup parser actually followed a totally linear behaviour: no increase in computation time resulted and the performance is only conditioned by the number of words/number of arguments-adjuncts/number of clauses to build.",
        "We haven’t been able to compute this proportion systematically but will do so in the future."
