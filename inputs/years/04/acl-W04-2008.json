        "The goal of the semantic parser is to analyze the semantic structure of a natural language sentence.",
        "Similar in spirit with the syntactic parser – whose goal is to parse a valid natural language sentence into a parse tree indicating how the sentence can be syntactically decomposed into smaller syntactic constituents – the purpose of the semantic parser is to analyze the structure of sentence meaning.",
        "Sentence meaning is composed by entities and interactions between entities, where entities are assigned semantic roles, and can be further modified by other modiÞers.",
        "The meaning of a sentence is decomposed into smaller semantic units connected by various semantic relations by the principle of compositionality, and the parser represents the semantic structure – including semantic units as well as semantic relations, connecting them into a formal format.",
        "In this paper, we describe the main components of the semantic parser, and illustrate the basic procedures involved in parsing semantically open text.",
        "We believe that such structures, reflecting various levels of semantic interpretation of the text, can be used to improve the quality of text processing applications, by taking into account the meaning of text.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "We first describe the semantic structure of English sentences, as the basis for semantic parsing.",
        "We then introduce the knowledge bases utilized by the parser, and show how we use this knowledge in the process of semantic parsing.",
        "Next, we describe the parsing algorithm and elaborate on each of the three main steps involved in the process of semantic parsing: (1) syntactic and shallow semantic analysis, (2) semantic role assignment, and (3) application of default rules.",
        "Finally, we illustrate the parsing process with several examples, and show how the semantic parsing algorithm can be integrated into other language processing systems."

        "Semantics is the denotation of a string of symbols, either a sentence or a word.",
        "Similar to a syntactic parser, which shows how a larger string is formed by smaller strings from a formal point of view, the semantic parser shows how the denotation of a larger string – sentence, is formed by denotations of smaller strings – words.",
        "Syntactic relations can be described using a set of rules about how a sentence string is formally generated using word strings.",
        "Instead, semantic relations between semantic constituents depend on our understanding of the world, which is across languages and syntax.",
        "We can model the sentence semantics as describing entities and interactions between entities.",
        "Entities can represent physical objects, as well as time, places, or ideas, and are usually formally realized as nouns or noun phrases.",
        "Interactions, usually realized as verbs, describe relationships or interactions between participating entities.",
        "Note that a participant can also be an interaction, which can be regarded as an entity nominalized from an interaction.",
        "We assign semantic roles to participants, and their semantic relations are identified by the case frame introduced by their interaction.",
        "In a sentence, participants and interactions can be further modified by various modifiers, including descriptive modifiers that describe attributes such as drive slowly, restrictive modifiers that enforce a general denotation to become more specific such as musical instrument, referential modifiers that indicate particular instances such as the pizza I ordered.",
        "Other semantic relations can also be identified, such as coreference, complement, and others.",
        "Based on the principle of compositionality, the sentence semantic structure is recursive, similar to a tree.",

        "The semantic parser attempts to solve this problem, and produces a syntax-independent representation of sentence meaning, so that semantic constituents can be accessed and processed in a more meaningful and flexible way, avoiding the sometimes rigid interpretations produced by a syntactic analyzer.",

        "To deal with the large number of cases where the same syntactic relation introduces different semantic relations, we need knowledge about how to map syntax to semantics.",
