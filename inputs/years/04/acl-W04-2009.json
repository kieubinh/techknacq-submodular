        "The model goes utterance by utterance through a semantically labeled corpus, and whenever the semantic analysis of an utterance does not supply the salient relations in the context associated with the utterance, the model hypothesizes new grammatical mappings to account for the mismatch between the utterance’s analyzed meaning and its associated context.",
        "The language analysis that the learning framework relies on exhibits many of the standard issues motivating robust methods.",
        "Because the grammar is changing with every utterance, extragrammaticality and ungrammaticality (with respect to the current grammar) are the norm rather than the exception.",
        "In addition, the child language data functioning as a training corpus is transcribed from spoken language.",
        "As such, the utterances exhibit the usual difficulties associated with real language such as agreement errors, false starts, fragments, and constituent dislocations.",
        "A task of this nature cannot be handled by traditional methods of language analysis because they are too brittle.",
        "Robust approaches are much more appropriate.",
        "This paper describes a system implementing such a robust approach.",
        "It combines chunk-based semantic analysis with an abductive method for recovering coherent interpretations from incomplete analyses.",
        "Upon encountering an utterance, the system attempts syntactic/semantic analysis using a semantic chunker.",
        "If a complete analysis cannot be found, the system tries to integrate the remaining semantic chunks by merging common semantic structures.",
        "In other words, the system leverages the semantics to robustly combine and interpret recognized, but unbound semantic chunks.",
        "Different sets of chunks can be integrated in different ways.",
        "To compare how good each possible integration is, the system uses a heuristic called semantic density.",
        "Integrations that are more dense are preferred since that suggests high semantic compatibility between the recognized chunks.",
        "The semantic density metric is related to the coherence/completeness principles used in LFG (Dalyrimple, 2001), but in addition, suggests a graded notion of semantic compatibility more akin to a notion of gradient grammaticality (Sorace and Keller, to appear).",

        "A construction is a form-meaning pair.",
        "Each pair is a structured mapping from a lexical/syntactic pattern to its corresponding semantic and pragmatic properties.",
        "Construction grammar rejects the assumption that syntax and semantic are separate processing mod-ules(Fillmore et al., 1988).",
        "Morphemes, idioms and standard syntactic constructions like subject-auxiliary-inversion are all represented by the same kind of object – the construction.",
        "Construction Grammar defines grammaticality as a combination of syntactic and semantic well-formedness.",
        "Using Embodied Construction Grammar as the linguistic substrate therefore requires that syntactic and semantic analysis happen simultaneously.",
        "To describe constructions precisely, Embodied Construction Grammar (ECG) combines a grammar formalism and knowledge representation language within a unification-based framework.",
        "This makes it possible for both constructions and frame-based, schematic knowledge (Fillmore, 1982) to be expressed succinctly in the same formalism.",
        "Linking the grammar into frame-based meaning is what makes semantic integration possible (see section 5).",
        "ECG has two basic units: the schema and the construction.",
        "• Constructions, as discussed, are form-meaning pairs, while schemas are used to represent meaning( like frames or image schemas1).",
        "• Schemas and constructions have roles which can be assigned an atomic value (with �--) or coindexed (with , )).",
        "• Schemas and constructions are arranged into inheritance hierarchies with the subcase of keyword.",

        "Because Throw is a lexical unit associated with this frame, the corresponding Throw-Action schema evokes the Cause-Motion-Frame schema so that their roles can be coindexed.",
