        "The grammatical system of the Slavonic languages and their descriptions differentiate these two mechanisms as word formation and word derivation.",

        "Generally speaking, each rule operates either on the beginning or the ending of the target wordform.",
        "For example, the following rule says that if an unknown word ends on ied, this ending should b be stripped, yshould be appended, a check should be performed of whether the newly created word is in the dictionary and annotated as (VB VBP) there, and if so, (JJ VBD VBN) for the original word should be predicted: e[ied +y?",
        "(VP VBP) --).",
        "(JJ VBD VBN)] All rule elements are optional, except for the POS assignment.",
        "This means that a rule can just add and/or remove letters, without looking in the dictionary (although it could potentially benefit from doing so).",
        "When both removal and addition are used, one can account for mutations in the word stem.",
        "In fact, Mikheev uses the following restricted types of rules: Prefix (prefix deletion and dictionary lookup), Suffix0 (suffix deletion and dictionary lookup), Suffix1 (suffix deletion with mutation in the last letter and dictionary lookup), Ending (suffix deletion).",
        "There are separate ending guessing rules for hyphenated, capitalised and all other words.",
        "Given a dictionary, a scan through the wordforms is performed, during which all possible rules are collected and scored, and those above some threshold are selected.",
        "Finally, rule merging is applied to rules with identical preconditions but different predictions: the new rule predicts the union of the predictions of the original rules, which results in higher ambiguity but possibly allows the new rule to pass above the threshold after being rescored.",
        "We do not use the full power of the Mikheev-like rules and we limit ourselves to ending rules without dictionary lookup and single class predictions.",
        "Further, at present we do not treat the hyphenated or capitalised wordforms in any special way.",
        "The intuition behind the Mikheevs ule core s that a good guessing rule should be unambiguous (predicts a particular class without or with only very few exceptions), frequent (must be based on a large number of occurrences) and long (the longer the rule the lower the probability that it will happen by chance and thus the better its prediction).",
        "These criteria are combined in the following formula: ) score where: - l is the rule length; - x is the number of successful rule guesses; - n is the total number of training instances compatible with the rule; - p is a smoothed version of the maximum likelihood estimation p , which ensures that neither p nor (1p) could be zero: p = (x+0.5)/(n+1);",
        "- tai-a)/2 is a coefficient of the t-distribution with n 1 degrees of freedom and confidence level a.",
        "It is important to note that Mikheev weights the rule frequencies with the frequencies of the wordforms they match as estimated from raw text.",
        "We performed experiments both with and without such weighting.",
        "Column 2 of Table 2 gives an idea about the number of selected ending guessing rules for POS prediction when different thresholds are used (and when the training was performed on a subset of the dictionary, containing 894,915 wordforms, as described below).",
        "We were unhappy with such a large number of rules, especially after we observed that they were highly redundant.",
        "For example, if the threshold is set to 0.95, all the rules listed in Table 3 (and many more) are selected.",
        "In fact, all these are covered by the ending xTewhich is 00% correct, and they all predict that the POS should be verb.",
        "So, all we need is to keep xTewhile dropping all other longer endings that have additional starting letters4.",
        "This reduces the number of rules by a factor of 3 to 7 (see column 3 of Table 2).",
        "Thinking again, we can see that we can reduce the number of rules even further.",

        "As a result, the F-measure is consistently lower for the exact algorithm as compared to the approximate one with a threshold of 0.50.",
        "Figures 1-8 show this is not the case for higher thresholds (especially 0.95) when the coverage becomes lower and the F-measure gets worse as compared to that of the exact method.",
        "Comparing article, gender and number to arti-cle+POS, gender+POS and number+POS, accordingly, where the number of classes is increased by a factor of 3, we can see that the exact algorithm remains robust with respect to precision: there is a decrease of about 1-1.5% only.",
        "The precision of the approximate rules is decreased by 3-4%.",
        "On the other hand, the coverage of the approximate rules is virtually unaffected and stays very close to 100% (decreased by less than 0.2%), while for the exact rules it drops significantly: by 6-9%.",
        "As a result, the approximate algorithm has a more robust F-measure, which drops by 1-2.5% only, while for the exact algorithm this is 4-7%.",
        "The approximate method is also more robust with respect to the number of rules, as it produces about five times less of them as compared to the exact one.",
        "When article, gender and number are combined with POS, the number of rules is increased by a factor of 2 to 3.",
        "Overall, the approximate rules with a threshold of 0.50 exhibit a very high coverage (100% or very close) and precision/F-measure of about 97-99%.",
        "Finally, the tasks are not equally hard.",
        "The easiest one is semantics, and the hardest one is POS.",
        "It is interesting to observe the performance of the different classes in a particular experiment, e.g. gender+POS.",
        "Note that now we can calculate a true recall as opposed to coverage, as we can work with a particular class.",
        "The results for the gen-der+POS, dictionary trained, experiments are shown in Tables 13 and 14.",
        "We can see that the precision, the recall and the F-measure of the exact rules are consistently better for each class as compared to the ones obtained using approximate rules (with threshold of 0.50).",
        "Note however that the recall here is calculated only for the part for which there was a prediction.",
        "The exact rules covered 84,512 out of all 96,643 wordforms (coverage: 87.45%) and 83,120 of them were correct (precision: 98.35%).",
        "The per-class P, R and F are calculated only for those 84,512 wordforms for which a prediction has been made.",
        "I.e. we did not assign the non-covered wordforms the class none by default, although probably we should, as it is the most frequent one.",
        "The approximate rules made predictions for 96,458 wordforms (coverage: 99.81%) 91,430 of which were correct (precision: 94.79%).",
        "Table 15 shows the performance for the approximate rules as evaluated on the training set9.",
        "Out of the 867,567 wordforms, 866,786 have been covered (coverage 99.91%), 835,330 of which correctly (precision 96.37%).",
        "We see that the class N+neu was hard to predict not only on testing but also on training.",
        "Something that Table 12 does not show, but one can see on Figures 1-8, is the consistently worse performance of training & testing on the dictionary vs. training & testing only on these dictionary words that are met in the raw text, using the corresponding frequencies.",
        "The major reason for this is 9 We do not show a corresponding training accuracy table for the exact rules as every cell there is replaced with 100%, i.e. there is a perfect fit.",
        "the insufficient amount of training text.",
        "While the number of word tokens is high, the number of word types is much less than that of the dictionary.",
        "So, the significantly lower variability of wordforms more than compensates any gains of having real word frequencies.",
        "We believe weighting through real text is important and we plan to rerun these experiments with word frequencies estimated from orders of magnitude more textual data (it is cheap and freely available on the Web).",
        "Another, less attractive alternative could be to add the dictionary as a text.",
        "That way we would have incorrect frequency estimations for some of the words, but also the learning algorithm would have access to the rich word variability of the dictionary words."

        "There are several possible extensions to the work presented above.",
        "First, the exact algorithm can be extended with non-exact rules.",
        "Second, the Mikhe-ev-like ending guessing rules construction could be augmented with a merging phase as originally proposed.",
        "It would be interesting to consider using the dictionary not only during rules generation but also during their application: e.g. try to add/remove suffixes/prefixes and check whether the newly obtained word is listed in the dictionary (e.g. we might have the word �a6ri�gaTeri/noun (observer) but not �a6ri�gaTeri��/adj (observing), generated following a standard derivational rule).",
        "There are prefixes, mostly foreign, that can attach to any open class word, but the resulting words are unlikely to be in our dictionary: a�T�- \"(anti-), yriTpa-(ultra-), cynep- super-), ���Tpa- contra-)Furthermore, there are some important prefixes, specific to Bulgarian, that can limit the possible POS: e.g. n�-and �a�- \" ( is part of the prefix) are are used to construct a comparative and a superlative form, accordingly, and can be used only with adjectives, adverbs and some verb forms (e.g. participle).",
        "We believe in the potential of the combined evidence from both prefixes and suffixes.",
        "In addition, it seems important to allow for mutations in the word stem as these are common in Slavonic languages.",
        "Finally, it might be beneficial to learn separate rules for capitalised and dashed words (but maybe it is not that important as their usage is less frequent, especially the capitalisation).",
        "We would like to try other scoring and smoothing approaches.",
        "We did not address the problem of selecting the best threshold (although it is clear that it should be low, maybe around 0.50).",
        "One way to do this is to split the training set into rules-training and threshold-training sets.",
        "Next, it looks promising to try to estimate the dictionary word frequencies using a search engine instead of text corpus, as proposed by Lapata and Keller (2004).",
        "While the exact algorithm performed worse due to insufficient coverage10, we believe it has a potential, e.g. if extended with some approximate rules.",
        "Note that the way the exact rules were built is very similar to the standard algorithm for decision tree construction.",
        "Thus the corresponding tree cutting criteria used to prevent over fitting can help decide when to go further and look at longer endings and when to stop.",
        "It is interesting to see how the proposed rules perform for other Slavonic languages.",
        "In particular, we plan similar experiments for Russian as a comparable morphological dictionary with the same kind of linguistic annotations is already available.",
        "Finally, we would like to explore the machine learning potential offered by morphological dictionaries with application to other related tasks such as stemming (Nakov, 2003), lemmatisation and POS tagging."
