        "With the fast development of text mining technologies, automated management of lexical resources is presently an important research issue.",
        "A particular text mining task often requires a lexical database (e.g., a thesaurus, dictionary, or a terminology) with a specific size, topic coverage, and granularity of encoded meaning.",
        "That is why a lot of recent NLP and AI research has been focusing on finding ways to speedily build or extend a lexical resource ad hoc for an application.",
        "One attractive idea to address this problem is to elicit the meanings of new words automatically from a corpus relevant to the application domain.",
        "To do this, many approaches to lexical acquisition employ the distributional model of word meaning induced from the distribution of the word across various lexical contexts of its occurrence found in the corpus.",
        "The approach is now being actively explored for a wide range of semantics-related tasks including automatic construction of thesauri (Lin, 1998; Caraballo, 1999), their enrichment (Alfonseca and Manandhar, 2002; Pekar and Staab, 2002), acquisition of bilingual lexica from nonaligned (Kay and Röscheisen, 1993) and nonparallel corpora (Fung and Yee, 1998), learning of information extraction patterns from unannotated text (Riloff and Schmelzenbach, 1998).",
        "However, because of irregularities in corpus data, corpus statistics cannot guarantee optimal performance, notably for rare lexical items.",
        "In order to improve robustness, recent research has attempted a variety of ways to incorporate external knowledge into the distributional model.",
        "In this paper we investigate the impact produced by the introduction of different types of linguistic knowledge into the model.",
        "Linguistic knowledge, i.e., the knowledge about linguistically relevant units of text and relations holding between them, is a particularly convenient way to enhance the distributional model.",
        "On the one hand, although describing the “surface” properties of the language, linguistic notions contain conceptual information about the units of text they describe.",
        "It is therefore reasonable to expect that the linguistic analysis of the context of a word yields additional evidence about its meaning.",
        "On the other hand, linguistic knowledge is relatively easy to obtain: linguistic analyzers (lemmatizers, PoS-taggers, parsers, etc) do not require expensive hand-encoded resources, their application is not restricted to particular domains, and their performance is not dependent on the amount of the textual data.",
        "All these characteristics fit very well with the strengths of the distributional approach: while enhancing it with external knowledge, linguistic analyzers do not limit its coverage and portability.",
        "This or that kind of linguistic preprocessing is carried out in many previous applications of the approach.",
        "However, these studies seldom motivate the choice of a particular preprocessing procedure, concentrating rather on optimization of other parameters of the methodology.",
        "Very few studies exist that analyze and compare different techniques for linguistically motivated extraction of distributional data.",
        "The goal of this paper is to exploire in detail a range of variables in the morphological and syntactic processing of the context information and reveal the merits and drawbacks of their particular settings.",
        "The outline of the paper is as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the preprocessing methods under study.",

        "Section 4 details the experimental results.",

        "In order to prepare a machine-processable representation of a word from particular instances of its occurrence, one needs to decide on, firstly, what is to be understood by the context of a word’s use, and, secondly, which elements of that context will constitute distributional features.",
        "A straightforward decision is to take a certain number of words or characters around the target word to be its occurrence context, and all uninterrupted letter sequences within this delineation to be its features.",
        "However, one may ask the question if elements of the text most indicative of the target word’s meaning can be better identified by looking at the linguistic analysis of the text.",
        "In this paper we empirically study the following types of linguistic preprocessing.",
        "1.",
        "The use of original word forms vs. their stems vs. their lemmas as distributional features.",
        "It is not evident what kind of morphological preprocessing of context words should be performed, if at all.",
        "Stemming of context words can be expected to help better abstract from their particular occurrences and to emphasize their invariable meaning.",
        "It also relaxes the stochastic dependence between features and reduces the dimensionality of the representations.",
        "In addition to these advantages, lemmatization also avoids confusing words with similar stems (e.g., car vs. care, ski vs. sky, aide vs. aid).",
        "On the other hand, morphological preprocessing cannot be error-free and it may seem safer to simply use the original word forms and preserve their intended meaning as much as possible.",
        "In text categorization, stemming has not been conclusively shown to improve effectiveness in comparison to using original word forms, but it is usually adopted for the sake of shrinking the dimensionality of the feature space (Sebastiani, 2002).",
        "Here we will examine both the effectiveness and the dimensionality reduction that stemming and lemmatization of context words bring about.",
        "2.",
        "Morphological decomposition of context words.",
        "A morpheme is the smallest meaningful unit of the language.",
        "Therefore decomposing context words into morphemes and using them as features may eventually provide more fine-grained evidence about the target word.",
        "Particularly, we hypothesize that using roots of context words rather than their stems or lemmas will highlight lexical similarities between context words",
        "belonging to different parts of speech (e.g., different, difference, differentiate) or differing only in affixes (e.g., build and rebuild).",
        "3.",
        "Different syntactically motivated methods of delimiting the context of the word’s use.",
        "The lexical context permitting occurrence of the target word consists of words and phrases whose meanings have something to do with the meaning of the target word.",
        "Therefore, given that syntactic dependencies between words presuppose certain semantic relations between them, one can expect syntactic parsing to point to most useful context words.",
        "The questions we seek answers to are: Are syntactically related words indeed more revealing about the meaning of the target word than spatially adjacent ones?",
        "Which types of syntactic dependencies should be preferred for delimiting the context of a target word’s occurrence?",
        "4.",
        "Filtering out rare context words.",
        "The typical practice of preprocessing distributional data is to",
        "remove rare word co-occurrences, thus aiming to reduce noise from idiosyncratic word uses and linguistic processing errors and at the same time form more compact word representations (e.g., Grefenstette, 1993; Ciaramita, 2002).",
        "On the other hand, even single occurrence word pairs make up a very large portion of the data and many of them are clearly meaningful.",
        "We compare the quality of the distributional representations with and without context words that occurred only once with the target word."

        "First, we have compared different types of syntactic dependencies of the target noun in terms of the informativeness of the distributional features constructed from them.",
        "We find that the most useful dependencies are the adjectives and nouns used as attributes to the target nouns and the verbs near which the target nouns are used as direct or prepositional objects.",
        "The most effective representation overall is obtained when using all the syntactic dependencies of the noun.",
        "We find that it is clearly more advantageous than the windowing technique both in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.",
        "The combination of the attribute and object dependencies also produces very good classification accuracy, which is only insignificantly worse than that of the combination of all the dependency types, while using several times more compact feature space.",
        "We further looked at the influence of stemming and lemmatization of context words on the performance.",
        "The study did not reveal any considerable differences in effectiveness obtained by stemming or lemmatization of context words versus the use of their original forms.",
        "Lemmatization, however, allows to achieve the greatest reduction of the feature space.",
        "Similarly, the removal of rare word co-occurrences from the training data could not be shown to consistently improve effectiveness, but was very beneficial in terms of dimensionality reduction, notably for features corresponding to word collocations.",
        "Finally, we examined whether morphological decomposition of context words helps to obtain more informative features, but found that indiscriminative decomposition of all context words into morphemes and using them as separate features actually more often decreases performance rather than increases it.",
        "These results seem to indicate that morphological analysis of context words should be accompanied by some feature selection procedure, which would identify those affixes which are too general and can be safely stripped off and those which are sufficiently specific and whose unity with the root best captures relevant context information."
