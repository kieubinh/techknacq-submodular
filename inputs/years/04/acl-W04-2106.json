        "Graphemes are the smallest meaning distinguishing units.",
        "In the case of kanji this can be stroke length (as in and ), angle of the stroke (as in , and ), stroke direction (as in and ), or ending of a stroke (as in and ).",
        "A more concrete analysis which also takes the act of writing into account would use strokes as basic units of kanji.",
        "A stroke is a graphical element that can be drawn e.g. with a brush or a pencil without interruptions.",
        "Most kanji consist of more than one stroke.",
        "Our analysis of strokes uses 25 basic forms of brush strokes for kanji.",
        "It considers stroke direction, bending of the strokes, stroke endings (blunt or with a short bend) and so on.",
        "The stroke forms are numbered and every stroke of a kanji is assigned with the corresponding number of its stroke form.",
        "Strokes can be grouped together not only to build full kanji but also to combine smaller units which frequently occur in kanji.",
        "We call these smaller units grapheme elements.",
        "Many kanji dictionaries use a subset of such grapheme elements to classify characters ( bushu, engl.",
        "“radicals”).",
        "For the time being our analysis of the grapheme elements uses mostly existing kanji or given radicals.",
        "The data concerning stroke forms, grapheme elements and relative position can, of course, be used for kanji look up.",

        "The graphical description of a kanji consists mostly of an ordered list of strokes.",
        "In SVG, we represent a stroke by a path element.",
        "For instance, the first stroke of the kanji ( kan, “Han-China”) is: <path d=\"M21.38, 19.75, c3.31, 1.47, 8.54, 6.05, 9.37, 8.34\"/> The d attribute of the path element contains the path data in a compact form.",
        "This data is a list of drawing commands that an SVG renderer will execute to draw the path.",
        "The path data for every stroke will consist of a sequence of Bézier curves, which are parametric curves defined by four control points.",
        "Several paths can be grouped together under a group element, which allows the association of groups of paths (i.e., lists of strokes) with every grapheme element of a kanji.",
        "It is then possible to deal directly with grapheme elements in the graphic representation of the kanji, in order to highlight such elements (as in figure 2) or to link them to other SVG files – e.g.",
        "clicking on the left component of would link it to the kanji (mizu, “water”), which is this component’s standard form.",
        "The SVG data available so far is static.",
        "Our goal is to present it in a dynamic fashion, showing strokes one by one, in the order and the direction in which they should be drawn.",
        "We will add an animated child element to every path in the static SVG file to create its animated counterpart.",
        "The animate element controls the moment at which the path is drawn, and the shape it should take.",
        "Unfortunately there is no special command in SVG to draw a path progressively.",
        "A solution is to divide every path in several smaller ones, and to draw each segment one after another, giving the impression of an invisible pen drawing the kanji.",
        "Our division strategy is to segment every curve in a path into a fixed number of elements.",
        "That number of element is set to a power of two, because dividing Bézier curves into two is very easy to do.",
        "Longer strokes will consist of more curves than shorter ones, and it will take more to time to draw them; the distribution of the control points along the curves makes the animation look quite natural.",
        "At the end, an animation is controlled by two parameters: the number of segments into which a curve is split and the time between the drawing of two strokes.",
        "Modifying these values will make the drawing slower or faster, and more or less smooth.",
        "The first stroke of our example kanji will now look like shown below.",
        "The animation will start at time 0; it lasts for 0.45 seconds and it will iterate over the values given by the value’s attribute.",
        "The d attribute in the path parent element will take these successive values over time."
