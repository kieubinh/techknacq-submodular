        "The computerized version of the dictionary, the TLFi (Trésor de la langue française informatisé), contains the same data as the paper version, with its 350 million characters.",
        "With the help of very sophisticated automata, we have been able to insert in the text a very complex set of XML tags in such a way that every textual object is clearly identified and that the hierarchy containing these objects is clearly designed.",

      "text": [
        "Its originality is based, firstly, on its wordlist, which is rich of about 100 000 entries, present either in our funds or in other dictionaries.",
        "The TLF was a pioneer in the treatment of morphemes or in the treatment of structures of specific vocabularies.",
        "Secondly, it is original too, by the richness of the number of examples, about 430000, and syntagms, about 165 000, quoted throughout its 16 volumes.",
        "Besides, its list of metatextual objects such as headwords, definitions, indications of domains, semantic and stylistic indicators, examples with their sources, fixed phrases is exceptional.",
        "About 40 different metatextual objects.",
        "The data are proposed in different sections: synchrony, etymology, history, pronunciation, bibliography.",
        "One of the main advantages of a computerized dictionary is to consider it as a knowledge database in which one can extract any items contained in any textual object.",
        "In order to get the most relevant answers when querying the database, the XML tag set is divided into two subsets : the tags of the first subset are used as delimiters and identifiers of the different kinds of textual objects used in the TLF ; the tags of the second subset represent the hierarchical organisation of the articles, in a way similar to the block structure of modern programming languages.",
        "This introduces very useful notions: The scope of an object (from a pragmatic point of view it is the paragraph in which the object appears plus all the subparagraphs of this paragraph) is the smallest block containing this object.",
        "The comparison of the scopes defines a binary relation between objects.",
        "Let us take the example of an article devoted to the headword W, containing the stylistic indicator “popular” and an example of Zola.",
        "Does this example illustrate a popular sense of W?",
        "The answer is yes if the scope of the indicator contains the scope of the example, otherwise the answer is no.",
        "Three levels of queries are possible depending on the users’s need.",
        "2.2.3.1.",
        "First level : Simple visualization of an article.",
        "You can read an article dedicated to a specific headword by three means.",
        "Firstly, you have the possibility to write the word with mistakes if you do not know the right spelling of the word.",
        "That is very useful for the users who do not remember the right accents (acute, grave or circumflex) for instance.",
        "All kinds of mistakes (like bad or omitted accents, simple/double consonants, missing hyphens) are allowed.",
        "What is more, any mistake is possible as long as the right pronunciation is correct.",
        "For instance, if you write “ornitorink”, the article “ornithorynque” will be found.",
        "It is also possible to enter an inflected form of a verb (ex.",
        "danseront) or of an adjective or noun (ex.",
        "généraux), or even a phonetic equivalent of such a form (ex.",
        "jénéro), even with bad accents (ex.",
        "jenero).",
        "Secondly, you can use the possibility of seeing the list of the main articles contained in the TLFi, this allows the user to discover unknown words, just as if he was turning the pages of the paper version of the dictionary.",
        "Thirdly, the user can find an article thanks to selecting sounds and not alphabetical characters.",
        "At that level of consulting, you read the dictionary article by article, yet with easy ways of searching a word.",
        "2.2.3.2.",
        "Second level : aided requests.",
        "At that level you have the possibility of using the dictionary as a textual knowledge database and to make queries throughout the 16 volumes in one click of mouse.",
        "One can make requests on graphic forms, on inflected forms as well, on sequences of words ...",
        "The requests can be mono-criterion or multi-criteria.",
        "Examples of mono-criterion requests : all the words borrowed from Spanish language, all the words of a specific domain, all the onomatopoeias, all the metaphors and so on.",
        "By specifying several criteria, one can extract from the dictionary all the nouns of a specific domain, all the verbs which are used with a stylistic indicator (for instance “popular”) and which have been used by an author (for instance Victor Hugo).",
        "Other example : one can extract also all the definitions which contain a word (for instance instrument) and which at the same time do not contain the word measure, and which are found in the domain of optics, and so on.",
        "2.2.3.3.",
        "Third level : complex requests.",
        "The user, at that level, can seek for a set of textual objects {O1, O2,..., On} imposing them to be conformant to a set of constraints combining the type, the contents and the relations between objects.",
        "Type and contents specifications are sometimes possible in other computerized dictionaries query systems.",
        "They allow to find articles talking about architecture or containing an example contained from Zola.",
        "Suppose now that we are looking for articles where an example of Zola is related to the domain architecture.",
        "The simple fact to combine the two criteria (must talk about architecture and contain examples of Zola), is not enough : may be some part of the article is not devoted to architecture.",
        "If the example of Zola is in such a part, the article is not relevant.",
        "In the TLFi, the problem is solved with a new kind of constraint, by using the scope of objects.",
        "We will state that the example must be hierarchically inferior to the domain.",
        "Thus, all the articles where the example is not in the scope of the domain will be shifted.",
        "This feature is nothing but the simple reflect of the XML tags representing the hierarchy.",
        "It gives the TLFi query system an incredible accuracy.",
        "Strangely enough, it seems to be ignored in other computarized dictionaries, with the consequence of very poor quality results.",
        "This powerful feature, plus many other ones, such as the possibility to make list of words in many ways (manually, by automatical generation of the inflected forms of a given lemma, or by high level regular expressions selection) and reuse them in requests, allied to the rich content of the TLFi and a very friendly user’s interface, with help on line, allow very complex querying, with pertinent results."

        "Historically, the base derives from the texts assembled for providing examples to be used in the elaboration of the Trésor de la langue française (TLF).",
        "This first raison d’être turned to a new one: the desire to offer the scientific community a vast corpus of texts linked to an efficient query tool.",

        "At the start the TLF in its paper version was intended to a public of specialists in linguistics, erudite persons and scholars.",
        "The computerization of its data, the friendly interface with its help on line, the capacities of the software Stella give a new life to the TLF.",
        "As described above, all the possibilities of queries allow anyone, specialist or not, to extract any piece of information from that textual database.",
        "The TLFi is directed at the widest audience with the possibility of making queries without knowing the right spelling of a word.",
        "The majority of electronic dictionaries do not offer this possibility of access to words when spelling is unknown by the user.",
        "For instance, in the French word “sculpture”, the letter p is mute.",
        "Thanks to this first query of research, the user can ask the word by its spelling : “skultur”.",
        "The right answer will be immediately found.",
        "Besides, another friendly way to read the computerized TLFi consists in putting in evidence one or several textual objects by colouring them.",
        "Its interest for linguistic research is obvious for it is a powerful tool to help the user who wants to study grammatical classes (verbs, adjectives, adverbs, for instance), syntactical classes (in studying constructions of a verb, more precisely, the user can find the verbs which are followed by the french preposition “de”), etymological classes (verbs borrowed from a language, Latin or English), stylistic classes (ironical or metaphorical uses, for instance all the adverbs used in slang), morphological classes (the words ending with a suffix, or beginning with a prefix, for instance all the verbs ending with the suffix –age and which are an action of a verb).",
        "It is also possible to exclude the content of a textual object, for instance if the user wants to extract all the words ending with the suffix –able which are not adjectives.",
        "The use of the TLFi can also be foreseen for learning and teaching French language.",
        "Actually we are thinking, on one hand, about the pedagogic possibilities given by that computerized dictionary such as it is available at the moment, and on the other hand, about the modifications we could make in order to encourage its use in education In the use of the TLFi in teaching such as it is at present, we have defined a methodology whose aim is to allow the use of this important linguistic resource.",
        "In collaboration with a teacher we have prepared and experimented a set of pedagogical activities for children in the CE1 class (7 years old).",
        "The results show that young children, who are learning to read, are able, alone or in pairs, to use the TLFi to write a word in capital letters, to tell its grammatical category, to find a noun phrase or verb phrase containing this word or to say whether it is monosemic or polysemic.",
        "As regards the modifications we could implement in order to get the TLFi to adapt to the learners, we could mention different types of modifications according to the ages of the learners.",
        "Firstly, we could, in the articles, change the literary examples extracted from the textual database Frantext for examples coming from another textual database containing youth literature.",
        "Secondly, we intend to present the information in a slightly different way.",
        "For instance, the syntagms could be found at start of a new paragraph, instead of being at a place where it is not easy to detect them for a young learner.",
        "Thirdly, we intend to give specific helps and commentaries on line to guide the young learner."
