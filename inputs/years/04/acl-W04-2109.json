        "The project \"Collocations in the German Language\", located at the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences, studies the properties of verb phrase idioms such as jmdm.",
        "einen Bären aufbinden (lit.",
        "‘tie a bear onto sb.",
        "'s back,’ i.e. ‘tell a big lie’) and einen Bock schiessen (lit.",
        "‘shoot a buck,’ i.e. ‘commit a grave error’).",
        "Idioms are sometimes referred to informally as \"long words\" and are treated as fixed strings with no internal structure.",
        "While some idioms (like the much-discussed English example kick the bucket) have semantically opaque components and do not undergo syntactic or lexical alternations, others (like bury the hatchet) behave more like freely composed VP.",
        "Nunberg, Sag, and Wasow (1994) and Dobrovolskij (1999) are among the linguists who have observed a correlation between an idiom's fixedness and its semantic opacity: The more fixed an idiom, the more semantically opaque it can be.",
        "But this correlation is not always straightforward, and to understand the way speakers represent idioms in their internal grammars we must investigate the full range of behavior.",
        "For example, the German equivalent of kick the bucket is lit.",
        "‘bite into the grass’ (ins Gras beissen).",
        "While Gras (just like ‘bucket’) does not seem to be mappable onto the concept, it can be modified with an adjective, as our corpus example ‘bit the Texan grass’ shows.",
        "In fact, the adjective must be interpreted as having scope over the entire VP, not just the NP, as the phrase refers to someone dying in Texas.",
        "Lexical substitution and variability of the idiom’s components in general can show that an element is assigned a particular interpretation, as in the (diachronically differentiated) variants sich auf die Striimpfe machen and sich auf die Socken machen (lit.",
        "‘make oneself on the stockings/socks’, i.e. ‘to get going or get moving’).",
        "Here, the substitution of a near-synonym indicates that speakers assign some meaning to the noun, most likely the footwear that is associated with travel on foot.",
        "But speakers make substitutions without necessarily assigning a meaning to the constituents of the idiom.",
        "Current lexicographic and linguistic treatment of VP idioms does not attempt to reflect the full range of the idioms' properties or classify them accordingly.",
        "Our goal is to give a data-oriented, comprehensive linguistic account of a broad spectrum of German idioms.",
        "The empirical basis for our work is the corpus of the Digitales Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache (DWDS), a corpus of almost 1 billion words from texts drawn from a variety of genres and covering the entire 20th century.",
        "We are creating a resource that combines features of a dictionary, a grammar of idioms, and a corpus.",
        "Central to our methodology are two main components: an electronic knowledge base created via structured annotations, and a corresponding sub-corpus of examples (example corpora) for each entry."

      "text": [
        "Our lexicon combines subtle linguistic annotations with specific corpus data.",
        "For each target idiom, a sub-corpus, containing appropriate examples drawn from the 1-billion-word-corpus, is created.",
        "Following the identification of a target idiom, corpus queries are written to generate the candidate set of relevant corpus data, taking advantage of a search engine developed in-house.",
        "The queries include specific lexical and morphological elements as well as Boolean operators.",
        "The resultant candidate example corpus, in XML/TEI format, is manually inspected for false positives, i.e. strings which are not instances of the idiom but rather accidental products of the query.",
        "The number of true positives gives an idea of the frequency of idioms in the language – information that was not easy to gather until now.",
        "For example, the idiom jmdn.",
        "zur Minna machen (lit.",
        "‘make sb.",
        "a Minna,’, i.e. ‘to publicly reprimand sb.’) is attested only 41 times, while ein Auge auf etw.",
        "haben (lit.",
        "‘to keep an eye on sth.’) yields 560 examples.",
        "To ensure reproducibility of result sets, examples are marked with tags identifying their corpus query and the particular corpus version.",
        "Thus we have the possibility of comparison between the manually inspected example corpora and the dynamically increasing DWDS-Corpus."

      "heading": "3 The Annotation Template",
      "text": [
        "We created a template for linguistic and lexicographic annotation, a kind of digital questionnaire.",
        "It serves as both input and output interface and links the annotated example corpora with the idiom knowledge base.",
        "The data entry interface supports a structured entry created by the linguists/lexicographers, who record various properties of the idioms as evidenced by the examples.",
        "The template design reflects the information which is considered relevant in the discussion of idioms from a lexicographic and linguistic point of view, focusing on the interplay between normal usage and flexibility.",
        "The template consists of the following major parts: The first part contains information which is typically found in dictionaries.",
        "This includes the citation form of the idiom, together with a definition.",
        "A difference from standard dictionaries is the link to the data.",
        "We record the first and last occurrence in the corpus and in this way we indicate the time span of corpus examples of the idiom during the 20th century.",
        "The citation form is derived on the basis of the corpus evidence according to statistical significance (cf. example below).",
        "The typical usages lead to the formulation of the citation form, which is linked to some of them.",
        "In addition, there is information on alternate forms (e.g. different aspectual varieties of an idiom, transitive vs. intransitive uses, etc.)",
        "with a reference to the corresponding entry.",
        "The second part is the syntactic structure of the idiom, in particular the structure of the VP including the subject.",
        "We show dependencies between constituents on three levels (two phrase levels and a terminal level), using the category variables of a German tag set1.",
        "At the terminal level we fill in the lexical material which corresponds to the citation form.",
        "Finally, we note the status of each component in the idiom according to degree of fixedness (external argument, core component, obligatory, optional, etc.).",
        "This ‘tree’ structure automatically creates a table which records the morphosyntactic properties of idiom components.",
        "Since idioms are considered as typically restricted according to morphosyntactic properties (e.g., noun complements may occur only in the singular or only in the plural), we explore to which extent this is supported by the data.",
        "On the basis of these morphosyntactic regularities, we derive the citation form.",
        "This is considered to be the normal (or typical) form, according to frequency of usage.",
        "We are also interested in non-typical or “deviant” usages.",
        "The term should be understood not in the sense of “abnormal” or “ungrammatical”, but as infrequent or not statistically significant (sometimes idiosyncratic, sometimes more widespread), yet important for insight into the linguistic properties of an idiom.",
        "Idioms are also subject to restrictions concerning the passivization of the nominal components, their pronominalization, relativization, and other syntactic processes sometimes called “transformations”.",
        "If we take the example mentioned earlier, one would not expect to encounter *das Gras, in das er gebissen hat (relativization), *das Gras wurde gebissen (passivization), etc.",
        "In reality, these transformations can be observed in most cases.",
        "We record them in a separate table and link every transformation type to the corresponding occurrences in the example corpora.",
        "The template also offers the possibility to include semantic as well as historical information, if diachronic changes or noteworthy developments can be observed in the corpus data.",

        "Modern German the noun Bockshorn2 is considered to be a phraseologically bound word, i.e. it does not occur in isolation, but only in a fixed expression3.",

        "ins Bockshorn jagen, which might be translated as ‘to put the wind up sb.’ The following table shows the results which were given by three different queries to the corpus for this idiom:",
        "As the table shows, the queries leave open the possibility of finding variation at every slot: The position of the verb is left unspecified in the first query.",
        "In the second query we try to find instances where the first component of the noun (Bock-) might be substituted by another noun4, while the third query should deliver instances of compounds with Bockshorn (cf. the form Bockshornklee in Table 2 below).",
        "2 The etymology of the word is obscure.",
        "Röhrich (2001) offers nine etymologies for the idiom according to different possible sources of the noun.",
        "He reaches no conclusion.",
        "Synchronically, the word is identical to the name of a low-growing plant (fenugreek) with tough wiry stems, also called Bockshornklee.",

        "Actually, this particular word (Bockshorn) occurs outside a fixed expression, but it occurs only in highly technical contexts (cf. footnote 5 below).",
        "4 The opposite case, i.e. looking for cases with the component stable (-horn), gave no results.",
        "Linguistic analysis of the data led to the formulation of two alternate citation forms and consequently two entries for the idiom:",
        "1) jmd.",
        "lässt sich nicht ins Bockshorn jagen (192 hits) 2) jmd.",
        "jagt jmdn.",
        "ins Bockshorn (44 hits).5",
        "The first is a form with the so-called “lassen-passive”.",
        "It is much more frequent than the transitive form; actually it is the typical form associated with Bockshorn.",
        "The results show a remarkable uniformity of the idiom components, as the following table shows:",
        "The forms which are mentioned first in Table 2 (bold face) are seen as the “normal” components in the sense of statistical significance, the other forms are considered as “deviations” from the norm.",
        "These include the substitution of components.",
        "Cf. the noun: The form Boxhorn is phonologically identically to Bockshorn; perhaps its usage represents the need to motivate the original noun.",
        "The substitution of Bockshornklee can be explained with reference to the context: This noun appears earlier in the text and triggers the use of the idiom, a not unusual phenomenon in journalese texts.",
        "Finally, Hasenhorn shows the typical pattern of noun substitution in idioms in German, i.e. the substitution of one part of a compound noun typically by a synonym or a word belonging to the same lexical field (Hase- ‘rabbit’ for Bock-‘buck’).",
        "Again, this substitution is triggered by the topic of the text.",
        "Note that this substitution occurs",
        "even though the speaker cannot assign a meaning to the lexeme Bockshorn (cf. Introduction).",
        "Now consider the figures for the transitive alternant jmd.",
        "jagt jmdn.",
        "ins Bockshorn:",
        "The citation form given is derived on the basis of these quantities, which distinguish normal usage from “deviant” usages.",
        "Beside the form Boxhorn (cf. above) Bockhorn occurs once.9 Gruselhorn (Grusel- ‘scary’) is a nonce creation for the expression of emphasis since it combines the meaning of the idiom and the meaning of ‘to scare sb.’ As for the verb, it is substituted twice.",
        "The verb führen ‘to lead’ fulfils the same semantic function as jagen in this idiom, i.e. the expression of causativity.",
        "The difference is that führen is unmarked: In German it is often used as a function verb to express causativity (to cause a change of state for sb.).",
        "The substitution of einjagen on the other hand may be due to its occurrence in the near-synonymous expression (jmdm.)",
        "Angst/Schrecken einjagen ‘to scare sb.’ To sum up, if variability correlates with flexibility (or fixedness) of an idiom, then these figures lead to the conclusion that idioms with phraseologically bound forms are typically fixed.",
        "But contrary to claims in the literature that there is no variability at all, corpus evidence shows that there is some patterned variability.",
        "The interesting question is whether it is also predictable.",
        "Finally, it should be noted that the postulation of two entries (the lassen-Passive and the transitive/ causative) are necessary for two reasons.",
        "Firstly, the two entries differ in syntactic structure (argument structure, negation, etc.).",
        "This difference automatically forces us to establish separate entries, because the whole design of the template is based on syntactic structure.",
        "This means that the subsequent sections (morpho",
        "syntactic properties and variations or deviations from the citation form) are created automatically on the basis of the syntactic structure of the idiom.",
        "Of course, they have to be filled in manually, but their design is uniform for all idioms which ensures comparability.",
        "Secondly, the lassen-Passive (plus negation and reflexivity) as a typical instance of this idiom is not a regular (or necessary) correlate of the transitive form, as a pure passive form would be.",
