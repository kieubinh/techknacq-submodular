        "The dictionaries, monolingual, bilingual, or multilingual, are the standard way of collecting and presenting lexicographic knowledge about one or more languages.",
        "The electronic dictionaries (EDs) are not merely a straightforward extension of their printed counterparts, but they entail additional purely computational problems.",
        "ED as marked-up text.",
        "An ED may be seen simply as a long, marked-up text.",
        "The important computational issues arise around the problem of efficient keyword search and appropriate presentation of the dictionary data.",
        "The search is performed in the context of a markup scheme, such as SGML or XML, and the query model has to provide expressibility for search queries within this scheme; e.g, searching for a keyword within a certain text region.",
        "An example of such research is the OED project conducted from 1987 through 1994 (Tompa and Gonnet, 1999; OED, 2004).",
        "One of the achievements of the OED project was that the search software was able to retrieve all occurrences of words and phrases within the dictionary corpus of size 570 MB in less than a second (Tompa and Gonnet, 1999).",
        "Knowledge-base Structure of an ED.",
        "The second aspect of EDs is the structure of information represented in them.",
        "This structure is of interest to linguists, lexicographers, and various dictionary users, but it is of chief interest to computational linguists.",
        "A major computational challenge is how to design the dictionary structure in order to make its maintenance manageable and efficient.",
        "Various lexical resources that were developed in the last few decades have become invaluable in Natural Language Processing (NLP), most notably the WordNet.",
        "Another reason why efficiency in dictionary maintenance is important is that natural languages change dynamically and good ED should track these lexical innovations.",
        "Different domains need to be covered, and the parts of the dictionary that are becoming old and archaic need to be timestamped and archived as such.",
        "In this paper, we present a bilingual bidirectional on-line Serbo-Croatian (SC)-English dictionary that has been available on the Internet since 1999.",
        "This is the first published report describing this resource.",
        "The dictionary internal structure is motivated by the WordNet structure, and it provides a way of producing monolingual SC and bilingual SC-English wordnet."

        "The on-line dictionary R{j}ecnik.com has been active since 1999.",
        "One of its most visible characteristics, also noted by other users, is simplicity of the user interface.",
        "There is one search textual field in which the user enters the query and the dictionary reports all dictionary entries matching the query on either English or SC side.",
        "It provides an efficient search mechanism, returning the results within a second.",
        "Lexical resources.",
        "As a lexicographic resource, this is a wide-coverage, up-to-date, bidirectional, and bilingual dictionary covering not only general, often used terms, but also over 8,000 computer and Internet terms,8 as well as healthcare and medical vocabulary, including useful abbreviations.",
        "The entries are grouped by semantic meaning and part of speech, in the WordNet fashion.",
        "The English lexemes are associated with their phonetic representations, and the entries are marked by domain of usage (e.g., computers, business, finance, medicine).",
        "Colloquial and informal expressions are marked",
        "through public discussion at the email list Serbian Terminology maintained by Danko Sipka (http://main.amu.edu.pl/mailman/listinfo/st-l).",
        "with special symbols so that they can be easily identified.",
        "In addition, the dictionary contains plenty of illustrative examples showing the language in use.",
        "A suitable text encoding for SC is used so that the software generates both Latin (Roman) and Cyrillic script versions.",
        "Dialectical and geographical differences are also marked.",
        "Software overview.",
        "The dictionary software is developed in the Perl programming language.",
        "From the source dictionary file, the searchable on-line resource file is generated.",
        "It is in textual format and it is indexed through an inverted file index for searchable terms in English and SC.",
        "The searchable terms are chosen selectively.",
        "The tags and descriptions are not searchable since this would produce spurious search results.",
        "Dictionary structure.",
        "Following the ideas from OED (Tompa and Gonnet, 1999), we adopted the philosophy of modern text markup systems that “a computer-processable version of text is well-represented by interleaving ‘tags’ with the text of the original document, still leaving the original words in proper sequence.” Additionally, we adopted the ideas from the WordNet project (Miller, 2004) in structuring our knowledge base around the basic entry unit being a meaning; i.e., one meaning = one entry.",
        "One source dictionary entry (vs. a printed, or on-line dictionary entry) corresponds to one synset in WordNet.",
        "It is represented in one physical line in a textual file, or it may be stored in several lines which are continued by having a backslash (\\) character at the end of each line but the last one.",
        "An entry starts with the English lexemes separated by commas followed by an equal sign (=), and the corresponding SC lexemes, also separated by commas.",
        "Additional pertinent information is encoded using tags.",
        "This representation is conceptually simple and efficient in terms of manual maintenance and memory use.",
        "It is also flexible, since it allows tags to define features that refer to the whole entry or just individual lexemes.",
        "Such representation deviates from the commonly used XML notation because we find the XML notation to be more “machine-friendly” than user-friendly, but it can be automatically converted to XML.",
        "To illustrate the difference between TEI (Sperberg-McQueen and Burnard, 2003), the standard XML-based markup scheme, and our markup scheme, we adopt an example from (Erjavec, 1999), which is shown in in Fig. 1.",
        "TEI markup, in (B) we give our corresponding entry.",
        "The tags are preceded with a colon (:).",
        "English lexemes are associated with their phonetic representations within the square brackets.",
        "The phonetic representation is encoded using the vfon encoding.9 All changes to the dictionary can be easily tracked down using the key : id tag and the standard CVS (Control Version System) system.",
        "The encoding ipp is used to encode SC text fragments, since they include additional letters beside the standard 7-bit ASCII set.",
        "The on-line version of the dictionary is encoded using the dual1 encoding for simplicity and efficiency reasons.",
        "The input query can be entered using the ipp encoding, and is translated into the dual1 encoding before matching.",
        "The krascii encoding10 is additionally accepted in the input query as the most common transcribing scheme, although it inherently leads to some incorrect matches.",
        "A very systematic variation in SC is ekavian vs. ijekavian dialect; for example: mleko/mlijeko (milk) and primeri/primjeri (examples), but also hteo/htio (wanted).",
        "The text is converted via the following regular ex",
        "POS tags: noun (n), verb (v), adjective (a), adverb (adv), article (art), preposition (prep), conjunction (conj), interjection (interj), pronoun (pron), numeral (num), noun phrase (np), verb phrase (vp), symbol or special character (sym), and idiom (idiom).",
        "Morpho-syntactic features: diminutive (dim), feminine (fm), imperfective (ipf), intransitive (itv), masculine (m), neuter (nt), past participle (pp), perfective (pf), plural (pl), preterite or past tense (pret), singular (sl), and transitive (tv).",
