        "MWEs have been viewed, for long time, as marginal idiosyncratic combinations of words.",
        "In recent years, however, there has been a growing awareness in the NLP community of the problems that MWEs pose and the need for their robust handling.",
        "Several major conferences and satellite workshops have been dedicated to the subject (ACL, EACL, LREC, for instance); major publications devote thematic issues to MWEs.",
        "Anticipating that growing interest, over the last years, a significant part of LabEL’s research has been devoted to the development of large-scale, linguistically precise language resources, namely to the construction of computational lexicons for simple and multiword units (Eleutério et al., 1995; Ranchhod et al., 1999; Ranchhod et al., 2004).",
        "In fact, we have observed that MWEs are used frequently in both everyday language and technical and scientific texts to express ideas and concepts that in general cannot be stated by “free” linguistic structures.",
        "They include a large range of different linguistic phenomena, such as: (i) lexical compounds (nouns: cellular phone, rush hour, New Jersey; adjectives: well-known; adverbs: for the time being, in short; prepositions and conjunctions:",
        "in spite of, in order to) (ii) phrasal verbs (give up); (iii) light verbs (give a lecture); (iv) fixed (proverbs and maxims) and semi-fixed sentences (to see the light at the end of the tunnel; to take the Lord’ name in vain).",
        "From a linguistic point of view, all these expressions exhibit distributional and selectional constraints, i.e. they lack compositionality, and frequently have idiomatic interpretations.",
        "In this paper, we focus on multiword nouns.",
        "Special attention will be given to their formalization and generation, using INTEX, a public FST (Finite-State Transducer) based NLP system [Silberztein, 1993].",
        "In this context, we present the main characteristics of a new inflectional module, conceived at LabEL, fully compatible with this system.",
        "Next, we describe the acquisition methodology used to gather new dictionary entries in a fragment (extracts 1,520,001 to 1,567,625) of the non-annotated version of a public Portuguese corpus, CETEMPublico2.",
        "Finally, based on this experiment, we assess, on the one hand, the dictionary increase, and, on the other hand, the lexical coverage improvement in the referred corpus."

        "Multiword (or compound) nouns are composed of non-capitalized simple words.",
        "Superficially, they seem to result from general rules of word combinations but they present constraints (morphological, combinatorial, etc.)",
        "concerning the properties they were supposed to have.",
        "Regarding inflection, general rules presented by grammarians do apply to some cases, but most compounds exhibit inflectional restrictions on gender or number that cannot be described by the morphological properties of their constituents.",
        "Table 1 presents a few examples of the most representative classes of compound nouns in Portuguese.",
        "These classes represent binary compounds, comprised of two content words (where one of them is a noun), eventually connected by a grammatical word3.",
        "The classification criteria are based on the noun’s internal structures, which are generally associated with a characteristic inflectional pattern.",
        "For instance, compound nouns belonging to the NA class usually allow the inflection in gender and/or number of both constituents (e.g. bomba atómica, bombas atómicas); on the contrary, in the majority of NDN compound nouns, only the first noun can inflect (conselho de guerra, conselhos de guerra).",

        "Following methods and formalisms introduced at LADL [Gross, 1988; Courtois and Silberztein, 1990], linguistic attributes of simple and multiword units are systematically encoded in dictionaries compatible with INTEX.",
        "In this system, compound word entries are handled depending on their internal structure.",
        "They are formalized and processed separately by different programs.",
        "In order to simplify the formalization of linguistic attributes, and make the generation process easier, we implemented a new inflectional module compatible with INTEX system.",
        "The main strength of this tool is allowing the simultaneous generation of all compounds, regardless of their internal structure, reusing the inflectional graphs already built for simple words [Mota, forthcoming].",
        "The morphological constraints are specified manually, assigning to each constituent the inflectional code that corresponds to its inflectional behavior within the compound, as illustrated by the following dictionary entries:",
        "3 Even though less productive than the previous structures, there are longer multi-word combinations that may involve more than one compound form (e.g. cabo de alta tensão, high-tension electricity cable).",
        "In the first compound, both constituents keep their simple word dictionary inflectional code; they inflect in gender and number, according to the compound inflectional behavior.",
        "On the other hand, the compound noun ser humano inflects only in number, which means that the masculine nominal constituent ser preserves its inflectional code, but the adjectival constituent humano (which also inflects in gender, as simple word) receives a new code that just allows its inflection in number within the compound.",
        "In the case of the NDN compounds, as previously mentioned, only the head can inflect: ponto de vista inflects in number, so the head receives a code allowing its inflection; direitos de autor does not inflect (it is an exclusive masculine plural noun), hence the head is assigned an inflectional code that simply transmits these gender and number features to the compound."

        "Then, it combines the resulting inflected nouns with all inflected forms of the adjective secundário, generated given graph A001.",
        "Subsequentely, the combinations that do not verify the gender and number agreement constraints are eliminated.",

        "After tokenized by INTEX, 6,385,531 tokens (corresponding to 138,230 different tokens) were identified in the acquisition corpus.",

        "Each class’s candidates were integrated into a concordance, to which were applied the existing compound dictionaries.",

        "The percentage in the graphic was calculated based on the number of non-recognized different candidates (NA: 104,715; NDN: 56,741).",
        "Another interesting observation regarding Graphic 1 is that the size of the NA candidate list is slightly more than a double of the NDN candidate list.",
        "Nevertheless, the NA candidate list includes proportionally more valid compound forms (NA: 20%; NDN: 7%).",
        "In addition, the final selected NA compound list contains about five times more entries than the corresponding NDN list.",
        "The selected compound forms resulted in a total of 19,825 NA and 3,769 NDN canonical entries, which correspond respectively to 41,267 NA and 7,722 NDN inflected forms."

        "This discrepancy is not unexpected, regarding the low number of nominal compound entries in dictionaries.",
