        "In this paper we try to contribute to the problem of electronic dictionaries with a case study, - TransDict, - a multilingual lexicon for a family of patent-related NLP applications, such as AutoPat, APTrans and AutoRead1.",
        "TransDict thus conforms to the “Multilingual-Specialized” dictionary paradigm (Sérasset, 1993), but it can also be used as a stand alone tool and adapted for other language related tasks, e.g., training computational linguists.",
        "The motivation to focuse on application tuned dictionaries is that though developing reusable full-sized knowledge bases for NLP systems is highly desirable this process is extremely expensive and time consuming, and reusability is not guaranteed.",
        "If an NLP system uses a restricted sublanguage, and, thus, can operate with smaller-scale dictionaries, the scope of acquisition and development effort will decrease correspondingly.",
        "Dictionary software should be adaptable to the specificity of sublanguages.",
        "The languages that are currently covered are English and Danish but TransDict can easily be extended to a multiple number of other languages.",
        "TransDict features a powerful environment for acquisition, editing, browsing, defaulting and coherence checking.",
        "It is implemented in C++ as an integral part of 32-bit Windows applications for Windows 95/98/2000/NT."

        "A vast amount of research in the field of electronic dictionaries concentrate on data unification, representation, organization and management with the major focus on multilingual dictionaries as, for example, in (Wong, 2000; Boitet et al.,2002).",
        "Multilingual electronic dictionaries often include a database of cross-referenced unilingual dictionaries with the use of interlingua such as ontology (Onyshkevich and Nirenburg, 1994)) or a pivotal language (Boitet et al.,cf.).",
        "The architecture of such dictionaries normally include a lexical database and a set of tools for data management, - visualisers, editors, defaulters, etc.",
        "(Khatchadourian, 1992).",
        "A user-friendly interface is one of the major issues still uderdeveloped (Bilac and Zock, 2003).",
        "XML and SGML data representation languages (Boitet et al., cf.) have been a successful approach to facilitate the export of electronic dictionaries to different applications though many dictionaries use their own internal data representation formats (Fedder, 1992).",
        "Finally, it is desirable for electronic dictionaries to be standalone modules with defined interfaces for interaction with other linguistic applications (Pointer project report, http://www.computing.surrey.ac.uk/ai/pointer)."

      "heading": "3.2 Organization and architecture",
      "text": [
        "TransDict includes cross-referenced monolingual lexicons for every language.",
        "A monolingual dictionary consists of a set of entries.",
        "An entry identifies lexical information for one meaning of a lexeme of a given language.",
        "Every entry is maximally defined as a tree of features: SEM-CL[Language[POS RANK [MORPH CASE_ROLE FILLER PATTERN] The CASE_ROLE , FILLER and PATTERN features might not be specified in certain entries, e.g., for nouns-physical objects.",
        "A maximal entry has the following fields:",
        "TAG is a label to code several features: POS, number, inflection type and semantic class: object, event, etc., providing for powerful tagging.",
        "The architecture of TransDict is shown in Figure 1.",
        "All information is stored in TransDict internal formats: in data files and index files.",
        "The developer works with the Main Dictionary File (MDF) visualised by the interface (Figure 2).",
        "When the lexicographer saves the data multiple extractions from MDF are automatically created.",
        "These extractions contain different data subsets relevant for different processing steps (tagging, disambiguation, transfer and generation).",
        "The extractions are created for every language and for every pair of languages.",
        "They are linked to applications by special DLL (dynamic link library) functions that access only one of the dictionary extractions for every processing step.",
        "This approach gives a significant increase in access speed and processing, which is crucial for real world systems.",
        "This and the fact that TransDict is implemented for PC motivated our choice not to use the SQL database and XML (which would have slowed down the application performance).",
        "It does not mean, however, that TransDict could not be used in the on-line regime.",
        "An interface and a dll can be written for this purpose."

        "Defaulter automatically assignes entry structures and some of feature values to entries.",

        "The “Add” button calls pop-up menus where the developer is prompted to select a semantic class and part-of speech.",
        "This done, an entry with a relevant structure, tags and default values will be displayed.",
        "After the user types in a base form all other wordforms are automatically generated on mouse click.",
        "The developer is to review the default knowledge and edit it if necessary.",
        "The content and format checker take care of correct descriptions with different kinds of alert messages and rewriting support.",
        "Powerful search can be done both in a lookup and edit mode.",
        "Changing the dictionary settings can easily change a base form status of a wordform, the structure of the entry and other specification parameters.",
        "Figure 3 shows how the default noun entry with two slots for its morphological forms: singular and plural, is reset for Danish where definiteness is expressed morphologically, thus duplicating the number of members of the noun paradigm compared with English."

      "heading": "6 Conclusion",

        "In this paper we described an ongoing project on developing a multilingual electronic dictionary, - TransDict, integrated with patent domain applications.",
        "We focused on such effort saving strategies as knowledge organization, access, reusability, support tools and interface design.",
        "As of now (April 2004) the dictionary program including intelligent application adaptive interface integrated with supporting tools and external applications, - AutoPat, AutoTrans, AutoRead (Sheremetyeva, cf.) is fully implemented and tested.",
        "This “shell” can now be used to create any number of dictionaries with different feature spaces.",
        "The TransDict patent domain knowledge base currently contains about 60,000 completed English entries and around 100 equivalent Danish entries that are directly used in testing analysis, transfer and generation modules for the English-Danish machine translation system.",
        "We plan to increase the English-Danish knowledge base to a product size level by December 2004.",
        "TransDict (with patent domain or other knowledge) can be used as a standalone tool, for other applications e.g., for training computational linguists."
