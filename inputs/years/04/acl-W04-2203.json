        "The macro-structure of Papillon is a set of monolingual dictionaries (one for each language) of word senses, called lexies, linked through a central set of interlingual links, called axies.",
        "Axies, also called interlingual acceptions, are not concepts, but simply interlingual links between lexies, motived by translations found in existing dictionaries or proposed by the contributors.",
        "Figure 1 represents an interlingual database that links monolingual resources in three languages: French, English and Japanese.",
        "The interlingual acceptions (axies) are linked to lexies from each language.",
        "For instance, a lexie for the French word “terre” is linked through an axie to two lexies for the English words “earth” and “soil” and to a lexie for the Japanese word “tsuchi”.",
        "Note that an axie can be refined into a set of axies.",
        "For instance, a lexie for the English word “chair” is linked through axie1 to two lexies for the French words “fauteuil” and “chaise”.",
        "Axie1 can be refined into two axies axie11 and axie12 as illustrated in figure 2.",
        "This pivot macrostructure has been defined by (Serasset, 1994) and experimented by (Blanc, 1999) in the PARAX mockup.",
        "The mi-crostructure of the monolingual dictionaries is the “DiCo” structure, which is a simplification of Mel’cuk’s (Mel’cuk et al., 1995) DEC (Explanatory-Combinatorial Dictionary) designed by Polguere & Mel’cuk (Polguere, 2000) to make it possible to construct large, detailed and principled dictionaries in tractable time.",
        "The building method of the Papillon lexical database is based on one hand on 1) reusing existing lexical resources, and on the other hand on 2) contributions of volunteers working through Internet.",
        "In order to automate the first step, we have developed Jeminie (cf. section 2), a",
        "flexible software system that helps create (semi) automatically interlingual lexical databases.",
        "As there are several possible techniques for the creation of axies that can be implemented in Jeminie, it is necessary to evaluate and compare these techniques to understand their strengths and weaknesses and to identify possible improvements.",

        "The second function of Jeminie is to automatically link lexies that have the same sense into axies.",
        "The prominent feature of Jeminie is the ability to arbitrarily combine several axie creation techniques (Teeraparbseree, 2003).",
        "An axie creation technique is an algorithm that creates axies to link a set of existing lexies.",

        "By analogy, one can define a golden standard multilingual lexical database to compare to a database generated by a system such as Jeminie, that both contain axies that link to lexies in the same monolingual databases.",
        "Considering that two axies are the same if they contain links to exactly the same lexies, the quality of a machine generated multilingual lexical database would then be measured with two metrics adapted from machine translation system evaluation (Ahrenberg et al., 2000): recall and precision.",
        "Recall (coverage) is the number of axies that are defined in both the generated database and in the golden standard database, divided by the number of axies in the golden standard.",
        "Precision is the number of axies that are defined in both the generated database and in the golden standard database, divided by the number of axies in the generated database.",
        "However, (Aimelet et al., 1999) highlighted the limits of the golden standard approach, as it is often difficult to manually produce precise reference resources.",
        "In the context of the Papillon project, a golden standard multilingual lexical database would deal with nine languages (English, French, German, Japanese, Lao, Thai, Malay, Vietnamese and Chinese), which makes it extremely difficult to produce.",
        "Furthermore, since the produced multilingual lexical database in Papillon will define at least 40000 axies, using heterogeneous resources, a comparison with a typical golden standard of only 100 axies seems not relevant.",

        "This metrics should be calculated for each language independently, because the number of lexies may significantly vary between two languages, making this metrics irrelevant if calculated using the total number of lexies and axies in a database.",

        "We have proposed a taxonomy of criteria for the automatic evaluation of a MLDB.",
        "One criteria alone is not sufficient to significantly evaluate the quality of a whole database.",
        "We therefore propose a method for the arbitrary composition of evaluation criteria, following the same principles as the Jeminie system.",
        "The proposed method will be implemented in a software framework, along with a library of modules that implement a variety of evaluation criteria, and that can be freely composed.",
        "This framework will be integrated with Jeminie, in order to allow for the automatic evaluation of a MLDB during its creation."
