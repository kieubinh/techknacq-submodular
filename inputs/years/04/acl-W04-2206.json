        "Recently, deep linguistic processing, which aims to provide a useful semantic representation, has become the focus of more research, as parsing technologies improve in both speed and robustness (Uszkoreit, 2002).",
        "In particular, machine translation systems still mainly rely on large hand-crafted lexicons.",
        "The knowledge acquisition bottleneck, however, remains: precise grammars need information-rich lexicons, such as valency dictionaries, which are costly to build and extend.",
        "In this paper, we present a method of adding new entries to an existing bilingual valency dictionary, using information about verbal alternations.",
        "The classic approach to acquiring lexical information is to build resources by hand.",
        "This produces useful resources but is expensive.",
        "This is still the approach taken by large projects such as FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) or OntoSem.",
        "Therefore, there is a need to extend these handmade resources quickly and economically.",
        "Another approach is to attempt to learn information from corpora.",
        "There has been much research based on this, but due to the inevitable errors, there are few examples of lexicons being constructed fully automatically.",
        "Korhonen (2002) reports that the ceiling on the performance of monolingual subcategorization acquisition from corpora is generally around 80%, a level that still requires manual intervention.",
        "Yet another approach is to combine knowledge sources: for example to build a lexicon and then try to extend it using corpus data or to enrich monolingual data using multilingual lexicons (Fujita and Bond, 2002).",
        "The aim of this research is not to create a lexicon from scratch, but rather to add further entries to an existing lexicon.",
        "We propose a method of acquiring detailed information about predicates, including argument structure, semantic restrictions on the arguments and translation equivalents.",
        "It combines two heterogeneous knowledge sources: an existing bilingual valency lexicon (the seed lexicon), and information about verbal alternations.",
        "Most verbs have more than one possible argument structure (subcat).",
        "These can be regularized into pairs of alternations, where two argument structures link similar semantic roles into different subcats.",
        "Levin (1993) has identified over 80 alternation types for English, and these have been extended to cover 4,432 verbs in 492 classes (Dorr, 1997).",
        "In this paper, we will consider alternations between transitive (Vt) and intransitive (Vi) uses of verbs, where the subject of the intransitive verb (S) is the same as the object of the transitive verb (O) (e.g. the acid dissolved the metal <---> the metal dissolved (in the acid)) (Levin, 1993, 26–33)).",
        "We call the subject of the transitive verb A (ergative) and this alternation the S=O alternation.",
        "Figure 1 shows a simplified example of an alternating pair in a bilingual valency dictionary (the valency lexicon from the Japanese-to-English machine translation system ALT-J/E (Ikehara et al., 1991)).",
        "This includes the subcategorization frame and selectional restrictions.",
        "As shown in Figure 1, Japanese, unlike English, typically morphologically marks the transitivity alternation.",
        "We chose the S=O alternation because it is one",
        "of the most common types of alternations, making up 34% of those discovered by Bond et al.",

        "Exploiting the machine translation lexicon for linguistic research, we compare the SRs of S with both A and O for verbs that take the S=O alternation.",

        "In this case, we further classified the SRs which are identical into “0 (Same)”.",
        "For example, in Figure 1, the MD between S and O is “0 (Same)” because they have the same SR: (stuff).",
        "The MD between A and S is two because the shortest path from (artifact) to (stuff) traverses two links (artifact C inanimate C stuff ).2 Figure 2 shows the MD between O and S, and A and S. The selectional restrictions are very similar for O and S. 30.1% have identical SRs, distance is zero for 27.5% and distance one is 28.3%.",
        "However, for A and S, the most common case is distance one (26.7%) and then distance two (21.5%).",
