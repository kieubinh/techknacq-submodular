        "It is now an aknowledged fact that parallel corpora, i.e. corpora made of texts in one language and their translation in another language, are well suited in particular to cope with the problem of the construction of bilingual resources such as bilingual lexicons or terminologies.",
        "Several works have focused on the alignment of units which are smaller than a sentence, for instance words or phrases, as to produce bilingual word, phrase or term associations.",
        "A common assumption is that the alignment of words or phrases raises a real challenge, since it is “neither one-to-one, nor sequential, nor compact”, and thus “the correspondences are fuzzy and contextual” (Debili, 1997).",
        "Indeed, it is even often diffult for a human to determine which source unit correspond to which target unit within aligned sentences (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "Most alignment systems working on parallel corpora rely on statistical models, in particular the EM ones (Brown, Della Pietra and Mercer, 1993).",
        "Quite recently attempts have been made in order to incorporate different types of linguistic information sources into word and phrase alignment systems.",
        "The idea is to take into account the specific problems arising from the alignment at the word or phrase level mentioned in particular by Debili (1997).",
        "Different types of linguistic knowledge are exploited: morphological, lexical and syntactic ones.",
        "In the method described in this article, the syntactic information is the kernel of the alignment process.",
        "Indeed, syntactic relations identified on both sides of the French/English parallel corpus with a deep and robust parser are used to find out new correspondences between words or to confirm existing ones in order to achieve a high accuracy alignment.",

        "Two kinds of methods have been basically proposed in order to address the problem of bilingual lexicon extraction.",
        "On the one hand, terms are recognized in both source and target language and then they are mapped to each other (Daille, Gaussier and Langé, 1994).",
        "On the other hand, only source terms are extracted and the target ones are discovered through the alignment process (Gaussier, 1998; Hull, 2001).",
        "The alignment between terms is obtained either by computing association probabilities (Gaussier, 1998 ; Daille, Gaussier and Langé, 1994) or by identifying, for a given source term, a sequence of words in the target language which is likely to contain or to correspond to its translation (Hull, 2001).",
        "In so far as the precision rate may be affected by the number of alignments obtained (Daille, Gaussier and Langé, 1994; Gaussier, 1998), the results achieved basically range between 80% and 90%, for the first 500 alignments.",
        "As for the method described in (Hull, 2001), the precison reported is 56%.",
        "It should be noticed that the use of linguistic knowledge is most of the time restricted to the term recognition stage.",
        "This kind of knowledge is quite rarely taken into account within the very alignment process, except for the approach implemented by Daille, Gaussier and Langé (1994), which try to take advantage of correspondences between the syntactic patterns defined for each language."

        "Various and more or less complex sources of linguistic knowledge are exploited: morphological, lexical (Arhenberg, Andersson and Merkel, 2000) and syntactic knowledge (Wu, 2000; Lin and Cherry, 2003).",
        "The contribution of these information sources to the alignment process with respect to the statistical data varies according to the considered system.",
        "However, as pointed out by Arhenberg, Andersson and Merkel (2000) as well as Lin and Cherry (2003), the introduction of linguistic knowledge leads to a significant improvement in alignment quality.",
        "In the first case, the accuracy goes from 91% for a baseline configuration up to 96.7% for a linguistic knowledge based one.",
        "In the second, the precision rate is increased from 82.7% up to 89.2% and the improvement noticed have been confirmed within the framework of an evaluation task (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 20003).",
        "For our part, we propose a method in which the syntactic information plays a major role in the alignment process, since syntactic relations are used to find out new correspondences between words or to confirm the existent ones.",
        "We chose this approach in order to achieve a high accuracy alignment both at word and phrase level.",
        "Indeed, we aim at capturing frequent alignments between words and phrases as well as those involving sparse or corpus specific ones.",
        "Moreover, as stressed in previous works, using syntactic dependencies seems to be particularly well suited to solve n-to-1 or n-to-m alignments (Fluhr, Bisson and Elkateb, 2000) and to cope with the problem of linguistic variation and non correspondence across languages, for instance when aligning terms (Gaussier, 2001)."
