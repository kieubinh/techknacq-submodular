        "The JMdict project has as its primary goal the compilation of a Japanese-multilingual dictionary, i.e. a dictionary in which the headwords are from the Japanese lexicon, and the translations are in several other languages.",
        "It may be viewed as a synthesis of a series of Japanese-Other Language bilingual dictionaries, although, as discussed below, there is merit in having this information collocated.",
        "The project grew out of, and has now subsumed, an earlier Japanese-English dictionary project (EDICT: Electronic Dictionary) (Breen, 1995, 2004a).",
        "With Japanese being an important language in world trade, and with it being the second most common language used on the WWW, it is not surprising that there is considerable interest in electronic lexical resources for Japanese in combination with other languages."

      "heading": "2 Project Goals and Development",
      "text": [
        "As mentioned above, the JMdict project grew out of the bilingual EDICT dictionary project.",
        "The EDICT project began in the early 1990s with a relatively simple goal of producing a Japanese-English dictionary file that could be used in basic software packages to provide traditional dictionary services, as well as facilities to assist reading Japanese text.",
        "The format was (and is) quite simple, comprising lines of text consisting of a Japanese word written using kanji and/or kana, the reading (pronunciation) of that word in kana, and one or more English translations.",
        "By the late 1990s, the file had outgrown its humble origins, having reached over 50,000 entries, and having spun off a parallel project for recording Japanese proper nouns (see below).",
        "The material has partly been drawn from word lists, vocabulary lists, etc.",
        "in the public domain, and supplemented by material prepared by large numbers of users and other volunteers wishing to contribute.",
        "While it had been used in a variety of software systems, and as a source of lexical material in a number of projects, it was clear that its structure was quite inadequate for the lexical demands being made by users.",
        "In particular, it was not able to incorporate a suitable variety of information, nor represent the orthographical complexities of the source language.",
        "Accordingly, in 1999 it was decided to launch a new dictionary project incorporating the information from the EDICT file, but expanded to include translations from other languages with the Japanese entries remaining as the pivots.",
        "The project goals were: a. a file format, preferably using a recognized standard, which would enable ready access and parsing by a variety of software applications; b. the handling of orthographical and pronunciation variation within the single entry.",
        "This addressed a major problem with the EDICT format, as many Japanese words can be written with alternative kanji and with varying portions in kana (okurigana), and may have alternative pronunciations.",
        "The EDICT format required each variant to be treated as a separate entry, which added to the complexity of maintaining and extending the dictionary; c. additional and more appropriately associated tagging of grammatical and other information.",
        "Certain information such as the part of speech or the source language of loan words had been added to the EDICT file in parentheses within the translation fields, but the scope was limited and the information could not easily be parsed; d. provision for differentiation between different senses in the translations.",
        "While basic indication of polysemy had been provided in the EDICT file by prepending (1), (2), etc.",
        "to groups of translations, the result was difficult to parse.",
        "Also it did not support the case where a sense or nuance was tied to a particular pronunciation, as occurs occasionally in Japanese; e. provision for the inclusion of translational equivalents from several languages.",
        "The EDICT dictionary file was being used in a number of countries, and several informal projects had begun to develop equivalent files for Japanese and other target languages.",
        "A small Japanese-German file (JDDICT) had been released in the EDICT format.",
        "There was considerable interest expressed in having translations in various languages collocated to enable such things as having a single reference file for several languages, cross-referencing of entries, cross-language retrieval, etc.",
        "as well as acting as a focus for the possible development of translations for as yet unrepresented languages; f. provision for inclusion of examples of the usage of words.",
        "As the file expanded, many users of the file requested some form of usage examples to be associated with the words in the file.",
        "The EDICT format was not capable of supporting this;",
        "g. provision for cross-references to related entries;",
        "h. continued generation of EDICT-format files.",
        "As a large number of packages and servers had been built around the EDICT format, continued provision of content in this format was considered important, even if the information only contained a subset of what was available.",
        "An early decision was to use XML (Extensible Markup Language) as a format for the JMdict file, as this was expected to provide the appropriate flexibility in format, and was also expected to be supported by applications, parsing libraries, etc.",
        "An examination was made of other available dictionary formats to ascertain if a suitable formatting model was available.",
        "It was known that commercial dictionary publishers has well-structured databases of lexical information, and some were moving to XML, but none of the details were available.",
        "A large number of bilingual dictionary files and word lists were in the public domain; however in general they only used very simple structures, and none could be found which covered all the content requirements of the project.",
        "The dictionary section of the TEI (Text Encoding Initiative), which at the time of writing has a well-developed document structure for bilingual dictionaries, was at that stage quite limited (Sperberg-McQueen et al., 1999).",
        "Accordingly, an XML DTD (Document Type Definition) was developed which was tailored to the requirements of the project.",
        "The EDICT file was parsed and reformatted into the JMdict structure, and at the same time, many of the orthographical variants were identified and merged.",
        "The initial release of the DTD and XML-format file took place in May 1999.",
        "At that stage, it contained the English translations from the EDICT file and the German translations from the JDDICT file.",
        "As described below, it has been expanded considerably since then, both in terms of number of entries and also in multilingual coverage."

        "The file now has over 99,300 entries, i.e. the size of a medium-large printed dictionary, and the growth in numbers of entries is now relatively slow, with most updates dealing with corrections and expansion of existing entries.",
        "The file is available under a liberal licence that allows its use for almost any purpose without fee.",
        "The only requirement is that its use be fully acknowledged and that any files developed from it continue under the same licence conditions."

    {
      "heading": "4 Structure",
      "text": [
        "The JMdict XML structure contains one element type: <entry>, which in turn contains sequence number, kanji word, kana word, information and translation elements.",
        "The sequence number is used for maintenance and identification.",
        "The kanji word and kana word elements contain the two forms of the Japanese headwords; the former is used for representations containing at least one kanji character, while the latter is for representations in kana alone.",
        "The kana word is effectively the pronunciation, but is also an important key for indexing the dictionary file, as Japanese dictionaries are usually ordered by kana words.",
        "The minimum content of these fields is a single word in the kana word element.",
        "In addition, each entry may contain information about the words (unusual orthographical variant, archaic kanji, etc.)",
        "and frequency of use information.",
        "The latter needs to be associated with the actual words rather than the entry as a whole because some combinations of kanji and kana words are used more frequently than others.",
        "(For example, V'X� and V �� are orthographical variants of the one word (aikidô), but the former is more common.)",
        "The kana used in the elements follows modern Japanese orthography, i.e. hiragana is used for native Japanese words, and katakana for loan words, onomatopoeic words, etc.",
        "In most cases an entry has just one kanji and one kana word (approx.",
        "75%), or one kana word alone (15%).",
        "In about 10% of entries there are multiple words in one of the elements.",
        "In some cases a kana reading can only be associated with a subset of the kanji words in the entry.",
        "For example, soyokaze (7c �7) 1T: breeze) can be written either ,(� or 7c � � (the latter is more common as 7c � is a non-standard reading of the ,( kanji).",
        "However ,(JAI, can also be pronounced bifuu (��5 ) with the same meaning, but clearly this pronunciation cannot be associated with the 7c � � form, as the kana portion is read \"soyo \".",
        "XML does not provide an elegant method for indicating a restricted mapping between portions of two elements, so when such a restriction is required, additional tags are used with each kana word supplying the kanji word with which it may be validly associated.",
        "The information element contains general information about the Japanese word or the entry as a whole.",
        "The contents allow for ISO-639 source language codes (for loan words), dialect codes, etymology, bibliographic information and update details.",
        "The translation area consists of one or more sense elements that contain at a minimum a single gloss.",
        "Associated with each sense is a set of elements containing part of speech, cross-reference, synonym/antonym, usage, etc.",
        "information.",
        "Also associated with the sense may be restriction codes tying the sense to a subset of the Japanese words.",
        "For example, *'X can be pronounced suiki (t��) and mizuge (�� �); both meaning \"moisture\", but the former alone can also mean \"dropsy\".",
        "The gloss element has an attribute stating the target language of the translation.",
        "In its absence it is assumed the gloss is in English.",
        "There is also an attribute stating the gender, if for example, the part-of-speech is a noun and the gloss is in a language with gendered nouns.",
        "Figure 1 shows a slightly simplified example of an entry.",
        "The <ke_pri> and <re_pri> elements indicate the word is a member of a particular set of common words.",
        "The potential to have multiple kanji and kana words within an entry brings attention to the issues of homonymy, homography and polysemy, and the policies for handling these, in particular the criteria for combining kanji and kana words into a single entry.",
        "As Japanese has a comparatively limited set of phonemes there are a large number of homophonous words.",
        "For example, over twenty different words have the kana representation :5 � 1 5 (kojo).",
        "If we regard homography as only applying to words written wholly or partly with kanji, there are relatively few cases of it, however they do exist, e.g. M� when read -tl-Iv � � 5 (senryû) means a comic poem, but when read 7)>tD�4 � (kawayanagi) means a variety of willow tree.",
        "The combining rule that has been applied in the compilation of the JMdict file is as follows:",
        "a. treat each basic entry as a triplet consisting of: kanji representation, matching kana representation, senses; b. if for any basic entries two or more members of the triplet are the same, combine them into the one entry;",
        "i. if the entries differ in kanji or kana representation, include these as alternative forms; ii.",
        "if the entries differ in sense, treat as a case of polysemy; c. in other cases leave the entries separate.",
        "This rule has been applied successfully in a majority of cases.",
        "The main problems arise where the meanings are similar or related, as in the case of the entries: (;Wt, N:4 t, to separate; to set free; to turn loose) and (0t, N:4 t, to part; to divide; to separate), where the kana words are the same and the meanings overlap.",
        "Japanese dictionaries are divided on ;Wt and 0t; some keeping them as separate entries, and others having them as the one entry with two main senses.",
        "(The two words derive from a common source.)",
        "5 Parts of Speech and Related Issues The omission of such derived forms means that care needs to be taken when constructing the translations so that the user is readily able to identify the appropriate translation of one of the derived forms.",
        "As languages differ in their parts of speech (POS), the recording of those details in bilingual dictionaries can be a problem (Al-Kasimi, 1977).",
        "Traditionally bilingual dictionaries involving Japanese avoid recording any POS information, leaving it to the user to deduce that information from the translation and examples (if any).",
        "In the early stages of the EDICT project, POS information was deliberately kept to a minimum, e.g. indicating where a verb was transitive or intransitive when this was not apparent from the translation, mainly to conserve storage space.",
        "As there are a number of advantages in having POS information marked in an electronic dictionary file, a POS element was included in the JMdict structure, and publicly available POS classifications were used to populate much of the file.",
        "About 30% of entries remain to be classified; mostly nouns or short noun phrases.",
        "In the interests of saving space an early decision had been made to avoid listing derived forms of words.",
        "For example, the Japanese adjective AU` (takai) meaning \"high, tall, expensive\" has derived forms of A � (takasa) \"height\" and A < (takaku) \"highly\".",
        "As this process is very regular, many Japanese dictionaries do not carry entries for the derived forms, and some bilingual dictionaries follow suit.",
        "Another such example is the common verb form, sometimes called a \"verbal noun\", which is created by adding the verb t;5 (suru) \"to do\" to appropriate nouns.",
        "The verb \"to study\" is O N t ;5 (benkyosuru) where ON is a noun meaning \"study\" in this context.",
        "Again, Japanese dictionaries often do not include these forms as headwords, preferring to indicate in the body of an entry that the formation is possible.",
        "In a multilingual context, the omission of derived forms can have other problems.",
        "The recording of t;5 verbs only in their noun base form has been reported to lead to some discomfort among German users, as German language orthographical convention capitalizes the first letters of nouns but not verbs (the WaDokuJT file has t;5 verbs as separate entries for this reason)."

        "As mentioned above, part of the interest in having entries with translations in a range of languages came from the compilation of a number of dictionary files based on or similar to the EDICT file.",
        "There are a number of issues associated with the inclusion of material from other dictionary files, in particular those relating to the compilation policies: coverage, handling of inflected forms, etc.",
        "(Breen, 2002) There is also the major issue of the editing and maintenance of the material, which has the potential to become more complex as each language is incorporated.",
        "The approach taken with JMdict has been to: a. maintain a core Japanese-English file with a well-documented structure and set of inclusion and editing policies; b. encourage the development and maintenance of equivalent files in other languages paired with Japanese, which can draw on the JMdict/EDICT material as required; c. periodically build the complete multilingual JMdict from the different components.",
        "This approach has proved successful in that it has separated the compilation of the file from the ongoing editing of the components, and has left the latter in the hands of those with the skills and motivation to perform the task.",
        "At the time of writing, the JMdict file has over 99,300 entries (Japanese and English), of which 83,500 have German translations, 58,000 have French translations, 4,800 have Russian translations and 530 have Dutch translations.",
        "A set of approximately 4,500 Spanish translations is being prepared, with the prospects that some 20,000 will be available shortly.",
        "The major sources of these additional translations are: a. French translations from two projects: i. approximately 17,500 entries have come from the Dictionnaire français japonais Project (Desperrier, 2002), a project to translate the most common Japanese words from the EDICT File into French; ii.",
        "a further 40,5001i entries drawn from the TLS 3497' p I'0i (French-Japanese Complementation Project) at http://francais.sourceforge.jp/ (This project is also based on the EDICT file.)",
        "b. German translations from the WaDokuJT Project (Apel, 2002).",
        "This is a large file of over 300,000 entries; however, unlike JMdict it includes many phrases, proper nouns and inflected forms of verbs, etc.",
        "The overlap of coverage with JMdict is quite high, leading to the large number of entries that have been included in the JMdict file.",
        "One of the issues that can lead to problems when incorporating translations from other project files is that of aligning the translations when an entry has several senses.",
        "In the case of the French translations, the project coordinator has marked the translations of polysemous entries with a sense code, thus enabling the translations to be inserted correctly when compiling the final file.",

        "In practice, a quite different approach has been taken.",

        "This strategy, which required the corpus to be parsed to extract a set of index words for each sentence, has proved effective at the application level.",
