        "This paper describes a bilingual sign language dictionary (Japanese Sign Language and American Sign Language) that can help people learn each sign language directly from their mother sign language.",
        "Our discussion covers two main points.",
        "The first describes the necessity for a bilingual dictionary.",
        "Since there is no \"universal sign language\", or real \"international sign language,\" deaf people would need to learn at least four languages if they want to talk to people whose mother tongue is different from their own: their mother sign language, their mother spoken language (as an intermediate language), the target spoken language, and the sign language fot the language in which they wish to communicate.",
        "The two spoken languages become language barriers for deaf people, and our bilingual dictionary will remove these barriers.",
        "The second describes the use of computers.",
        "As the use of computers becomes more widespread, it has become more convenient to study using computer software and/or the Internet facilities.",
        "Our dictionary system provides deaf people with an easy means of access using their mother-sign language so that they don't have to overcome the barrier of learning the target-spoken language.",
        "It also provides a way for people who are going to learn two sign languages to look up new vocabulary.",
        "Further, we plan to examine how our dictionary system could be used to educate and assist deaf people."

      "heading": "1 Introduction",
      "text": [
        "Nowadays many deaf people have an opportunity to study abroad and to learn a foreign language.",
        "But there are three barriers they must overcome to acquire the target sign language: the first barrier is their mother-spoken language; the second is the target-spoken language; and, the last is the target-sign language.",
        "Generally, deaf people are bilingual since they have to learn their mother-spoken language and its sign language.",
        "In the United States, many universities offer American Sign Language(ASL) as a second foreign language.",
        "It is recognized as an independent languages in the U.S.",
        "In Japan, Japanese Sign Language(JSL) has not yet been recognized as an independent language.",
        "One of the main purposes of our dictionary is to remove these language barriers and help deaf people improve their sign language abilityies based on their spoken language(Japanese or English)[Suzuld E., and Kakihana K 20021."

      "text": [
        "American Sign Language (ASL) is a complex visual â€“ spatial language, used by the deaf community in the United States and English-speaking parts of Canada (Nakamura (1)).",
        "The number of ASL users is almost five-hundred thousand.",
        "It is the native language of many hearing-impaired people, as well as some hearing children born into deaf families The ASL is derived from the Native American sign language, with some words taken from French sign language.",
        "ASL shares no grammatical similarities to English and should not be considered in any way to be a broken, mimed, or gestural form of English.",
        "In terms of syntax, for example, ASL uses topic-comment syntax, while English uses subject-verb-object."

    {
      "heading": "2.2 Japanese Sign Language (JSL)",
      "text": [
        "There are two main sign languages in Japan: \"Japanese sign language,\" and \"Japanese oral sign language.\"",
        "The former is used by deaf people, and the latter is mainly used by volunteers.",
        "It is a type of pidgin-signed Japanese, often used in formal situations, lectures, and speeches.",
        "The main difference between the two is the sequence of the words.",
        "Japanese sign language syntax is like spoken English, using subject-verb-object, whereas Japanese oral sign language syntax is like spoken Japanese, using subject-object-verb.",
        "In this paper, since we will only discuss the sign language word dictionary and not with syntax, we will use the acronym \"JSL\" to refer to both Japanese sign languages."

    {
      "heading": "2.3 Language Selection",
      "text": [
        "As previously mentioned in terms of syntax, ASL has more in common with spoken Japanese than with English.",
        "For example, in spoken English, they say \"What is your name?\"",
        "and ASL signs \"name\"+\"what\".",
        "This word order is identical to oral Japanese.",
        "On the other hand, in JSL, the word order is \"what\"+\"name\" which is more like spoken English.",
        "That is one of the main reasons for us to focus on ASL as a bilingual dictionary.",
        "Another reason is that ASL is the fourth most commonly used language in the U.S.A. We assume that it is easier than learning another sign language for those who already know Japanese sign language (JSL) and are planning to learn a second sing language(Nakamura (2)).",
        "Further, according to some TV programs and newspaper reports, JSL is becoming more popular among Japanese recently.",
        "Therefore we decided to provide a bilingual dictionary for those who wish to learn JSL and ASL."

        "These on-line dictionaries are easy to access by searching an Internet dictionary site.",
        "Almost all of there digital dictionaries illustrate signs using cartoon-animations and not human gestures.",
        "We tried to make two types of dictionaries, and decided that the animations were more difficult to understand than human gestures especially by beginners.",
        "On the other hand, people who have been learning the sign language for a long time might be able to understand animated sign languages."

      "text": [
        "Almost all of these digital dictionaries are for the people who can read and write their mother language fluently and not for those who have a disability with their mother tongue.",
        "The mother tongue for those who were born deaf is sign language, especially for those born into a deaf family On the other hand, the main language for those who were born deaf but whose parents are not deaf is the parents' spoken language.",
        "The problem for these deaf children is that it is difficult for them to learn their spoken language in their country.",
        "Since their parents use their spoken language and have become used to using sign language for their child, a child who is deaf must learn at least two languages.",
        "When they want to or have to learn a foreign language, the foreign language becomes the second foreign language.",
        "The target sign language then, becomes their third one.",
        "Sign language is believed to help those who want to communicate with people who have another mother tongue.",
        "We think that the second sign language helps deaf people to communicate with each other without learning the target-spoken language.",
        "We believe that our digital dictionary will remove the bathers for the deaf to learn another foreign language.",
        "The users can choose the language (Japanese or English) when they want to search for signed words.",
        "They select the word from their favourite language and just look for it in the index.",
        "Our dictionary shows both Japanese and American sign languages with moving pictures taken from three directions."

        "For example, if Japanese is selected, the first characters of the indices are arranged in dictionary order (Fig.",
        "4).",
        "While using Japanese to search the dictionary, the user can check the equivalent English words and ASL.",
        "Thus, they can learn spoken English and ASL simultaneously as shown in Fig. 5.",

        "Each are explained in Japanese and English and the example sentences are in Japanese and English.",

        "As mentioned earlier, the word order in ASL is from general to specific and from large to small, similar to the Japanese language.",
        "This results in easier learning of each language.",
