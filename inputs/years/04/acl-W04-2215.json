        "This requires powerful tools to manage multilingual documents.",
        "Current techniques for handling multilingual documents use large-grained linking (at the level of HTML pages), but don't allow fine-grained synchronization (at paragraph or sentence level) and don't permit bilingual or multilingual editing through the Web.",
        "The interest to synchronize at least at the level of sentences is double: 0 make it possible to use Machine Aided Human Translation (MAHT) techniques, in particular translation memories, for translating and postediting multilingual documents.",
        "0 add UNL tags at sentence level to store the translations as well as UNL hypergraphs (anglosemantic interlingual representations), from which raw (or rough!)",
        "translations into other languages can be obtained from distant \"deconversion\" servers.",
        "Here, we are not concerned with the problem of aligning parallel monolingual documents, or realigning them after they have been modified, a frequent need in the case of leaflets and booklets.",
        "(Assimi,2000) proposed a tool to handle the non-centralized management of the evolution of multilingual parallel documents.",
        "We consider the case, frequent in the industry, where documents are managed centrally, even if they are distributed on several sites.",
        "What happens in general is that they are aligned at the level of large blocks, with one file per block and language (fileXXX.en.htm, fileXXX.fr.htm etc.",
        "for HTML pages).",
        "What we propose is to align them at the level of sentences, but of course not to have one file per sentence.",

        "Then, they are assembled (CPXM.dtd) to visualize them in parallel through the web.",
        "In a third stage, they are put in a Multilingual Polyphraz Memory (MPM).",
        "A \"polyphrase\" is a structure containing an original sentence and various proposals of equivalent sentences, in the same and other languages.",
        "An MPM stores one or more corpora of polyphrazes.",
        "The MPM part of PolyphraZ has 3 main web interfaces.",
        "One is a web-oriented translator workstation (TWS), where suggestions or translations come from the MPM itself, which functions as its own translation memory, and from calls to MT systems.",
        "Another serves to send sentences to MT systems with appropriate parameters, and to run various evaluation measures (NIST, BLEU, and distance computations) in order to propose to the translator a \"best\" proposal.",
        "A third interface is planned for giving feedbacks to the developers of the MT systems, in the form of lists of unknown or wrongly translated words, with suggestions for correct translations, and of parallel presentation of pairs of translations showing the \"editing work\" to be done to get one from the other.",
        "The first 2 stages are operational, and used for experimentation and MT evaluation on the CSTAR 5-lingual BTEC corpus and on the Japanese-English Tanaka corpus used as a source of examples in electronic dictionaries (JDict, Papillon).",

        "A more recent motivation is to extend the BTEC corpus of CSTAR III (163000 sentences in tourism) to French and Arabic, and to evaluate various Chinese-English MT systems on it.",

        "It contains sentences of newspapers or teaching works of NHK for the training of English by the Japanese.",
        "Each file is bilingual.",
        "We have also corpora from the UNL project, where each document is a multilingual file containing for each sentence its text in source language, a UNL graph, the result of deconversions in a certain number of languages, and possibly their revisions, or direct manual translations.",
        "All these \"parallel\" corpora are aligned at the level of sentences.",
        "As it would be interesting to show correspondences at finer levels (syntagms, chunks, words), we design PolyphraZ to later add tools for subsential alignement such as the one developed by Ch.",
        "Chenon for his Ph.D.",
        "In other corpora, we may be obliged to go up to the level of paragraphs, because sentences will not be aligned perfectly.",
        "That will not be done completely in PolyphraZ, but at the level of the structure of the multilingual document itself: if 2 sentences are translated by 3, each of the 5 sentences will be in a different polyphrase, with their individual translations, and there will be another polyphrase, of \"n-m\" type, to contain the 2 complete segements.",
        "The first problem we encounter with the available parallel corpora it is that there is no tool to visualize their contents at a glance, sentence by sentence, nor to show the fine correspondences between subsentential segments.",
        "In addition, in the case of UNL documents, we cannot visualize at the same time a sentences in several languages and its corresponding UNL graph.",
        "Lastly, it is not possible to see successive versions in parallel.",
        "When it comes to evaluation, we can only see the monolingual files, and associated statistical measurements (NIST, BLEU...), but we can never confront them with the real translations and make a direct subjective evaluation."
