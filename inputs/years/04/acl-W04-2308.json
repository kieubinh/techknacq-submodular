        "Human-human communication is not fluent, problems that must be solved arise continuously.",
        "Similar problems occur in human-computer interaction.",
        "Several branches of linguistics study how to solve communication problems: discourse analysis, psycholinguistics, foreign language learning, conversation analysis, dialogue modelling on the computer and determining dialogue acts (Allen, Core, 1997; Linell, 1998; Bunt, 1999; Traum, 1999; Allwood et al.",
        "2001; O'Brien, 2002).",
        "Similar phenomena are called differently: structure shifts, feedback, grounding, repair, communication strategies.",
        "There are at least the following difficulties with these treatments:",
        "1) repair is considered together with other dialogue management acts and not as a separate phenomenon as it is in natural conversation 2) different means of repair are considered instead of repair as a process and sequence 3) non-natural utterances are used in dialogue systems for repairs (To Paris, is that correct?",
        "/ I don't quite understand )",
        "To overcome these problems, we analyse repair using the methods of the conversation analysis (Sche-gloff et al. 1977).",
        "There are 4 kinds of repairs differenced in CA: self-initiated self-repair, other-initiated self-repair, self-initiated other-repair, other-initiated other-repair.",
        "All the repairs analyzed in this paper are other-initiated self-repairs.",
        "We differentiate three subtypes here: clarification (45 cases), non-understanding (7), and reformulation (27).",
        "We have analyzed calls for information (asking phone numbers, addresses etc.",
        "), and calls to travel bureaus, shops and outpatients' departments.",
        "The analysed sub-corpus consists of 62 dialogues; 2472 dialogue act tags were used in our sub-corpus, among them 79 repair initiations (about dialogue acts see Hennoste et al. 2003)."
