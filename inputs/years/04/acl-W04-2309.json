        "In this paper, we will continue investigation into Denial of Expectation (DofE) across turns in dialogue when signalled by “but”, following work by Thomas and Mathe-son (2003), and claim that these denied expectations need not be causal only.",
        "That is, we investigate two hypotheses: (1), that “but” can deny noncausal relations across turns in dialogue, e.g., temporal ordering relations, and (2) that because “but” is a negative polarity cue (Sanders et al., 1993), it inverts normal relations, and we will need to invert DofE dialogues in order to investigate the relations underlying the original (not denied) expectations.",
        "To this end, we motivate the argument that these denied expectations can involve relations other than causal ones licensing the inference from A’s turn to B’s.",
        "We will then outline a novel methodology which utilises linguistic substitution tests on Knott’s (1996) taxonomy of cue phrases to distinguish the underlying expectations denied.",
        "The practical utility of distinguishing these relations arises from discovering ways in which to both represent and utilise this information for NLG (among other applications), so we will address these issues in section 4.",
        "We show how the Information State (IS) (Matheson et al., 2000) representing the state of the dialogue in the PTT (Poesio and Traum, 1998) model of dialogue must be updated to reflect this new information, with Conversational Acts (Matheson et al., 2000) that do not simply indicate DofE as in (Thomas and Matheson, 2003), but also annotate the relation underlying the expectation being denied.",
        "Finally we will demonstrate how a system incorporating this information can improve generation of responses to DofE depending on its model of beliefs regarding the relation underlying the denied expectation in DofE dialogues."

      "heading": "2 Motivation",
      "text": [
        "The main motivation behind modelling cross-turn relations is to get at what expectations and beliefs speakers might have upon interpreting the previous turn in the dialogue.",
        "Inferring the relations speakers perceive in cases where the related material spans speaker turns sheds light on how they interpret the previous speaker’s turn, which in turn enables response generation that can specifically address these implicit relations.",
        "Here we focus on cases involving DofE, where the speaker of the “but” turn in dialogues like Ex.1 below has an expectation that beautiful people marry, where indicates defeasible implication.",
        "(1) Example 1.",
        "A: Greta Garbo was the yardstick of beauty.",
        "B: But she never married.",
        "Thomas and Matheson (2003) argue that B has the expectation that beautiful people (usually) marry, and interpreting A’s utterance triggers this expectation, which B knows does not hold, since he knows that Greta never married, denying the consequent of the rule.",
        "Hence he generates DofE, and depending on A’s beliefs w.r.t.",
        "B’s assertion that Greta never married or the inferred expectation that beautiful people marry that is being denied, she can respond accordingly.",
        "E.g., if she agrees with the assertion but disagrees with the expectation, she can respond “But beautiful people don’t have to marry!” Thomas and Matheson (2003) focus on modelling DofE in Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD).",
        "They present TOD examples like the following,",
        "(2) Example 2.",
        "A: Add the vinegar to the sauce.",
        "B 1: (Yeah) But it’s not tangy enough.",
        "B2: (Yeah) But we forgot to add the mushrooms.",
        "where B 1 involves an expectation similar to the one above involving beautiful people marrying, namely, that adding vinegar makes things tangy, which is a general cause-effect relationship.",
        "However they argue in that paper that B2 involves satisfaction precedence (s.p.)",
        "between adding vinegar and adding mushrooms, namely, that B expects adding mushrooms to be done before adding vinegar.",
        "They then went on to argue that TOD DofE should be distinguished from Nontask-Oriented Dialogue (NTOD) DofE, because of examples like Ex.2B2 above, where the DofE arises from the denial of an ordering of actions in B’s task-plan.",
        "While we do not disagree with their claim that these s.p.",
        "DofEs in TOD (e.g., Ex.2B2) are distinct from causal cases like Ex.2B 1, we disagree that these noncausal cases are unique to TOD; i.e., we argue for a unified treatment of DofE in TOD and NTOD, where, while search methods might differ (i.e., searching task-plans in TOD and private beliefs in NTOD), examples involving noncausal expectations which are denied are not unique to TOD.",
        "Consider the example below:",
        "(3) Example 3.",
        "A: Greta had a child in ’43.",
        "B: But she married in ’47.",
        "here we interpret B’s “but” as signalling the denial of his expectation that marriage (usually) precedes having children in order to coherently interpret his response.",
        "The relation between turns (or antecedent and consequent) here is temporal ordering, and is very similar to the s.p.",
        "in the previous example (Ex.2B2).",
        "Unlike s.p., however, temporal ordering does not require the actions or states that temporally precede the later one to be achieved; i.e., the accomplishment aspect of s.p.",
        "is novel to planning, where goals are posted and accomplished, and there is a sense of agency.",
        "Temporal ordering relates actions, events, states, effects, etc, with no notion of agency involved.",
        "Prior work on DofE has not focussed much on the nature of the relation underlying the denied expectation, and we argue that this information will facilitate much more adaptive and appropriate response generation."

        "Comparing the intersection of feature-values for hyponyms that work in the inverted case to the intersection of feature-values for hyponyms that work in denied case shows precisely which features are being denied.",
        "(c) If Knott’s taxonomy does not provide a category that works for the inverted dialogue, i. check whether any of Knott’s categories fit the original denied expectation by testing which cues are substitutable in the original example; a good place to start is with hyponyms of “but”.",
        "ii.",
        "For cues that work, check their hyponyms to determine the maximally specific set of features that apply to the relation between turns.",

        "More practically speaking, the features are defined in terms of variable bindings and relationships which describe the relations concisely.",

        "If her turn is mapped onto Q, and the prior turn is mapped successfully onto P by matching first-order logic representations of the material in the two turns, then if her turn maps onto Q, we can assume positive polarity; if her turn maps onto a negated Q, then we assume negative polarity.",
        "While mapping speakers’ turns onto the variables which define Knott’s features might be difficult, we can automate some of the feature assignment to update the IS by maintaining an exhaustive (i.e. complete) static table of cue-phrase definitions 2.",
        "This way, once the most specific cue-phrases that work in the inverted and denied expectations are determined, we can automatically assign feature-value-pair bundles to these dialogues which describe the underlying relation being denied.",
