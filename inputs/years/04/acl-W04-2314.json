        "In a natural spoken dialog system, typically, first the speaker’s utterance is recognized using an automatic speech recognizer (ASR).",
        "Then, the intent of the speaker is identified from the recognized sequence, using a spoken language understanding (SLU) component.",
        "This step can be framed as a classification problem for goal-oriented call routing systems (Gorin et al., 2002; Natarajan et al., 2002, among others).",
        "Then, the user would be engaged in a dialog via clarification or confirmation prompts if necessary.",
        "The role of the dialog manager (DM) is to interact in a natural way and help the user to achieve the task that the system is designed to support.",
        "In our case we only consider automated call routing systems where the task is to reach the right route in a large call center, which could be either a live operator or an automated system.",
        "An example dialog from a telephone-based customer care application is given in Figure 1.",
        "Typically the design of such complex systems consists of several manual steps, including analysis of existing IVR (Interactive Voice Response) systems, customer service representative (CSR) interviews, customers’ testimonials, CSR training material, and, when available, human-machine unconstrained speech recordings.",
        "Based on these heterogeneous requirements, the User Experience (UE) expert analyzes and defines by hand the system core functionalities: the system semantic scope (call-types) and the dialog manager strategy which will drive the human-machine interaction.",
        "Once the UE expert designs the system, large amounts of transcribed and labeled speech utterances are needed for building the ASR and SLU models.",
        "In our previous work, we have presented active and unsupervised (or semi-supervised) learning algorithms in order to reduce the amount of labeling effort needed while building ASR and SLU systems (Tur et al., 2003; Tur and Hakkani-T¨ur, 2003; Riccardi and Hakkani-T¨ur, 2003).",

        "As the confidence threshold we have chosen a hypothetical value of 0.3 for all experiments.",
        "As seen, 78.27% classification (or rejection) accuracy is the performance using all training data.",
        "This reduces to 61.73% when we use the ASR output.",
        "This is mostly because of the unrecognized words which are critical for the application.",
        "This is intuitive since ASR language model has not been trained with domain data.",
        "Then we trained a generic model using only generic call-types.",
        "This model has achieved better accuracies as seen in the second row, since we do not expect it to distinguish among the reusable or specific call-types.",
        "Furthermore, for classification accuracy we only use the portion of the test set whose call-types are covered by the model and the call-types in this model are definitely easier than the specific ones.",
        "The drawback is that we only cover about half of the utterances.",
        "Using the ASR output, unlike the in-domain model case, did not hurt much, since the ASR already covers the utterances with generic call-types with great accuracy.",
        "We then trained a bootstrapped model using 13 call-types from the library and a few simple rules written manually for three frequent intents.",
        "Since the library consists of an application from a fairly different domain, we could only exploit intents related to billing, such as Request(Account Balance).",
        "While determining the call-types to write rules, we actually played the expert which has previous knowledge on the application.",
        "This enabled us to increase the coverage to 70.34%.",
        "The most impressive result of these experiments is that, we have got a call classifier which is trained without any in-domain data and can handle most utterances with almost same accuracy as the trained with extensive amounts of data.",
        "Noting the weakness of our current call-type library we expect even better performances as we augment more call-types from ongoing applications."

        "Evaluation of spoken dialog system performances is a complex task and depends on the purpose of the desired dialog metric (Paek, 2001).",
        "While ASR and SLU can be fairly assessed off-line using utterances collected in previous runs of the baseline system, the dialog manager requires interaction with a real motivated user who will cooperate with the system to complete the task.",
        "Ideally, the bootstrap system has to be deployed in the field and the dialogs have to be manually labeled to provide accurate measure of task completion rate.",
        "Usability metrics also require direct feedback from the caller to properly measure the user satisfaction (specifically, task success and dialog cost) (Walker et al., 1997).",
        "However, we are more interested in automatically comparing the bootstrap system performances with a reference system, working on the same domain and with identical dialog strategies.",
        "As a first order of approximation, we reused the 3,082 baseline test dialogs (5,537 utterances) collected by the live reference system and applied the same dialog turn sequence to evaluate the bootstrap system.",
        "According to the reference system call flow, the 97 call-types covered by the reference classifier are clustered into 32 DM categories (DMC).",
        "A DMC is a generalization of more specific intents.",
        "The bootstrap system only classifies 16 call-types and 16 DMC accordingly to the bootstrapping SLU design requirements described in 4.2.",
        "This is only half of the reference system DMC coverage, but it actually addresses 70.34% of the total utterance classification task.",
        "We simulate the execution of the dialog using data collected from a deployed system, with the following proce",
        "dure: for each dialog in the reference data set, we pass the utterance to the bootstrap classifier and select the result with the highest confidence score .",
        "We use two confidence score thresholds, , for acceptance, and , for rejection.",
        "Call-types, whose confidence scores are in between these two thresholds are confirmed.",
        "Then: 1. the dialog is considered as successful if the following condition is verified: where is the acceptance threshold, is the manually labeled reference DM category set for the turn , and is the set of concrete call-types; 2. the dialog is considered as successful with confirmation if the following condition is verified: where is the rejection threshold; 3. if in any turn of the dialog, a mismatching concrete call-type is found, the dialog is considered as unsuccessful: If none of the conditions above are satisfied, we apply steps 1 and 3 with a lower threshold and , assuming that the dialog did not contain any relevant user intention.",
        "A further experiment considers only the final routing destinations (e.g. specific type of agent or the automatic fulfillment system destination).",
        "Both reference and bootstrap systems direct calls to 12 different destinations, implying that a few DM categories are combined into the same destination.",
        "This quantifies how effectively the system routes the callers to the right place in the call center and, conversely, gives some metric to evaluate the missed automation and misrouted calls.",
        "The test has been executed for both transcribed and untranscribed utterances.",
        "Results are shown in Table 5.",
        "Even with a modest 50% DM Categories coverage, the bootstrap system shows an overall task completion of 67.27% in case of transcribed data and 57.39% using the output generated by the bootstrap ASR.",
        "When considering the route destinations, completion increases to 70.67% and 61.84% respectively.",
        "This approach explicitly ignores the dialog context, but it contemplates the call-type categorization, the confirmation mechanism and the final route destination, that would be missed in the SLU evaluation.",
        "Although a more completed evaluation analysis is needed, lower bound results are indicative of the overall performances."
