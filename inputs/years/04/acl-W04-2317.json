        "Communication, between humans or between humans and conversational computer agents, involves addressing.",
        "Addressing has received attention in the tradition of conversation analysis (Clark and Carlson, 1992; Clark and Schaefer, 1992), but not that much in the community of computational dialogue systems.",
        "One exception is (Traum, 2003).",
        "An explanation for this lack of attention may be that most research in computational dialogue systems concerns systems that were designed for interaction between one human user and one conversational agent.",
        "In dialogues in which only two participants take part addressing goes without saying.",
        "Addressing becomes a real issue in multi-party conversations and that is the subject of this paper.",
        "There are a number of application areas that could benefit from studying addressing behavior in human human interactions.",
        "It can provide valuable data for learning more about human interaction and the way humans interact with intelligent environments.",
        "The result can be used by those who develop communicative agents in interactive intelligent environments, meeting managers and presentation assistants.",
        "If we could induce from recorded meetings the ”who said what, when and to whom” we can use this information for making summarizations of meetings, and for real-time tracking.",
        "Research on small group discussions (Carletta et al., 2002) has shown that there is a noticeable difference in the interaction patterns between large and small groups (up to seven participants).",
        "A small group discussion looks like two-way conversations but conversations occur between all pairs of members and every member can initiate conversation.",
        "A large group discussion is more like a series of conversations between a group leader and various individuals with the rest participants present but silent.",
        "We will focus our research on small group discussions in meetings.",
        "In this paper we propose research that aims at the automatic determination of the addressee of a speaker in small meetings.",
        "Analysis of the mechanisms that people use in identifying their addressees leads to a model of a conversation that describes the features that play a role in these mechanisms.",
        "These features can be of several types: verbal, non-verbal, and features of the situation.",
        "Our research is partly based on analysis of the IDIAP multi-modal meeting data corpus made available through the Media File Server 1."

        "One of the question of interest concerning a meeting is: ”Who talked to whom and about what during the meeting?",

        "This question refers to three very important aspects of a conversational event: source of the message (speaker identification), topic of the message (topic detection) and addressee of the message (addressee identification).",

        "The active participants in a conversation include speaker and addressee as well as other participants taking part in conversation but currently not being addressed.",
        "Clark called them side-participants.",
        "All other listeners who have no rights to take part in conversation are called overhearers.",

        "In determining the conversational roles in a meeting situation we will focus on the active participants.",
        "The problem of addressee identification amounts to the problem of distinguishing the addressee from the side participants in a conversation.",

        "Speech is the main communication channel used in the meeting conversation.",
        "Therefore, it is the main source for addressee detection.",
        "The most common heuristics that may guide the addressee recognition process is the search for linguistic markers in the utterance.",
        "Table 1 contains linguistic markers that can be used as cues for addressee detection.",
        "For instance, you is the personal pronoun that refers to the meeting participants excluding the speaker of the utterance.",
        "Usage of quantifying determiners, numerals and indefinite pronouns may help in distinguish you as a particular person from you as a group.",
        "If an utterance contains noun phrases like some ofyou, few ofyou, most ofyou, etc., then it is addressed to all meeting participants.",
        "The speaker doesn’t know who he is actually addressing (He saw some ofyou yesterday).",
        "Name detection is a powerful method for addressee determination.",
        "The name in vocative form is used for direct addressing the person with that name (What about you, John?).",

        "Dialogue acts.",
        "There is a relation between addressees of an utterances and the type of the dialogue act the speaker performed.",
        "Sometimes the description of a dialogue act includes the possible addressees of the act.",
        "Therefore, knowledge about the dialog act is used as a cue for addressee detection.",
        "For dialogue act annotation we use the Meeting Recorder Dialogue Acts (MRDA) tag set (Dhillon et al., 2003).",
        "The MRDA is a tag set for labeling multiparty face-to-face meetings.",
        "The tags in the MRDA set are organized into thirteen groups according to syntactic, semantic, pragmatic and functional characteristic of the utterance they mark.",
        "For addressee detection purposes we used a large subset of the MRDA tag set but we organized them at two levels: forward looking function (FLF) and backward looking function (BLF).",
        "FLF represents the effect that an utterance has on the subsequent interaction.",
        "BLF indicates how an utterance relates to the previous discourse.",
        "If an utterance has both functions the corresponding addressee is the addressee of the BLF.",
        "When an utterance is marked with a BLF it is related to one of the previous utterances in the conversation.",
        "The addressee of the associated dialogue act in most cases is the speaker of the related utterance.",
        "However, it is possible that the speaker of the related utterance is the same as the current speaker.",
        "For instance, a speaker can repeat or correct himself.",
        "The addressees of these utterances are addressees of the related utterances.",
        "Most of the BLFs are related to the previous utterances of the other speaker (acceptance tags, answer tags, etc.).",
        "In the multiparty case there is a number of interesting interaction patterns with respect to addressee identification.",
        "In the first conversation all responses are related to A’s proposal.",
        "Therefore, A is the addressee of the utterances expressed by B, C and D. It means the addressee doesn’t have to be the previous speaker.",
        "In the second example it is not clear whether C rejects A’s or B’s proposal or both proposals.",
        "Additional information obtained from visual channels can help in resolving the addressee ambiguity.",
        "Unlike BLFs, FLFs do not provide much information about the addressee of a speaker’s utterance.",
        "Yet, some assumptions about the utterance’s addressee are possible, especially if we take in consideration the linguistic markers mentioned above.",
        "For instance, the speaker of an utterance marked with some of the question tags directly addresses the addressee to provide information.",
        "In combination with the use of the personal pronoun we these questions are addressed to a subgroup of participants or to all participants rather than to a single person.",
        "Very often questions in meeting discussions are open-ended questions.",
        "An open-ended question is a question that does not seek a specific answer.",
        "Rather, it is asked in a broad sense.",
        "An open-ended question is more likely addressed to all meeting participants.",
        "If an open ended question contains ’you’ than a single person is the most probable addressee (What about C?",
        "questions?",
        "What about you?).",
        "Linguistic markers and dialogue acts described above provide us with starting assumptions about the most likely addressee.",
        "These assumptions are mostly related to a size of the target group i.e. whether the addressee is a single participant, a group of participant or all participants.",
        "Therefore, some other communication channels are used in combination with speech for addressing the utterance.",
        "In the following sections we will describe the role of non-verbal communication channels in addressee detection.",
        "Gaze is an important aspect of social interaction (Argyle, 1973).",
        "One of the functions of gaze is channel-control.",
        "Mutual gaze is important when people want to establish relationship.",
        "Unless the utterance is very short the speaker very soon breaks the mutual gaze.",
        "When finishing the utterance, the speaker gazes back to a listener.",
        "If the speaker decided to continue to talk at turn transition points, or even before, he usually gazes away.",
        "Need for feedback effects the speaker’s gaze direction.",
        "Gaze direction shows a participant’s focus of attention.",
        "In the meeting scenario where all participants are around the table the focus of attention of the current speaker are mostly the other meeting participants.",
        "Since it is almost impossible to record eye gazing of participants, gaze information is obtained and induced from head movements.",
        "In (Stiefel-hagen and Zhu, 2002) it is shown that we can predict a participant focus of attention based on head orientation with a reliability of 88,7 %.",
        "The contribution of gaze information to addressee detection is dependent on the current meeting action (discussion, presentation, note-taking, etc.",
        "), the participants’ location and the utterance length.",
        "During a presentation a speaker most probably addresses utterances to all meeting participants.",
        "Therefore, information about gaze direction is less relevant for a presentation than for a discussion meeting action.",
        "When the utterance is short a speaker usually gazes only at one participant or at no one, addressing the utterance at a group ofpeople or at the whole audience.",
        "Moreover, information about the visible areas of the participants and hence the relative positions they have in the meeting is relevant for interpreting the gaze behavior in terms of focus of attention and it’s contribution to addressing.",
        "During a turn a speaker mostly looks at the participant who are in his visible area.",
        "On the other hand if he wants to address someone outside his visual area he will often move his body towards the addressee.",
        "The result of automatic or manual gaze annotation is a list of gazed participants or objects, together with time stamps.",
        "For the BLFs the first participant in the list is of interest.",
        "If the participant is not in the speaker’s visible area then the gazed participant is the most likely addressee of the speaker utterance.",
        "If the participant is in the speaker’s visible area and he is a candidate from the speech analysis then the likelihood that he is the addressee of the speaker utterance is greater.",
