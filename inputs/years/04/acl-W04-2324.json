        "Within a multilevel approach to discourse processing, this paper focuses on the semantic level.",
        "This level reflects the discourse structure (how things are said, how the discourse is rhetorically organized).",
        "This structure plays an important role, e.g., it constrains both anaphora resolution and the attachment of incoming propositions in understanding.",
        "I assume that the informational content level (what is said) is based on first order logic.",
        "A nice tool for the semantic level is dependency graphs.",
        "This is what is adopted in RST (rhetorical structures correspond roughly to dependency structures), but it is not the case in SDRT1: discourse structures, called SDRSs, are represented as boxes.",
        "Nevertheless, it is easy to translate the conditions of an SDRS into a dependency graph (Section 2.1).",
        "Our goal in this paper is to determine to which mathematical object dependency structures for discourses correspond.",
        "In RST, it is a basic principle that this object is a tree.",
        "In SDRT, the issue is not discussed.",
        "I will show that this object is an ordered directed acyclic graph (DAG),",
        "which may be not tree shaped.",
        "Some authors, e.g. (Bate-man, 1999) and (Blackburn and Gardent, 1998), have already brought forward discourse structures which are not tree shaped.",
        "However nobody says explicitly that discourse dependency structures are DAGs considering seriously all the consequences of this claim2.",
        "Our argumentation is based on one of the simplest cases of discourses, namely discourses of type S1 Conna S2 Connb S3 with two discourse connectives (Conna/b) and three clauses (Si).",
        "A discourse connective Conn can be either a subordinating or coordinating conjunction or a discourse adverbial.",
        "It denotes a discourse relation R, a predicate with two arguments.",
        "I will show (Section 3) that they are topologically only four types of DAGs for these discourses.",
        "This allows us to state that DAGs for these discourses are not arbitrary: they satisfy structural constraints (Section 5).",
        "I stipulate that this result can be extrapolated to discourses in which sentences are simply juxtaposed without discourse connective.",
        "It can also be foreseen that dependency structures for more complex discourses (e.g. discourses with more than three clauses) are also constrained DAGs.",
        "This can be seen as an important result since many authors in the discourse community hang on trees as discourse structures, even if it means to use artificial trees as shown in Section 2.4.",
        "They reject DAGs because they view them as completely unconstrained (except the acyclicity constraint) and so as unusable in discourse processing.",
        "This is truly not the case.",
        "Semantic dependency structures for discourses are ordered DAGs but these DAGs present heavy structural constraints, which can help us to cut down the number of possibilities when processing discourses (although this issue is not discussed here).",
        "Before getting to the heart of the matter, let us give some preliminaries."

        "Following works in MTT3, a trace of the linear order can be recorded in a semantic dependency representation, however it should not affect its structure.",

        "In (Danlos, 2003), I have shown, using LTAG as a syntactic formalism, that X receives two syntactic analyses which allow us to compute Y1 and Y2.",

        "As a consequence, our study on the semantics of sentences with two subordinate clauses can be limited to the study of such sentences in the canonical order.",

        "Therefore, the standard interpretation of dependency relations in a tree is needed.",
        "Next, the following question arises: is it possible to state that the dependency relations in a tree should be computed sometimes by the standard interpretation and some other times by the nuclearity one?",
        "In the tree (B), this question is instantiated in the following way: should the first argument of Rb be given sometimes by the standard interpretation (it is then the tree rooted at R,) and some other times by the nuclearity principle (it is then 7rl, and (B) is equivalent to (D))16?",
        "An answer to this question is sound only if it is possible to define formally “sometimes”.",
        "The only sound answer consists in stating that there exist two types of discourse relations: the dependency relations are computed with the standard interpretation for the first type, and computed with the nuclearity interpretation for the second one.",
        "The only types of discourse relations which have been put forward up to now are the “coordinating and subordinating” types (Hobbs, 1979), (Asher and Lascarides, 2003), (Asher and Vi eu, 2003).",
        "Laurence Delort in (Delort, 2004) has examined, in the framework of SDRT, my DAGs (A)-(D) in studying for each relation R, or Rb if it could be of the coordinating and/or subordinating type.",
        "Her results are summarized in Table 1.",
        "This table shows that (B) is possible only when R, is coordinating and (D) only when R, is subordinating (in both cases, Rb can be equally coordinating or subordinating).",
        "Therefore, it is possible to lay down the following rule: the dependency relations in the tree (B) are computed with the standard interpretation when R, is coordinating, and with the nuclearity interpretation when R, is subordinating.",
        "However, let us examine the situation for the tree (A).",
        "From Table 1, the reader can check that no rule can be laid down for the dependency relations in (A) when Rb is coordinating: they can be computed with either the standard or the nuclearity interpretation.",
        "These two cases are 15With the nuclearity principle, the second argument of Ra in (A) is ir2, and the first argument of Rb in (B) is π1.",

        "On the top of part of speech considerations, the lexical value of each connective may exclude some of these DAGs.",
        "Finally, the distinction between coordinating and subordinating discourse relations must be taken into account.",
        "Table 1 from (Delort, 2004) presented as in Table 2 shows that a given DAG among (A)-(D) never corresponds to the 2*2 = 4 possibilities given by the combinatory R,/b coordinating or subordinating discourse relation.",

        "I stipulate that this result can be extrapolated to cases where sentences are simply juxtaposed without discourse connective.",
        "It can be considered that there is only a few DAGs corresponding to coherent discourses with three clauses17.",

        "on the topology of the ordered DAGs (A)-(D) allows us to bring forward this other structural constraint: Ra must “left-dominate” 7r2.",

        "This means that Ra establishes some semantic link between S1 and S219.",
        "This result may sound trivial on psycho-linguisitics grounds: what would be a discourse in which the second clause is not linked at all to the first one?20 It has the following consequence: the semantic representation of a discourse with four clauses and three discourse connectives cannot be DAG (L) in Figure 8.",
        "In (L), Ra does not left-dominate 7r2, or informally, there is no link between S1 and S2.",
        "(L) includes two crossing dependencies.",
        "I have just half-opened the door towards an extension of this study to discourses with more than three clauses.",
        "I stipulate that the conclusion of this forthcoming study will be the same.",
