        "This paper describes a coding scheme for annotating student emotional states in spoken dialogue tutoring corpora, and analyzes the scheme not only for its reliability, but also for its utility in developing a spoken dialogue tutoring system that can model and respond to student emotions.",
        "Motivation for this work comes from the performance discrepancy between human tutors and current machine tutors: typically, students tutored by human tutors achieve higher learning gains than students tutored by computer tutors.",
        "The development of computational tutorial dialogue systems (Ros´e and Aleven, 2002) represents one method of closing this performance gap, e.g. it is hypothesized that dialogue-based tutors allow greater adaptivity to students’ beliefs and misconceptions.",
        "Another method for closing this performance gap involves incorporating emotion prediction and adaptation into computer tutors (Kort et al., 2001; Evens, 2002).",
        "For example (Aist et al., 2002) have shown that adding human-provided emotional scaffolding to an automated reading tutor increases student persistence.",
        "This suggests that the success of computer dialogue tutors could be increased by responding to both what a student says and how s/he says it, e.g. with confidence or uncertainty.",
        "To assess the impact of adding emotion modeling to dialogue tutoring systems, we are building ITSPOKE (Intelligent Tutoring SPOKEn dialogue system), a spoken dialogue system that uses the Why2-Atlas conceptual physics tutoring system (VanLehn et al., 2002) as its “back-end.”' Our first step towards incorporating emotion processing into ITSPOKE is to develop a reliable annotation scheme for student emotions.",
        "Our next step will be to use the data that has been annotated according to this scheme to enhance ITSPOKE to dynamically predict and adapt to student emotions.",
        "This adds additional constraints on our annotation scheme besides good reliability, namely that our annotations are predictable by ITSPOKE with a high degree of accuracy (automatically and in real-time), and that they are expressive enough to support the range of desired system adaptations.",
        "In Section 2 we review previous work in emotion annotation for spoken dialogue systems.",
        "In Section 3 we discuss our tutoring research project and corpora.",
        "In Section 4 we present an emotion annotation scheme for this domain.",
        "In Section 5 we analyze our scheme with respect to interannotator agreement and predictive accuracy, using a corpus of human tutoring dialogues.",
        "Our agreement indicates that our scheme is reliable, while machine learning experiments on annotated data indicate that our emotion labels can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy.",
        "In Section 6 we analyze more expressive versions of our scheme, and discuss differences between annotating human and computer spoken tutoring dialogues."

        "Developing a descriptive theory of emotion is a complex research topic, viewed from either a theoretical or an empirical standpoint (Cowie et al., 2001).",
        "Some researchers have proposed a variety of “fundamental” human emotions, while others have argued that emotions 'We also use ITSPOKE to examine the utility of building spoken dialogue tutors (e.g. (Litman and Forbes, 2003)).",
        "are best represented componentially, in terms of multiple dimensions.",
        "Despite this lack of a well-defined descriptive framework, there has been great recent interest in predicting emotional states, using information extracted from a person’s text, speech, physiology, facial expressions, eye gaze, etc.",
        "(Pantic and Rothkrantz, 2003).",
        "In the area of emotional speech, most research has used databases of speech read by actors or native speakers as training data for developing emotion predictors (Holzapfel et al., 2002; Liscombe et al., 2003).",
        "In this work the set of emotions to be read is predefined before the utterance is spoken, rather than annotated after the fact.",
        "One problem with this approach is that such prototypical emotional speech does not necessarily reflect natural speech (Batliner et al., 2003), e.g. the way one acts an emotion is not necessarily the same as the way one naturally expresses an emotion.",
        "Moreover, actors repeatedly reading the same sentence are restricted to conveying different emotions using only acoustic and prosodic features, while in natural interactions a much wider feature variety is available (e.g., lexical, dialogue).",
        "As a result of these problems, researchers motivated by spoken dialogue applications have instead started to train emotion predictors using naturally-occurring speech that has been hand-annotated for various emotions (Ang et al., 2002; Batliner et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2001; Litman and Forbes, 2003).",
        "However, this requires researchers to first develop a scheme for annotating emotions in naturally-occurring spoken dialogue corpora.",
        "Although emotion annotation of natural corpora (typically at the turn or utterance level) has been addressed in various domains, little has yet been done in the educational setting.",
        "Although not yet tested, (Evens, 2002) has hypothesized adaptive strategies; for example, if detecting frustration, the system should respond to hedges and self-deprecation, by supplying praise and restructuring the problem.",
        "A comparison of our annotation scheme and prior non-tutoring schemes is presented in Section 4.4."

        "b) The semantics of certain groundings is associated with weakly expressed understanding, (e.g. “right” and “sure”), and default to weak positive.",

        "In this paper we presented and analyzed our scheme for annotating student emotional states in spoken tutoring dialogues.",

        "Our inter-annotator agreement is on par with prior emotion annotation in other types of corpora.",
        "We used consensus-labeling to resolve disagreements and increase our dataset.",
        "Through further annotation and the use of other inter-annotation metrics (Gwet, 2001), we will investigate how systematic disagreements can yield revisions to our annotation scheme that improve reliability.",
        "Our machine learning experiments have shown that our main emotion categories can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy.",
        "Although not presented here, F-Measures ( ) for our experiments on agreed data ranged from 67%-86%; in future work we will more closely examine the tradeoff between recall and precision when predicting our annotations.",
        "Our experiments have also highlighted tradeoffs that can be made between coding reliability, predictive accuracy, and annotation scheme granularity.",
        "Finally, we presented initial results in annotating our ITSPOKE human-computer tutoring corpus, and discussed differences from our human-human annotations.",
        "This research on emotion annotation and prediction is a first step towards extending the ITSPOKE computer tutoring dialogue system to predict and adapt to student emotional states.",
        "Our next goal is to label human tutor reactions to emotional student turns, in order to formulate adaptive strategies for ITSPOKE, and to determine which of our six prediction tasks best triggers adaptation."
