        "The MATE ‘meta-scheme’ for anaphora annotation (Poesio et al., 1999) is one of the annotation schemes developed as part of the MATE project (McKelvie et al., 2001), whose goal was to develop annotation tools suitable for different types of dialogue annotation.",
        "The scheme has served as the basis for a number of annotation projects, such as the development of the GNOME corpus (Poesio, 2000a) and, more recently, of the VENEX corpus of anaphora in Italian spoken dialogue and text (Poesio et al., 2004a).",
        "The GNOME corpus has been used to study salience, particularly as formalized in Centering theory (Poesio et al., 2004c), to develop statistical models of natural language generation (e.g., (Poesio, 2000a; Henschel et al., 2000; Cheng et al., 2001; Cheng, 2001; Karama-nis, 2003)) and to evaluate anaphora resolution systems, with a special focus on the resolution of bridging references (Poesio, 2003; Poesio and Alexandrov-Kabadjov, 2004; Poesio et al., 2004b).",
        "Aspects of the scheme have been implemented in annotation tools including MMAX (M¨uller and Strube, 2003) and the Annotator tool developed by ILSP.",
        "As a result of this work, many aspects of the proposals concerning anaphoric annotation made in MATE and GNOME have been subjected to a thorough test.",

        "The design of an annotation scheme involves a number of decisions: what has to be annotated, how, and how the annotation should be recorded (the markup scheme).",
        "One of the most important motivations behind the design of the MATE proposals for anaphoric annotation is the belief that given the variety of phenomena that go under the name of anaphora, and the variety of possible applications, there can be no such thing as a general-purpose anaphoric annotation instructions.",
        "On the other hand, we also believed that it is possible to design a general purpose markup scheme (and therefore, general-purpose tools) that could then be used in different ways for different projects.",
        "The approach taken in MATE was then to design a general markup scheme (the ‘meta-scheme’) and then to show its basic building blocks could be used to implement different types of anaphoric annotation, including some of the most popular schemes for ’coreference annotation,’ such as the MUC scheme (MUCCS) (Hirschman, 1998), Passonneau’s DRAMA scheme (1997) , and the scheme used for annotation of references to landmarks in the MapTask corpus.",
        "In this section we summarize the most distinctive features of the proposals resulting from this basic assumption.",

      "text": [
        "The MATE scheme differs from the best-known scheme for annotating ‘coreference,’ MUCCS (Hirschman, 1998) both in the conceptualization underlying the annotation (i.e., what type of information should be annotated) and in the way this information is marked up.",
        "MUCCS was designed to encode information deemed useful for a subtask of information extraction, and the instructions provided to annotators were meant to ensure that all information provided by a text about a certain entity would be marked using a single device, the I DENT relation.",
        "As van Deemter and Kibble (2000) point out, however, the result is rather ad hoc; the I DENT relation as defined by the instructions doesn’t capture any coherent definition of ‘coreference’.",
        "(In fact, the very notion of ‘reference’ is rather difficult to formalize precisely.)",
        "The MATE proposals, by contrast, while still labeled as proposals for ‘coreference annotation,’ because the name has become a de facto standard as a result of the MUC initiative, are explicitly based on the DISCOURSE MODEL assumption adopted almost universally by linguists (computational and not) working on anaphora resolution and generation (Webber, 1979; Heim, 1982; Kamp and Reyle, 1993; Gundel et al., 1993).",
        "This is the hypothesis that interpreting a discourse involves building a shared discourse model containing DISCOURSE ENTITIES that may or may not ‘refer’ to specific objects in the world, as well as the relations between these entities.",
        "The type of annotation for which the MATE scheme was developed–and that we’ll call here ’anaphoric annotation,’.1 is meant as a partial representation of the discourse model evoked by a text (hence, for example, the tag used for nominal expressions denoting discourse entities, (de)).2"

      "heading": "2.2 The Markup Scheme",
      "text": [
        "The design of the MATE workbench was strongly inspired by the concept of STANDOFF ANNOTATION developed for the reorganization of the MapTask.",
        "The main principle of standoff annotation is that each level of annotation– for example, syntactic annotation, dialogue act annotation, and anaphoric annotation–should be stored independently; in this way, annotators working on one level need not be concerned about the other levels of annotation, and can start immediately without having to wait for other annotation tasks to be completed.",
        "The separate levels of annotation are synchronized via a base file, to which the separate levels point using the HRE F mechanism of XML.",
        "The markup scheme for anaphoric relations is the core aspect of the MATE proposals and its most distinctive aspect.",
        "As in the MUC scheme, it is as",
        "sumed that annotation of anaphoric information involves identifying MARKABLES (the text constituent that realize semantic objects that may enter in anaphoric relations), and marking up anaphoric relations between them.",
        "The main difference from MUCCS is that whereas in MUCCS anaphoric relations are annotated using an attribute of the markables, in the MATE markup scheme– following the recommendations of the Text Encoding Initiative (Burnard and Sperberg-McQueen, 2002), and of Bruneseaux and Romary (1998)–the distinction between these two steps of annotation is mirrored by a distinction between two XML elements: (de), used to indicate the markables, and (link), used to mark information about anaphoric relations (or any other semantic relation).3 However, unlike in the TEI proposals, in the MATE markup scheme (link) elements are structured elements, containing one or more (anchor) element.",
        "The (link) element specifies the anaphoric expression (using XML’s HRE F mechanism) and the relation between the anaphoric expression and its antecedent; whereas the (anchor) element specifies the antecedent, as in (1) where, for example, the first (link) elements encodes the information that the discourse entities realized by the NPs the engine E3 and it denote the same object.",
        "<de ID=\"de_01\">we</de>’re gonna take <de ID=\"de_07\"> the engine E3 </de> and shove <de ID=\"de_08\"> it </de> over to <de ID=\"de_02\">Corning</de>, hook <de ID=\"de_09\"> it </de> up to <de ID=\"de_03\">the tanker car</de>... <link href=\"coref.xml#id(de_07)\" type=\"ident\"> <anchor href=\"coref.xml#id(de_08)\"/> </link> <link href=\"coref.xml#id(de_08)\" type=\"ident\"> <anchor href=\"coref.xml#id(de_09)\"/> </link> There were two main reasons for having (link) elements separated from the elements used to indicate mark-ables.",
        "The first reason is that in this way (link) elements can be kept in a separate file from (de) elements, in keeping with the idea of standoff annotation.",
        "The second, and more important, reason is that in this way it is possible to annotate multiple anaphoric relations involving the same anaphoric expression without having multiple attributes for each markable.",
        "The reason why (link) elements may have more than one (anchor) element is to allow for the possibility to annotate ambiguities.",
        "For some types of applications, it may be a good idea not to ask annotators to decide upon the interpretation of ambiguous anaphoric expressions.",
        "tual name of these tags are (co re f : de), (co re f : link), etc.",
        "We omit the namespace indication in this paper.",
        "In these cases, the multiple anchors mechanisms allows each of the possibilities to be marked by means of a separate (anchor) element.",
        "In (2a), for example, the pronun it in 15.16 could refer equally well to engine E3 or the tanker car.",

        "Schemes of this type can be implemented by having just one anaphoric relation, I DENT.",
        "The remaining differences between the schemes have then mostly to do with the instructions to annotators–for example, which types of anaphoric relations to be considered as cases of ’identity’ (see (van Deemter and Kibble, 2000) for some problems with the choices made in MUCCS).",
        "In the comments for the designers of a scheme, it was suggested that some of the cases marked as coreference in MUCCS, such as the relation between the temperature and 90 degrees in the temperature rose to 90 degrees before dropping to 70 degrees, would be best marked as function-value relations (viewing the temperature as a function from objects and time points into values, rather than an individual-denoting term).",

        "Concerning markable identification, the main suggestions were to concentrate on anaphoric expressions realized as NPs and their antecedents; and to rely on the output of a parser as much as possible.",
        "But because of the assumption that only NPs evoking discourse entities should be considered, it was suggested that not all NP should be treated as markables: for example, it was recommended that NPs in post-verbal position in predicative clauses (such as a policeman in John is a policeman) should be excluded.",

        "GNOME was concerned with the empirical investigation of the aspects of discourse that appear to affect generation, especially salience (Pearson et al., 2000; Poesio et al., 2000; Poesio and Di Eugenio, 2001; Poesio and Nissim, 2001; Poesio et al., 2004c).",
        "Particular attention was paid to the factors affecting the generation of pronouns (Pearson et al., 2000; Henschel et al., 2000), demonstratives (Poesio and Nygren-Modjeska, To appear) possessives (Poesio and Nissim, 2001) and definites in general (Poesio, 2004).",
        "These results, and the annotated corpus, were applied to the development of both symbolic and statistical natural language generation algorithms with the application of these empirical results to natural language generation, from sentence planning (Poesio, 2000a; Henschel et al., 2000; Cheng et al., 2001), to aggregation (Cheng, 2001) and text planning (Kibble and Power, 2000; Karamanis, 2003).",
        "The empirical side of the project involved both psychological experiments and corpus annotation, based on a scheme based on the MATE proposals, as well as on a detailed annotation manual (Poesio, 2000b), the reliability of whose instructions was tested by extensive experiments (Poesio, 2000a).",
        "More recently, the corpus has also been used to develop and evaluate anaphora resolution systems, with a special focus on the resolution of bridging references (Poesio, 2003; Poesio and Alexandrov-Kabadjov, 2004; Poesio et al., 2004b).",
        "The corpus The GNOME corpus currently includes texts from three domains, about 3000 NPs were annotated in each domain.",
        "The museum subcorpus consists of descriptions of museum objects, generally with an associated picture, and brief texts about the artists that produced them.",
        "The pharmaceutical subcorpus is a selection of leaflets providing the patients with legally mandatory information about their medicine.",
        "Several layers of information were annotated, including layout in the case of text and rhetorical structure in the case of tutorial dialogues, sentences and potential utterances, noun phrases, a variety of attributes of the objects denoted by noun phrases,6 and anaphoric relation.",
        "We concentrate here on anaphoric information, and refer the reader to the manual for the other types of annotation.",
        "Markup scheme The markup scheme for markables and anaphoric relations adopted in GNOME follows very 6E.g., whether an NP denoted generically or not; whether it denoted an animate or inanimate entity, as well as other ontological properties; and whether it denoted a discourse entity, a quantifier, or a predicate.",
        "In the case of a discourse entity, we also annotated whether it denoted an atom, a set, or a mass term; and whether it denoted uniquely or not.",
        "closely that proposed in MATE, except that the (de) element was renamed (ne) (since all NPs were marked), and the (link) element was renamed (ante).",
        "More substantial differences are the decision not to use standoff, and the introduction of new elements necessary for the study of salience, such as elements that could be used to investigate the notion of UTTERANCE used in Centering (Poesio et al., 2004c).",
        "Although standoff is a clear improvement over including all annotation levels in a single file, our own experiences during the creation of the GNOME corpus being further proof of this, it’s only really possible when tools are available both to create the annotation and–crucially– later to ’knit back’ the separate levels when needed.",
        "As neither the MATE workbench nor any other tools based on standoff were available by the time the GNOME annotation started,7 in GNOME we didn’t use standoff, but integrated all levels of annotation in one file; an Emacs mode was developed for the annotation.",
        "This decision made it very easy to use the annotated corpus for a number of studies, but did resulted in a number of problems, the main among which were that the annotators had to be very careful not to damage other annotations; that annotators working on one level were occasionally confused by annotations for other levels; and that the annotation work had to be organized in a careful sequential way even for levels that could have been annotated independently.",
        "The main new aspect of the markup scheme, especially as far as our studies of salience were concerned, are the elements used to annotate potential utterances in the sense of Centering (Grosz et al., 1995).",
        "In order not to prejudge the answer to the question of which text constituents are best viewed as utterances, we used a ‘generic’ element called (unit) to mark up finite and non-finite clauses, but also parentheticals and apposi-tions, elements of bulleted lists, etc.",
        "The following example illustrates both the use of (unit) elements and of the elements (ne) and (ante)",
        "Bridging References Apart from the basic anaphoric relations of identity, in GNOME we were concerned with bridging references, hence our annotation scheme incorporated aspects of the ‘Extended Relations’ and the ‘MapTask’ instantiations of the MATE meta-scheme.",
        "One of our aims was to continue the work on bridging references annotation and interpretation in (Poesio and Vi eira, 1998), which showed that marking up bridging references is quite hard.",
        "In addition, work such as (Sid-ner, 1979; Strube and Hahn, 1999) suggested that indirect realization can play a crucial role in maintaining the CB.",
        "After testing a few types of associative reference (Hawkins, 1978), we decided to annotate only three non-identity relations, as well as identity.",
        "These relations are a subset of those proposed in the ‘extended relations’ version of the MATE scheme: set membership (ELEMENT), subset (SUBSET), and ‘generalized possession’ (POSS), which includes both part-of relations and ownership relations.",
        "Coder manual Perhaps the most important aspects of the annotation work in GNOME are the development of detailed instructions for annotators and the reliability experiments testing several aspects of the scheme, particularly the annotation of bridging references.",
        "The identification of sentences, units and markables was done entirely by hand, without encountering particular problems.",
        "(The Emacs mode, an extension of SGMLmode, provides some support for introducing new elements, marking regions, and attribute editing, as well as anaphoric annotation.)",
        "Unlike in MATE, all NPs were tagged as (ne).",
        "The instructions for (unit)s were based on Marcu’s proposals for discourse units annotation (Marcu, 1999).",
        "All attributes of sentences, (unit)s and (ne)s in the final version of the scheme, including DE I X, can be annotated reliably.",
        "In order to achieve reliability on anaphoric annotation, the range of anaphoric phenomena considered was restricted in many ways.",
        "Apart from marking a limited number of associative relations, the annotators only marked relations between objects realized by noun phrases and not, for example, anaphoric references to actions, events or propositions implicitly introduced by clauses or sentences.",
        "We also gave strict instructions to our annotators concerning how much to mark.",
        "They were told to mark all identity relations, but to mark associative relations only if either (i) no I DENT relation could be marked for the anaphoric expression, or (ii) an I DENT relation with an entity not mentioned in the previous (unit).",
        "Furthermore, preferences were specified, e.g., for appositions: for example, in Francois, the Dauphin, the embedding NP would be chosen as an antecedent of subsequent anaphoric references, rather than the NP in appositive position.",
        "We found a reasonable, although by no means perfect, agreement on identity relations.",
        "In a typical analysis (two annotators looking at the anaphoric relations between 200 NPs) we observed no real disagreements; 79.4% of these relations were marked up by both annotators; 12.8% by only one of them; and in 7.7% of the cases, one of the annotators marked up a closer antecedent than the other.",
        "Limiting the relations did limit the disagreements among annotators on associative relations (only 4.8% of the relations are actually marked differently) but only 22% of bridging references were marked in the same way by both annotators; 73.17% of relations are marked by only one or the other annotator.",

        "Our experience with VENEX suggests that two of the most beneficial aspects of having a separate (link) element are ones that we had not originally considered: that they can be used to mark general semantic relations, not just anaphoric relations (for more complex types of semantic annotation); and that they make it harder for annotators to forget to fill in aspects of the annotation.",

        "In addition, it’s often difficult to decide whether an NP is used predicatively or referentially, especially in languages like Italian where subjects in such clauses are often used predicatively (as in La soluzione e’ questa).",
        "In GNOME, a new attribute LF TYPE was introduced to specify the type of semantic object denoted by an NP: term, quant and pred.",
        "The annotators were instructed to concentrate on term-denoting NPs.",
        "The instructions for classifying NPs according to their semantic type were based mostly on syntactic information, but the annotation was reliable.",
        "In the instructions for the VENEX annotation, the instructions for recognizing term-denoting NP are further developed.",
        "Restricting the range of associative relations The range of associative relations tested in GNOME is much narrower than those considered in DRAMA, but they can be annotated reliably, at least in the sense that very few disagreements are observed.",

        "In the pharmaceutical texts, for example, it is often unclear whether a particular mention of the medicine under consideration refers to the generic product, or to the particular instance that the user has in their hands.",
        "In this case, we would want annotators to mark the anaphoric expression as I DENT with one object, and ELEMENT of the other (ELEMENT is also used in GNOME for relations between instances and types), as follows, but this is not possible in either the original MATE scheme or in the GNOME markup scheme:"

        "Ambiguity Offering annotators the opportunity to annotate anaphoric ambiguity is essential, especially for annotations used to study linguistic phenomena, but raises serious theoretical and practical problems.",
        "A coreference chain containing such links becomes a coreference (directed) graph, in which each of the paths across the graph is a potential interpretation.",
        "While having multiple paths is not a problem as far as evaluating the results of an anaphoric resolver (any path in the graph counts as a valid solution), it is a serious problems both for scripts attempting to ensure consistency (e.g., that all references to the same object are marked as either generic or non-generic– this is of course impossible when one of the possible antecedents is generic while the other isn’t) as well for annotation tools (the problem is of course worsened when the tool only uses a single attribute to indicate membership in a coreference chain).",
        "Revision A second difficult problem is caused by cases, common in the MapTask dialogues, in which after a while a participant realizes that their previous belief that an object was identical to another object is mistaken.",
        "In these cases, the participant is arguably revising their previous beliefs; it is not clear then what should be done with the annotation of the original anaphoric information."
