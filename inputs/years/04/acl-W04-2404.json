        "The success of supervised learning approaches to word sense disambiguation is largely dependent on the features used to represent the context in which an ambiguous word occurs.",
        "Previous work has reached mixed conclusions; some suggest that combinations of syntactic and lexical features will perform most effectively.",
        "However, others have shown that simple lexical features perform well on their own.",
        "This paper evaluates the effect of using different lexical and syntactic features both individually and in combination.",
        "We show that it is possible for a very simple ensemble that utilizes a single lexical feature and a sequence of part of speech features to result in disambiguation accuracy that is near state of the art."

        "Most words in natural language exhibit polysemy, that is, they have multiple possible meanings.",
        "Each of these meanings is referred to as a sense, and word sense disambiguation is the process of identifying the intended sense of a target word based on the context in which it is used.",
        "The context of the target word consists of the sentence in which it occurs, and possibly one or two surrounding sentences.",
        "Consider the following sentence: Harry cast a bewitching spell (1) The target word spell has many possible senses, such as, a charm or incantation, to read out letter by letter, and a period of time.",
        "The intended sense, a charm or incantation, can be identified based on the context, which in this case includes bewitching and a reference to a famous young wizard.",
        "Word sense disambiguation is often approached by supervised learning techniques.",
        "The training data consists of sentences which have potential target words tagged by a human expert with their intended sense.",
        "Numerous learning algorithms, such as, Naive Bayesian classifiers, Decision Trees and Neural Networks have been used to learn models of disambiguation.",
        "However, both (Pedersen, 2001 a) and (Lee and Ng, 2002) suggest that different learning algorithms result in little change in overall disambiguation results, and that the real determiner of accuracy is the set of features that are employed.",
        "Previous work has shown that using different combinations of features is advantageous for word sense disambiguation (e.g., (McRoy, 1992), (Ng and Lee, 1996), (Stevenson and Wilks, 2001), (Yarowsky and Florian, 2002)).",
        "However, less attention is paid to determining what the minimal set of features necessary to attain high accuracy disambiguation are.",
        "In this paper we present experiments that measure the redundancy in disambiguation accuracy achieved by classifiers using two different sets of features, and we also determine an upper bound on the accuracy that could be attained via the combination of such classifiers into an ensemble.",
        "We find that simple combinations of lexical and syntactic features can result in very high disambiguation accuracy, via an extensive set of experiments using the SENSEVAL-1, SENSEVAL-2, line, hard, serve and interest data.",
        "Together, this consists of more than 50,000 sense-tagged instances.",
        "This paper also introduces a technique to quantify the optimum gain that is theoretically possible when two feature sets are combined in an ensemble.",
        "In the process, we identify some of the most useful part of speech and parse features."

        "Given an occurrence of the surface form casing, we can immediately conclude that it was used in the sense of a frame or covering and not the other two.",
        "Each possible surface form as observed in the training data is represented as a binary feature, and indicates if that particular surface form occurs (or not).",
        "Unigrams are individual words that appear in the text.",

        "Every unigram that occurs above a certain frequency threshold in the training corpus is represented as a binary feature.",
        "For example, there is a feature that represents whether or not judge occurs in the context of a target word.",
        "Bigrams are pairs of words that occur in close proximity to each other, and in a particular order.",
        "For example, in the following sentence: the interest rate is lower in state banks (3) the interest, interest rate, rate is, is lower, lower in, in state and state banks are bigrams, where interest rate suggests that bank has been used in the financial institution sense and not the river bank sense.",
        "Every bigram that reaches a given frequency and measure of association score threshold is represented as a binary feature.",
        "For example, the bigram feature interest rate has value of 1 if it occurs in the context of the target word, and 0 if it does not.",
        "We use the Ngram Statistics Package1 to identify frequent unigrams and statistically significant bigrams in the training corpus for a particular word.",

        "In addition, when looking at a more detailed breakdown of the 73 and 36 words included in these samples respectively, a considerable number of those words experience improved accuracy using part of speech features.",
        "In particular, we observed that while verbs and adjectives are disambiguated best by part of speech of words one or two positions on their right (P1, P2), nouns in general are aided by the part of speech of immediately adjacent words on either side (P_1, P1).",
        "In the case of transitive verbs (which are more frequent in this data than intransitive verbs), the words at positions P1 and P2 are usually the objects of the verb (for example, drink water).",

        "However, we also observe high accuracies for nouns using P1.",
        "This can be explained by the fact that nouns are often the subjects in a sentence and the words at positions P1 and P2 may be the syntactically related verbs, which aid in disambiguation.",

        "Further, we may conclude that given these unigram and part of speech features, the best ensemble techniques will not achieve accuracies higher than 67.9%.",
        "It may be noted that a single unified classifier based on multiple features may achieve accuracies higher than the Optimal Ensemble.",
        "However, we show that an accurate ensemble method (Optimal Ensemble), based on simple lexical and syntactic features, achieves accuracies comparable or better than some of the best previous results.",
        "The point here is that using information from two distinct feature sets (lexical features and part of speech) could lead to state of the art results.",
        "However, it is as yet unclear how to most effectively combine such simple classifiers to achieve these optimal results.",
        "Observation of the pairs of lexical and syntactic features which provide highest accuracies for the various data suggest that the part of speech combination feature - P-1, P0, P1, is likely to be most complementary with the lexical features (bigrams or unigrams).",
        "The hard data did particularly well with combinations of parse features, the Head and Parent words.",
        "The Optimal Ensemble attains accuracy of over 91%, while the best previous results were approximately 83%.",
        "This indicates that not only are the Head and Parent word features very useful in disambiguating adjectives but are also a source of complementary information to lexical features."

        "Scores are assigned based on morphology, part of speech, collocations and syntactic cues.",
        "The sense with the highest score is chosen as the intended sense.",

        "The system was evaluated using the interest data on which it achieved an accuracy of 87.3%.",
        "They studied the utility of individual features and found collocations to be most useful, followed by part of speech and morphological form.",
        "(Lin, 1997) takes a supervised approach that is unique as it did not create a classifier for every target word.",
        "The system compares the context of the target word with that of training instances which are similar to it.",
        "The sense of the target word most similar to these contexts is chosen as the intended sense.",
        "Similar to McRoy, the system attempts to disambiguate all words in the text.",
        "Lin relies on syntactic relations, such as, subject-verb agreement and verb object relations to capture the context.",
        "The system achieved accuracies between 59% and 67% on the Sem-Cor corpus.",
        "(Pedersen, 2001b) compares decision trees, decision stumps and a Naive Bayesian classifier to show that bigrams are very useful in identifying the intended sense of a word.",
        "The accuracies of 19 out of the total 36 tasks in SENSEVAL-1 data were greater than the best reported results in that event.",
        "Bigrams are easily captured from raw text and the encouraging results mean that they can act as a powerful baseline to build more complex systems by incorporating other sources of information.",
        "Pedersen points out that decision trees can effectively depict the relations among the various features used.",
        "With the use of multiple sources of information this quality of decision trees gains further significance.",

        "We use the SENSEVAL-2, SENSEVAL-1, line, hard, serve and interest data which together have more than 50,000 sense tagged instances.",
        "We show that both lexical and syntactic features achieve reasonably good accuracies when used individually, and that the part of speech of the word immediately following the target word is particularly useful in disambiguation as compared to other individual part of speech features.",
        "A combination of part of speech features attains even better accuracies and we identify (P0, P1) and (P_1, P0, P1) as the most potent combinations.",
        "We show that the head word of a phrase is particularly useful in disambiguating adjectives and nouns.",
        "We identify the head and parent as the most potent parse feature combination.",
        "We introduce the measures Baseline Ensemble and Optimal Ensemble which quantify the redundancy among two feature sets and the maximum accuracy attainable by an ensemble technique using the two feature sets.",
        "We show that even though lexical and syntactic features are redundant to a certain extent, there is a significant amount of complementarity.",
        "In particular, we showed that simple lexical features (unigrams and bigrams) used in conjunction with part of speech features have the potential to achieve state of the art results."
