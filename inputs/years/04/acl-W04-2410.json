        "Prepositional phrases are an interesting example of syntactic ambiguity and a challenge for automatic parsers.",
        "The ambiguity arises whenever a prepositional phrase can modify a preceding verb or noun, as in the canonical example I saw the man with the telescope.",
        "In syntactic terms, the prepositional phrase attaches either to the noun phrase or the verb phrase.",
        "Many kinds of syntactic ambiguity can be resolved using structural information alone (Briscoe and Carroll, 1995; Lin, 1998a; Klein and Manning, 2003), but in this case both candidate structures are perfectly grammatical and roughly equally likely.",
        "Therefore ambiguous prepositional phrases require some kind of additional context to disambiguate correctly.",
        "In some cases a small amount of lexical knowledge is sufficient: for example of almost always modifies the noun.",
        "Other cases, such as the telescope example, are potentially much harder since discourse or world knowledge might be required.",
        "Fortunately it is possible to do well at this task just by considering the lexical preferences of the words making up the PP.",
        "Lexical preferences describe the tendency for certain words to occur together or only in specific constructions.",
        "For example, saw and telescope are more likely to occur together than man and telescope, so we can infer that the correct attachment is likely to be verbal.",
        "The most useful lexical preferences are captured by the quadruple (v, n1, p, n2) where v is the verb, n1 is the head of the direct object, p is the preposition and n2 is the head of the prepositional phrase.",
        "A benchmark dataset of 27,937 such quadruples was extracted from the Wall Street Journal corpus by Ratnaparkhi et al.",
        "(1994) and has been the basis of many subsequent studies comparing machine learning algorithms and lexical resources.",
        "This paper examines the effect of particular smoothing algorithms on the performance of an existing statistical PP model.",
        "A major problem faced by any statistical attachment algorithm is sparse data, which occurs when plausible PPs are not well-represented in the training data.",
        "For example, if the observed frequency of a PP in the training is zero then the maximum likelihood estimate is also zero.",
        "Since the training corpus only represents a fraction of all possible PPs, this is probably an underestimate of the true probability.",
        "An appealing course of action when faced with an unknown PP is to consider similar known examples instead.",
        "For example, we may not have any data for eatpizza with fork, but if we have seen eatpasta withfork or even drink beer with straw then it seems reasonable to base our decision on these instead.",
        "Similarity is a rather nebulous concept but for our purposes we can define it to be distributional similarity, where two words are considered similar if they occur in similar contexts.",
        "For example, pizza and pasta are similar since they both often occur as the direct object of eat.",
        "A thesaurus collects together lists of such similar words.",
        "The first step in constructing a thesaurus is to collect co-occurrence statistics from some large corpus of text.",
        "Each word is assigned a probability distribution describing the probability of it occurring with all other words, and by comparing distributions we can arrive at a similarity score.",
        "The corpus, co-occurrence relationships and distributional similarity metric all affect the nature of the final thesaurus.",
        "There has been a considerable amount of research comparing corpora, co-occurrence relations and similarity measures for general-purpose thesauruses, and these thesauruses are often compared against wide-coverage and general purpose semantic resources such as Word-Net.",
        "In this paper we examine whether it is useful to tailor the thesaurus to the task.",
        "General purpose thesauruses list words that tend to occur together in free text; we want to find words that behave in similar ways specifically within prepositional phrases.",
        "To this end we create a PP thesaurus using existing similarity metrics but using a corpus consisting of automatically extracted prepositional phrases.",
        "A thesaurus alone is not sufficient to solve the PP attachment problem; we also need a model of the lexical preferences of prepositional phrases.",
        "Here we use the back-off model described in (Collins and Brooks, 1995) but with maximum likelihood estimates smoothed using similar PPs discovered using a thesaurus.",
        "Such similarity-based smoothing methods have been successfully used in other NLP applications but our use of them here is novel.",
        "A key difference is that smoothing is not done over individual words but over entire prepositional phrases.",
        "Similar PPs are generated by replacing each component word with a distributionally similar word, and we define a similarity functions for comparing PPs.",
        "We find that using a score based on the rank of a word in the similarity list is more accurate than the actual similarity scores provided by the thesaurus, which tend to weight less similar words too highly.",
        "In Section 2 we cover related work in PP attachment and smoothing techniques, with a brief comparison between similarity-based smoothing and the more common (for PP attachment) class-based smoothing.",
        "Section 3 describes Collins’ PP attachment model and our thesaurus-based smoothing extensions.",
        "Section 4 discusses the thesauruses used in our experiment and describes how the specialist thesaurus is constructed.",
        "Experimental results are given in Section 5 and we show statistically significant improvements over the baseline model using generic thesauruses.",
        "Contrary to our hypothesis the specialist thesaurus does not lead to significant improvements and we discuss possible reasons why it underperforms on this task."

        "Typically this involves mixing in probability distributions that have less context and are less likely to suffer from sparse data problems.",
        "For example, if the probability of an attachment given a PP p(alv, n1, p, n2) is undefined because that quadruple was not seen in the training data, then a less specific distribution such as p(alv, n1, p) can be used instead.",
        "A wide range of different techniques have been proposed (Chen and Goodman, 1996) including the backing-off technique used by Collins’ model (see Section 3).",
        "An alternative but complementary approach is to mix in probabilities from distributions over “similar” contexts.",
        "This is the idea behind both similarity-based and class-based smoothing.",

        "Although class-based smoothing is shown to improve the model in both cases, some researchers have suggested that clustering words is counterproductive since the information lost by conflating words into broader classes outweighs the benefits derived from reducing data sparseness.",
        "This remains to be proven conclusively (Dagan et al., 1999).",
        "In contrast, similarity-based techniques do not discard any data.",

        "Generating triples is riskier since there is less context to rule out unlikely PPs: the triple tree in Korea is more plausible and possibly misleading.",

        "There may be merit in creating separate thesauruses for noun-attachment and verb-attachment, since there may be words that are strongly similar in only one of these cases.",
        "Interestingly, although Lin is smaller than WASPS it has better coverage.",
        "This is most likely due to the different corpora used to construct each thesaurus.",
        "Lin is built using newswire text which is closer in genre to the Wall Street Journal.",
        "For example, the first neighbour for fetch in WASPS is grab, but none of the top 25 neighbours of this word in Lin have this sporting sense.",
        "Both WASPS and specialist are derived from the BNC and have similar coverage, although the quality of specialist neighbours is not as good.",
        "The WASPS and Lin models produce statistically significant (P < 0.05) improvements over the vanilla Collins model using a paired t-test with 10-fold cross-validation on the entire dataset4.",
        "The specialist model is not significantly better.",
        "Table 3 compares our results with other comparable PP attachment models.",
        "On the face of it, these are not resounding improvements over the baseline, but this is a very hard task.",
        "Ratnaparkhi (1994) established a human upper bound of 88.2% but subsequent research has put this as low as 78.3% (Mitchell, 2003).",

        "maining errors are therefore likely to be very difficult.",
        "An inspection of the data shows that many of the remaining errors are due to poor neighbouring PPs being used for smoothing.",
        "For example, the PP in entrust company with cash modifies the verb, but no matching quadruples are present in the training data.",
        "The only matching (n1, p, n2) triple using WASPS is (industry, for, income), which appears twice in the training data modifying the noun.",
        "The model therefore guesses incorrectly even though the thesaurus is providing what appear to be semantically appropriate neighbours.",
        "Another example is attend meeting with representative, where the (v, p, n2) triple (talk, with, official) convinces the model to incorrectly guess verb attachment.",
        "Part of the problem is that words in the PP are replaced independently and without consideration to the remaining context.",
        "However we had hoped the specialist thesaurus might alleviate this problem by providing neighbours that are more appropriate for this specific task.",
        "Finding good neighbours for verbs is clearly more difficult than for nouns since subcategorisation and selectional preferences also play a role."

        "Our results show that the similarity-based smoothing of frequency estimates significantly improves an already respectable probabilistic PP attachment model.",
        "However our hypothesis that a task-specific thesaurus would outperform a generic thesaurus was not borne out by our experiments.",
        "The neighbours provided by the specialist thesaurus are not as informative as those supplied by the generic thesauruses.",
        "Of course, this negative result is naturally good news for developers of generic thesauruses.",
        "We described ways of finding and scoring distributionally similar PPs.",
        "A significant number of errors in the final model can be traced to the way individual words in the PP are replaced without regard to the wider context, producing neighbouring PPs that have conflicting attachment preferences.",
        "The specialist thesaurus was not able to overcome this problem.",
        "A second finding is that distributional similarity scores provided by all thesauruses weight dissimilar neighbours too highly, and more aggressive weighting schemes are better for smoothing.",
        "Our aim is to apply similarity-based smoothing with both generic and specialist thesauruses to other areas in lexicalised parse selection, particularly other overtly lexical problems such as noun-noun modifiers and conjunction scope.",
        "Lexical information has a lot of promise for parse selection in theory, but there are practical problems such as sparse data and genre effects (Gildea, 2001).",
        "Appropriately trained thesauruses and similarity-based techniques should help to alleviate both problems."
