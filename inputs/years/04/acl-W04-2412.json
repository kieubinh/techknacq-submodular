        "In recent years there has been an increasing interest in semantic parsing of natural language, which is becoming a key issue in Information Extraction, Question Answering, Summarization, and, in general, in all NLP applications requiring some kind of semantic interpretation.",
        "The shared task of CoNLL-2004 1 concerns the recognition of semantic roles, for the English language.",
        "We will refer to it as Semantic Role Labeling (SRL).",
        "Given a sentence, the task consists of analyzing the propositions expressed by some target verbs of the sentence.",
        "In particular, for each target verb all the constituents in the sentence which fill a semantic role of the verb have to be extracted (see Figure 1 for a detailed example).",
        "Typical semantic arguments include Agent, Patient, Instrument, etc.",
        "and also adjuncts such as Locative, Temporal, Manner, Cause, etc.",
        "Most existing systems for automatic semantic role labeling make use of a full syntactic parse of the sentence in order to define argument boundaries and to extract relevant information for training classifiers to disambiguate between role labels.",
        "Thus, the task has been usually approached as a two phase procedure consisting of recognition and labeling of arguments.",
        "Regarding the learning component of the systems, we find pure probabilistic models (Gildea and Juraf-sky, 2002; Gildea and Palmer, 2002; Gildea and Hock-enmaier, 2003), Maximum Entropy (Fleischman et al., 2003), generative models (Thompson et al., 2003), Decision Trees (Surdeanu et al., 2003; Chen and Ram-bow, 2003), and Support Vector Machines (Hacioglu and Ward, 2003; Pradhan et al., 2003a; Pradhan et al., 2003b).",
        "There have also been some attempts at relaxing the necessity of using syntactic information derived from full parse trees.",
        "For instance, in (Pradhan et al., 2003a; Ha-cioglu and Ward, 2003), a SVM-based SRL system is devised which performs an IOB sequence tagging using only shallow syntactic information at the level of phrase chunks.",
        "Nowadays, there exist two main English corpora with semantic annotations from which to train SRL systems: PropBank (Palmer et al., 2004) and FrameNet (Fillmore et al., 2001).",
        "In the CoNLL-2004 shared task we concentrate on the PropBank corpus, which is the Penn Treebank corpus enriched with predicate–argument structures.",
        "It addresses predicates expressed by verbs and labels core arguments with consecutive numbers (A0 to A5), trying to maintain coherence along different predicates.",
        "A number of adjuncts, derived from the Treebank functional tags, are also included in PropBank annotations.",
        "To date, the best results reported on the PropBank correspond to a Fl measure slightly over 83, when using the gold standard parse trees from Penn Treebank as the main source of information (Pradhan et al., 2003b).",
        "This performance drops to 77 when a real parser is used instead.",
        "Comparatively, the best SRL system based solely on shallow syntactic information (Pradhan et al., 2003a) performs more than 15 points below.",
        "Although these results are not directly comparable to the ones obtained in the CoNLL-2004 shared task (different datasets, different version of PropBank, etc.)",
        "they give an idea about the state-of-the art results on the task.",
        "The challenge for CoNLL-2004 shared task is to come up with machine learning strategies which address the SRL problem on the basis of only partial syntactic information, avoiding the use of full parsers and external lexico-semantic knowledge bases.",
        "The annotations provided for the development of systems include, apart from the argument boundaries and role labels, the levels ofpro-cessing treated in the previous editions of the CoNLL shared task, i.e., words, PoS tags, base chunks, clauses, and named entities.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the general setting of the task.",
        "Section 3 provides a detailed description of training, development and test data.",

        "The goal of the task is to develop a machine learning system to recognize arguments of verbs in a sentence, and label them with their semantic role.",
        "A verb and its set of arguments form a proposition in the sentence, and typically, a sentence will contain a number of propositions.",
        "There are two properties that characterize the structure of the arguments in a proposition.",
        "First, arguments do not overlap, and are organized sequentially.",
        "Second, an argument may appear split into a number of non-contiguous phrases.",
        "For instance, in the sentence “[A1 The apple], said John, [C-A1 is on the table]”, the utterance argument (labeled with type A1) appears split into two phrases.",
        "Thus, there is a set of non-overlapping arguments labeled with semantic roles associated with each proposition.",
        "The set of arguments of a proposition can be seen as a chunking of the sentence, in which chunks are parts of the semantic roles of the proposition predicate.",

        "It is formulated as: Fp=1 = 2pr/(p + r).",
        "For an argument to be correctly recognized, the words spanning the argument as well as its semantic role have to be correct.",
        "2 As an exceptional case, the verb argument of each proposition is excluded from the evaluation.",
        "This argument is the lexicalization of the predicate of the proposition.",
        "Most of the time, the verb corresponds to the target verb of the proposition, which is provided as input, and only in few cases the verb participant spans more words than the target verb.",
        "Except for non-trivial cases, this situation makes the verb fairly easy to identify and, since there is one verb with each proposition, evaluating its recognition overestimates the overall performance of a system.",

        "derived from the basic information are strongly inspired by previous works on the SRL task (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Surdeanu et al., 2003; Pradhan et al., 2003a).",
        "Many systems used the same kind of ideas but implemented in different ways, since the particular learning strategies used (see section 4.2) impose different constraints on the type of information available or the way of expressing it.",
        "As a general idea, we can divide the features into four types: (1) basic features, evaluating some kind of local information on the context of the word or constituent being treated; (2) Features characterizing the internal structure of a candidate argument; (3) Features describing properties of the target verb predicate; (4) Features that capture the relations between the verb predicate and the constituent under consideration.",
        "All systems used some kind of basic features.",
        "Roughly speaking, they consist of words, PoS tags, chunks, clause labels, and named entities extracted from a window-based context.",
        "These values can be considered with or without the relative position with respect to the element under consideration, and some n-grams of them can also be computed.",
        "If the granularity of the system is at phrase level then typically a representative head word of the phrase is used as lexical information.",
        "As an exception to the general approach, the system of Williams et al.",
        "(2004) does not make use of word forms.",
        "The rest of the features are more interesting since they are task dependent, and deserve special attention.",
        "Table 4 summarizes the type of features exploited by systems.",
        "To represent an argument itself, few attributes are of general usage.",
        "Some systems count the length of it, with different granularities.",
        "Others make use of heuristics to derive its syntactic type.",
        "There are systems that extract a structured representation of the argument, either homogeneous (capturing different sequences of head words, PoS tags, chunks or clauses), or heterogeneous (combining all elements, based on the syntactic hierarchy).",
        "A few systems have captured the existence of neighboring arguments, previously identified in the process.",
        "Interestingly, the system of Lim et al.",
        "(2004) represents the context of an argument relative to the syntactic hierarchy by means of relative constituent sequences and syntactic levels.",
        "Concerning lexicalization of the argument, most of the techniques rely on head word rules based on Collins’, or content word rules as in Surdeanu et al.",
        "(2003).",
        "Only Carreras et al.",
        "(2004) decide to use a bag-of-words model, apart from heuristic-based lexicalization.",
        "Regarding the target verb, the voice feature of the verb is generally used, in addition to basic features capturing the form and PoS tag of the verb.",
        "Some systems captured statistics on frequent argument patterns for each predicate.",
        "Also, systems represented the elements in the proximity of the target verb, inspired by local subcategorization patterns of a predicate.",
        "As for features related to a constituent-predicate pair, all systems use the simple feature describing the relative position between them, and to a lesser degree, the distance and the difference in clausal levels.",
        "Again, there is a general tendency to describe the structured path from the argument to the verb.",
        "Its design goes from simple homogeneous sequences of head words or chunks, to more sophisticated paths combining chunks and clauses, and capturing hierarchical properties.",

        "Ten systems have participated to the task, contributing with a variety of standard or novel learning architectures.",
        "The best system, presented by the most experienced group on the task (Hacioglu et al., 2004), achieved a moderate performance of 69.49 at the F1 measure.",
        "It is based on a SVM tagging system, performing IOB decisions on the chunks of the sentence, and exploiting a wide variety of features based on partial syntax.",
        "Most of the systems advance the state-of-the-art on semantic role labeling on the basis of partial syntax.",
        "However, state-of-the-art systems working with full syntax still perform substantially better, although far from a desired behavior for real-task application.",
        "Two questions remain open: which syntactic structures are needed as input for the task, and what other sources of information are required to obtain a real-world, accurate performance.",
        "As a future line, a more thorough experimental evaluation is required to see which are the components that",
        "most contributed to the performance of systems."
