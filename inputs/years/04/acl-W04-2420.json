        "A semantic role in a language is a semantic relationship between a syntactic constituent and a predicate.",
        "The shared task of CoNLL-2004 relates to recognize semantic roles in English (X. Carreras, 2004).",
        "Given a sentence, the task is to analyze a proposition expressed by a target verb of a sentence.",
        "Especially, for each target verb, all constituents in a sentence which fill semantic roles of the verb have to be recognized.",
        "This task is based only on partial parsing information, avoiding use of a full parser and external lexico-semantic knowledge base.",
        "According to previous results of the CoNLL shared task, the POS tagged, chunked, clause identified, and named-entity recognized sentences are given as an input (Figure 1).",
        "SVM is a well-known machine learning algorithm with high generalization performance in high dimensional feature spaces (H. Yamada, 2003).",
        "Also, learning with combination of multiple features is possible by virtue of polynomial kernel functions.",
        "However, since it is a binary classifier, we are often confronted with the unbalanced class distribution problem in a multiclass classification task.",
        "The larger the number of classes, the more severe the problem is.",
        "The semantic role labeling can be formulated as a multiclass classification problem.",
        "If we try to apply SVMs in the semantic role labeling problem, we have to find a method of resolving the unbalanced class distribution problem.",
        "Conceptually, semantic role labeling can be divided into two subtasks: the identification task which finds the boundary of semantic arguments in a given sentence, and the classificiation task which determines the semantic role of the argument.",
        "This provides us a hint of using SVMs with less severe unbalanced class distribution.",
        "In this paper, we present a two-phase semantic role labeling method which consists of an identification phase and a classification phase.",
        "By taking two phase model based on SVMs, we can alleviate the unbalanced class distribution problem.",
        "That is, since we find only the boundary of an argument in the identification phase, the number of classes is decreased into two (ARG, NON-ARG) or three (B -ARG, I-ARG, O).",
        "Therefore, we have to build only one or three SVM classifiers.",
        "We can alleviate the unbalanced class distribution problem by decreasing the number of negative examples, which is much larger than the number of positive exampels without two-phase modeling.",
        "In the classification phase, we classify only the identified argument into a proper semantic role.",
        "This enables us to reduce the computational cost by ignoring the non-argument constitutents.",
        "Since features for identifying arguments are different from features for classifying a role, we need to determine different feature sets appropriate for the tasks.",
        "For identification, we focus on the features to detect the dependency between a constituent and a predicate because the arguments are dependent on the predicate.",
        "For semantic role labeling, we consider both the syntactic and the semantic information such as the sentential form of the target predicate, the head of a constituent, and so on.",
        "In the following sections, we will explain the two phase semantic role labeling method in detail and show some experimental results.",
        "2 Two Phase Semantic Role Labeling based on SVMs We regard the semantic role labeling as a classification problem of a syntactic constituent.",
        "However, a syntactic constituent can be a chunk, or a clause.",
        "Therefore, we have to identify the boundaries of semantic arguments before we assign roles to the arguments."

        "A sequence of chunks or a subclause in the immediate clause of a predicate can be a semantic argument of the predicate.",
        "A chunk or a subclause of the predicate becomes a unit of the constituent of an argument.",
        "The chunks within the subclause are ignored.",
        "For identifying the semantic arguments of a target predicate, it is necessary to find the dependency relation between each constituent and a predicate.",
        "Identifying a dependency relation is important for identifying a subject/object relation (S. Buchholz, 2002) and also for identifying the semantic arguments of a target predicate.",
        "Therefore, the features for finding dependency relations are implicitly represented in the feature set for the identification task.",
        "For implementing the method based on the SVMs, we represent a constituent of an argument with B/I/O notation, and assign one of the following classes to each constituent: B -ARG class representing the beginning of semantic argument, I-ARG class representing a part of a semantic argument, or O class indicating that the constituent does not belong to the semantic arguments.",
        "Because we decide the unit of a constituent as a chunk or a subclause, words except the predicate in the target phrase 1 do not belong to constituent.",
        "Therefore, these words have to be handled independently.",
        "In the training data, we often observed that the beginning of semantic arguments starts from the word right after the predicate.",
        "For the agreement with the chunk boundary, we regard the word following a predicate as the beginning word of a new chunk.",
        "Namely, when the beginning of chunk tag is I, we change I to B.",
        "Also, the words located in front of the predicate in the target phrase are post-processed by 4 hand-crafted rules 2 and 211 automated rules 3 based on frequency in the training data.",
        "In order to restrict the search space in terms of the constituents, we use the clause boundaries.",
        "The left search boundary for identifying the semantic argument is set to the left boundary of the second upper clause, and the right search boundary is set to the right boundary of the immediate clause.",

        "The featue value (0) means that # of POS[“] is equal to # of POS[”].",
        "• path: This is the syntactic path from the predicate to the constituent, and is a symbolic feature comprising all the elements (chunk or subclause) between the predicate and the constituent.",
        "• beginning word’s POS: In the target phrase, these values appear only with VPs and represent the POS of the syntactic head (MD, TO, VB, VBD, VBG, VBN, VBP, VBZ).",
