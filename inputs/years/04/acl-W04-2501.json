        "Our fundamental premise is that progress in Q/A cannot be achieved only by enhancing the processing components, but it also requires generating the best strategies for processing each individual question.",
        "Thus we believe that Q/A systems capable of successfully processing complex questions should employ multiple strategies instead of the current pipeline approach, consisting of (1) question processing, (2) passage retrieval and (3) answer selection.",
        "The pipeline architecture was reported in (Prager et al., 2000; Moldovan et al., 2000; Hovy et al., 2001).",
        "Recently, a novel approach based on combinations of multiple independent agents implementing different answer finding strategies (multi-strategy) and multiple search spaces (multiple-source) was developed by the IBM QA group (Chu-Carroll et al., 2003).",
        "In (Echihabi and Marcu, 2003) another form of combining strategies for advanced QA is proposed: (1) a knowledge-based Q/A implementation based on syntactic/semantic processing is combined using a maximum-entropy framework with (2) a statistical noisy-channel algorithm for Q/A and (3) a pattern-based approach that learn from Web data.",
        "In this project we propose a different form of finding optimal strategies of advanced QA which is based on (a) Question Decomposition, (b) Answer Fusion and feedback from (c) Interactive Q&A and (d) User Background Recognition.",
        "We argue that all this new architectures operate under the assumption that there is a concept-based or pattern-based method for identifying the correct answer for any question that will be processed.",
        "However, we believe that there are complex questions that need first to be decomposed into simple questions, for which concept-based or pattern-based resolving techniques either exists or may be developed.",
        "For instance, when asking Q1: “How have thefts impacted on the safety of Russia’s nuclear navy, and has the theft problem been increased or decreased over time?” we may have series of simpler questions that decompose the question focus.",
        "One such example of simple question is Q1a: “What specific instances of theft do we know about?” – which is a list-question similar to those evaluated in the recent TREC tracks (Harabagiu et al., 2003).",
        "Related, simpler question is Q1b: “What sort of items have been stolen?”.",
        "Question Q1a asks about instantiations of the theft events, whereas question Q1b inquires about the objects of the events.",
        "The decompositions may follow other arguments of the event predicates, e.g. – the agents in Q1c: “Who are the perpetrators of these thefts?” as well as specializations of the events, e.g. “economical impact” specializing one of the possible impacts of the thefts in the question Q1d: “Do thefts have an economical impact on the naval bases?”.",
        "Furthermore, the concepts from the complex question need to be clearly understood, and often definition questions will be considered as decompositions that enable the processing of complex questions.",
        "The definition may involve entities from the complex question, e.g. Q1e: “What is meant by nuclear navy?” or events from the complex question, e.g. Q1f: “What does ‘impact’ mean?” There are several criteria that guide question decomposition, which also determine the answer resolution strategies.",
        "The criteria are:",
        "1.",
        "There are coordinations in the question format, suggesting decompositions along the constituents they coordinate.",
        "Coordinations may exist at: (a) question stem level, e.g. “When and where did the thefts occur?”; (b) at predicate level, e.g. “How does one define an increase or a decrease in the theft problem?”; (c) at argument level, e.g. “To what degree do different thefts put nuclear or radioactive materials at risk?”; (d) at question level, e.g. “What specific instances of theft do we know about, and what are the sources of this information?”.",
        "Question decomposition by identifying coordinations involves: (a) disambiguation of conjunctives for identifying when they indicate separate questions as opposed to when they just coordinate constituents; (b) reference and ellipsis resolution of anaphoric expressions in the original question; (c) recognition of the relations between the resulting, decomposed questions, e.g. contrast, reinforcement, mutual exclusion.",
        "2.",
        "The question asks about (a) a complex relation, e.g. cause-effect, resultative, trend, likelihood, (b) comparison with similar situations, or (c) elaboration of a state of affairs.",
        "Therefore the expected answer type is of complex nature and it requires definitions in the context of the complex scenario.",
        "The expected answer, recognized in a predicate from the question, determines the decomposition into (a) a definition question, (b) specializations of the predicate-concept, and (c) examples.",
        "3.",
        "In order to search for the complex answer, elaborations of its arguments are needed.",
        "Such elaborations, called argument-answer decompositions, may involve (a) nested predicate-argument structures, (b) quantifications, or (c) instantiations.",
        "When a complex question is processed, and is decomposed into a set of simpler questions which are analyzed independently.",
        "Each decomposed question may belong to a different class, for which certain strategies may be optimal.",
        "Such strategies implement the pragmatic processes that interact with the syntactic and semantic information that results from the derivation off (1) expected answer types or structures, (2) name entities which are recognized, as well as (3) syntactic and semantic dependencies derived from the parsing of the question into predicate-argument structures.",
        "To be able to process the question precisely we are developing techniques that leverage a database of one million questions that have answers in a controlled corpus.",
        "This large database provides wide coverage of answer types and answer instances.",
        "It also enhances the retrieval, navigation and fusion of partial answers.",
        "The challenge of creating a set of approximately one million question and answer pairs are twofold.",
        "First, the pairs need to be diverse in terms of difficulty, where difficulty can be defined in terms of answer type complexity (common, uncommon, requiring decomposition), answer granularity (concentrated within a small fragment or spread across several passages and documents), ease of matching (requiring both surface-text and deep semantic understanding).",
        "Second, the pairs should be reliable, i.e. each question must be associated with a correct answer.",
        "Our solution is a combination of collection and generation from semi-structured resources, followed by expansion and validation.",
        "We will generate the collection of QA pairs from Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) files on various topics.",
        "We will develop a dedicated harvesting algorithm to identify FAQ's on the Web and extract the QA pairs.",
        "The large database of questions also allows us to create a benchmark that will support the development of statistical techniques for Q/A.",
        "The architecture of the benchmark system is illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "Our system selects answers based on (1) question processing strategies; (2) passage retrieval strategies made possible by (3) question decomposition and (4) answer fusion.",
        "When a question is posed to the system, it is either decomposed on a set of simpler questions or it is processed in parallel with similar questions provided by the Interactive Question Answering component.",
        "Based on the user background, a set of similar questions may be selected and analyzed in parallel.",
        "Multiple strategies are available for retrieving relevant passages.",
        "The possible selections are once again dictated by feedback from",
        "interactions with the user.",
        "The relevant passages may also be combined on the basis of the same interactive and background information.",
        "We propose to study and develop several kernel methods that can operate in Support Vector Machines for determining the optimal strategies and compare the results with the Maximum Entropy combinations reported in (Echihabi and Marcu, 2003).",
        "The answer is produced by an answer fusion module that uses fusion operators.",
        "Since such operators are template-like, pattern acquisition methods may be employed for acquiring them.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "The answer fusion strategies are presented in Section 2.",
        "Section 3details the methods for bootstrapping Question Answering.",

        "Although all human systems of communication represent negation in some format, the issue of how best to address negation in open-domain Q/A still remains an open research question.",
        "Previous Q/A systems have dealt with negation by filtering the retrieved answer and eliminating answers that share key terms with the query but are irrelevant for the reasons of negation (Martino-vic, 2002; Attardi et al., 2001) or by constructing relational databases to query the answers can handle negation in the question since the scope is clearly defined in the relational database (Jung and Lee, 2001).",
        "However, neither of these systems has dealt with the central problem that negation poses for Q/A: determining the scope of the negation context.",
        "Consider the following examples: a.",
        "Which countries did not vote for the Iraq war resolution in the Security Council?",
        "b.",
        "Which countries did not provide help to the coalition during the Gulf War in 1991?",
        "c. What planets have no moon?",
        "In question (a), the scope of negation only includes the countries that were members of the Security Council during the Iraq war resolution that were able to vote but did not.",
        "However, examples (b) and (c) are ambiguous with respect to the scope of negation.",
        "In question (b), the scope could encompass the whole world, or all the countries in the Middle East that should have provided help but did not.",
        "In question (c), even more entities can be included under the scope of negation: all of the planets in the solar system or even all of the planets in the entire universe (including planets that are not yet discovered).",
        "In order for a Q/A system to answer questions like (b) or (c), the scope of negation must first be determined.",
        "We initially propose to develop empirical studies for recognizing the most frequent cases of negation: e.g. the “no” negation – “with no terrorists, the world would be safer”, the “nothing” negation – “the inspectors found nothing”, and other core cases of local negation – e.g. “thefts did not occur at the beginning”.",
        "We shall complement our methods of recognizing negation in textual sentences by analyzing various syntactic and semantic contexts of negation, e.g. adverbial negation – “the president never leaves the White House without the Secret Service approval”.",
        "In addition, we assume that when a speaker is formulating a question to find out whether a proposition is true or false, s/he formulates the question with the form of the proposition which would be the most informative if it turned out to be true.",
        "We expect that if a question has the form of negation, the speaker believes that the negative answer is the most informative.",
        "Using such hypotheses, we argue that in a negation question, if the scope is ambiguous, like in (b) or (c), then we can solve the ambiguity by choosing the scope that will be more informative for the user.",
        "Given these assumptions, we propose that negation can be addressed in Q/A in three ways: By using the user background.",
        "In questions like (b) above, if the user background is terrorism, then we can limit the scope of the countries to those who have been linked to terrorism.",
        "By interacting with the user.",
        "If no user background can be established, as in question (c), we expect to use dialogue techniques to enable the user can specify the relevant scope.",
        "By finding cues from the answers to the positive question.",
        "Finally, we expect to be able to use a combination of heuristics and information extraction methods to deduce the answer to a negative question from the answers to the corresponding positive question.",
        "For example, when searching for the answer to the positive analog of question (c), we can limit the scope of the negation to the solar systems where there are planets with moons."

        "In this position paper we discuss several strategies that enhance the pragmatic process involved in the interpretation and resolution of complex questions.",
        "In support of our claims we present a Q/A architecture used to benchmark the impact of (1) question decompositions following several criteria; (2) answer fusion which composes a unique, coherent answer from the partial answers extracted for each decomposed question; (3) modeling of user background and (4) processing of negation in questions and/or answers.",
        "Additionally, we present a bootstrapping algorithm that enhances the precision of factual Q/A.",
        "We argue that each of these enhancements would allow us to advance the state-of-the-art in Q/A and will enable us to correctly process complex questions."
