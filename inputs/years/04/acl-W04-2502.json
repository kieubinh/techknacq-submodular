        "Current Question Answering systems extract answers from large text collections by (1) classifying questions by the answer type they expect; (2) using question keywords or patterns associated with questions to identify candidate answer passages and (3) ranking the candidate answers to decide which passage contains the exact answer.",
        "A few systems also justify the answer, by performing abduction in first-order predicate logic [Moldovan et al., 2003].",
        "This paradigm is limited by the assumption that the answer can be found because it uses the question words.",
        "Although this may happen sometimes, this assumption does not cover the many cases where an informative answer is missed because its identification requires more sophisticated semantic processing than named entity recognition and the identification of an answer type.",
        "Therefore access to rich semantic structures derived from questions and answers will enable the retrieval of more accurate answers as well as inference processes that explain the validity and contextual coverage of answers.",
        "Several stages of deeper semantic processing may be considered for processing complex questions.",
        "A first step in this direction is the incorporation of “semantic parsers” or identifiers of predicate argument structures in the processing of both questions and documents.",
        "Processing complex questions consists of: (1) a syntactic parse of the question and of the document collection; (2) Named Entity recognition that along with the syntactic parse enable (3) the identification of predicate-argument structures; and (4) identification of the answer types, which no longer consist of simple concepts, but rather complex conceptual structures, and (5) keywords extraction that allows candidate answers to be identified.",
        "Document processing is performed by indexing and retrieval that uses three forms of semantic information: (1) Classes of named entities; (2) Predicate-argument structures and (3) Ontologies of possible answer types.",
        "Additionally, as more complex semantic structures are evoked by the question and recognized in documents, indexing and retrieval models are enhanced by taking into account conceptual schemas and topic models.",
        "Answer processing is concerned with the recognition of the answer structure, which is a natural extension of recognizing exact answers when they are represented as single concepts.",
        "Since many times the answer is merged from several sources, enhanced answer processing also requires a set of special operators for answer fusion.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 presents question processing that uses deeper semantic resources.",
        "Section 3 details the methods for answer extraction whereas Section 4 describes methods for representing and reasoning with rich semantic structures.",

        "Given the size of today’s very large document repositories, one can expect that any complex topic will be covered from multiple points of view.",
        "This feature is exploited by the question decomposition techniques, which generate a set of multiple questions in order to cover all of the possible interpretations of a complex topic.",
        "However, a set of decomposed questions may end up producing a disparate (and potentially contradictory) set of answers.",
        "In order for Q/A systems to use these collections of answers to their advantage, answer fusion must be performed in order to identify a single, unique, and coherent answer.",
        "We view answer fusion as a three-step process.",
        "First, an open-domain, template-based answer formalization is constructed based on predicate-argument frames.",
        "Second, a probabilistic model is trained to detect relations between the extracted templates.",
        "Finally, a set of template merging operators are introduced to construct the merged answer.",

        "The system functionality is demonstrated with the example illustrated in Figure 3.",
        "Our method first converts the extracted answers into a series of open-domain templates, which are based on predicate-argument frames (Surdeanu et al., 2003).",
        "The next component detects generic inter-template relations.",
        "Typical “greedy” approaches in Information Extraction (Hobbs et al., 1997; Surdeanu and Harabagiu, 2002) use heuristics that favor proximity for template merging.",
        "The example in Figure 3 proves that this is not always the best decision, even for templates that share the same predicate and have compatible slots.",
        "Processing complex questions involves the identification of several forms of complex semantic structures.",
        "Namely we need to first recognize the answer type that is expected, which is a rich semantic structure, in the case of complex question or a mere concept in the case of a factual question.",
        "At least three forms of information are needed for detecting the answer type: (1) question classes and named entity classes; (2) syntactic dependency information, enabling the recognition of (3) predicate-argument structures.",
        "Each of the following three",
        "questions illustrates the significance of the three forms of semantic information in question processing: For question Q-Ex1, the question stem “when” indicates that the answer type is a temporal unit, eventually expressed as a date.",
        "To find candidate answers, the recognition of India and other related named entities, e.g. Indian, as well as the name of the Prithvi missile or of its related program are important.",
        "Named entity recognition is also important for processing question Q-Ex2, because not only “North Korea” needs to be recognized as a country, but names of other countries need to be identified in the candidate answer paragraph.",
        "Processing question Q-Ex2 involves syntactic information as well, e.g. the identification of the complex nominal “missile launch pad metals”.",
        "To better process question Q-Ex2, additional semantic information in the form of predicate arguments structures enables the recognition of the answer type more precisely.",
        "Instead of looking only for country names when processing the documents, a search for countries that export missile launch pad metals or of counties from which North Korea imports such commodities refines the search space.",
        "This is made possible by the transformation of question Q-Ex2 in the structure illustrated in Figure 2.",
        "The role set for the arguments of predicate “import” was used as it is currently defined in the PropBank project.",
        "Predicate-argument structures are also essential to the processing of question Q-Ex3, because the question is too ambiguous.",

        "The predicate-argument structure illustrated in Figure 3 indicates that the answer may have the role of the agent or even the role of the instrument.",
        "When semantic information from FrameNet is also used, Figure 4 shows that the answer may have in fact four other semantic roles.",
        "To illustrate the semantic knowledge that needs to be recognized and the inference process that they enable, we shall use one of the questions employed in the AQUAINT Pilot 2 for Dialog Processing of CNS Scenarios, illustrated in Figure 5.",
        "Processing Q-Sem cannot be done by simply using the question stem “how” to identify manners of detection or even by employing the predicate-argument structure illustrated in Figure 6.",
        "The answer contains a single troponym of the verb “detect”, namely “look at”, and the agent is “Milton Leitenberg, an expert on biological weapons”.",
        "However returning the name of Milton Leitenberg as the answer is not informative enough.",
        "Instead of relying only on the question stem and the predicate-argument structure, question processing takes advantage of a more complex semantic structure made available by the enhanced architecture: the topic model.",
        "The topic model contributes to the interpretation of the only argument fully specified in the predicate-argument structure illustrated in Figure 6, namely Arg1 representing the “detected” role, expressed as “the biological weapons program”.",
        "The interpretation of this complex nominal is made possible by two semantic representations: (1) the typical connections in the topic model; and (2) the possible paths of action characterizing the topical model as represented in Figure 6.",
        "Figure 6 lists only two of the semantic representation typical of the scenario defined in Figure 8, namely typical connections between events and entities or between events.",
        "A special kind of relations between events is represented by the possible paths of action.",
        "The two paths of actions that are listed in Figure 6 enable the two interpretations of the detected object.",
        "It is to be noted that such semantic knowledge as the one represented in the topic model is not available from WordNet or FrameNet at present, and thus need to be encoded and made accessible to the Q/A system.",
