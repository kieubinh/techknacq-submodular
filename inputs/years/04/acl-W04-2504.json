        "The capability to interpret and answer questions based on context is important.",
        "For example, Figure 1 shows an example of a series of context questions.",
        "In this example, the interpretation of Q2 and Q4 depends on the resolution of “it” and “this” from the context respectively.",
        "Although neither Q3 nor Q6 requires any anaphora resolution, the interpretation of Q3 depends on Q2 while the interpretation of Q6 depends solely on itself.",
        "Furthermore, in Q5, there are no explicit references.",
        "Its interpretation depends on a preceding question (e.g.,Q4), however, in a different manner.",
        "This example indicates that interpreting each of these questions and extracting answers needs to be situated in a particular context as the QA session proceeds.",
        "There are situations where a question is “complete” enough and its interpretation does not depend on the previous questions (Q6).",
        "There are also situations where the interpretation of a question depends on preceding questions no matter whether it requires anaphora or ellipsis resolution.",
        "Based on these observations, a natural question to ask is what makes the use of discourse differently in different situations?",
        "What is the role of discourse in context question answering?",
        "To address these questions, a key issue, in our mind, is that every question and its answer have a discourse status with respect to an entire QA session.",
        "This discourse status includes two aspects.",
        "The first aspect relates to discourse roles of entities in a question and the corresponding answer.",
        "Entities (such as noun phrase, verb phrase, preposition phrase, etc) in a question carry distinctive roles that indicate what is the topic or focus of a question in terms of the overall information seeking discourse.",
        "Topic relates to the “aboutness” of a question and focus relates to a specific perspective of the topic.",
        "The second aspect of discourse status relates to discourse transitions that indicate how discourse roles are changed from one question to another as the interaction proceeds and how such changes reflect the progress of user information needs.",
        "Both discourse roles and discourse transitions determine whether the context is useful, and if so, how to use the context to interpret a question.",
        "This paper takes an initial attempt to investigate the discourse status for context question answering.",
        "In particular, it motivates a semantic-rich discourse representation that captures both discourse roles of a question and discourse transitions between questions.",
        "Through examples, this paper further discusses the potential impact of this refined discourse structure on context question answering."

        "In context question answering, each question is situated in a context.",
        "In addition to the semantic information carried by important syntactic entities (such as noun phrase, verb phrase, preposition phrase, etc), each question also carries distinctive discourse roles with respect to the whole question answering discourse.",
        "Specifically, the discourse roles can be categorized based on both the informational and intentional perspectives of discourse (Hobbs, 1996), as well as the presentation aspect of both questions and answers.",
        "The intentional perspective relates to the purpose of a question.",
        "In a fully interactive question answering environment, instead of asking questions, a user may need to reply to a clarification question prompted by the system or may need to simply ask for a confirmation.",
        "Therefore, it is important to capture the intention from the user (Grosz and Sidner 1986).",
        "The informational perspective relates to the information content of a question, in particular, the topic and the focus based on the semantics of the content.",
        "In addition to the intentional and informational aspects, there is also a presentational aspect of discourse that relates to both the input modality (i.e., questions) and the output modality (i.e., answers).",
        "For example, a user may explicitly ask for images or pictures of a person or event.",
        "The presentation aspect is particularly important to facilitate multimodal multimedia question answering.",
        "Therefore, for a given question, three types of discourse roles: Intent, Content, and Media can be captured to reflect the intentional, informational, and presentational perspectives of discourse respectively.",
        "These discourse roles can be further characterized by a set of features.",
        "For example, Intent can be represented by Act and Motivator, where Act indicates whether the user is requesting information from the system or replying to a system question.",
        "Motivator corresponds to the information goal as to what type of action is expected from the system, for example, whether information retrieval or confirmation (Chai et al., 2003).",
        "We will not elaborate Intent here since it has been widely modeled for most dialog systems.",
        "Content can be characterized as Target, Topic and Focus.",
        "Target indicates the expected answer type such as whether it should be a proposition (e.g., for why and how questions), or a specific type of entity (e.g., TIME and PLACE).",
        "Topic indicates the “aboutness” or the scope related to a question.",
        "Focus indicates the current focus of attention given a particular topic.",
        "Focus always refers to a particular aspect of Topic.",
        "Since the informational perspective of discourse should capture the semantics of what has been conveyed, Topic and Focus are linked with the semantic information of a question, for example, semantic roles as described in (Gildea and Jurafsky 2002).",
        "Semantic roles concern with the roles of constitutes in a question in terms of its predicate-argument structure.",
        "The discourse roles link the semantic roles of individual questions together with respect to the discourse progress through Topic and Focus.",

        "Activity can be further categorized by ActType, Participant, and Peripheral.",
        "ActType indicates the type of the activity; Participant indicates entities that are participating in the activity with different semantic roles.",
        "Peripheral captures auxiliary information such",
        "as the time, place, purpose, and reason for such an activity.",
        "Entity can be categorized by SemRole, SemType, Id, Element, and Constraint.",
        "SemRole indicates the semantic role of the entity in a particular activity (if any).",
        "SemType represents the semantic type of the entity.",
        "Element indicates the specific features associated with the entity.",
        "Constraint specifies the constraints need to be satisfied to identify the entity, and Id specifies the particular identifier of the entity that particularly corresponds to pronouns, demonstratives, and definite noun phrases.",
        "Media indicates the desired information media, which can be further characterized as Format and Genre as shown in Figure 2.",
        "Format indicates whether it is an image, a table, or text, etc.",
        "Genre specifies the answer needs such as summary or list.",
        "If it is a list, how many should be in the list as in the question “number ten largest cities in the world.” Figure 2 shows the representation of discourse roles of Q1 using typed feature structures (Carpenter 1992), where Intent indicates that the user is requesting for the system to retrieve an answer.",
        "Topic indicates the topic of Q1 is a Destroy Activity, which has two participants.",
        "The first participant is some kind of unknown volcano that takes the role of Agent in the activity (i.e., the destroyer).",
        "The second participant is the city of Pompeii that takes the role of Theme indicating the thing destroyed.",
        "The Focus of Q1 is about the name (i.e., Element) of the entity in the first participant (i.e., Participant1) in the Topic representation.",
        "The granularity of discourse roles can be varied.",
        "The finer the granularity, the better is the use of context for inference (as discussed later).",
        "However, the finer granularity also implies deeper semantic processing.",
        "This semantic rich representation can be used to generate other representations such as queries based on weighted terms for information retrieval or logical forms for deduction and inference (Waldinger et al., 2003).",

        "TREC 10 Question Answering Track initiated a context-task that was designed to investigate the system capability to track context through a series of questions.",
        "As described in (Voorhees 2001), there were two unexpected results of this task.",
        "First, the ability to identify the correct answer to a question in the later series had no correlation with the capability to identify correct answers to preceding questions.",
        "Second, since the first question in a series already restricted answers to a small set of documents, the performance was determined by whether the system could answer a particular type of question, rather than the ability to track context.",
        "Because of these unexpected results, the context task has been stopped in the following TREC evaluations (Voorhees 2002).",
        "The reasons that TREC 10 did not achieve the expected results, in our opinion, lie in two aspects.",
        "The first aspect relates to the uniqueness of open domain context question answering.",
        "In open domain QA, first, there may be many occurrences of correct answers in various part(s) of document(s).",
        "Second, there may be multiple paths (e.g., different combination of key query terms) that can lead to one occurrence of the correct answer.",
        "Therefore, the correct answer to a previous question may not be critical in finding answers to subsequent questions.",
        "This phenomenon may provide an opportunity to find answers without explicitly modeling context (i.e., by keeping track of the discourse objects from answers), but rather identifying and using relevant context.",
        "For example, in the LCC system (that achieved the best result for the context task in TREC 10), the discourse was not explicitly represented (Harabagiu et al. 2001).",
        "Instead of resolving references using discourse information, the LCC system first identifies the question that contains the potential referents and uses those questions and the current question to identify the target paragraph.",
        "Thus, question interpretation does not depend on the answers, but rather depends on the context that is dynamically identified as a list of preceding questions.",
        "Now the question is whether the system will achieve even better results (e.g., correctly find answers to the rest of the eight questions) with some context representation?",
        "Another more important question to be asked is whether the design of the context task just happened to provide an opportunity to achieve good results without modeling the context.",
        "As discussed in (Harabagiu et al., 2001), answers to 85% of context questions actually occurred within the same paragraph as the answers to the previous questions.",
        "Therefore, just using preceding questions, the system was able to find the target paragraph and the final answer really depended on the capability to identify different types of answers in that paragraph.",
        "What if a series of questions were designed differently so that questions are related but answers are scattered in different documents or paragraphs.",
        "Will the shallow processing of discourse succeed in finding the answers?",
        "Furthermore, the ultimate goal of QA systems is to be able to access information from different sources (e.g., unstructured text or structured database) and to provide intelligent dialog capability.",
        "One important question we need to address is what kind of discourse representation will be sufficient to support these capabilities?",
        "For example, to access structured databases, the answer to a previous question usually narrows down the search spaces in the database for subsequent questions.",
        "Thus, previous answers usually determine where in the database an answer can be found.",
        "Therefore, it is important to keep track of previous questions and answers in some kind of structure for later use.",
        "The second reason that TREC 10 did not achieve expected results relates to evaluation methodology.",
        "In context QA, good performance depends on two important components: the capability of representing and using the relevant context (both explicitly or implicitly) and the general capability of interpreting questions and extracting answers.",
        "The level of sophistication in either component will influence the final performance.",
        "Thus, by comparing the final answers to each context question, the evaluation of the context task in TREC 10 was not able to isolate the effect of one component from another.",
        "It is not feasible to identify that when an answer is not identified, whether it is because of poor representation and use of the discourse information or it is because of the general limitations of the capability to process certain types of questions.",
        "Therefore, to study the role of discourse in context question answering, a more controlled evaluation mechanism is desired.",
        "For example, one approach is to keep the general processing capability as a constant and vary the representations of discourse and strategies to use the discourse so that their different impacts on the final answer extraction can be learned.",
        "As a summary, the experience in the TREC 10 context task is very valuable.",
        "It does not discount the importance of context modeling for context questions.",
        "But rather, it motivates a more in-depth investigation of the role of discourse in context question answering."

        "Given recent advances in text-based domain independent semantic processing and discourse parsing, as well as the availability of rich semantic knowledge sources, we believe it is the time to start from the other end of the spectrum to examine the possibility and impact of semantic-rich discourse representation for open-domain question answering."
