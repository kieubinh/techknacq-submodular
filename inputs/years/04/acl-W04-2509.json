        "Open-domain question answering technologies allow users to ask a question in natural language and obtain the answer itself rather than a list of documents that contain the answer.",
        "These technologies make it possible to retrieve information itself rather than merely documents, and will lead to new styles of information access (Voorhees, 2000).",
        "The recent research on open-domain question answering concentrates on answering factoid questions one by one in isolation from each other.",
        "Such systems that answer isolated factoid questions are the most basic level of question answering technologies, and will lead to more sophisticated technologies that can be used by professional reporters and information analysts.",
        "On some stage of that sophistication, a cub reporter writing an article on a specific topic will be able to translate the main issue addressed by his report into a set of simpler questions and then pose those questions to the question answering system (Burger et al., 2001).",
        "In addition, there is a relation between multi-document summarization and question answering.",
        "In his lecture, Eduard Hovy mentioned that multi-document summarization may be able to be reduced into a series of question answering (Hovy, 2001).",
        "In SUMMAC, an intrinsic evaluation was conducted which measures the extent to which a summary provides answers to a set of obligatory questions on a given topic (Mani et al., 1998).",
        "Those suggest such question answering systems that can answer a series of related questions would surely be a useful aid to summarization work by human and by machine.",
        "Against this background, question answering systems need to be able to answer a series of questions, which have a common topic and/or share a local context.",
        "In this paper, we propose a challenge to measure objectively and quantitatively such an ability of question answering systems.",
        "We call this challenge QACIAD (Question Answering Challenge for Information Access Dialogue).",
        "In this challenge, question answering systems are used interactively to participate in dialogues for accessing information.",
        "Such information access dialogue occurs such as when gathering information for a report on a specific topic, or when browsing information of interest to the user.",
        "Actually, in QACIAD, the interaction is only simulated and systems answer a series of questions in a batch mode.",
        "Although such a simulation may neglect the inherent dynamics of dialogue, it is a practical compromise for objective evaluation and, as a result, the test sets of the challenge are reusable.",
        "Question answering systems need a wide range of abilities in order to participate in information access dialogues (Burger et al., 2001).",
        "First, the systems must respond in real time to make interaction possible.",
        "They must also properly interpret a given question within the context of a specific dialogue, and also be cooperative by adding appropriate information not mentioned explicitly by the user.",
        "Moreover, the systems should be able to pose a question for clarification to resolve ambiguity concerning the user’s goal and intentions, and to participate in mixed initiative dialogue by making suggestions and leading the user toward solving the problem.",
        "Among these various capabilities, QACIAD focuses on the most fundamental aspect of dialogue, that is, interpreting a given question within the context of a specific dialogue.",
        "It measures context processing abilities of systems such as anaphora resolution and ellipses handling.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "The next chapter explains the design of QACIAD.",
        "The following three chapters discuss the reality of the challenge.",
        "First, we explain the process of constructing the test set of the challenge and introduce the results of a study conducted during this process which show the validity of QACIAD.",
        "That is, QACIAD measures valid abilities needed for participating in information access dialogues.",
        "In other words, the ability measured by the challenge is crucial to the systems for realizing information access dialogues for writing reports and summaries.",
        "Second, we show the statistics of pragmatic phenomena in the constructed test set, and demonstrate that the challenge covers a wide variety of pragmatic phenomena observed in real dialogues.",
        "Third, based on a preliminary analysis of the QACIAD run, we show that the challenge has a proper difficulty for evaluating the current state of open-domain question answering technologies.",
        "In the last two chapters, we discuss problems identified while constructing the test set and conducting the run, and draw some conclusions."

        "The origin of QACIAD comes from QAC1 (Question Answering Challenge), one of the tasks of the NTCIR3 workshop conducted from March 2001 through October 2002 (NTCIR, 2001).",
        "QACIAD was originally proposed in March 2001 as the third subtask of QAC 1, its formal run was conducted in May 2002 (Fukumoto et al., 2001; Fukumoto et al., 2002; Fukumoto et al., 2003), and the results were reported at the NTCIR3 workshop meeting in October 2002.",
        "The current design of QACIAD reported in this paper is based on that challenge and is the result of extensive elaboration.",
        "The design of the challenge and construction of the test set were performed from January 2003 through December 2003.",
        "The formal run was conducted in December 2003, as a subtask of QAC2, which in turn is a task of the NTCIR4 workshop (NTCIR, 2003)."

        "QAC is a challenge for evaluating question answering technologies in Japanese.",
        "It consists of three subtasks including QACIAD, and the common scope of those subtasks covers factoid questions that have names as answers.",
        "Here, names mean not only names of proper items (named entities) including date expressions and monetary values, but also common names such as names of species and names of body parts.",
        "Although the syntactical range of the names approximately corresponds to compound nouns, some of them, such as the titles of novels and movies, deviate from that range.",
        "The underlying document set consists of two years of articles of two newspapers in QAC2, and one newspaper in QAC1.",
        "Using those documents as the data source, the systems answer various open-domain questions.",
        "From the outset, QAC has focused on question answering technologies that can be used as components of larger intelligent systems and technologies that can handle realistic problems.",
        "It persists in requesting exact answers rather than the text snippets that contain them with the cost of avoiding handling definition questions and why questions, because such answers are crucial in order to be used as inputs to other intelligent systems such as multi-document summarization systems.",
        "Moreover, as such a situation is considered to be more realistic, the systems must collect all the possible correct answers and detect the absence of an answer.",
        "Therefore two subtasks, one of which is QACIAD, request systems to return one list of answers that contains all and only correct answers, while the other subtask requests systems to return a ranked list of possible answers as in TREC-8.",
        "In both subtasks, the presence of answers in the underlying documents is not guaranteed and the number of answers is not specified, so these subtasks are similar to the list question task in the TREC-2003 style rather than the TREC-10 style (TREC, 2003)."

        "Gathering Type The user has a concrete objective such as writing a report and summary on a specific topic, and asks a system a series of questions all concerning that topic.",

        "For example, whereas questions asking where, such as “Where was Shakespeare born?”, could be answered by a place name, questions like “Where do lobsters like to live?” need a description and not a proper name as the answer.",

        "Although such cases happened in other combinations of categories, those questions were categorized into a more complex category as only the border of names and descriptions are important in the current analysis.",
        "As Table 2 shows, 58% to 72% of questions could be answered by names.",
        "The amount of those questions is almost same as the amount of 4W questions, since while some 4W questions could not be answered by names, some definition and explanation questions might be able to be answered by names.",

        "The rank of the systems somewhat changes by this approximation, as some systems benefit from this approximation and others do not.",
        "Based on this criterion, the best system answered correctly 45% of the questions, which is inadequate for practical use.",
        "However, the result shows that this challenge is not too hard and desperate, though it is challenging for existing question answering technologies.",
        "The mean modified F measures for the strictly gathering type, other gathering type, and browsing type are shown in Figure 5.",
        "For the majority, the questions in the browsing type series are more difficult to answer, as anticipated."

        "With existing technologies, which still have room for study for answering ordinary questions without pragmatic processing and particularly remain inadequate for answering list questions correctly, QACIAD cannot easily independently evaluate the context processing abilities from other general abilities concerning question answering.",
        "The ability that QACIAD measures is a combination of several kinds of abilities concerning question answering for handling information access dialogues.",
        "Although this may be desirable and an objective of QACIAD, sometime we need an isolated evaluation of context processing.",
        "In order to fulfill this need, we devised two types of accompanying test sets for reference.",
        "The first reference test set consists of isolated questions, that is, not in series, obtained from questions of the original test set by manually resolving all anaphoric expressions including zero anaphora.",
        "The second reference test set consists of isolated questions obtained from questions of the original test set by mechanically removing anaphoric expressions.",
        "Though most of the questions in the second test set are semantically under-specified, such as asking a birthday without specifying whose one, all the questions are syntactically well formed in the case of Japanese.",
        "The first reference test set measures the ceiling of the context processing in a given original test set, while the second measures the floor.",
        "These are only for reference, since there are several ways of resolving anaphora and context processing sometimes makes thing worse.",
        "Nevertheless, the reference test sets should be useful for analyzing the characteristics of technologies used by the participant systems.",
        "We are now analyzing the results of the run on those reference test sets for our current test set, and will present the results in due course.",
        "As described above, we believe that the task setting in QACIAD is real, even though this is not clear from the evaluation method.",
        "There are two major problems.",
        "The first concerns the F measure.",
        "First, the F measure cannot be calculated until the number of correct answers is fixed, which means the value of the F measure changes when a new correct answer is found.",
        "This makes the evaluation cumbersome.",
        "Especially in question answering, as the number of correct answers is usually relatively small, the recall rate sometimes falls to half if a minor alternative answer is found to a question that had been assumed to have only one correct answer.",
        "Even worse, some questions have more than one way of enumerating correct answers.",
        "For example, to a question asking for the sites of a ski jump competition, a system may answer six city names, and another system may answer three country names.",
        "Neither are wrong.",
        "A system could even answer four city names and one country name.",
        "We need a principle for handling such cases.",
        "In TREC-2003 this problem were cleverly avoided by carefully checking the question3.",
        "The second and more serious problem comes from handling dialogues.",
        "As mentioned above, whether an answer is correct or not is determined by human interpretation of a given question within the given context and is not affected by a system’s interpretation and the answers it returned to the previous questions.",
        "Many feel that this evaluation criterion is somewhat peculiar.",
        "As mentioned in the example in chapter 2.5, in series 22, the answer to the second question, 1923, is considered correct even if the system wrongly answered the Shea stadium to the first question.",
        "This is not completely absurd because that system may manage the context intensionally, in which case the system may interpret the second question as “When was the home to the New York Yankees built?” It is doubtful, however, whether such a “correct” answer has any value in practice.",
        "This problem shows the importance of cooperative response.",
        "It may be effective to change the style of answering from a current list of answers to answers with additional information.",
        "In this example, it would be better to answer “The Yankee stadium was built in 1923”, and the correctness of answers should be judged by including this additional information.",
        "The difficult and remaining problem is to formalize this type of cooperative response to a sufficient level for use in objective evaluations like QACIAD."
