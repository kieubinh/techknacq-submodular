        "Question Answering (QA) systems (as QA track of the Text Retrieval Conference (TREC-QA) competitions (Voorhees 2001)), are able both to understand questions in natural language and to produce answers in the form of selected paragraphs extracted from very large collections of text.",
        "Generally, they are open-domain systems, and do not rely on specialised conceptual knowledge as they use a mixture of statistical techniques and shallow linguistic analysis.",
        "Ontological Question Answering systems, e.g. (Woods et al.",
        "1972, Zajac 2000) propose to attack the problem by means of an internal unambiguous knowledge representation.",
        "As any knowledge intensive application, ontological QA systems have as intrinsic limitation related to the small scale of the underlying syntactic-semantic models of natural language.",
        "While limitations are well-known, we are still questioning if any improvement has occurred since the development of the first ontological QA system LUNAR.",
        "Several important facts have emerged that could influence related research approaches: a growing availability of lexical knowledge bases that model and structure words: WordNet (Miller 1995) and EuroWordNet (Vossen 1998) among others; some open-domain QA systems have proven the usefulness of these resources, e.g. WordNet in the system described in (Harabagiu et al.",
        "2001).",

        "2003).",
        "Given this background, we are investigating a new approach to ontology-based QA in which users ask questions in natural language to knowledge bases of facts extracted from a federation of Web sites and organised in topic map repositories (Garshol 2003).",
        "Our approach is being investigated in the context of EU project MOSES1, with the explicit objective of developing an ontology-based methodology to search, create, maintain and adapt semantically structured Web contents according to the vision of the Semantic Web.",
        "MOSES is taking advantage of expertise coming from several fields: software agent technology, NLP, graph theory",
        "and text mining.",
        "The test-bed chosen in the project is related to the development of an ontology-based knowledge management system and an ontology-based search engine that will both accept questions and produce answers in natural language for the Web sites of two European universities.",
        "The challenges of the project are: building an ontological QA system; developing a multilingual environment which implies the ability to treat several languages, and, importantly, several conceptualisations.",
        "In this paper, after briefly describing how the project is trying to comply with the semantic Web vision, we will focus on question processing, and in particular on the way in which NLP techniques and ontological knowledge interact in order to support questions to specific sites or to site federations.",
        "An ontology-based approach to question answering In our ontological QA system, both questions and domain knowledge are represented by the same ontological language.",
        "It is foreseen to develop the QA system in two steps.",
        "First a prototypical implementation is planned to answer questions related to the current “state-of-affairs” of the site to which the question is posed.",
        "In a second step, given a “federation” of sites within the same domain, we will investigate whether and how an ontological approach could support QA across the sites.",
        "Answering a question can then be seen as a collaborative task between ontological nodes belonging to the same QA system.",
        "Since each node has its own version of the domain ontology, the task of passing a question from node to node may be reduced to a mapping task between (similar) conceptual representations.",
        "To make such an approach feasible, a number of difficult problems must still be solved.",
        "In this paper, we will provide details on how: to build on existing ontologies and interface between them and language resources; to interpret questions wrt the ontological language; to model the mapping task for federated questions."
