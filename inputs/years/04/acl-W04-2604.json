        "There is currently much interest in training supervised systems to perform shallow semantic annotation tasks such as word sense tagging and semantic role labeling.",
        "These systems are typically trained on annotated corpora such as the Penn Treebank [Marcus1994], and perform best when they are tested on data from the same genre.",
        "A more long-term goal is to develop systems that will perform equally well on diverse genres, and that will also be able to perform additional, more complex, semantic annotation tasks.",
        "With this end in mind, we have been manually developing a large-scale, general purpose hierarchical verb lexicon that, in addition to links to WordNet senses [Miller 1985, Fellbaum1998], has explicit and detailed syntactic and semantic information associated with each entry.",
        "Much of the syntactic information is derived from the Levin verb classes, although the classification has been extended and modified.",
        "Sets of syntactic frames are associated with each verb class, and specific prepositions are often listed as well.",
        "We are interested in evaluating how well our lexicon predicts syntactic frames in naturally occurring data.",
        "This will give us an estimate of its likely usefulness in extending the coverage of systems trained on one genre to other genres.",
        "This paper presents a comparison between our hierarchical verb lexicon, VerbNet [Kipper et al.2000, Dang et al.2000], and a corpus annotated semantically with predicate-argument structure, Prop-Bank [Kingsbury and Palmer2002].",
        "We briefly describe an experiment which established a baseline for the syntactic coverage of the verb lexicon and more extensively we compare and discuss the preposition mismatches found while doing this evaluation.",
        "We used this experiment, which used almost 50,000 verb instances, to measure how well the linguistic intuitions motivating our verb lexicon are attested to in the actual data.",
        "It allowed us to determine which of the expected syntactic frames and specific prepositions occur and which do not, and also look for unexpected occurrences.",
        "Although prepositions are generally described as restrictions on syntax, their significance goes far beyond that of a syntactic restriction.",
        "Verb-preposition relations can also allow us to make predictions about the semantic contents of a verb-frame.",
        "The mapping between the two resources was done by assigning verb classes to the different senses in PropBank and by assigning the thematic roles used to describe VerbNet classes to argument roles of PropBank.",
        "The criteria used for matches includes both a notion of exact frame match where the encountered preposition was explicitly listed in the frame, as well as a more relaxed notion of frame match that allows alternative prepositions.",
        "We found that under the former, our lexicon correctly predicts over 78% of all the syntactic frames found in PropBank, while under the latter criterion, the results go up to 81%.",
        "This differential hints at the difficulty of accounting for semantically significant prepositions in sentences.",
        "We believe that it is precisely because the preposition-semantics relationship is so complex that properly accounting for it will lead to a more robust natural language resource.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Sections 2 and 3 present the lexical resources used for the experiment.",
        "Section 4 discusses the evaluation of VerbNet against PropBank and Section 5 shows examples of preposition mismatches between the two resources."

        "VerbNet is an on-line broad-coverage domain-independent lexical resource with syntactic descriptions for over 4,100 verbs organized into classes according to the Levin classification [Levin1993].",
        "It is a general purpose verb lexicon created initially with the task of instructing a virtual character in a simulated environment in mind [Badler et al.",
        "1999, Bindiganavale et al.2000] .",
        "VerbNet extends Levin's classification by providing explicit syntactic and semantic information about the verbs it describes.",
        "In addition, the lexicon is organized hierarchically so that all verbs in a class (or subclass) share these syntactic descriptions and have common semantics.",
        "Each verb class is completely described by the set of its members (each verb has links to the appropriate senses in WordNet, thematic roles for the predicate-argument structure of the members, selectional restrictions on these arguments to express preferred argument types, and frames.",
        "Each frame consists of a brief description, an example, a syntactic description corresponding to one of Levin's alternations, and a set of semantic predicates.",
        "In addition, each predicate has a time function to show at what stage of the event the predicate holds true, in a manner similar to the event decomposition of Moens and Steedman (1988) .",
        "In order for the members of each class to be coherent with respect to the thematic roles, selectional restrictions, syntactic frames, and semantics they allow, we refined the original Levin classes and added 74 new subclasses.",
        "VerbNet's broad-coverage, with explicit syntax and semantics, attempts to address several gaps present in other resources.",
        "WordNet was designed mainly as a semantic network, and contains little syntactic information.",
        "VerbNet, in contrast, includes explicit predicate argument structures for verbs in their classes, as well as a way to systematically extend those senses based on the semantics of each class.",
        "FrameNet [Baker et al.",
        "1998] and VerbNet both contain the notion of verb groupings.",
        "The groupings in FrameNet however are based solely on the semantic roles shared by the members of a class.",
        "These members do not need to have the same set of syntactic frames, and lack explicit semantics other than what is provided by the semantic labels.",
        "Unlike VerbNet, which uses a small set of thematic roles for all classes, FrameNet uses frame elements which are particular to a lexical item or to small groups of frames.",
        "Besides, one of the benefits of constructing a general lexicon like VerbNet is that it allows one to extend the coverage of resources tied to specific corpora.",
        "The syntactic frames in VerbNet describe the surface realization for constructions such as transitive, intransitive, prepositional phrases, resultatives, and a large set of Levin's alternations.",
        "A syntactic frame consists of the thematic roles, the verb, and other lexical items which may be required for a particular construction or alternation.",
        "Additional restrictions may be further imposed on the thematic roles (quotation, plural, infinitival, etc.).",
        "Illustrations of syntactic frames are shown in examples 1, 2, and 3.",
        "(1) Agent V Patient (John hit the ball) (2) Agent V at Patient (John hit at the window) (3) Agent V Patient[+plural] together (John hit the sticks together)",
        "VerbNet also includes a hierarchy of prepositions, with 57 entries, derived from an extended version of work described in Sparck-Jones and Boguraev (1987).",
        "This restriction is necessary in order to specify which prepositions are possible in a particular frame since many of Levin's alternations require specific prepositions such as `as' or `with/against'.",
        "A partial and somewhat simplified hierarchy is shown in Figure 1.",
        "This figure shows the spatial prepositions hierarchy divided into path and locative prepositions.",
        "Path prepositions are further subdivided into source, direction, and destination prepositions.",
        "A syntactic frame with Prep[+src] as a constraint will allow only those specific prepositions (from, out, out of, etc) that are part of the spatial, path, source hierarchy.",
        "The semantic information for the verbs in VerbNet is expressed as a conjunction of semantic predicates, any of which may be negated.",
        "These semantic predicates fall into four categories: general predicates such as motion and cause which are widely used across classes; variable predicates whose meaning is assumed to be in a one-to-one relation with a set of words in the language; predicates that are specific to certain classes; and predicates for multiple events which are used to express relations between events.",
        "The semantic predicates can take arguments over the verb complements, as well as over implicit existentially quantified event variables.",
        "Relations between verbs (or between verb classes) such as antonymy and entailment present in Word",
        "Net can be predicted upon verification of the predicates used.",
        "Relations between verbs (and verb classes) such as the ones predicted in FrameNet, can also be verified by the semantic predicates, for instance all of the Communication classes have the same predicates of cause and transfer info.",

        "In general, we used several criteria when attempting to match a constructed frame to a frame in VerbNet.",
        "Two of these criteria are of primary interest for",
