        "Lexical-semantic classes which aim to capture the close relationship between the syntax and semantics of verbs have attracted considerable interest in both linguistics and computational linguistics (e.g. (Pinker, 1989; Jackendoff, 1990; Levin, 1993; Dorr, 1997; Dang et al., 1998; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001)).",
        "Such classes can capture generalizations over a range of (cross-)linguistic properties, and can therefore be used as a valuable means of reducing redundancy in the lexicon and for filling gaps in lexical knowledge.",
        "Verb classes have proved useful in various (multilingual) natural language processing (NLP) tasks and applications, such as computational lexicography (Kipper et al., 2000), language generation (Stede, 1998), machine translation (Dorr, 1997), word sense disambiguation (Prescher et al., 2000), document classification (Klavans and Kan, 1998), and subcategorization acquisition (Korhonen, 2002).",
        "Fundamentally, such classes define the mapping from surface realization of arguments to predicate-argument structure and are therefore a critical component of any NLP system which needs to recover predicate-argument structure.",
        "In many operational contexts, lexical information must be acquired from small application and/or domain-specific corpora.",
        "The predictive power of classes can help compensate for lack of sufficient data fully exemplifying the behaviour of relevant words, through use of back-off smoothing or similar techniques.",
        "Although several classifications are now available for English verbs (e.g. (Pinker, 1989; Jackendoff, 1990; Levin, 1993)), they are all restricted to certain class types and many of them have few exemplars with each class.",
        "For example, the largest and the most widely deployed classification in English, Levin’s (1993) taxonomy, mainly deals with verbs taking noun and prepositional phrase complements, and does not provide large numbers of exemplars of the classes.",
        "The fact that no comprehensive classification is available limits the usefulness of the classes for practical NLP.",
        "Some experiments have been reported recently which indicate that it should be possible, in the future, to automatically supplement extant classifications with novel verb classes and member verbs from corpus data (Brew and Schulte im Walde, 2002; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Korhonen et al., 2003).",
        "While the automatic approach will avoid the expensive overhead of manual classification, the very development of the technology capable of large-scale automatic classification will require access to a target classification and gold standard exemplification of it more extensive than that available currently.",
        "In this paper, we address these problems by introducing a substantial extension to Levin’s classification which incorporates 57 novel classes for verbs not covered (comprehensively) by Levin.",
        "These classes, many of them drawn initially from linguistic resources, were created semi-automatically by looking for diathesis alternations shared by candidate verbs.",
        "106 new alternations not covered by Levin were identified for this work.",
        "We demonstrate the usefulness of our novel classes by using them to improve the performance of our extant subcategorization acquisition system.",
        "We show that the resulting extended classification has good coverage over the English verb lexicon.",
        "Discussion is provided on how the classification could be further refined and extended in the future, and integrated as part of Levin’s extant taxonomy.",
        "We discuss Levin’s classification and its extensions in section 2.",
        "Section 3 describes the process of creating the new verb classes.",
        "Section 4 reports the experimental evaluation and section 5 discusses further work.",

        "(i) A few individual verbs were chosen from a new verb class whose predominant sense according to the WordNet frequency data belongs to this class, (ii) SCF distributions were built for these verbs by manually analysing c. 300 occurrences of each verb in the BNC, (iii) the resulting SCF distributions were merged.",

        "For example, the results with IS indicate that there is a large intersection between the acquired and gold standard SCFs when the method is used, and those with RC demonstrate that the method clearly improves the ranking of SCFs according to the conditional probability distributions of SCFs given each test verb.",

        "For example, tasks which require maximal accuracy from the classification are likely to benefit the most from fine-grained classes (e.g. refined versions of Levin’s classes (Green et al., 2001)), while tasks which rely more heavily on the capability of a classification to capture adequate generalizations over a set of lexical items benefit the most from broad classes.",
        "Therefore, to provide a general purpose classification suitable for various NLP use, we intend to refine and organize our novel classes into taxonomies which incorporate different degrees of granularity.",
        "Finally, we plan to supplement the extended classification with additional novel information.",
        "In the absence of linguistic resources exemplifying further candidate classes we will search for additional novel classes, intersective classes and member verbs using automatic methods, such as clustering (e.g. (Brew and Schulte im Walde, 2002; Korhonen et al., 2003)).",
        "For example, clustering sense disambiguated subcategorization data (acquired e.g. from the SemCor corpus) should yield suitable (sense specific) data to work with.",
        "We will also include in the classification statistical information concerning the relative likelihood of different classes, SCFs and alternations for verbs in corpus data, using e.g. the automatic methods proposed by McCarthy (2001) and Korhonen (2002).",
        "Such information can be highly useful for statistical NLP systems utilizing lexical-semantic classes."

        "This paper described and evaluated a substantial extension to Levin’s widely employed verb classification, which incorporates 57 novel classes and 106 diathesis alternations for verbs not covered comprehensively by Levin.",
        "The utility of the novel classes was demonstrated by using them to support automatic subcategorization acquisition.",
        "The coverage of the resulting extended classification over the English verb lexicon was shown to be good.",
        "Discussion was provided on how the classification could be further refined and extended in the future, and integrated into Levin’s extant taxonomy, to yield a single, comprehensive resource."
