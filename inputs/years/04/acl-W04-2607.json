        "Many NLP applications, such as text summarization and discourse segmentation, require, or can be helped by, the identification of lexical semantic relations in text.",
        "However, the resources that are presently available, such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) provide only “classical” relations: taxonomy or hyponymy (robin / bird), hypernymy (tool / hammer), troponymy (drink / guzzle), meronymy (hand / finger), antonymy (go / come), and synonymy (car / automobile).",
        "These relations, which have been widely studied and applied, are characterized by a sharing of the same individual defining properties between the words and a requirement that the words be of the same syntactic class.1 Intuitively, however, we see many other kinds of lexical relations in text.",
        "As an example, consider the following two sentences taken from a Reader’s Digest article: I attended a funeral service recently.",
        "Kind words, Communion, chapel overflowing, speeches by law",
        "yers, government workers, friends, all speaking of the deceased’s kindness, his brilliance in mathematics, his love of SCRABBLE and CHESS, his great humility and compassion, his sense of humor.",
        "There are four groups of related words in this text: the italicized group is about funerals, the bolded group is positive human characteristics, the underlined group is job types, and the capitalized group is games.",
        "Some of the lexical relations here are of the classical kind that we mentioned earlier (e.g., chess and Scrabble have a common subsumer); but others are examples of relations that we will refer to as “non-classical”, such as funeral / chapel and humility / kindness.",
        "The goal of this research is to investigate these non-classical relations, and to determine what the different types are and how they are used, with a view to eventual automatic detection of the relationships in text.",
        "Most prior research on types of lexical semantic relations has been context-free: the relations are considered out of any textual context and are then assumed to be relevant within textual contexts.",
        "And in lexical cohesion research, the analysis of lexical relations has been done by professional linguists with particular points of view (Hasan, 1984; Martin, 1992).",
        "A better understanding of the types of lexical semantic relations that are actually identified in context by readers of text will potentially lead to improvements in the types of relations used in NLP applications."

        "cohesion When people read a text, the relations between the words contribute to their understanding of it.",
        "Related word pairs may join together to form larger groups of related words that can extend freely over sentence boundaries.",
        "These larger word groups contribute to the meaning of text through “the cohesive effect achieved by the continuity of lexical meaning” (Halliday and Hasan, 1976, p. 320, emphasis added).",
        "Lexical semantic relations are the building blocks of lexical cohesion, and so a clear understanding of their nature and behavior is crucial.",
        "Lexical cohesion analysis has been used in such NLP applications as determining the structure of text (Morris and Hirst, 1991) and automatic text summarization (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1999).",
        "In recent lexical cohesion research in linguistics (Hasan, 1984; Halliday and Hasan, 1989; Martin, 1992) non-classical relations are largely ignored, and the same is true in implementations of lexical cohesion in computational linguistics (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1999; Silber and McCoy, 2002), as the lexical resource used is WordNet.",
        "It is notable, however, that the original view of lexical semantic relations in the lexical cohesion work of Halliday and Hasan (1976) was very broad and general; the only criterion was that there had to be a recognizable relation between two words.",
        "Most research on lexical semantic relations in linguistics (Cruse, 1986) and psychology has also ignored non-classical relations (with the exception of Chaffin and Herrmann, 1984); however there have been recent calls to broaden the focus and include non-classical relations as well (McRae and Boisvert, 1998; Hodgson, 1991).",
        "A notable exception to this trend is in library and information science (LIS), and is likely a pragmatic reflection of the fact that it is a field with a large user base that demanded this type of access to reference materials.",
        "In LIS thesauri, most of the word pairs that are classed as Related Terms (RTs) are related non-classically, but unfortunately are listed as an undifferentiated group.",
        "Standards for their use have been developed (ISO, 1986); but since 1985, the Library of Congress has been encouraging a minimization of their use (El-Hoshy, 2001).",
        "Since RTs are all grouped together in an unclassified manner, the result has been inconsistencies and subjective judgments about what word pairs are included; but this is an issue of implementation rather than whether RTs can, in principle, be useful.",
        "Roget’s Thesaurus, which was used to form the lexical chains in Morris and Hirst (1991), also gives non-classically related word groups.",
        "Although this thesaurus is hierarchically classified, it makes frequent use within its basic categories of unclassified pointers to other widely dispersed basic categories.",
        "In this respect the structure of LIS thesauri and Roget’s Thesaurus are similar.",
        "They are both hierarchically organized – Ro-get’s by Roget’s own principles of domain and topic division and LIS thesauri by a broad-term / narrow-term structure – but they also both have a non-hierarchical, non-classified “structure” (or at least mechanism) for representing non-classical relations.",
        "But while both, unlike WordNet, give access to non-classically related word pairs, they don’t give any indication of what the actual relation between the words is.",
        "Other recent computational work such as that of Ji, Ploux, and Wehrli (2003) suffers from the same problem, in that groups of related words are created (in this case through automatic processing of text corpora), but the actual relations that hold between the members of the groups are not determined."

        "Lakoff (1987) gives the name “classical” to categories whose members are related by shared properties.",
        "We will extend Lakoff’s terminology and refer to relations that depend on the sharing of properties of classical categories as classical relations.",
        "Hence we will use the term non-classical for relations that do not depend on the shared properties required of classical relations.",
        "Lakoff emphasizes the importance of non-classical categories, providing support for the importance of non-classical relations.",
        "The classical category structure has been a limiting factor in the study of lexical relations: since relations create categories (and vice versa), if the categories that are considered are severely restricted in nature, so too will be the relations; and, as mentioned, related words must be of the same part of speech.",
        "This is thus a restriction found in both Hasan’s (1984) relations in lexical cohesion work and Cruse’s (1986, p. 16) concept of patterns of lexical affinity, where a mechanism is given for relating inter-sentence and, in fact, inter-text words that are both in the same grammatical class.",
        "The lexical chains of Morris and Hirst (1991) had no such restriction, and frequently nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and verbs were joined together in one chain.",
        "Lakoff (1987) mentions Barsalou’s (1989) concept of creating ad hoc categories, his term for categories that are “made up on the fly for some immediate purpose”, which would presumably require some type of processing interaction with a specific text instead of the assumption that all categories preexist (Lakoff, 1987, p. 45).",
        "Two examples of these categories are “things to take on a camping trip” and “what to do for entertainment on a weekend” (ibid, p. 45).",
        "Barsalou’s ad hoc categories seem to be of (at least) two types: (1) different activities or actions pertaining to the same or similar objects; (2) different objects pertaining to the same or similar activities or actions.",
        "This process has similarities to the mechanisms of Hasan (1984), Martin (1992), and Cruse (1986) that use both intra-sentence case-like relations and inter-sentence classical relations.",
        "Categories created this way are not classical, as they seem to be ways of joining “different” objects, actions, or activities, and so the relations between their members are not classical either.",
        "The mix of classical categories and relations with non-classical categories and relations appears to be a rich source of lexico-grammatical cohesion.",
        "The following are the major (not necessarily mutually exclusive) types of non-classical relations found in the literature:",
        "• Relations between members of Lakoff’s non-classical categories: ball, field and umpire, that are part of the structured activity of cricket (or baseball).",
        "• Case relations: • General: dog / bark (Chaffin and Herrmann, 1984).",
        "• Sentence-specific (Fillmore, 1968): stroke / it in the sentence: They stroked it.",
        "• LIS RTs (Milstead, 2001).",
        "The relations between members of non-classical categories are unnamable except with reference to the category name (one can’t describe the relations between ball / field or ball / umpire without using the word cricket).",
        "For word pairs consisting of a member and the category name, the relation has often been covered, either as a general case relation (ball / cricket as instrument / activity) or as an RT (field / cricket as the activity / location relation of Neelameghan (2001), or the locative general case relation).",
        "Case relations come in two varieties: general and specific (to a sentence).",
        "The general inter-sentence and inter-text case relations (Chaffin and Herrmann, 1984) are given also by several of the LIS researchers who have provided lists of RT types (Neelameghan, 2001; Milstead, 2001).",
        "Cruse deals almost exclusively with classical relations, but does mention two general case-like relations that he calls “zero-derived paronymy” (1986, p. 132).",
        "The instrumental case (dig / spade or sweep / broom) and the objective case (drive / vehicle or ride / bicycle) are given as examples.",
        "He observes that in the instrumental case, the definition of the noun will most likely contain the verb, and in the objective case, the definition of the verb will most likely contain the noun.",
        "To Cruse, these are not “real” relations but merely “quasi” relations, as the word classes involved differ.",
        "The case relations as defined by Fillmore (1968) are intra-sentence grammatical relations that always apply to the specific text and sentence they are situated in.",
        "Sometimes these relations can be both text-specific and general at the same time (dog / barked in The dog barked).",
        "Hasan (1984) and Martin (1992) also use these intra-sentence case relations to further link together word groups that have been created through classical relations, as does Cruse (1986) with his concept of patterns of lexical affinity mentioned above.",
        "LIS can lay claim to the most extensive amount of research on non-classical relations.",
        "It is interesting to note that during the development of the Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT), RTs were not included in the initial design, but rather added in afterwards due to user demand (Moholt, 1996).",
        "Of the LIS researchers, Neelameghan (2001) has produced the most extensive list of non-classical relations, which has changed little since Neelameghan and Ravichandra (1976).",
        "Apart from relations between members of non-classical categories (see above), his list includes most of the text-general relations (recognizable out of the context of a text) mentioned by other researchers.",
        "Obviously any text-specific relations such as sentence-specific case cannot be included, since word pairs are considered out of text.",
        "Note again, however, that both Hasan (1984) and Martin (1992) use relations similar to text-specific case relations to strengthen cohesive ties created by the classical relations.",
        "This combination of text-specific and text-general relations could prove to be useful computationally.",
        "A couple of exceptions to the above mentioned relation types have been noted.",
        "Evens et al.",
        "(1983) have a provenience relation (water / well), and Cruse (1986) has a proportional series relation made up of what he calls recurring endonymy (university / lecturer / student, prison / warden / convict, hospital / doctor / patient), that is a relation that “involves the incorporation of the meaning of one lexical item in the meaning of another”, such as education in university / lecturer / student (1986, p. 123–125).",
        "In the research on domain-neutral lexical semantic relations, hundreds (Cassidy, 2000) or thousands (Lenat, 1995) of relations are defined, or perhaps even more in the case of Barrière and Popowich (2000).",
        "The question of whether there is a smallish set of field (domain-) neutral non-classical relations that will provide (good) coverage for all (or most) fields is one of the questions we are investigating.",
        "Encouragingly, LIS has tackled an extensive number of specific domains with just such a smallish set of field-neutral non-classical relations.",
        "However, due to the reportedly subjective implementation of these relations, this may not in fact be true in practice.",
        "WordNet’s approach uses domain-neutral relations for a general domain, but mostly for classical relations.",
        "Databases use domain-specific relations for specific domains."

        "Eleven groups were identified by at least four of the nine subjects.",
        "For each of these groups, we computed the subjects’ agreement on membership of the group in following manner: We took all possible pairs of subjects, and for each pair computed the number of words on which they agreed as a percentage of the total number of words they used.",
        "Averaged over all possible pairs of subjects, the agreement was 63%.",
        "Next, we looked at agreement on the word pairs that were identified as directly related (within the groups that were identified by at least four subjects).",

        "We counted all distinct instances of word pairs that were marked by at least 50% of the subjects, and divided this by the total number of distinct word pairs marked.",
        "We found that 25% of the word pairs were marked by at least 50% of the subjects.",
        "For this set of word pairs that were identified by more than one subject, we then computed agreement on what the relationship between the pair was deemed to be.",
        "We found that the subjects agreed in 86% of the cases.",
        "We now turn to the nature of lexical relations that the subjects reported perceiving in the text in each of the eleven word groups that were used by at least four of the readers.",
        "As we would expect, the individual wording of the descriptions of relation types varied greatly by reader: the subjects often used different ways to describe what were clearly intended to the same relations.",
        "Thus, we had to analyze and interpret their descriptions.",
        "We were careful in this analysis to try to determine the subjects’ intent and generalize the conceptual meaning of the individual wordings that were given, but not impose any view of what the relations “should be”.",

        "In cases where subjects identified word pairs as related, they also showed a marked tendency, at an average of 86%, to agree on what the relation was.",
