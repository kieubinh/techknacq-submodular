        "Prepositions have been studied from a variety of perspectives.",
        "The syntactic status has been probed by such linguists as Jackendoff [77], Emonds [85], Rauh [93] and Pullum and Huddleston [02].",
        "Cognitive theorists have paid attention to the polysemous nature of prepositions and explored the conceptual relationships of the polysemy, often proposing the graphical mental images (Lakoff and Johnson [80], Brugman [81, 88], Herskovits [86], Langacker [87], Tyler and Evans [01]).",
        "Pragmatic aspects of prepositions have been studied by such scholars as Fauconnier [94] and Visetti and Cadiot [02].",
        "The deictic properties of spatial prepositions have been examined by Hill [82], while the geographical information provided by them was an interest of computational research (Xu and Badler [00], Tezuka et al. [01]).",
        "A practical study of the usage of prepositions was carried out for the purpose of teaching English as a second language (Wahlen [95], Lindstromberg [97], Yates [99]).",
        "In the fields related to natural language processing, prepositional phrase attachment has been a topic for research for quite a long time, and in recent years, the problem was explored with a neural network-based approach (Sopena, LLoberas and Moliner [98]) and with a syntax-based trainable approach (Yeh and Valin [98]).",
        "Although past research has revealed various aspects of prepositions, to my knowledge there is not much semantic research of prepositions available for computational use, which requires a vigorous formalization of representing the semantics.",
        "A recent semantic study of prepositions for computational use is found in Voss [02], with a focus on spatial prepositions.",
        "Spatial prepositions are divided into three categories according to which one of the two thematic meanings between place and path they acquire when they are in argument, adjunct and non-subcategorized positions of particular types of verbs.",
        "The semantics of spatial prepositions dealt with in Voss [02] is not lexical but thematic.",
        "The present study places more focus on the lexical meanings of prepositions rather than on the thematic meanings because it is intended for use in machine translation (MT), where the meaning of a sentence, a phrase or a lexical entry of a source language must be preserved in the target language, even though it may take a different syntactic form in the source and target languages.",
        "The preservation of meaning is even more important at an Interlingua-based MT, because meaning is a medium of translation between source and target languages.",
        "The current research deals with the prepositional uses of over, but not with the uses of over in different syntactic categories such as the use as adjective (as in The initial test is over), as part of a phrasal verb (as in He handed over his notes to me), as part of an idiomatic phrase (as in She said it over and over) and as a modifier of a quantity (as in over forty years ago).",
        "These uses could be identified in terms of their syntactic characteristics.",
        "On the other hand, the prepositional uses are grouped under the same syntactic category, but exhibit different meanings in different semantic contexts, requiring semantic treatments as well for the disambiguation of the senses.",
        "This paper examines the meanings of the prepositional uses of over, identifies the semantic contexts, and proposes two decision trees for interpreting the different meanings.",
        "The second section will divide the prepositional uses of over into two groups according to which one of the two functional units between Head and Complement is likely to identity the meanings.",
        "It will also bring into light the semantic features of the Head and Complement components that make the interpretations of the uses possible.",
        "The third section will discusses the two decision trees proposed in this paper, and the fourth section gives an evaluation of the trees, before concluding this paper."
