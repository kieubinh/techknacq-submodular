        "By comparison with the baseline, the feature vector presented here gives better results.",
        "This explains in part our initial intuition that nominalization constructions at NP level have a different semantic behavior than the NP non-nominalization patterns.",
        "We studied the influence of each feature on the performance, and since there are too many cases to discuss we only show in Table 5 the average impact as High, Medium, or Low.",
