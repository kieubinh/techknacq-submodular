        "Several approaches to text-based information management applications are being pursued, including word-based statistical processing and those depending on string matching, syntax, or semantics.",
        "Statistical systems have enjoyed considerable success for information retrieval, especially using the vector space model (Salton et al., 1975).",
        "Since the SIR system (Raphael, 1968), some have felt that automatic information management could best be addressed using semantic information.",
        "Subsequent research (Schank, 1975; Wilks, 1976) expanded this paradigm.",
        "More recently, a number of examples of knowledge-based applications show considerable promise.",
        "These include systems for machine translation (Viegas et al., 1998), question answering, (Harabagiu et al., 2001; Clark et al., 2003), and information retrieval (Mihalcea and Moldovan, 2000).",
        "In the biomedical domain, the MEDLINE® bibliographic database provides opportunities for keeping abreast of the research literature.",
        "However, the large size of this online resource presents potential challenges to the user.",
        "Query results often include hundreds or thousands of citations (including title and abstract).",
        "Automatic summarization offers potential help in managing such results; however, the most popular approach, extraction, faces challenges when applied to multidocument summarization (McKeown et al., 2001).",
        "Abstraction summarization offers an attractive alternative for managing citations resulting from MEDLINE searches.",
        "We present a knowledge-rich abstraction approach that depends on underspecified semantic interpretation of biomedical text.",
        "As an example, a graphical representation (Batagelj, 2003) of the semantic predications serving as a summary (or conceptual condensate) from our system is shown in Figure 1.",
        "The input text was a MEDLINE citation with title “Gastrointestinal tolerability and effectiveness of rofecoxib versus naproxen in the treatment of osteoarthritis: a randomized, controlled trial.”",
        "Our semantic interpreter and the abstraction summarizer based on it both draw on semantic information from the Unified Medical Language System® (UMLS),® a resource for structured knowledge in the biomedical domain.",
        "After introducing the semantic interpreter, we describe the transformation phase of our paradigm, discussing principles that depend on semantic notions in order to condense the semantic predications representing the content of text.",
        "Initially, this process was applied to summarizing single documents.",
        "We discuss its adaptation to multidocument input, specifically to the set of citations resulting from a query to the MEDLINE database.",
        "Although we have not yet formally evaluated the effectiveness of the resulting condensate, we discuss its characteristics and possibilities as both an indicative and informative summary."

        "The UMLS (Humphreys et al., 1998) consists of three components: the Metathesaurus,® Semantic Network (McCray, 1993), and SPECIALIST Lexicon (McCray et al., 1994).",
        "The Metathesaurus is at the core and contains more than 900,000 concepts compiled from more than sixty controlled vocabularies.",
        "Many of these have hierarchical structure, and some contain meronymic information in addition to hypernymy.",
        "Editors combine terms in the constituent vocabularies into a set of synonyms (cf. WordNet’s synsets), which constitutes a concept.",

        "(1) Concept: Dyspnea Synonyms: Breathlessness, Shortness of breath, Breathless, Difficulty breathing, Respiration difficulty, etc.",
        "In addition, each concept in the Metathesaurus is assigned at least one semantic type (such as ‘Sign or Symptom’ for (1)), which categorizes the concept in the biomedical domain.",
        "The semantic types available are drawn from the Semantic Network, in which they are organized hierarchically in two single-inheritance trees, one under the root ‘Entity’ and another under ‘Event’.",
        "The Semantic Network also contains semantic predications with semantic types as arguments.",

        "Semantic interpretation is based on a categorical analysis that is underspecified in that it is a partial parse (cf. McDonald, 1992).",
        "This analysis depends on the SPECIALIST Lexicon and the Xerox part-of-speech tagger (Cutting et al., 1992) and provides simple noun phrases that are mapped to concepts in the UMLS Metathesaurus using MetaMap (Aronson, 2001).",
        "The categorial analysis enhanced with Metathesaurus concepts and associated semantic types provides the basis for semantic interpretation, which relies on two components: a set of “indicator” rules and an (underspecified) dependency grammar.",

        "For example, such rules stipulate that the preposition for indicates the semantic predicate TREATS in sumatriptan for migraine.",
