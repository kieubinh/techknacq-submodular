        "Lexical semantics is becoming increasingly important in a variety of natural language applications from machine translation to text summarization to question answering.",
        "Since it is generally agreed that the verb is the locus of “meaning” in a natural language sentence, theories ofver-bal argument structure are extremely important for our understanding of lexical semantics.",
        "An appropriate lexical semantic representation can illuminate difficult problems in language processing, expose facets of meaning relevant to the surface realization of sentential elements, and reveal insights about the organization of the human language faculty.",
        "In machine translation, a “good” representation of verbs can straightforwardly capture cross-linguistic divergences in the expression of arguments.",
        "In question answering, lexical semantics can be leveraged to bridge the gap between the way a question is asked and the way an answer is stated.",
        "This paper explores fine-grained lexical semantic representations – approaches that view a verb as more than a simple predicate of its arguments (e.g., Dang et al., 2000).",
        "This contrasts with recent semantic annotation projects such as PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998).",
        "For example, while it is undeniable that throw(John, the ball, Mary), is a valid representation for the sentence “John threw the ball to Mary”, it is widely believed (at least by theoretical linguists) that decomposing verbs in terms of more basic primitives can better capture generalizations about verb meaning and argument realization.",
        "I will argue that finer-grained semantics is not only theoretically motivated, but necessary for building applications.",
        "I first provide a brief overview of theories of verbal argument structure, and then contrast the typology of Mandarin verbs with that of English verbs.",
        "I will present evidence from Chinese that verb meaning is compositionally “built up” from primitive notions of stativity and activity.",
        "The consequence, therefore, is that “flat” representations lacking internal structure are unable to capture the verbal semantics of a language like Mandarin.",
        "Productive phenomena such as verbal compounding render enumeration of all permissible verbs impossible.",
        "Verb meaning, therefore, must be represented decompositionally in terms of underlying primitives.",
        "This paper does not propose a concrete lexical semantic representation, but rather focuses on the requirements, for natural language applications, of such a representation."

        "The earliest theory of verbal argument structure involves generalized collections of semantic roles, known as a case frame (Fillmore, 1968) or a theta-grid (Stowell, 1981) under the framework of Government and Binding Theory.",
        "The idea of semantic roles was first explicated in Fillmore’s seminal paper, “The Case for Case” (1968), which argues that the propositional component of a sentence can be represented as an array consisting of the verb and a number of noun phrases specifically marked with roles such as agent, patient, instrument, and goal.",
        "These labels identify the grammatically relevant aspects of the roles that pertain to argument realization in the syntax.",
        "A verb is defined by the semantic roles that it “takes”, i.e., its case frame.",
        "For example, love takes an agent and a patient, while frighten takes an experiencer and a stimulus.",
        "A theory of argument structure is not complete without an associated linking theory that explicitly maps arguments in the lexical semantic representation (semantic roles) to syntactic arguments.",
        "Approaches based on semantic roles often formulate a linking theory in terms of a thematic hierarchy (Jackendoff, 1972): semantic roles are arranged in an abstract “prominence” hierarchy, and the realization of syntactic arguments is based on the position of roles in this hierarchy.",
        "The highest role in the thematic hierarchy is assigned the highest argument position in the syntactic structure (the subject), the next highest role is assigned the next highest argument, and so forth.",
        "Thematic hierarchies are believed to be an independent and irreducible module of grammar.",
        "There has been considerable debate over the ordering of roles on thematic hierarchies.",
        "In fact, the actual inventory of semantic roles, along with precise definitions and diagnostics, remains an unsolved problem.",
        "These are not the only drawbacks associated with theories of argument structure that rely on semantic roles:1 Some analyses show that semantic roles are too coarse-grained to account for certain semantic distinctions.",
        "The only recourse, to expand the collection of roles, comes with the price of increased complexity, e.g., in the linking rules.",
        "Fillmore’s original assumption that each noun phrase in an utterance occupies a unique thematic role is often called into question.",
        "For some verbs, e.g., resemble, multiple noun phrases appear to have the same semantic role.",
        "Finally, because case frames are “flat”, i.e., lacking any internal structure, a theory based purely on semantic roles lacks real explanatory power.",
        "Why is it, for example, that love takes an obligatory agent and an obligatory patient?",
        "Why is the instrument role in open optional?",
        "These theories cannot offer satisfactory answers because they do not directly refer to the meaning of predicates.",
        "Recognizing the drawbacks of theories based purely on semantic roles, there is now a general consensus among linguists that argument structure is (to a large extent) predictable from event semantics – hence, patterns of argument realization should be inferable from lexical semantic representations grounded in a theory of events.",
        "These event representations typically decompose seman",

        "The somewhat controversial claim that Mandarin lacks monomorphemic accomplishments and achievements has been previously made by a number of linguists, most notably Tai (1984); see also (Shi, 1988).",

Zhang1san1 da3 sui4 ley bo1li2 Zhangsan hit shatter LE glass ‘Zhangsan shattered the glass.’ Putting all the pieces together, the organization of the Mandarin verbal system can be summarized as follows: (26) primitive event types: activity, state state + le – > achievement activity + achievement – > accomplishment Activity and state are the two primitive verbal categories in Mandarin.",

        "However, the actual machinery for formalizing these insights is not important for the present discussion.",
        "The important lessons are the theoretical constraints imposed by verbal typology on lexical semantic representations designed for language applications.",

        "These claims imply that a PropBank or FrameNet approach to lexical semantics will not be sufficient for many language applications, at least for languages such as Mandarin Chinese.",
        "While I may disagree with the technical details, I believe that the approach taken by (Dang et al., 2000) is on the right path.",
        "Due to the productivity of verbal phenomena in Mandarin, it is impossible to exhaustively enumerate all felicitous predicates – verbal meaning, therefore, must be compositionally derived from primitive elements.",
        "This however, does not mean that PropBank or FrameNet are not useful; quite the contrary!",
        "Existing semantic resources serve as the foundation from which we can bootstrap finer-grained semantic representations.",
        "While the approach Palmer and Wu (1995) take to lexical semantics captures many selectional restrictions and finer-grained facets of meaning, it still does not model the arbitrary productivity of verbal compounds.",
        "For the purposes of translating English change of state verbs into Mandarin, they developed a conceptual lattice that unifies verbs from both languages.",
        "Distances between nodes in this lattice correspond to “semantic distance”, and is used to find the closest translation if a specific meaning is unavailable.",
        "Although this approach results in better lexical selection, the semantic lattice still assumes that all verbal forms can be exhaustively enumerated.",
        "Although this certainly may be true within the context of a specific corpus, the productivity of Mandarin verbal phenomena is limitless in the real world.",
        "I believe that, for all languages in general, verbal meanings are compositionally built up from states and activities.",
        "Furthermore, this process is syntactic in nature (Lin, 2004b), governed by well-known syntactic processes such as MERGE (Chomsky, 1995) and subjected to well-studied constraints such as selectional restrictions and the Head Movement Constraint (Travis, 1984).",
        "This contrasts with Rappaport Hovav and Levin’s (1998) “event template” approach, which is lexicalist in that large chunks of event structure are directly associated with verbs.",

        "Rappaport Hovav and Levin’s theory argues that a verb’s meaning is composed of an event template that captures the structural component of meaning and open-class constants that capture the idiosyncratic component of meaning (represented by items in angle brackets).",
        "This separation is a major breakthrough in lexical semantic theories because it allows grammatically relevant facets of meaning to be untangled from facets of meaning not directly relevant to the encoding of arguments.",
        "Descriptively, the structural component of meaning is what a verb shares with other verbs in the same verb class, whereas the idiosyncratic component of meaning is what separates verbs within the same verb class.",
        "In Rappaport Hovav and Levin’s account of verbal argument structure, complex event representations are directly introduced in the syntax; that is, the verb lexicalizes a complete causative accomplishment – to shatter implicates an agent participating in an unspecified activity that brings about a change of state where an entity becomes shattered.",
        "In English, they propose that intransitive verbs are derived by a process of “decausativization” through which the external argument is “absorbed”, and therefore remains unexpressed (Levin and Rappaport Hovav, 1995).",
        "Such a theory is unable to account for the derivation of Mandarin resultatives such as da3 sui4 ‘hit-shatter’.",
        "If (29) is indeed the representation of sui4 ‘shatter’, then what is the lexical semantic representation of da3 ‘hit’?",
        "There are, in principle, two alternatives: (30) Option 1: da3 ‘hit’= [ x ACT<HIT> ] Option 2: da3 ‘hit’ = < HIT > One might suggest that da3 ‘hit’ is associated with its own event template that somehow gets merged with the lexical entry of sui4 ‘shatter’.",
        "In order for this approach to be tenable, one has to explicate the process by which verbs are “fused” (and in many cases, how arguments of both verbs are sometimes merged or remain unexpressed); Li (1990) provides exactly such a lexical account, although it has been found to be problematic for many cases (Cheng and Huang, 1994).",
        "The other option is to suggest that da3 ‘hit’ merely encodes the idiosyncratic component of meaning, without an associated event template.",
        "This, however, cannot be true because da3 ‘hit’ itself can be used as a main verb: (31) Zhang1san1 da3 ley bo1li2 Zhangsan hit LE glass ‘Zhangsan hit the glass.’ The only plausible solution is that verbs encode small fragments of event structure, which are compositionally built up by regular syntactic processes.",
        "This approach also provides a natural solution for handling verbs that are derivationally related to other lexical categories, e.g., deadjectival verbs such as flatten, widen, modernize, and legalize.",
        "These derivational affixes obviously contribute the inchoative component of meaning that turns states (adjectives) into change of states:",

        "flat-en: Ax.BECOME(x, BE([state flat])) In such a treatment, for example, the complete semantics of a word can be compositionally derived from its component morphemes.",
        "This framework, where the “semantic load” is spread more evenly throughout the lexicon to lexical categories not typically thought to bear semantic content, is essentially the model advocated by Pustejovsky (1991a), among others.",
        "Such an analysis of verbal phenomena marks a departure from the standard architectural view of morphological analysis as a preprocessor – instead, morphological and syntactic derivation can be integrated under a common framework."

        "The key claim of this paper is that results from the theoretical study of verbal argument structure are relevant to computational lexical semantic representations for language applications.",
        "Although the simplest possible argument representation treats verbs as predicates over their arguments, I have demonstrated that this approach is woefully inadequate for handling a language such as Mandarin Chinese.",
        "I have presented evidence that verb meaning in Mandarin is compositionally built up from underlying state and activity primitives – this organization of the verbal system must be mirrored by any lexical semantic representation aspiring to capture generalizations about argument realization patterns.",
        "This paper takes an important step in laying out some of the constraints for such a representation."
