        "Our aim is to achieve semiautomatic semantic tagging of the UAM Spanish Treebank.",
        "To reach this goal, we have developed and implemented a program called SST (Syntax Semantics Transformation).",
        "The application of this tool provides us with three main benefits: First and foremost, our principal concern is a reliable, quick and cost effective tagging of the treebank.",
        "Manual annotation would be time consuming and expensive because of the complexity of the sentences.",
        "On the other hand, automatic processing ensures coherence and control over the tagging: each type will be tagged",
        "always with the same structure.",
        "Our previous experience in developing the UAM Spanish Treebank has led us to this approach.",
        "Second, this experiment contributes to the study of the relationship between syntax and semantics showing that an almost automatic transition from one level to another is possible.",
        "The idea of the connection between these levels of the language is a commonplace in contemporary linguistics and there are important theoretical works concerning the mapping between morpho-syntactic and semantic forms.",
        "However these theories have not yet been applied to corpora.",
        "Indeed, we are not aware of any similar experiments.",
        "Finally, through this research we have developed a set of grammatical rules connecting syntactic structures to their correspondent event types.",
        "It is worth mentioning here that we have worked with corpora with no thematic restrictions.",
        "Therefore, these rules are not thought for a particular sublanguage, but applicable to Spanish language in general."

        "These three types are divided into subtypes according to the arguments they require.",
        "This approach is compositional: a state has two arguments, a process is made up of a transition from one state to another, and an action is a process with an agent.",
        "This leads to the logical consequence that we need an annotation format for representing both the relation between events and the arguments of the sentence and its sub-event structure.",
        "Most of the recent work on semantics focuses on ontologies.",
