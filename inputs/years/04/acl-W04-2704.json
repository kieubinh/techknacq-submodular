        "As the representation in (5c) shows, we adopt Neo-davidsonian analysis of events, which follows Parsons (1990) in treating arguments on a par with modifiers in the event structure.",
        "An alternative analysis is the original Davidsonian analysis of events (Davidson 1967), where the arguments of the verb are analyzed as its logical arguments.",
        "Our choice of a Neodavidsonian representation is motivated by its predictions with respect to obligatoriness of arguments.",
        "Under the Davidsonian approach, arguments are logical arguments of the verb and thus must be implied by the meaning of the sentence, either explicitly or implicitly (i.e. existentially quantified).",

        "For example, the Frameset for the verb serve, shown in (6a) has three roles: Arg0, Arg1, and Arg2.",
        "Actual usages of the verb, on the other hand, do not require the presence of all three roles.",

        "And, finally, we will consider tagging variables according to the aspectual class of the eventuality they denote, such as states or events.",

        "The sentences she was ill and he was in a foul mood seem to describe a state of affairs obtaining at the time of the speakerâ€™s arrival.",
        "As this example illustrates, there are different types of temporal relations between eventualities (as we will call both events and states) and adverbials that modify them, such as temporal overlap and temporal containment.",
        "Furthermore, these relations crucially depend on the aspectual properties of the sentence.",
        "Translation of PB annotations to logical representations with eventuality variables and tagging these variables according to their aspectual type would thus make it possible to provide an analysis of temporal relations.",

        "Based on our existing WN 1.7 tags and Frameset tags of the Senseval2 verbs in the Penn Treebank, 95% of the verb instances map directly from sense groups to Framesets, with each Frameset typically corresponding to two or more sense groups.",
        "Using the PropBank coarse-grained senses as a starting place, and WordNet sense tagging for over 1000 verbs produced automatically through mapping VerbNet to PropBank (Kipper, et.",
        "al., 2004), we have the makings of a large scale tagging experiment on the Penn Treebank.",
        "This will enable investigations into the applicability of clearly defined criteria for sense distinctions at varying levels of granularity, and produce a large, 1M word corpus of sense-tagged text for training WSD systems The hierarchical approach to verb senses, as utilized by most standard dictionaries as well as Hector (Atkins, â€™93), and as applied to SENSEVAL-2, presents obvious advantages for the problem of Word Sense Disambiguation.",
        "The human annotation task is simplified, since there are fewer choices at each level and clearer distinctions between them.",
        "The automated systems can combine training data from closely related senses to overcome the sparse data problem, and both humans and systems can back off to a more coarse-grained choice when fine-grained choices prove too difficult."
