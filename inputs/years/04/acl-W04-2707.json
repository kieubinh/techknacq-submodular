        "The initial interest was to look into the correlations and co-occurences of features on different linguistic levels that can be interpreted as indicators of information structure.",
        "This resulted in a design of the annotation scheme which was as theory independent as possible.",
        "We refrained from annotating abstract categories of information structure like topic - focus or theme - rheme and concentrated on more concrete linguistic phenomena that have been described as indicators of these abstract categories on the different levels (cf. §2).",
        "The challenge is to design, carry out and maintain a corpus annotation to facilitate interpretations of information distribution.",
        "Particularly, the different types of linguistic information that are relevant for the analysis of information distribution need to be combined in one resource, where the relevant types are drawn from different linguistic levels.",
        "The goal in a multilayer annotation task like this is to keep each layer of annotation intact, while at the same time enabling relating the different layers when analysing the corpus (e.g., in querying) (cf. §3).",

        "In the previous sections we presented a multi-layered view of information structure, where each layer is to be annotated independently, in order to allow us to investigate interactions across the layers.",
        "Such investigations involve either exploration of the integrated data (i.e., simultaneous viewing of the different levels and searching across levels) or integrated processing, e.g., in order to discover correlations across layers.",
        "There are two crucial technical requirements that must be satisfied to make this possible: (i) stand-off annotation at each layer and (ii) alignment of base data across the layers.",
        "Without the first, we would not be able to keep the layers separate, without the latter we would not be able to align the separate layers.",
        "There are currently basically two kinds of approaches dealing with multilayer corpus annotation: one is committed to a hierarchical data structure either implemented as relational databases (e.g., EMU (Cassidy and Harrington, 2001)) or in XML (e.g., XCES (Ide et al., 2000) or MATE (McKelvie et al., 2001)) using XPointers or ordered directed acyclic graphs (ODAGs) to represent intersecting hierarchies.",
        "The other is based on the concept of temporality using directed arcs representing nodes at certain time offsets on a given time-line this concept is reflected in the annotation graph (AG) as proposed by (Bird and Liberman, 2001).",
        "Our approach to multilayer annotation is based on both of these concepts (see also (Teich et al., 2001)): from AGs we adopt the principle of modularity, i.e., we keep independent layers of annotation separate, even if they can in principle be merged into a single hierarchy.",
        "From ODAGs we adopt the possibility to explicitly represent structural hierarchies if they are meaningful.",
        "Like in MATE, we have chosen XML as the concrete data format to maintain and represent annotations, in order to take advantage of the rich set of readily available tools to edit, validate, transform, and query XML.",
        "This means the following for our stand-off annotation: The raw text of the corpus is represented as a flat text file each token carrying a unique ID.",
        "Each layer of annotation is represented as a separate XML file.",
        "Each markable containing the linguistic information is equipped with the ID or the IDs of the corresponding text sequence.",
        "Parallel aligned texts (e.g. spoken and written versions of the corpus) are also represented via shared IDs in order to refer to overlapping segments.",
        "A related issue is that of annotation tools.",
        "One possibility would be to use a generic tool supporting the annotation of either of the levels we are concerned with (and any levels that we may want to add in the future).",
        "The most ambitious projects we are familiar with are the MATE Workbench$ and the follow-up NITE Workbench9 for multi-level, cross-level and cross-modality annotation of language data.",
        "The MATE Workbench has been developed as a highly customizable tool for parallel annotation of arbitrary and possibly non-hierarchical layers of linguistic description.",
        "It is an open source tool written in Java and handles XML-encoded data.",
