        "Parallel data are needed for designing, training, and evaluation of both statistical and rule-based machine translation systems.",
        "Since Czech is a language with relatively high degree of word-order freedom, and its sentences contain certain syntactic phenomena, such as discontinuous constituents (non-projective constructions), which cannot be straightforwardly handled using the annotation scheme of Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993; Linguistic Data Consortium, 1999), based on phrase-structure trees, we decided to adopt for the PCEDT the dependency-based annotation scheme of the Prague Dependency Treebank – PDT (Linguistic Data Consortium, 2001).",
        "The PDT is annotated on three levels: morphological layer (lowest), analytic layer (middle) – surface syntactic annotation, and tec-togrammatical layer (highest) – level of linguistic meaning.",
        "Dependency trees, representing the sentence structure as concentrated around the verb and its valency, are used for the analytical and tectogrammatical levels, as proposed by Functional Generative Description (Sgall et al., 1986).",
        "In Section 2, we describe the process of translating the Penn Treebank into Czech.",
        "Section 3 sketches the general procedure for transforming phrase topology of Penn Treebank into dependency structure and describes the specific conversions into analytical and tectogrammatical representations.",
        "The following Section 4 describes the automatic process of parsing of Czech into analytical representation and its automatic conversion into tectogrammatical representation.",
        "Section 5 briefly discusses some of the problems of annotation from the point of view of mutual compatibility of annotation schemes.",
        "Section 6 gives an overview of additional resources included in the PCEDT."

        "The choice of the Penn Treebank as the source corpus was also pragmatically motivated: firstly it is a widely recognized linguistic resource, and secondly the translators were native speakers of Czech, capable of high quality translation into their native language.",
        "The translators were asked to translate each English sentence as a single Czech sentence and to avoid unnecessary stylistic changes of translated sentences.",
        "The translations are being revised on two levels, linguistic and factual.",

        "For the purpose of quantitative evaluation methods, such as NIST or BLEU, for measuring performance of translation systems, we selected a test set of 515 sentences and had them retranslated from Czech into English by 4 different translator offices, two of them from the Czech Republic and two of them from the U.S.A."

        "The manual annotation of 1,257 English sentences on tectogrammatical level was, to our knowledge, the first attempt of its kind, and was based especially on the instructions for tectogrammatical annotation of Czech.",
        "During the process of annotation, we have experienced both phenomena that do not occur in Czech at all, and phenomena",
        "whose counterparts in Czech occur rarely, and therefore are not handeled thoroughly by the guidelines for tectogrammatical annotation designed for Czech.",
        "To mention just a few, among the former belongs the annotation of articles, certain aspects of the system of verbal tenses, and phrasal verbs.",
        "A specimen of a roughly corresponding phenomenon occurring both in Czech and English is the gerund.",
        "It is a very common means of condensation in English, but its counterpart in Czech (usually called transgressive) has fallen out of use and is nowadays considered rather obsolete.",
        "The guidelines for Czech require the transgressive to be annotated with the functor COMPL.",
        "The reason why it is highly problematic to apply them straightforwardly also to the annotation of English, is that the English gerund has a much wider range of functions than the Czech transgressive.",
        "The gerund can be seen as a means of condensing subordinated clauses with in principle adverbial meaning (as it is analyzed in the phrase-structure annotation of Penn Treebank).",
        "Since the range of functors with adverbial meaning is much more fine-grained, we deem it inappropriate to mark the gerund clauses in such a simple way on the tectogrammatical level.",
        "From the point of view of machine translation, the gerund constructions pose considerable difficulties because of the many syntactic constructions suitable as their translations corresponding to their varied syntactic functions.",
        "We present two examples illustrating the issues mentioned above.",
        "Each example consists of three figures, the first one presenting the Penn Treebank annotation of a (in the second case simplified) sentence from the Penn Treebank, the second one giving its tentative tectogrammatic representation (according to the guidelines for Czech applied to English), and the third one containing the tectogrammatical representation of its translation into Czech (see Figures 1, 3, 5, and Figures 6, 7, 8).",
        "Note that in neither of the two examples the Czech transgressive is used as the translation of the English gerund; a coordination structure is used instead.",
        "On the other hand, we have also experienced phenomena in English whose Penn Treebank style of annotation is insufficient for a successfull conversion into dependency representation.",
        "In English, the usage of constructions with nominal premodification is very frequent, and the annotation of such noun phrases in the Penn Treebank is often flat, grouping together several constituents without reflecting finer syntactic and semantic relations among them (see Figure 9 for an example of such a noun phrase).",
        "In fact, the possible syntactic and especially semantic relations between the members of the noun phrase can be highly ambiguous, but when translating such a noun phrase into Czech, we are not usually able to preserve the ambiguity and are forced to resolve it by choosing one of the readings (see Figure 10).",
        "Sometimes we even may be forced to insert new words explicitly expressing the semantic relations within the nominal group.",
        "An example of an English noun phrase and the tectogrammatical representation of its Czech translation with an inserted word “podnikajici” (‘operating’) can be found in Figures 11 and 12."
