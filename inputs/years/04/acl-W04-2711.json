        "The Prague Dependency Treebank1 (PDT) meets the widespread aspirations of building corpora with rich annotation schemes.",
        "The annotation on the underlying (tectogrammatical) level of language description ((HajicÏovaÂ et al., 2000)) – serving among other things for training stochastic processes – allows to acquire a considerable amount of data for rule-based approaches in computational linguistics (and, of course, for ’traditional’ linguistics).",
        "And valency belongs undoubtedly to the core of all rule-based methods.",
        "PDT is based on Functional Generative Description of Czech (FGD), being developed by Petr Sgall and his collaborators since the 1960s ((Sgall et al., 1986)).",
        "Within FGD, the theory of valency has been studied since the 1970s (see esp.",
        "(PanevovaÂ, 1992)).",
        "Its modification is used as the theoretical background in VALLEX 1.0 (see (LopatkovaÂ, 2003) for a detailed description of the framework).",
        "Valency requirements are considered for autosemantic words – verbs, nouns, adjectives, and adverbs.",
        "Now, its",
        "principles are applied to a huge amount of data – that means a great opportunity to verify the functional criteria set up and the necessity to expand the ‘center’, ‘core’ of the language being described.",
        "Within the massive manual annotation in PDT, the problem of consistency of assigning the valency structure increased.",
        "This was the first impulse leading to the decision of creating a valency lexicon.",
        "However, the potential usability of the valency lexicon is certainly not limited to the context of PDT – several possible applications have been illustrated in ((StranÏaÂkovaÂ-LopatkovaÂ and 2 abokrtskyÂ, 2002)).",
        "The Valency Lexicon of Czech Verbs, Version 1.0 (VALLEX 1.0) is a collection of linguistically annotated data and documentation, resulting from this attempt at formal description of valency frames of Czech verbs.",
        "VALLEX 1.0 contains roughly 1400 verbs (counting only perfective and imperfective verbs, but not their iterative counterparts).2 They were selected as follows: (1) We started with about 1000 most frequent Czech verbs, according to their number of occurrences in a part of the Czech National Corpus3 (only ‘by´t’ (to be) and some modal verbs were excluded from this set, because of their non-trivial status on the tectogrammatical level of FGD).",
        "(2) Then we added their perfective or imperfective aspectual counterparts, if they were missing; in other words, the set of verbs in VALLEX 1.0 is closed under the relation of ‘aspectual pair’.",
        "The preparation of the first version of VALLEX has taken more than two years.",
        "Although it is still a work in progress requiring further linguistic research, the first",
        "version has been already publically released.",
        "The whole VALLEX 1.0 can be downloaded from the Internet after filling the on-line registration form at the following address: http://ckl.mff.cuni.cz/zabokrtsky/vallex/1.0/ From the very beginning, VALLEX 1.0 was designed with an emphasis on both human and machine readability.",
        "Therefore both linguists and developers of applications within the Natural Language Processing domain can use and critically evaluate its content.",
        "In order to satisfy different needs of these different potential users, VALLEX 1.0 contains the data in the following three formats: Browsable version.",
        "HTML version of the data allows for an easy and fast navigation through the lexicon.",

        "Perfective verbs (in VALLEX 1.0 marked as ‘pf.’ for short) and imperfective verbs (marked as ‘impf.’) are distinguished between in Czech; this characteristic is called aspect.",
        "In VALLEX 1.0, the value of aspect is attached to each word entry as a whole (i.e., it is the same for all its frames and it is shared by the lemma variants, if any).",
        "Some verbs (i.e. informovat - to inform, charakterizo-vat - to characterize) can be used in different contexts either as perfective or as imperfective (obouvidovaÂ slo-vesa, ‘biasp.’ for short).",
        "Within imperfective verbs, there is a subclass of of iterative verbs (iter.).",
        "Czech iterative verbs are derived more or less in a regular way by affixes such as -va- or -iva-, and express extended and repetitive actions (e.g. cˇita´vat, cho-divat).",
        "In VALLEX 1.0, iterative verbs containing double affix -va- (e.g. chodiva´vat) are completely disregarded, whereas the remaining iterative verbs occur as aspectual counterparts in frame entries of the corresponding non-iterative verbs (but have no own word entries, still).",
        "A verb in its particular meaning can have aspectual counterpart(s) - a verb the meaning of which is almost the same except for the difference in aspect (that is why the counterparts constitute a single lexical unit on the tectogrammatical level of FGD; however, each of them has its own word entry in VALLEX 1.0, because they have different morphemic forms).",
        "The aspectual counterpart(s) need not be the same for all the meanings of the given verb, e.g., odpoveˇdeˇt is a counterpart of odpovidat - to answer, but not of odpovidat - to correspond.",
        "Therefore the aspectual counterparts (if any) are listed in frame attribute ‘asp.",
        "counterparts’ in VALLEX 1.0.",

        "perfective or imperfective counterparts, not only the lemmas are specified within the list, but (more specifically) also the frame numbers of the counterpart frames (which is of course not the case for the iterative counterparts, for they have no word entries of their own as stated above).",
        "One frame might have more than one counterpart because of two reasons.",
