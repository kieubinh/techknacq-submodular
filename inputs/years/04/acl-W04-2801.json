        "A number of issues arise when trying to scale-up natural language understanding (NLU) tools designed for relatively simple domains (e.g., flight information) to domains such as medical advising or tutoring where deep understanding of user utterances is necessary.",
        "Because the subject matter is richer, the range of vocabulary and grammatical structures is larger meaning NLU tools are more likely to encounter out-of-vocabulary words or extra-grammatical utterances.",
        "This is especially true in medical advising and tutoring where users may not know the correct vocabulary and use common sense terms or descriptions instead.",
        "Techniques designed to improve robustness (e.g., skipping unknown words, relaxing grammatical constraints, mapping unknown words to known words) are effective at increasing the number of utterances for which an NLU subsystem can produce a semantic interpretation.",
        "However, such techniques introduce additional ambiguity and can lead to a loss of fidelity (i.e., a mismatch between the semantic interpretation and what the language producer meant).",
        "To control this trade-off, we propose semantic interpretation confidence scores akin to speech recognition confidence scores, and describe our initial attempt to compute such a score in a modularized NLU subsystem."

        "Applications such as automated medical advice and tutoring use rich knowledge representations, and natural language input to dialogue systems in these domains contains a wide range of vocabulary and grammatical structures.",
        "Natural language understanding (NLU) tools may fail when encountering out-of-vocabulary words or extra-grammatical utterances.",
        "Using robustness features such as skipping unknown words and mapping unknown words to known words can allow an NLU subsystem to recover fully from failure, or at least to extract pieces of meaning that can be used for a directed clarification question (see (Gabsdil, 2003; Ros´e, 1997) for more details).",
        "Such robustness is especially critical for the domain of tutoring.",
        "Educators are interested in using dialogue to address conceptual errors instead of focusing on terminology errors, and students want “partial credit” from tutors if they have the right general idea.",
        "Thus, NLU subsystems for tutoring must attempt to extract correct elements from student answers that they do not fully understand.",
        "The problem with such robustness features is that they introduce additional ambiguity and can lead to a loss of fidelity (i.e., a mismatch between the semantic interpretation and what the language producer meant) if no clarification or confirmation request is made.",
        "We argue that semantic interpretation confidence scores (akin to speech recognition confidence scores) are necessary to properly manage this robustness versus fidelity trade-off.",
        "It is not enough to ask for clarification of missing information; the dialogue system needs confidence scores so it can decide what information present in the logical form (if any) should be clarified or confirmed.",
        "In addition to avoiding misunderstandings, dialogue systems should be sensitive to the lexical and syntactic choices made by users.",
        "Pickering and Garrod (under revision) argue that conversational agents track each other’s use of referring expressions.",
        "In experimental contexts such as games involving mazes, participants often implicitly agree on a conventional way of referring to entities such as places in the maze.",
        "If dialogue systems do not mimic this alignment process, users can easily become confused if they make a reference such as “the two o’clock flight” but the system talks about “BA 112” instead.",
        "In some domains (e.g., tutoring, medical advising), the process is more complex as users may use common sense terms or descriptions instead of correct terminology.",
        "The system should not use incorrect terminology, but instead teach the correct terms.",
        "To enable dialogue systems to align or correct user-referring-expressions, the NLU subsystem must provide pointers from the semantic interpretation back to the words and syntax produced by the user.",
        "In the body of this paper, we present the architecture of our NLU subsystem.",
        "Features of our architecture such as a packed parse tree representation and a two-stage semantic interpretation process provide efficiency and portability advantages.",
        "However, they complicate the calculation of confidence scores and maintenance of links between the words and syntax produced by the user and the output of NLU.",

        "Since the parser’s lexicon is typically much smaller than a lexical database such as WordNet (Miller, 1990), there is a reduction in token ambiguity (i. e., the number of possible replacements to consider) but the spelling of unknown words will not be corrected.",
