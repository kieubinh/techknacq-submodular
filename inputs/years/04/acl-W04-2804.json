        "Based on human-human communication research, e. g., (Oviatt, 1999), we can identify four basic interaction patterns of how to use different modalities within a single multimodal utterance: redundant the information provided by two modalities is basically the same, concurrent two modalities are used one after another to provide information, complementary the information provided by two modalities can be intertwined, contradicting the information provided by one modality is contradictory to the information provided by the other modality.",
        "All these interaction patterns can be resolved by obtaining access to information about the internal structure of objects.",

        "Move execution is then interleaved with checking their outcome, and possibly replanning if preconditions are violated.",
        "This strategy allows the system to deal with unexpected user inputs like misunderstandings or changing of goals.",

        "To devise the course of action, a plan is then constructed dynamically as a game sequence.",

        "One of the most important constraints when building a functioning system has been the domain of the application.",
        "Based on the domain we developed ends-based representations which have so far mostly been ontologies or ontology-like structures, e. g., (Gurevych et al., 2003b) but which in fact could be event-based representations as well.",
        "How interpretation and presentation are connected to the abstract representation is of secondary interest; Our backbone uses this task-oriented representation for communication and processing and the way there and back may exclude, for instance, traditional semantics.",
        "We make two important observations: on the one hand, that the complete backbone should use a single representation, so that translations between different representations are avoided.",
        "Important here is that each module (ideally) separates its engine from its knowledge base.",
        "On the other hand, the common representation has to be ends-based and fulfil the needs of the application.",
        "The latter point leads us to another lesson learned: The application has to be examined and its needs have to be mirrored in the representation.",
        "We also have to determine what interactions we are aiming for.",
        "Since, e. g., in SmartKom, we pursue a situated delegation-oriented dialog paradigm – meaning that the system is in itself not a dialogue partner as in (Blaylock et al., 2003) but instead the dialogue is mediated by an animated agent – we encapsulate the details of the application APIs in an application manager and hence provide a user-oriented view of the application(s).",
        "Additionally, the dialogue plans are represented separately from the ends-based representation in a different knowledge base, i. e., the plan specifications for the action planner.",
        "However, the plans refer to the application using the ends-based representation.",
        "We have acquired our knowledge, e. g., ends-based represenations or interpretation rules completely by hand.",
        "While we avoid the potentially costly resources for the collection and annotation of corpora for automated learning4, the question remains whether expanding knowledge sources by hand is feasible.",
        "Our approach has indeed allowed for scaling up – in SmartKom we have extended the system to more than 50 functionalities overall (Reithinger et al., 2003a).",
        "In the following, we list the most important lessons we learned, which is by no means exhaustive: Encapsulation Encapsulate the backbone from the application(s).",
        "This was one of the main lessons from the NaRATo and the SmartKom projects.",
        "We did not do it in the NaRATo project and spent lots of time interfacing the database.",
        "In SmartKom, such a module exists, and the backbone developers could concentrate on more relevant tasks in dialogue processing proper.",
        "Representation Use one representation throughout the backbone.",
        "It is a secondary question how exactly it is done, but it is essential that you get there and avoid spending time on converting between different formalisms.",
        "Representation (revisited) There is to be no presentation (system output) without representation on the ends-based representation level.",
        "This representation is part of the global dialogue history residing in the discourse module and can be accessed by any module, e. g., for reference resolution at any time during the course of the dialogue.",
        "Interface In the case of a multi-module approach, use one well-defined representation for module communication.",
        "In most cases we have used XML and XML Schema which is convenient because a wide variety of infrastructure and tools is available.",
        "For instance, most XML processing tools allow for syntactic validation.",
        "However, XML is not mandatory.",
        "A final remark here: using XML in combination with stylesheets, we can in fact – contrary to the advice in Representation (above) – translate or convert messages to some internal representation easily.",
        "Interface (revisited) Interfaces should be clean and well-defined.",
        "One reason for the success of the SmartKom project was the requirement to define every interface formally by XML Schema.",
        "These XML Schemata were kept in a project-wide repository and changed at this one place",
        "after mutual agreement only.",
        "Due to the multi-blackboard approach, there are not point-to-point connections, but - to connections, and an interface definition comprises of a precise description of what is supposed to be an allowed message for a specific blackboard.",
        "Integration Our large projects have profited enormously of a dedicated integration group providing infrastructure, integration cycles and – for, e. g., the SmartKom and COMIC systems – a testbed (Herzog et al., 2004).",
        "Multimodality More modalities allow for more natural communication, which normally employs multiple channels of expression, suited to the content to be communicated.",
        "For natural language processing per se this raises new and interesting challenges, e. g., cross-modal referential expressions.",
        "It is also the case that more modalities constrain interpretation and hence enhance robustness.",
        "The ends-based representation allow for modality-independent processing in the backbone.",
        "Standards Standards ease scalability.",
        "For, e. g., ends-based representations and tools, we have previously developed custom-built software providing short-lived solutions.",
        "In other situations we have chosen standards and standard tools.",
        "We claim that the latter is beneficial in at least two ways: It opens up the door for scalability since we can reuse our as well as other’s resources.",
        "Secondly it is easier to maintain our solution over time and projects."

      "text": [
        "DFKI’s dialogue toolbox was used in a number of fully functional, differently sized systems with a variety of interaction paradigms.",
        "Vital to its success in terms of reusability and scalability was the choice of a modular design and ends-based representations throughout the complete backbone.",
        "Starting from basic functionalities, it is possible to extend the system coverage while incorporating new features.",
        "Future work includes reusing (parts of) the backbone in EU and nationally funded large projects like AMI, TALK, Inscape, VirtualHuman and SmartWeb."
