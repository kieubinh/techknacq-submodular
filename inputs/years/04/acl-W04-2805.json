        "As described by (Chang et al., 2002), the semantic and pragmatic insights provided by cognitive linguistics must be incorporated into a language understanding system before deep understanding can take place.",
        "Embodied Construction Grammar (ECG) (Chang et al., 2002), (Bergen and Chang, 2002) is a rigorous, formalism incorporating such insight.",
        "It provides formal mechanism for describing cognitive primitives like linguistic constructions (Goldberg, 1995), image schemas (Lakoff, 1987), frames (Fillmore, 1982), and mental spaces (Fauconnier and Turner, 2002), as well as cross-domain mappings.",
        "From a system-building point of view, however, the importance of ECG lies in its scalability.",
        "Within its unification-based framework, constructions, frames and mental spaces are combined compositionally, yielding a network of entwined semantic and pragmatic structures representing the overall interpretation.",
        "This makes it possible for ECG to scale to much more complex linguistic data that previous formalisms would allow.",
        "The work described in this paper builds on this system-building perspective since it is a system that leverages the ECG formalism to perform deep, scalable construction-based parsing and semantic analysis.",
        "It incorporates an implementation of ECG’s semantic and constructional primitives as well as integrating scalable language analysis algorithms like level-based parsing (Abney, 1996).",
        "This system is called the constructional analyzer and it fits into a larger framework for scalable, simulation-based language understanding.",
        "In a simulation-based model of language understanding, interpretation of an utterance is split into two phases: analysis and enactment.",
        "Analysis is the process of mapping forms to context-independent meanings, providing the input parameters for enactment.",
        "Enactment uses an active, simulation-based model to generate context-specific inference.",
        "This process-level separation of analysis and inference provides further scalability.",
        "The next three sections describe the ECG formalism, simulation-based understanding and partial parsing.",
        "Then the constructional analyzer is described along with an example.",
        "The paper closes with a description of a language analysis task requiring the deep semantic representation afforded by the constructional analyzer."

        "The grammar formalism that makes constructional analysis possible is the Embodied Construction Grammar.",
        "ECG combines a syntax and knowledge representation in a unification-based framework.",
        "This allows both constructions and frame-based, schematic knowledge to be expressed succinctly in the same formalism.",
        "As usual for construction grammar, the grammar rules in ECG are pairs, mapping a particular lexical/morphological/syntactic pattern to a (partial) specification of a situation.",
        "In ECG, this description of a situation is known as a semantic specification (semspec).",
        "The semspec combines embodied semantic primitives like",
        "image schemas (Lakoff, 1987) and executing schemas (Narayanan, 1997) with frame-based knowledge (Fillmore, 1982) to completely specify the meaning of an utterance.",
        "Meaning in ECG is represented by schemas.",
        "Schemas, much like frames, are schematic, role-based conceptual and semantic structures.",
        "But as they are intended to describe an embodied, parameter-based representation of language, the schema formalism is augmented by special semantic operators that make cognitive linguistic insights easier to express.",
        "As an initial starting point into the formalism, figure 1 shows three canonical image schemas in ECG notation.",
        "Each schema is initially defined by the keyword schema, and after the name, an optional subcase of line denotes the structures from which the current schema inherits.",
        "Much like frames, ECG schemas (and constructions) are arranged into a type hierarchy from which a schema can inherit structure.",
        "In this case, each image schema inherits from the Image-Schema type.",
        "Following the subcase of, comes the optional roles block, denoted by the roles keyword.",
        "Just like the roles of a frame, the roles of a schema are the parameters of the concept being described.",
        "These simple image schemas do not show off all of ECG’s schema mechanism, however.",
        "For a more complete picture, we now focus on the Into schema shown in figure 2.",
        "The Into schema subcases the Trajector-Landmark schema, and thus inherits the trajector and landmark roles from its parent.",
        "The Into schema further constrains the landmark role by constraining it to be of type Container.",
        "The Into schema also introduces the new evokes operator which makes the specified type locally accessible via the given alias.",
        "In this case, the evoked SPG schema acts as the background frame, capturing into’s notion of motion.",
        "This is the primary virtue of the evokes operator.",
        "It provides a way to place concepts such as bachelor into the context of their larger background frames, as described by (Fillmore, 1982).",
        "After the roles block in the Into schema, comes the optional constraints block.",
        "Constraints act as the semantic glue with the H identifying its two argument slots.",
        "When a set of slots have been coindexed, a proposed filler to any one of those slots must satisfy the restrictions of all of them.",
        "In the Into schema, the locally defined land-mark.interior1 role2 is identified with the evoked SPG’s goal role, while the landmark.exterior role is coindexed with the SPG’s source role.",
        "These constraints schematically describe how the use of into suggests motion from outside some container to the inside of that container.",
        "Figure 3 shows the Into lexical construction.",
        "Every construction starts with the keyword construction, followed by the name of the construction.",
        "Then comes the optional subcase of keyword that relates constructions to the constructional type system.",
        "The ECG version of the Into construction has a form and meaning pole, notated by the keywords form and meaning.",
        "Constructions can type their form and meaning poles.",
        "In the case of our Into construction, the form pole is of schema type Word3 and the meaning pole is of type Into schema.",
        "A typed meaning pole indicates that a particular construction denotes an instance of that type.",
        "Thus",
        "our Into construction claims that the word into means an instance of the complex relation described by the Into schema.",
        "The Into construction also exhibits the assignment operator ( ).",
        "This operator fills a slot with an atomic value.",
        "In our Into construction’s form pole, the orth4 feature brought in from the Word schema is assigned the atomic string into.",
        "Figure 4 shows the clausal Caused-Motion construction, an example of which is The basketball player threw the ball into the basket.",
        "This construction has an agent (the player) which acts upon a patient (throwing the ball) thereby moving it along a path (into the basket).",
        "Since the Caused-Motion construction links a particular syntactic form, that of a referring expression, a force-application verb, a referring expression and a path to a Caused-Motion-Scene5, the construction is different from the ones we have covered so far in that it has constituents that are themselves constructions.",
        "Thus instead of typing the form block, the form block has constraints relating the constituents.",
        "Each of the construction’s four constituents are defined in the constructional block.",
        "Each constituent is assigned a local name, and then after the colon, the constructional type is defined.",
        "If necessary, like in the case of the Verb constituent, a semantic type is added in brackets.",
        "The ordering of these constituents is specified by adding form constraints to the form block.",
        "When the constructional analyzer searches for instances of a construction, these form constraints must be satisfied.",
        "The two supported constraints are before which requires that the left argument be somewhere the left of the right argument in the input, and meets which requires the left argument to be directly before the right argument in the input.",
        "In the Caused-Motion construction, the form constraints require that the agent be directly before the verb and the verb be before the path and patient.",
        "Notice that the relative order of the path and patient is left unspecified6.",
        "Because ECG allows constituent order to be unspecified like this, ECG can express with one rule what a CFG might have to express with an exponential number of rules.",
        "The meaning pole of the construction uses the semantic machinery that has already been described.",
        "It links the agent.’s category to the agent of the scene as well as setting patient..category to the trajector of the specified path.",
        "Notice that the constraints use the m and f subscripts when referring to the constructional constituents’",
        "form and meaning poles, respectively, and can be applied to any construction as if they were just dotting into the structure.",
        "With a formal language for describing constructions, many avenues are opened.",
        "The most important for the sake of this work, is that it is possible to translate ECG descriptions into feature structures.",
        "For the most part, this translation is straightforward.",
        "For example, schemas, constructions are represented as feature structures and their roles are represented (unsurprisingly) as roles.",
        "The evokes operator, however, requires a little more care to properly model its nonlocal semantics.",
        "In this case, the evoked type is generated outside of the evoking structure.",
        "The evoked structure’s alias is represented as a local role coindexed with the nonlocal structure7."

        "In order to draw inferences about an action like walking, the system performs a simulation by executing its internal model of walking.",
        "To tailor the inference to a particular scenario, the simulator needs to set the parameters of the x-schema representation appropriately.",

        "This figure exposes both the virtues and weaknesses of chunking–the weakness being the fact that the parse for the sentence does not attach the prepositional phrase in the lab coat, treating it instead as a sister to the the woman noun group.",
        "But it also illustrates the robustness of the system in that while the grammar has no rule for reduced relative, it still correctly labels the syntactic groups.",
        "In other words, the incompleteness of the grammar does not cause phrases to be rejected since there is no requirement that a successful parse converge to a complete sentence.",
        "Thus such a parser is well-suited for spoken language (Hinrichs et al., 2000), where Hinrichs, et al. were able to get 93 % “correctness” 9 at finding the various syntactic groups from an error prone spoken language input.",
