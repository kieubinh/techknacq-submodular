        "If sentences), embedded discourse, and other natural language utterances whose interpretation depends on cognitive partitioning of contextual knowledge.",

        "There are two dimensions to scalability: improving system performance (e.g. speed and size) for a fixed task, and expanding the range of tasks that the system can handle.",
        "Today’s natural language processing (NLP) systems are not very scalable in the latter dimension.",
        "They tend to ignore a wide range of cognitive linguistic phenomena, notably those associated with mental spaces, which are key to understanding any non-trivial piece of natural language.",
        "Mental spaces (Fauconnier, 1985) are partial cognitive structures built up during discourse that keep track of entities and relations in different contexts.",
        "Hypothetical reasoning, depictions (e.g. stories, paintings or movies) and reasoning about other minds are but a few examples where new mental spaces are required.",
        "Mental spaces provide an important partitioning of contextual knowledge that allows scalable reasoning in a partitioned large knowledge base.",
        "However, the literature on Mental Space Theory does not address how these cognitive structures are specified compositionally, let alone offering formalizations of mental space representations or computational realizations.",
        "We thus seek to scale up the complexity of natural language understanding (NLU) systems by proposing a computational method of handling mental spaces.",
        "In this paper we give a brief introduction to Mental Space Theory (Section 2), and then explain how Mental Space Theory can be incorporated into the existing Neural Theory of Language (NTL) simulation-based understanding framework (Section 3).",
        "In this framework, each mental space is a separate thread of simulation.",
        "Each thread of simulation comprises a dynamic structure combining knowledge, event models and beliefs that evolve over time.",
        "The use of a simulation-based framework imposes constraints on how mental spaces are represented, and we introduce a formalization of mental spaces based on Embodied Construction Grammar (ECG).",
        "As a case study (Section 4), we will walk through the formalization of English Conditionals (Dancygier and Sweetser, 2004) using mental space analysis.",
        "Through this case study we illustrate how mental spaces are parameterized compositionally by language, and capture this composi-tionality succinctly using construction grammar.",
        "Then with these formal tools, we address the issue of inference in mental spaces (Section 5), which is at the core of the scaling up understanding."

        "This partitioning in turn affects what inferences can be drawn.",
        "In traditional mental space analysis, certain linguistic constructions called space builders may open a new mental space or shift focus to an existing space.",

        "This kind of space-building is traditionally illustrated in diagrams similar to Figure 1.",
        "In the mental space literature, the transfer of assumptions between spaces is guided by the presupposition float principle.",
        "The presupposition float principle states that any presupposed structure in the parent space can float to a child space unless it conflicts with structure already in that space.",
        "In the above example, any attributes about the real Eiffel Tower can be assumed in the Depiction-Space, as long as they do not depend on it being finished.",
        "However, this account of assumption and inference transfer is incomplete.",
        "Specifically, it is incorrect to assume that different types of mental spaces obey the same presupposition float principle.",
        "For example, if we are having a conversation right now about Harry’s painting, very little of what is currently happening should transfer into the Depiction-Space.",
        "On the other hand, if we are having a conversation about our plans for tomorrow, our current situation is very relevant to our actions tomorrow, and this information should carry over to the future space.",
        "The other key piece that is missing from the presupposition float account is how inference is drawn across spaces in general.",
        "Any computational account of mental spaces must address this inference process precisely and supply a formalized representation that inference can operate with.",

        "A central piece of a scalable computational treatment of mental spaces is a robust language understanding framework.",

        "The simulation-based understanding paradigm stipulates that, in addition to constructional analysis of the surface form, language understanding requires active simulation.",
        "The constructional analysis is based on Embodied Construction Grammar (Chang et al., 2002a) which contains four primitive types: schemas, constructions, maps and mental spaces.",
        "Schemas are the basic ECG unit of meaning, capturing embodied concepts such as image schemas, actions, and events.",
        "Constructions are the basic linguistic unit, pairing meaning schemas with representations of linguistic form (words, clauses, etc.).",
        "Maps and mental spaces are the subject of this paper, and will be discussed in detail in the next section.",
        "It is worth noting that in the ECG formalism, in addition to support of an inheritance hierarchy (with the keyword subcase of), there is also an evokes relation that makes an outside structure accessible to a schema through a local name.",
        "The evokes relation is neither a subcase-of or part-of relation, but is analogous to spreading activation in the neural sense.",
        "During analysis, a Semantic Specification (Sem-Spec) is created from the meaning poles of the constructions, and is essentially a network of schemas with the appropriate roles bounded and filled in.",
        "Crucially, within this network of schemas are executing schemas (or X-schemas), which are models of events.",
        "They are active structures for event-based asynchronous control that can capture both sequential flow and concurrency.",
        "Simulation is a dynamic process which includes executing the X-schemas specified in the SemSpec and propagating belief updates in a belief network.",
        "This mechanism is used for metaphor understanding in (Na-rayanan, 1999), and is being generalized to Coordinated Probabilistic Relational Models (CPRM) in current efforts (Narayanan, submitted).",
        "The CPRM mechanism is discussed in more detail in Section 5.",
        "Within a simulation-based understanding paradigm, each mental space involves a new thread of simulation, with its own separate belief network and simulation trace.",
        "This is necessary for keeping track of possibly contradictory beliefs, such as the alternative scenarios where it is sunny or rainy tomorrow.",
        "Each alternative scenario exists within its own mental space, and in many situations, there can be a large number of alternatives.",
        "However, not only is it computationally expensive",
        "to create a new thread of simulation, but cognitive capacity also constrains the number of concurrently open spaces.",
        "We need both a cognitively plausible and computationally feasible theory of how mental spaces are manipulated.",
        "The insight in addressing this problem is that at any given level of granularity, not all spaces need to be opened at the same time.",
        "Harry’s painting, in example (1), may be represented at different granularity depending on the context.",
        "If it is discussed simply as a wall-hanging, the Depiction-Space need not be expanded and the painting should be treated schematically as an object.",
        "However, once the contents of the painting are under discussion (e.g., the trip to Paris during which the painting was done), inference in a separate mental space is required, and the Depiction-Space needs to be built.",
        "As illustrated by this example, the simulation process dictates the actual building of mental spaces.",
        "The analysis process is responsible for supplying all the necessary parameterization of the spaces and their corresponding maps in case they need to be built.",
        "As a result, each potential space-builder is represented at two levels of granularity – as an object in its schematic form and as a full mental space.",
        "Formalizing this idea in ECG, mental spaces are represented in two ways: as a compressed mental space and an uncompressed version.",
        "In the ECG notation in Figure 2, the Compressed-Mental-Space is just a schema, and Mental-Space is of the space primitive type.",
        "In each version there is pointer to its counterpart, ums and cms respectively.",
        "The role parent-space points to the parent of this space.",
        "The uncompressed mental space contains the list of alternatives and the local-content.",
        "Alternatives are scenarios that are different and cannot co-exist, such as the different activities one might be doing tomorrow at noon.",
        "Local-content at noon.",

        "The predication is then automatically added to the local-content of the space when this role is assigned.",
