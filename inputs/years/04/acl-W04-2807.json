        "The difficulty of finding consistent criteria for making sense distinctions has been thoroughly attested to in the literature (Kilgarriff, ‘97, Hanks, ’00).",
        "Difficulties have been found with truth-theoretical criteria, linguistic criteria and definitional criteria (Sparck-Jones, ‘86, Geeraerts, ‘93).",
        "In spite of the proliferation of dictionaries, there is no methodology by which two lexicographers working independently are guaranteed to derive the same set of distinctions for a given word, with objects and events vying for which is the most difficult to characterize (Cruse, ‘86, Apresjan, ‘74, Pustejovsky, ’91, ‘95).",
        "On the other hand, accurate Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) could significantly improve the precision of Information Retrieval by ensuring that the senses of verbs in the retrieved documents match the sense of the verb in the query.",
        "For example, the two queries What do you call a successful movie?",
        "and Whom do you call for a successful movie?",
        "submitted to AskJeeves both retrieve the same set of documents, even though they are asking quite different questions, referencing very different senses of call.",
        "The documents retrieved are also not very relevant, again because they do not distinguish which matches contain relevant senses and which do not.",
        "Tips on Being a Successful Movie Vampire ...",
        "I shall call the police.",
        "Successful Casting Call & Shoot for ̏Clash of Em-pires\" ... thank everyone for their participation in the making of yesterday's movie.",
        "Demme's casting is also highly entertaining, although I wouldn't go so far as to call it successful.",
        "This movie's resemblance to its predecessor is pretty vague... VHS Movies: Successful Cold Call Selling: Over 100 New Ideas, Scripts, and Examples from the Nation's Foremost Sales Trainer.",
        "The two senses of call in the two queries can be easily distinguished by their differing predicate-argument structures.",
        "They are also separate senses in WordNet, but WordNet has an additional 26 senses for call, and the current best performance of an automatic Word Sense Disambiguation system this type of polysemous verb is only 60.2% (Dang and Palmer, 2002).",
        "Is it possible that sense distinctions that are less fine-grained than Word-Net’s distinctions could be made more reliably, and could still benefit this type of NLP application?",
        "The idea of underspecification as a solution to WSD has been proposed in Buitelaar 2000 (among others), who pointed out that for some applications, such as document categorization, information retrieval, and information extraction it may be sufficient to know if a given word belongs to a certain class of WordNet senses or underspecified sense.",
        "On the other hand, there is evidence that machine translation of languages as diverse as Chinese and English will require all of the fine-grained sense distinctions that WordNet is capable of providing, and even more (Ng, et al. 2003, Palmer, et.",
        "al., to appear).",
        "An hierarchical approach to verb senses, of the type discussed in this paper, presents obvious advantages for the problem of word sense disambiguation.",
        "The human annotation task is simplified, since there are fewer choices at each level and clearer distinctions between them.",
        "The automated systems can combine training data from closely related senses to overcome the sparse data problem, and both humans and systems can back off to a more coarse-grained choice when fine-grained choices prove too difficult.",
        "The approach to verb senses presented in this paper assumes three different levels of sense distinctions: Prop-Bank Framesets, WordNet groupings, and WordNet senses.",
        "In a project for the semantic annotation of predicate-argument structure, PropBank, we have made coarse-grained sense distinctions for the 700 most polysemous verbs in the Penn TreeBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, ’02).",
        "These distinctions are based primarily on different subcategorization frames that require different argument label annotations.",
        "In a separate project, as discussed in Palmer et al. 2004, we have grouped SENSEVAL-2 verb senses (which came from WordNet 1.7).",
        "These manual groupings were shown to reconcile a substantial portion of the manual and automatic tagging disagreements, showing that many of these disagreements are fairly subtle (Palmer, et.al., ’04).",
        "The tree levels of sense distinctions form a continuum of granularity.",
        "Our criterion for the Framesets, being primarily syntactic, is also the most clear cut.",
        "These distinctions are based primarily on usages of a verb that have different numbers of predicate-arguments, however they also separate verb senses on semantic grounds, if these senses are not closely related.",
        "Sense groupings provide an intermediate level of hierarchy, where groups are distinguished by more fine-grained criteria.",
        "Both Frameset and grouping distinctions can be made consistently by humans and systems (over 90% accuracy for Framesets and 82% for groupings) and are surprisingly compatible; 95% of our groups map directly onto a single PropBank sense."

        "An important goal is to provide consistent semantic role labels across different syntactic realizations of the same verb, as in the window in [ARG0 John] broke [ARG1 the window] and [ARG1 The window] broke.",
        "PropBank can provide frequency counts for (statistical) analysis or generation components in a machine translation system, but provides only a shallow semantic analysis in that the annotation is close to the syntactic structure and each verb is its own predicate.",
        "In addition to the annotated corpus, PropBank provides a lexicon that lists, for each broad meaning of each annotated verb, its Frameset, i.e., the possible arguments in the predicate and their labels and all possible syntactic realizations.",
        "The notion of ̏meaning\" used is fairly coarse-grained, and it is typically motivated from differing syntactic behavior.",
        "The Frameset also includes a ̏descriptor\" field for each role which is intended for use during annotation and as documentation, but which does not have any theoretical standing.",

        "The process of sense-tagging the PropBank corpus with the Frameset tags has just been completed.",
        "The criteria used for the Framesets are primarily syntactic and clear cut.",

        "However, the Hector lexicon that was used as the sense inventory was very small and under proprietary constraints, and the question remained whether it was possible to have a publicly available, broad-coverage lexical resource for English and other languages, with the requisite clear, consistent sense distinctions.",
        "Subsequently, the Senseval-2 (Edmonds and Cotton, 2001) exercise was run, which included WSD tasks for 10 languages.",
        "A concerted effort was made to use existing WordNets as sense inventories because of their widespread popularity and availability.",
        "Each language had a choice between the lexical sample task and the all-words task.",
        "The most polysemous words in the English Lexical Sample task are the 29 verbs, with an average polysemy of 16.28 senses using the pre-release version of WordNet 1.7.",
        "Double blind annotation by two linguistically trained annotators was performed on corpus instances, with a third linguist adjudicating between inter-annotator differences to create the “Gold Standard.” The average inter-annotator agreement rate was only 71%, which is comparable to the 73% agreement for all words in SemCor, with a much lower average polysemy.",
        "However, a comparison of system performance on words of similar polysemy in Senseval-1 and Senseval-2 showed very little difference in accuracy (Palmer et al., submitted).",
        "In spite of the lower inter-annotator agreement figures for Senseval-2, the double blind annotation and adjudication provided a reliable enough filter to ensure consistently tagged data with WordNet senses.",
        "Even so, the high polysemy of the WordNet 1.7 entries on average poses a challenge for automatic word sense disambiguation.",
        "In addition, WordNet only gives a flat listing of alternative senses, unlike most standard dictionaries which are more structured and often provide hierarchical entries.",
        "To address this lack, the verbs were grouped by two or more people, with differences being reconciled, and the sense groups were used for coarse-grained scoring of the systems.",
        "The criteria used for groupings included syntactic and semantic ones.",
        "Syntactic structure performed two distinct functions in our groupings.",
        "Recognizable alternations with similar corresponding predicate-argument structures were often a factor in choosing to group senses together, as in the Levin classes and PropBank, whereas distinct subcategorization frames were also often a factor in putting senses in separate groups.",
        "Furthermore, senses were grouped together if they were more specialized versions of a general sense.",
        "The semantic criteria for grouping senses separately included differences in semantic classes of arguments (abstract versus concrete, animal versus human, animacy versus inanimacy, different instrument types...), differences in the number and type of arguments (often reflected in the subcategorization frame as discussed above), differences in entailments (whether an argument refers to a created entity or a resultant state), differences in the type of event (abstract, concrete, mental, emotional...), whether there is a specialized subject domain, etc.",
        "Senseval-2 verb inter-annotator disagreements were reduced by more than a third when evaluated against the groups, from 29% to 18%, and by over half in a separate study, from 28% to 12%.",
