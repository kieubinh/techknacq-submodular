        "Therefore, it is necessary for multimedia content analysis and navigation systems to handle various forms of data.",
        "In this paper we present SpeechLogger, a research system for searching and browsing spoken communications, or the spoken component of multimedia communications.",
        "In general, the information contained in a spoken communication consists of more than just words.",
        "Our goal is to make use of all the information within a spoken communication.",
        "Our system uses automatic speech recognition (ASR) to convert speech into a format which makes word and phonetic searching of the material possible.",
        "It also uses speaker segmentation to aid navigation.",
        "We are interested in a wide range of spoken communications with different characteristics, including broadcast material, lectures, meetings, interviews, telephone conversations, call center recordings, and teleconferences.",
        "Each of these communication types presents interesting opportunities, requirements and challenges.",
        "For example, lectures might have accompanying material that can aid ASR and navigation.",
        "Prior knowledge about the speakers and the topic may be available for meetings.",
        "Call center recordings may be analyzed to create aggregate reports.",
        "Spoken document retrieval (SDR) for Broadcast News type of content has been well studied and there are many research and commercial systems.",
        "There has also been some interest in the Voicemail domain (Hirschberg et al., 2001) which consists of typically short duration human-to-machine messages.",
        "Our focus here is on telephone conversations and teleconferences with comparisons to broadcast news.",
        "The paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we motivate our approach by describing the user needs under various conditions.",

        "We are primarily interested in situations in which a person needs to gather information from audio data but the quality of that data is not always sufficient to produce good ASR results.",
        "In the case of telephone conversations, the information gatherer needs to know who was on the call, how long the call was, what was said, a summary of the call, the ability to listen to any part of the call based on search parameters that s/he specifies, etc.",
        "Our users want to be able to scan a database of many calls, across a long period of time to look for specific phrases, speakers, or patterns of speech.",
        "In many cases, it is difficult to gather this type of information from teleconference calls since the audio quality is poor because of speaker phones, cell phones and line noise.",
        "All of these combine to lower ASR results to a point where the text of the call is not fully representative of the conversation.",
        "Thus, using standard information retrieval techniques may not provide sufficient information to the user.",
        "We focus on the navigation aspect of information gathering with the goal of compensating for lower ASR accuracy by presenting user interface elements relevant to the specific task at hand (Stark et al., 2000).",
        "Rather than looking at the recorded conversation as merely audio information, we view it as a source of linguistic information to which we can apply information retrieval and data mining techniques.",
        "We use all available metadata to enhance the search and the presentation.",
        "We wanted to have a set of interface elements that would be useful no matter what the ASR accuracy was.",
        "The main interface elements are:",
        "• Timeline with tick marks indicates search hits within the spoken document which allows for many search results to be displayed without overwhelming the user.",
        "This is particularly useful for cases where there are many false positives.",
        "• Keyword extraction summarizes a given communication, enables differentiation among a collection of many spoken documents, and detects subtopics in a large spoken document.",
        "• Speaker segmentation and speaker identification separate a long spoken document into inherently useful pieces.",
        "• Lattice search and phoneme search expand the possible search space.",
        "In this paper we examine three classes of spoken documents and consider what tasks a user might want to perform on them.",
        "• Broadcast News - excellent ASR conditions, one speaker at a time, good audio quality and generally a good speaker.",
        "Task involves primarily inter-document navigation.",

        "It is also flexible enough to support other forms of audio as input or to support new speech processing techniques as they become available.",
        "The system was designed with modularity in mind.",
        "For instance, it should be possible to add a speaker identification module to the processing.",
        "Once a new audio recording is available on the File Server, the following processing steps can begin: speaker segmentation, speech recognition, transcription alignment, keyword extraction, audio compression, and speech indexing.",
        "Each step will be described in more detail below.",
        "We attempt to distinguish the different speakers from each other in the speaker segmentation component.",
        "The speech recognition component converts the audio into a word or phone based representation including alternative hypotheses in the form of a lattice.",

        "The keyword extraction component generates the most salient words found in the speech recognition output (one-best word) or transcript (if available) and can be used to determine the nature of the spoken communications.",
        "The audio compression component compresses the audio file and creates an MP3 audio file which is copied to the Media Server.",
        "The final step in the processing is text and lattice indexing.",
        "This includes creating indices based on one-best word and one-best phone strings or word and phone lattices.",
        "After processing, the user can search and browse the audio using either the text index or the lattice index.",

        "Speaker-based segmentation of multi-speaker audio data has received considerable attention in recent years.",
        "Applications that have been considered include: indexing archived recorded spoken documents by speaker to facilitate browsing and retrieval of desired portions; tagging speaker specific portions of data to be used for adapting speech models in order to improve the quality of automatic speech recognition transcriptions, and tracking speaker specific segments in audio streams to aid in surveillance applications.",
        "In our system, speaker segmentation is used for more effective visualization of the audio document and speaker-based audio playback.",
        "Figure 2 gives an overview of the speaker segmentation algorithm we developed.",
        "It consists of two steps: preprocessing and iterative speaker segmentation.",
        "During the preprocessing step, the input audio stream is segmented into frames and acoustic features are computed for each frame.",
        "The features we extracted are energy, 12 Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), pitch, and the first and second order temporal derivatives.",
        "Then, all speaker boundary candidates are located, which include silent frames and frames with minimum energy in a window of neighboring frames.",
        "The preprocessing step generates a set of over-segmented audio segments, whose durations may be as short as a fraction of a second to as long as a couple of seconds.",
        "The iterative speaker segmentation step, as depicted in the bigger dotted rectangle in Figure 2, detects all segments of each speaker in an iterative way and then marks the boundaries where speakers change.",
        "At the beginning, all segments produced by the preprocessing step are unlabeled.",
        "Assuming that the features within each segment follow a Gaussian distribution, we compute the distances between each pair of segments using the Kullback Leibler distance (KLD) (Cover and Thomas, 1991).",
        "Here, we just consider features extracted from voiced frames since only voiced frames have pitch information.",
        "Based on the segment distance matrix, a hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) (Jain and Dubes, 1988) algorithm is applied",
        "to all unlabeled segments.",
        "The biggest cluster will be hypothesized as the set of segments for a new speaker and the rest of the segments will be considered as background audio.",
        "Accordingly, each unlabeled segment is labeled as either the target speaker or background.",
        "Then an embedded speaker segment refinement substep is activated to iteratively refine the segments of the target speaker.",
        "The refinement substep is depicted in the smaller dotted rectangle in Figure 2.",
        "For each iteration, two Gaussian mixture models (GMM) are built based on current segment labels, one for the target speaker, one for background audio.",
        "Then all segments are relabeled as either the target speaker or background audio using the maximum likelihood method based on the two GMM models.",
        "If the set of segments for the target speaker converges or the refinement iteration number reaches its maximum, the refinement iteration stops.",
        "Otherwise, a new iteration starts.",
        "Before the refinement substep terminates, it assigns a new speaker label for all segments of the target speaker, and sets the background audio as unlabeled.",
        "Then the iterative speaker segmentation step needs to test for more speakers or needs to stop.",
        "The termination criteria could be the given number of speakers (or major speakers) in an audio document, the percentage of unlabeled segments to the number of all segments, or the maximum distance among all pairs of unlabeled segments.",
        "If any of the criteria are met, the speaker segmentation algorithm merges all adjacent segments if their speaker labels are the same, and then outputs a list of audio segments with corresponding speaker labels.",
        "Obviously, one advantage of our speaker segmentation method is that the speaker labels are also extracted.",
        "Although the real speaker identities are not available, the",
        "labels are very useful for presenting, indexing, and retrieving audio documents.",
