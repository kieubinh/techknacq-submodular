        "This paper introduces a method that generates simulated multimodal input to be used in testing multimodal system implementations, as well as to build statistically motivated multimodal integration modules.",
        "The generation of such data is inspired by the fact that true multimodal data, recorded from real usage scenarios, is difficult and costly to obtain in large amounts.",
        "On the other hand, thanks to operational speech-only dialogue system applications, a wide selection of speech/text data (in the form of transcriptions, recognizer outputs, parse results, etc.)",
        "is available.",
        "Taking the textual transcriptions and converting them into multimodal inputs in order to assist multimodal system development is the underlying idea of the paper.",
        "A conceptual framework is established which utilizes two input channels: the original speech channel and an additional channel called Virtual Modality.",
        "This additional channel provides a certain level of abstraction to represent non-speech user inputs (e.g., gestures or sketches).",
        "From the transcriptions of the speech modality, predefined semantic items (e.g., nominal location references) are identified, removed, and replaced with deictic references (e.g., here, there).",
        "The deleted semantic items are then placed into the Virtual Modality channel and, according to external parameters (such as a predefined user population with various deviations), temporal shifts relative to the instant of each corresponding deictic reference are issued.",
        "The paper explains the procedure followed to create Virtual Modality data, the details of the speech-only database, and results based on a multimodal city information and navigation application."

        "Multimodal systems have recently drawn significant attention from researchers, and the reasons for such an interest are many.",
        "First, speech recognition based applications and systems have become mature enough for larger-scale deployment.",
        "The underlying technologies are gradually exhibiting increased robustness and performance, and from the usability point of view, users can see some clear benefits from speech-driven applications.",
        "The next evolutionary step is the extension of the \"one dimensional\" (i.e., speech-only) interface capabilities to include other modalities, such as gesture, sketch, gaze, and text.",
        "This will lead to a better and more comprehensive user experience.",
        "A second reason is the widely accepted, and expected, mobility and pervasiveness of computers.",
        "Devices are getting more and more powerful and versatile; they can be connected anywhere and anytime to networks, as well as to each other.",
        "This poses new demands for the user interface.",
        "It is no longer sufficient to support only a single input modality.",
        "Depending on the specific application, the given usage scenario, and the context, for example, users should be offered a variety of options by which to interact with the system in an appropriate and efficient way.",
        "Third, as the output capabilities of devices provide ever-increasing multimedia experiences, it is natural that the input mechanism must also deal with various",
        "modalities in an intuitive and comprehensive manner.",
        "If a map is displayed to the user, it is natural to expect that the user may want to relate to this physical entity, for instance, via gestures, pointing, gazing or by other, not necessarily speech-based, communicative means.",
        "Multimodal interfaces give the user alternatives and flexibility in terms of the interaction; they are enabling rather than restricting.",
        "The primary goal is to fully understand the user's intention, and this can only be realized if all intentional user inputs, as well as any available contextual information (e.g., location, pragmatics, sensory data, user preferences, current and previous interaction histories) are taken into account.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 introduces the concept of Virtual Modality and how the multimodal data are generated.",
        "Section 3 explains the underlying Galaxy environment and briefly summarizes the operation of the Context Resolution module responsible for, among other tasks, resolving deictic references.",

      "text": [
        "Multiple modalities and multimedia are an essential part of our daily lives.",
        "Human-human communication relies on a full range of input and output modalities, for instance, speech, gesture, vision, gaze, and paralinguistic, emotional and sensory information.",
        "In order to conduct seamless communication between humans and machines, as many such modalities as possible need to be considered.",
        "Intelligent devices, wearable terminals, and mobile handsets will accept multiple inputs from different modalities (e.g., voice, text, handwriting), they will render various media from various sources, and in an intelligent manner they will also be capable of providing additional, contextual information about the environment, the interaction history, or even the actual state of the user.",
        "Information such as the emotional, affective state of the user, the proximity of physical entities, the dialogue history, and biometric data from the user could be used to facilitate a more accommodating, and concise interaction with a system.",
        "Once contextual information is fully utilized and multimodal input is supported, then the load on the user can be considerably reduced.",
        "This is especially important for users with severe disabilities.",
        "Implementing complex multimodal applications represents the chicken-and-egg problem.",
        "A significant amount of data is required in order to build and tune a system; on the other hand, without an operational system, no real data can be collected.",
        "Incremental and rule-based implementations, as well as quick mock-ups and Wizard-of-Oz setups (Lemmelä and Boda, 2002), aim to address the application development process from both ends; we follow an intermediate approach.",
        "The work presented here is performed under the assumption that testing and building multimodal systems can benefit from a vast amount of multimodal data, even if the data is only a result of simulation.",
        "Furthermore, generating simulated multimodal data from textual data is justified by the fact that a multimodal system should also operate in speech-only mode."

      "heading": "2.2 The concept",
      "text": [
        "Most current multimodal systems are developed with particular input modalities in mind.",
        "In the majority of cases, the primary modality is speech and the additional modality is typically gesture, gaze, sketch, or any combination thereof.",
        "Once the actual usage scenario is fixed in terms of the available input modalities, subsequent work focuses only on these input channels.",
        "This is advantageous on the one hand; however, on the other hand, there is a good chance that system development will focus on tiny details related to the modality-dependent nature of the recognizers and their particular interaction in the given domain and application scenario.",
        "Virtual Modality represents an abstraction in this sense.",
        "The focus is on what semantic units (i.e., meaningful information from the application point of view) are delivered in this channel and how this channel aligns with the speech channel.",
        "Note that the speech channel has no exceptional role; it is equal in every sense with the Virtual Modality.",
        "There is only one specific consideration regarding the speech channel, namely, it conveys deictic references that establish connections with the semantic units delivered by the Virtual Modality channel.",
        "The abstraction provided by the Virtual Modality enables the developer to focus on the interrelation of the speech and the additional modalities, in terms of their temporal correlation, in order to study and experiment with various usage scenarios and usability issues.",
        "It also means that we do not care how the information delivered by the Virtual Modality arose, what (actual/physical) recognition process produced them, nor how the recognition processes can influence each other’s performance via cross-interaction using early evidence available in one channel or in the other - although we acknowledge that this aspect is important and desired, as pointed out by Coen (2001) and Haikonen (2003), this has not yet been addressed in the first implementation of the model.",
        "The term “virtual modality” is not used in the multimodal research community, as far as we know.",
        "The only occurrence we found is by Marsic and Dorohonceanu (2003), however, with “virtual modality system” they refer to a multimodal management module that manages and controls various applications sharing common modalities in the context of telecollaboration user interfaces."

        "The upper portion describes how the output of a speech recognizer (or direct natural language input from keyboard) and a sequence of words, {w1 .... wN}, is transformed into a corresponding sequence of concepts, {C1 .... CM}.",
        "The module responsible for this operation, for the sake of simplicity and generality, is called a classifier (CL).",
        "In real-life implementations, this module can be a sophisticated natural language understanding (NLU) unit, a simple semantic grammar, or a hybrid of several approaches.",
        "The middle part of Figure 1 exhibits how the Virtual Modality is plugged into the classifier.",
        "The Virtual Modality channel (VM) is parallel to the speech channel (Sp) and it delivers certain semantic units to the classifier.",
        "These semantic units correspond to a portion of the word sequence in the speech channel.",
        "For instance, the original incoming sentence might be, “From Harvard University to MIT.” In the case of a multimodal setup the semantic unit, originally represented by a set of words in the speech channel (e.g., “to MIT”), will be delivered by the Virtual Modality as mi.",
        "The tier between the two modality channels is a deictic reference in the speech channel (di in the bottom of Figure 1).",
        "There are various realizations of a deictic reference, in this example it can be, for example, “here”, “over there”, or “this university”.",
        "Nevertheless, in all cases for these input combinations (i.e., speech only, speech and some other modality) the requirement is that the very same sequence of semantic concepts is to be produced by the classifier.",
        "There is one more criterion: there must be a temporal correspondence between the input channels.",
        "The deictic reference can only be resolved if the input delivered by the other modality channel is within certain time frames.",
        "This is indicated tentatively in the figure as mi occurring either in synchrony with, prior to, or following the deictic reference in time (see Section 4.3).",
        "In the above described model the speech channel will always have a deictic replacement when a semantic unit is moved to the Virtual Modality channel, although Oviatt, DeAngeli and Kuhn (1997) reported their findings that in a given application domain users are not even using spoken deictic references in more than half of the multimodal input cases.",
