        "This paper discusses robustness and adaptation issues in a statistically-based SLU system which is entirely data-driven.",
        "To test robustness, the system has been tested on data from the Air Travel Information Service (ATIS) domain which has been artificially corrupted with varying levels of additive noise.",
        "Although the speech recognition performance degraded steadily, the system did not fail catastrophically.",
        "Indeed, the rate at which the end-to-end performance of the complete system degraded was significantly slower than that of the actual recognition component.",
        "In a second set of experiments, the ability to rapidly adapt the core understanding component of the system to a different application within the same broad domain has been tested.",
        "Using only a small amount of training data, experiments have shown that a semantic parser based on the Hidden Vector State (HVS) model originally trained on the ATIS corpus can be straightforwardly adapted to the somewhat different DARPA Communicator task using standard adaptation algorithms.",
        "The paper concludes by suggesting that the results presented provide initial support to the claim that an SLU system which is statistically-based and trained entirely from data is intrinsically robust and can be readily adapted to new applications."

        "Spoken language is highly variable as different people use different words and sentence structures to convey the same meaning.",
        "Also, many utterances are grammatically-incorrect or ill-formed.",
        "It thus remains an open issue as to how to provide robustness for large populations of non-expert users in spoken dialogue systems.",
        "The key component of a spoken language understanding (SLU) system is the semantic parser, which translates the users’ utterances into semantic representations.",
        "Traditionally, most semantic parser systems have been built using hand-crafted semantic grammar rules and so-called robust parsing (Ward and Issar, 1996; Seneff, 1992; Dowding et al., 1994) is used to handle the ill-formed user input in which word patterns corresponding to semantic tokens are used to fill slots in different semantic frames in parallel.",
        "The frame with the highest score then yields the selected semantic representation.",
        "Formally speaking, the robustness of language (recognition, parsing, etc.)",
        "is a measure of the ability of human speakers to communicate despite incomplete information, ambiguity, and the constant element of surprise (Briscoe, 1996).",
        "In this paper, two aspects of SLU system performance are investigated: noise robustness and adaptability to different applications.",
        "For the former, we expect that an SLU system should maintain acceptable performance when given noisy input speech data.",
        "This requires, the understanding components of the SLU system to be able to correctly interpret the meaning of an utterance even when faced with recognition errors.",
        "For the latter, the SLU system should be readily adaptable to a different application using a relatively small set (e.g. less than 100) of adaptation utterances.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "An overview of our data-driven SLU system is outlined in section 2.",
        "Experimental results on performance under a range of SNRs are then presented in section 3.",
        "Section 4 discusses adaptation of the HVS model to new applications.",

        "Within a statistical framework, the SLU problem can be factored into three stages.",
        "First the speech recognizer recognizes the underlying word string W from each input acoustic signal A, i.e.",
        "then the semantic parser maps the recognized word string Wˆ into a set of semantic concepts C",

        "Incremental speaker adaptation based on the maximum likelihood linear regression (MLLR) method (Gales and Woodland, 1996) was performed during the test with updating being performed in batches of five utterances per speaker.",
        "The Hidden Vector State (HVS) model (He and Young, 2003b) is a hierarchical semantic parser which associates each state of a push-down automata with the state of a HMM.",
        "State transitions are factored into separate stack pop and push operations and then constrained to give a tractable search space.",
        "The result is a model which is complex enough to capture hierarchical structure but which can be trained automatically from unannotated data.",
        "Let each state at time t be denoted by a vector of Dt semantic concept labels (tags) ct = [ct [1], ct [2], ••ct[Dt]] where ct [1] is the preterminal concept and ct [Dt] is the root concept (SS in Figure 2).",
        "Given a word sequence W, concept vector sequence C and a sequence of stack pop operations N, the joint probability of P(W, C, N) can be decomposed as",
        "where P(AJW) is the acoustic probability from the first pass, P(W) is the language modelling likelihood, P(CJ W) is the semantic parse score, LN denotes the N-best list, a is a semantic parse scale factor, and y is a grammar scale factor.",

        "On decreasing the SNR to 15dB, the system performance degrades significantly.",
        "The WER increases by 3.1 times relative to clean but the query answer error rate increases by only 1.7 times.",
        "Similar figures were obtained for the DEC94 test set.",
        "The above suggests that the end-to-end performance measured in terms of answer error rate degrades more slowly compared to the recognizer WER as the noise level increases.",
        "This demonstrates that the statistically-based understanding components of the SLU system, the semantic parser and the dialogue act decoder, are relatively robust to degrading recognition performance.",
        "Regarding the individual component performance, the dialogue act detection accuracy appears to be less sensitive to decreasing SNR.",
        "This is probably a consequence of the fact that the Bayesian networks are set up to respond to only the presence or absence of semantic concepts or slots, regardless of the actual values assigned to them.",
        "In another words, the performance of the dialogue act decoder is not affected by the mis-recognition of individual words, but only by a failure to detect the presence of a semantic concept.",

        "The system is trained entirely from data and there are no heuristic rules.",
        "One of the major claims motivating the design of this type of system is that its fully-statistical framework makes it intrinsically robust and readily adaptable to new applications.",
        "The aim of this paper has been to investigate this claim experimentally via two sets of experiments using a system trained on the ATIS corpus.",
        "In the first set of experiments, the acoustic test data was corrupted with varying levels of additive car noise.",
        "The end-to-end system performance was then measured along with the individual component performances.",
        "It was found that although the addition of noise had a substantial effect on the word error rate, its relative influence on both the semantic parser slot/value retrieval rate and the dialogue act detection accuracy was somewhat less.",
        "Overall, the end-to-end error rate degraded relatively more slowly than word error rate and perhaps most importantly of all, there was no catastrophic failure point at which the system effectively stops working, a situation not uncommon in current rule-based systems.",
        "In the second set of experiments, the ability of the semantic decoder component to be adapted to another application was investigated.",
        "In order, to limit the issues to parameter mismatch problems, the new application chosen (Communicator) covered essentially the same set of concepts but was a rather different corpus with different user speaking styles and different syntactic forms.",
        "Overall, we found that moving a system trained on ATIS to this new application resulted in a 6% absolute drop in F-measure on concept accuracy (i.e. a 62% relative increase in parser error) and by extrapolation with the results in the ATIS domain, we infer that this would make the non-adapted system essentially unusable in the new application.",
        "However, when adaptation was applied using only 50 adaptation sentences, the loss of concept accuracy was mostly restored.",
        "Specifically, using log-linear adaptation, the out-of-domain F-measure of 83.3% was restored to 89.2% which is close to the in-domain F-measure of 89.5%.",
        "Although these tests are preliminary and are based on off-line corpora, the results do give positive support to the initial claim made for statistically-based spoken language systems, i.e. that they are robust and they are readily adaptable to new or changing applications."
