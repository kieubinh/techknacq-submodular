        "With the increasing number of biomedical papers, and their electronic publication in NCBI-PUBMED, there is a growing focus on information retrieval from texts.",
        "In particular, the recent development of procedures for large-scale experiments, such as yeast-two hybrid screening, mass spectrometry, and DNA/protein microarrays, has brought about many changes in the knowledge required by biologists and chemists.",
        "Because they produce large amounts of data on genes at one time, biologists require extensive knowledge of numerous genes to analyze the data obtained and these are beyond the capability of manual acquisition from the vast biomedical literature.",
        "Since, in many cases, the main objective of text processing is extraction of protein-protein/gene interaction or gene function, the first problem to solve is gene/protein/compound name recognition.",
        "To date, various methods of protein/gene name taggers have been proposed, mainly relating to Homo sapiens.",
        "These methods can be roughly divided into rule-based approaches (Fukuda et al.",
        "1998), statistical approaches, including machine learning (Collier et al.",
        "2000, Nobata et al.",

        "Rapid advances in the biomedical field have resulted in the accumulation of numerous experimental results, mainly in text form.",
        "To extract knowledge from biomedical papers, or use the information they contain to interpret experimental results, requires improved techniques for retrieving information from the biomedical literature.",
        "In many cases, since the information is required in gene units, recognition of the named entity is the first step in gathering and using knowledge encoded in these papers.",
        "Dictionary-based searching is useful for retrieving biological information in gene units.",
        "However, since many genes in the biomedical literature are written using ambiguous names, such as family names, we need a way of constructing dictionaries.",
        "In our laboratory, we have developed a gene name dictionary:GENA and a family name dictionary.",
        "The latter contains ambiguous hierarchical gene names to compensate GENA.",
        "In addition, to address the problem of trivial gene name variations and polysemy, heuristics were used to search gene/protein/family names in MEDLINE abstracts.",
        "Using these algorithms to match dictionary and gene/protein/family names, about 95, 91, and 89% of protein/gene/family names in abstracts on Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, and Homo sapiens were detected with a precision of 96, 92, and 94%, in respective organisms.",
        "The effect of our gene/protein/family recognition method on protein-interaction and protein-function ex-There are three main problems in dictionary-based searching: (1) the existence of multi-sense words; (2) variations in gene names; and (3) the existence of ambiguous names.",
        "The first problem is mainly seen in symbol (abbreviated) types.",
        "For example, HAC1 is a synonym for both “tripartite motif-containing 3” and “hyperpolarization activated cyclic nucleotide-gated potassium channel 2” in H. sapiens.",
        "Further, some gene names, especially in Drosophila melanogaster, have the same spelling with verb(lack, ...), adjective(white, yellow...), common nouns (spot, twin, ...), and prepositions (of, ...).",
        "The second problem is trivial variations in gene names (orthographical, morphological, syntactic, lexico-semantic, insertion/deletion, permutation, or pragmatic).",
        "For example, “mitogen-activated protein kinase 1” and “protein kinase mitogen-activated, 1”, “NIK ser-ine/threonine protein kinase”, and “NIK protein kinase” indicate the same gene.",
        "The third problem is caused by ambiguous expression of the gene name in the text.",
        "The problems of multi-sense words and the ambiguity are well summarized by Tuason et al.",
        "(2004) In many cases, the family name is used instead of the gene name.",
        "A unique gene locus may not have been specified, especially for genes with multiple paralogs, or to avoid repeating the same expression, the family name may frequently be used.",
        "For example, in 1996, the “14- 3-3” family name was counted 107 times in abstracts using mesh terms for human, while “14-3-3 alpha, beta, delta, gamma” gene name expressions did not appear at all.",
        "Thus, a family name dictionary is also required along with a gene name dictionary to specify the gene locus or loci.",

        "In the strict criteria of family name recognition, 10, 18, 10 names were recognized as higher concepts in H. sapiens, D. melanogaster, and S.cerevisiae, respectively.",
        "The registration of detailed entries for the family name dictionary is required.",
        "The heuristics of the name detection seem to be sufficient so that no name detections failed due to trivial name variations in H. sapiens and S. cerevisiae, and only one name in D. melanogaster except mutant variation failed.",

        "In our laboratory, protein interaction information and protein function were automatically extracted and stored in PRIME (http://prime.ontology.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp) and in the protein kinase database (http://kinasedb.ontology.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp, Koike et al., 2003).",
        "With this procedure, some false positives were not extracted since the phrase patterns did not match the extracted protein interaction and protein function.",

        "For example, from PUBMED_11279098: “We also identified key residue pairs in the hydrophobic core of the Cet1 protomer that support the active site tunnel and stabilize the triphos-phatase in vivo.” It is difficult to automatically judge from this sentence whether “triphosphatase” means the Cet1 function or another protein family name.",

        "Further, they were developed mainly for H. sapiens.",
        "Since the naming convention is different in organisms, their recognition performance in other organisms is unknown.",

        "(2002) have reported the dictionary-based name recognition.",
        "This report discussed the difficulty of the gene name recognition of D. melanogaster and showed the increase of the precision by removing the gene names that have meanings as normal English words.",

        "Tsuruoka and Tsujii (2003) also reported the dictionary-based named recognition and our method is similar to them.",
        "They resolved the trivial gene variation problems using dynamic programming and tries, while in our method, by normalizing dictionary names and devising the trie structure, the trivial variations were addressed without dynamic programming and the required CPU time is expected to be largely reduced without decreasing precision and recall.",
        "The protein name recognition standard is a little different from them and the direct comparison of precision and recall with their results seem meaningless.",
        "In their methods, they focus on protein names (without gene names) and seem not to distinguish whether the protein name candidate represents the protein itself or not in the context.",
        "(ex.",
        "“IL-1 receptor antagonist” and “IL-1 receptor expression”: only the latter description means the IL-1 receptor itself.)",
        "Further, in our method, addressing the ambiguity of gene names (common gene names among multiple gene names) is tried.",
        "Since long protein names are usually written with abbreviated names, the name variations caused of permutation and insertion/deletion of long name words are picked up in the ambiguity resolution process."

      "heading": "8 Conclusions:",
      "text": [
        "We constructed gene name and family name dictionaries to link each gene name to a gene locus and to relate ambiguous names to gene families.",
        "Our preliminary investigations showed that more than one-third to one-half of gene/protein names in abstracts are written using ambiguous names such as family/super-family level names.",
        "This indicates that dictionary-based gene/protein/family name recognition requires not only a gene name dictionary but also a hierarchical family name dictionary.",
        "Using the gene name dictionary GENA and the family name dictionary we constructed and our searching method, 95, 91, and 89% of protein/gene/family names in abstracts on S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster, and H. sapiens were detected with a precision of 96, 92, and 94%, respectively.",
        "The simple heuristics we developed seem to be useful for matching gene/family names in texts with dictionary entry names, although additional trivial changes are required to address ambiguity of gene names.",
        "These methods are also useful for extracting data on protein interaction and protein function.",
        "However, the gene/protein/family name recognition subject is deep.",
        "For example, “NFkappaB” represents “NFKB1” and “RELA” complex in many contexts and sometimes represents “NFKB1”.",
        "Unfortunately, these complicated recognitions were not resolved.",
        "Although different organisms have different naming conventions, the nomenclature for mammals is similar to that for H. sapiens, and most bacteria and archaea gene/protein/family names are similar to the nomenclature for S. cerevisiae.",
        "Problems in gene name recognition for most organisms will be able to be addressed using our method.",
        "Dictionary-based name recognition cannot search new gene name/synonym names.",
        "However, the whole human/drosophila/yeast genomes have already been sequenced and the appearance of new synonym names can be expected to decrease or be inferable from the referenced known name.",
        "In addition, with the introduction of the family name dictionary, parts of new genes can be retrieved using the higher concept name (family name), even if the new gene name itself is not registered in GENA.",
        "Accordingly, the dictionary-based name recognition will be expected to be sufficient for the information extraction in these organisms.",
        "Protein-interaction and protein-function information extracted using these procedures for gene/protein/family name recognition are available from http://prime.ontlogy.ims.u-toky.ac.jp."
