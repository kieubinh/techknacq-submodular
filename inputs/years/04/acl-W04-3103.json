        "Our general goal is to investigate speculative speech in bioscience literature and explore how it might be used in HLT applications for bioscientists.",
        "A more specific goal is to investigate the use of speculative speech in MEDLINE abstracts because of their accessibility.",
        "There are a number of reasons supporting the importance of understanding speculative speech:",
        "• it makes up a substantial portion of scientific prose (we estimate that 11% of sentences in MEDLINE abstracts contain speculative fragments), • many researchers are interested in current trends and directions and speculations are likely to be relevant, • even if definite statements are of primary importance, knowing that a statement is not definite, i.e. speculative, is important.",
        "In the following, we expand upon these points in the contexts of i) information retrieval, ii) information extraction, and iii) knowledge discovery.",
        "In the context of information retrieval, an example information need might be “I am looking for speculations about the X gene in liver tissue.” One of the authors spoke at a research department of a drug company and the biologists present expressed this sort of information need.",
        "On the other hand, one of the authors has also encountered the opposite need: “I am looking for definite statements about transcription factors that interact with NF Kappa B.” Both these information needs would be easier to fulfill if automated annotation of speculative passages was possible.",
        "In the context of information extraction, a similar situation exists.",
        "For example, extracting tables of protein-protein interactions would benefit from knowing which interactions were speculative and which were definite.",
        "In the context of knowledge discovery (KR), speculation might play a number of roles.",
        "One possibility would be to use current speculative statements about a topic of interest as a seed for the automated knowledge discovery process.",
        "For example, terms could be extracted from speculative fragments and used to guide the initial steps of the knowledge discovery process.",
        "A less direct but perhaps even more important use is in building test/train datasets for knowledge discovery systems.",
        "For example, let us assume that in a 1985 publication we find a speculation about two topics/concepts A and C being related and later in a 1995 document there is a definite statement declaring that A and C are connected via B.",
        "This pair of statements can then form the basis of a discovery problem.",
        "We may use it to test a KR system’s ability to predict B as the connecting aspect between A and C and to do this using data prior to the 1995 publication.",
        "The same example could also be used differently: KR systems could be assessed on their ability to make a speculation between A and C using data up to 1985 excluding the particular publication making the speculation.",
        "In this way such pairs of temporally ordered speculative-definite statements may be of value in KR research.",
        "Differentiating between speculative and definite statements is one part of finding such statement pairs."
