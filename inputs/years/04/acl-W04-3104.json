        "One of the routine tasks for model organism database curators is to identify and associate research articles to database entries.",
        "Such task can be considered as text categorization which has been studied in the general English domain.",
        "The task can be decomposed into two text categorization subtasks: i) finding relevant articles associating with specific model organisms, and ii) routing the articles to specific entries or specific areas.",
        "In this paper, we investigated the first subtask and designed a study using existing reference information available at four well-known model organism databases and investigated the problem of identifying relevant articles for these organisms.",
        "We used features obtained from abstract text and titles.",
        "Additionally, we studied the determination power of other MEDLINE citation fields (e.g., Authors, MeshHeadings, Journals).",
        "Furthermore, we compared three supervised machine learning techniques on predicting to which organism the article belongs."

        "With the accelerated accumulation of genetic information associated with popularly used genetic model organisms for the human genome project such as laboratory mouse, C. elegans, fruit fly, and Saccharomyces, model organism databases that contain curated genetic information specifically to the associated organism have been initialized and evolved to provide a central place for researchers to seek condense genetic information (Flybase, 2003; Blake, 2003; Misra, 2003).",
        "At the same time, a rich amount of genetic and biomedical information associated with these model organisms are published through scientific literature.",
        "One of the routine curation tasks for the database curators is to associate research articles to specific genetic entries in the databases and identify key information mentioned in the articles.",
        "For example, a regular practice of mouse genetic database curators is to scan the current scientific literature, extract and enter the relevant information into databases (Blake, 2003).",
        "In Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD, Saccharomyces cerevisiae: http://www.yeastgenome.org), database curators are currently in the process of revising the information associated with the Description field of an entry to ensure that the Description (which usually is a concise summary of the function and biological context of the associated entry) contains the most up-to-date information and is written in a consistent style.",
        "One of the current objectives of Worm-Base (http://www.wormbase.org) is to systematically curate the C.elegans literature.",
        "However, manually scanning scientific articles is a labor intensive task.",
        "Meanwhile, the outcome may be incomplete, i.e., curators may miss some critical papers.",
        "Additionally, more than 2000 completed references are added daily to MEDLINE alone.",
        "It seems impossible to be always up-to-date.",
        "The task of associating research articles with specific entries can be decomposed into two subtasks: i) categorizing articles into several categories where articles with the same category are about the same model organism, and ii) associating the articles to specific entries or specific areas.",
        "Finding relevant articles specific to a particular model organism is a case of information retrieval.",
        "A simple way to retrieve relevant articles about a model organism is to retrieve articles containing terms that represent that organism.",
        "For example, if the term “C.",
        "elegans” appears in a paper, most likely, the paper is relevant to C. elegans.",
        "Another way is to apply supervised machine learning techniques on a list of category-labeled documents.",
        "In this paper, we designed a study on retrieving relevant articles using MEDLINE reference information obtained from four model organism databases aiming to answer the following questions:",
        "• Can we just use keywords to retrieve relevant MEDLINE references instead of using complicated machine learning techniques?",
        "• How accurate is the retrieval when we use various MEDLINE fields such as Authors, MeshHeadings etc to retrieve articles?",
        "Which kind of feature representations has the best performance?",
        "• Which kind of machine learning algorithm is suitable for categorizing the articles to the appropriate categories?",
        "How good is the MEDLINE citation information when we used category-labeled documents obtained in the past to predict the category of new documents?",
        "In the following, we first provide background information about applying supervised machine learning techniques on text categorization.",
        "We then describe materials and methods.",

        "Using keywords to retrieve relevant articles is to use a list of keywords to retrieve articles containing these keywords.",
        "The main component here is to derive a list of keywords for each category.",
        "Using supervised machine learning techniques to retrieve relevant articles requires a collection of category-labeled documents.",
        "The objective is to learn classifiers from these category-labeled documents.",
        "The construction process of a classifier given a list of category-labeled documents contains two components.",
        "The first component transfers each document into a feature representation.",
        "The second component uses a supervised learning algorithm to learn classification knowledge that forms a classifier.",
        "Machine learning for text categorization requires transforming each document into a feature representation (usually a feature vector) where features are usually words or word stems in the document.",
        "In our study, in addition to word or word stems in free text, we also explored other features that could be extracted from the material we used for the study.",
        "Several supervised learning algorithms have been adapted for text categorization: Naïve Bayes learning (Yang and Liu, 1999), neural networks (Wiener, 1995), instance-based learning (Iwayama and Takunaga, 1995), and Support vector machine (Joachims, 1998).",
        "Yang and Liu (1999) provided an overview and a comparative study about different learning algorithms.",
        "In previous studies of applying supervised machine learning on the problem of word sense disambiguation, we investigated and implemented several supervised learning algorithms including Naïve Bayes learning, Decision List learning and Support Vector Machine for word sense disambiguation.",
        "There is not much difference between word sense disambiguation task and text categorization task.",
        "We can formulate a word sense disambiguation task as a text categorization task by considering senses of a word as categories (Sebastiani, 2002).",
        "We can also formulate a text categorization task by considering there is a hidden word (e.g., TC) in the text with multiple senses (i.e., categories).",
        "Note that in word sense disambiguation task, one occurrence of a word usually holds a unique sense.",
        "While for text categorization task, sometimes one document can be in multiple categories.",
        "After verifying that there were less than 1% of documents holding multiple categories (shown in detail in the following section), for simplicity, we applied the implementations of supervised machine learning algorithm (used for word sense disambiguation) directly for text categorization by considering the disambiguation of a hidden word (TC) in the context.",
        "The following summarizes the algorithms used in the study.",
        "For detail implementations of these algorithms, readers can refer to (Liu, 2004).",
        "Naïve Bayes learning (NBL) (Duda, 1973) is widely used in machine learning due to its efficiency and its ability to combine evidence from a large number of features.",
        "An NBL classifier chooses the category with the highest conditional probability for a given feature vector; while the computation of conditional probabilities is based on the Naïve Bayes assumption: the presence of one feature is independent of another when conditioned on the category variable.",
        "The training of the Naïve Bayes classifier consists of estimating the",
        "•",
        "prior probabilities for different categories as well as the probabilities of each category for each feature.",
        "The Decision List method (DLL) (Yarowsky, 1994) is equivalent to simple case statements in most programming languages.",
        "In a DLL classifier, a sequence of tests is applied to each feature vector.",
        "If a test succeeds, then the sense associated with that test is returned.",
        "If the test fails, then the next test in the sequence is applied.",
        "This continues until the end of the list, where a default test simply returns the majority sense.",
        "Learning a decision list classifier consists of generating and ordering individual tests based on the characteristics of the training data.",
        "Support vector machine (SVM) (Vapnik, 1998) is a supervised learning algorithm proposed by Vladimir Vapnik and his co-workers.",
        "For a binary classification task with classes {+1, –1}, given a training set with n class-labeled instances, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xi, yi), ..., (xn, yn), where xi is a feature vector for the ith instance and yi indicates the class, an SVM classifier learns a linear decision rule, which is represented using a hyperplane.",
        "The tag of an unlabelled instance x is determined by which side of the hyperplane x lies.",
        "The purpose of training the SVM is to find a hyperplane that has the maximum margin to separate the two classes.",
        "Using a list of keywords to retrieve relevant articles has been used frequently for NLP systems in the biological domain.",
        "For example, Iliopoulos et al.",
        "(2001) used keywords pertinent to a biological process or a single species to select a set of abstracts for their system.",
        "Supervised machine learning has been used by Donaldson et al.",
        "(2003) to recognize abstracts describing bio-molecular interactions.",
        "The training articles in their study were collected and judged by domain experts.",
        "In our study, we compared keywords retrieving with supervised machine learning algorithms.",
        "The category-labeled training documents used in our study were automatically obtained from model organism databases and MEDLINE."

        "We experimented the following feature representations: stemmed words from AbstractText, stemmed words from Title, Author, MeshHeading, and Journals.",
        "Since some of the MEDLINE fields may be empty (such as some citations do not contain abstracts), Table 2 also provides the number of non-applicable references each year for a given feature representation method.",
        "From Table 2, we found that every citation has a title.",
        "However, there are about 6.4% of citations (5,647 out of 88,281) that do not have abstracts.",
        "For each feature representation, we applied three supervised learning algorithms (i.e., Naïve Bayes learning, Decision List learning, Support Vector Machine).",
        "For each combination of machine learning algorithm and feature representation, we computed the performance using the F-measure, which is defined as 2*P*R/(P+R), where P is the precision (the number of citations predicted correctly to the total number of citations being predicted) and R is the recall (the number of citations predicted correctly to the total number of citations).",

        "Feature representation using Journals has the lowest F-measure (i.e., 62.1%).",

        "Note that the results for feature representation Authors were significantly worse for year 2002.",

        "The current format results in less ambiguity among authors.",
        "However, we could not use the author fields of citations from previous years to predicate the category of documents for year 2002.",
        "Also, since a lot of citations in years 2002 and 2003 are in-process citations (i.e., people are still working on indexing these citations using Mesh Headings), feature representation using Mesh Headings had worse performance in these two years comparing to other years.",
