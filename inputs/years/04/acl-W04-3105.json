        "Consider a bioscientist who is studying a particular disease.",
        "Assume that she is already well familiar with the pathophysiology and accepted therapeutic options for treating this condition and wishes to determine if there are other, yet unrecognized, substances that may have therapeutic potential.",
        "She begins by searching for documents on the disease mechanism(s) and related disorders.",
        "Very soon she finds herself immersed in a morass of pathways and possible directions that need to be further explored.",
        "It will come as no surprise if even our most determined user quickly becomes overwhelmed and discouraged.",
        "The challenge of searching for a novel therapeutic substance is at best like looking for the proverbial “needle in a haystack”.",
        "However, in reality the challenge is greater since there is no assurance that there indeed is a needle in the haystack.",
        "Consequently, the goal of text mining (also known as literature mining) systems and algorithms is to assist users find such needles, if these exist at all in the literature “haystacks” (Hearst 1999).",
        "In general, as shown in Figure 1, a user may start with any type of topic (A), be it a disease, a pharmacological substance, or a specific gene.",
        "As he navigates the literature and follows connections through appropriate intermediate topics (B1, B2 etc.",
        "), the user hopes to reach terminal topics (C1, C2 etc.)",
        "that are both relevant and novel, in the sense of shedding new information on topic (A).",
        "This text mining approach commonly referred to as ‘open’ discovery was pioneered by Swanson in the mid 80s.",
        "A classic example discovery is one where starting with Raynaud’s disease (A) Swanson identified fish oils (C) as a substance that may have therapeutic potential (Swanson, 1986).",
        "Intermediate connections (B) such as ‘blood viscosity’, ‘platelet aggregation’ were observed.",
        "Swanson also proposed a variation called ‘closed’ discovery wherein starting with a pair of topics (A and C) one explores possible connections (B links) between them that are not yet recognized.",
        "In collaboration with Smalheiser, Swanson used his open and closed discovery methods on MEDLINE and proposed a number of hypotheses (eg.",
        "Swanson, 1990; Smalheiser & Swan-son1996a; Smalheiser & Swanson1996b; Smalheiser & Swanson1998).",
        "The hypotheses they proposed were subsequently corroborated in clinical studies.",
        "The text mining framework established by Swanson and Smalheiser has attracted the attention of several researchers (Gordon and Lindsay, 1996; Lindsay and Gordon, 1999; Weeber et al., 2001) besides us (Srinivasan, 2004).",
        "A key goal in these follow-up efforts has been to reduce the amount of manual effort and intervention required during the discovery process.",
        "In previous work",
        "using algorithms for MEDLINE which we developed, we replicated the eight open and closed discoveries made by Swanson and Smalheiser.",
        "In comparison with other replication studies these algorithms were the most effective (Srinivasan, 2004).",
        "They also require the least amount of manual input and analyses.",
        "For example, in open discovery, our methods expect the user to specify only the type of B terms of interest.",
        "Following this our algorithm selects B terms automatically.",
        "In contrast the other methods rely more on user input for selecting B terms.",
        "Our current research demonstrates that our open discovery algorithm can be used to generate new hypotheses for disease treatment that could be tested.",
        "In particular, we apply our open discovery procedure to explore the therapeutic potential of curcumin/turmeric (Curcumin Longa) a dietary substance commonly used in Asia.",
        "We show that our automatic discovery algorithm identifies retinal diseases as the novel context for research on curcumin.",
        "We review genetic and biochemical evidence to indicate that curcumin may be beneficial for treating retinal diseases.",
        "We first describe our open discovery algorithm.",
        "Next we show its application with curcumin as the starting point (topic A).",
        "We then present an analysis of the curcumin - retinal diseases connection.",

        "A topic is any subject of interest such as treatment of hypertension or ATM gene.",
        "A profile is essentially a representation of a topic that is derived from the text collection being mined.",
        "For MEDLINE our topic profiles are vectors of weighted Medical Subject Headings (MeSH).",
        "These terms belong to a controlled vocabulary and are manually assigned to each MEDLINE document by trained indexers.",
        "Given a topic of interest, our algorithm first retrieves relevant MEDLINE documents.",

        "These weighted terms form the profile vector for the topic.",
        "We discuss the method for calculating weights shortly.",
        "We also exploit the fact that MeSH terms have been classified using 134 UMLS (Unified Medical Language System)1 semantic types as for example Cell Function, Sign or Symptom.",
        "Each MeSH term is assigned one or more semantic types.",
        "For example, interferon type II falls within both Immunologic Factor and Pharmaco-logic Substance semantic types.",
        "More generally, semantic types represent ‘categories’ that have been used to classify the MeSH metadata.",
        "Semantic types are useful because depending on the nature of the discovery goals we may adopt a particular view, i.e., we may restrict the discovery process to consider only MeSH terms that belong to certain semantic types.",
        "In these cases the topic profiles are restricted to MeSH terms belonging to semantic types specified by the view.",
        "We calculate term weights for the MeSH terms.",
        "Term weights are a slight modification of the commonly used TF*IDF scores.",
        "Since a MeSH term typically occurs once in a MEDLINE record, here TFi (term frequency) equals the number of documents in which the MeSH term ti occurs within the retrieved document set.",
        "IDFi (inverse document frequency) is log(N/TFi).",
        "N is the number of documents retrieved for the topic.",

        "Algorithm: Figure 2 outlines our open discovery algorithm which follows the framework shown in Figure 1.",
        "We begin by building the A topic profile restricted to ST-B semantic types.",
        "Note that all MEDLINE searches are conducted automatically via the PubMed interface 2.",
        "We then automatically select M MeSH terms for each ST-B semantic type from this A profile and call these the B terms.",
        "Next profiles are built for each of these B terms limited to another selected set of semantic types ST-C.",
        "These B profiles are analysed in combination to select an initial pool of candidate C terms.",
        "These candidate terms are then checked for novelty in the context of the starting A topic.",
        "When the algorithm terminates the user is provided a final list of ranked, novel C terms.",
        "The higher the rank the greater",
        "the estimated confidence in the potential connection with the A topic.",
        "At this point the rest of the process depends almost entirely on the user.",
        "(This is also the case in other implementations of the open discovery process (eg.",
        "Lindsay & Gordon 1999; Weeber et al., 2001)).",
        "It is up to the user to select A - C pairs of interest and explore the literature for supporting evidence.",
        "The role of ST-B and ST-C in the algorithm is to apply reasonable constraints to the problem and shape the path of the discovery process.",
        "Similarly, parameter M may be used to focus the discovery process.",
        "The higher this number the bigger the scope through which one looks for novel C topics.",
        "Obviously it takes experience to come up with reasonable values for these parameters.",
        "But we already see some patterns emerge in the MEDLINE mining literature.",
        "For example when looking for substances likely to influence a disease several researchers have used functional semantic types such as Cell Function and Molecular Dysfunction for selecting intermediate pathways (eg.",
        "Weeber et al., 2001).",
        "Experiments varying these semantic types have been described in our previous work (Srinivasan, 2004).",
        "Unique aspects of our algorithm in comparison to open discovery methods explored by others, include for example, the fact that our weighting scheme identifies interesting and relevant B terms at high ranks.",

        "Glaucoma is the second most common cause of blindness in the world (8695555) and is caused by mutations in a number of genes on chromosomes 1 and 10 as well as in other loci on chromosomes 2, 3, 8, and 7.",
        "While several diseases have one or a few genetic loci that control disease progression and familial transmission, it is often the case that a variety of genes may be involved in their pathophysiology.",

        "In diabetes and during inflammation, periods of hypoxia, i.e. low oxygen concentration, occur in various tissues and organs.",
        "At such times an early cellular response results in the elevated expression of interleukin-1beta (IL-1 beta) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) genes (11527948, 14507857, 11821258) which in turn stimulate new blood vessel growth leading to retinopathy (12821538, 12601017).",
        "Similarly, the expression of COX-2 was associated with the development of glaucoma (9441697).",
        "Treatment with COX-2 inhibitors suppressed blood-retinal barrier breakdown and had an an-tiangiogenic effect, i.e. they prevented the growth of new blood vessels and thus had a protective effect on the retina (12821538, 11980873).",
        "Another gene, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), was elevated during the early stages of diabetic retinopathy and inflammation (11821258, 12706995, 11161842).",
        "Anti-TNF-alpha treatment reduced leukocyte adhesion to blood vessels of the eye and vascular leakage (12714660) indicating a potential therapeutic effect for such a treatment to reduce ocular inflammation.",

        "There is also a link to TNF-alpha (discussed above) which was shown to activate phosphorylation of ERKs, p38, and JNK MAPK in human chondrocytes (12878172).",
        "IL-1beta activation, induced by the presence of retinal holes, a key feature of diabetic retinopathy, is also reported to result in the activation of a number of the MAPK genes ERK, JNK, and p38 (12824248).",
        "These conditions in turn exacerbate the disease process in that they result in proliferative and migratory cells accumulating in the wounded retina (12500176).",

        "Curcumin was able to suppress COX-2 in a dose-related manner (12844482) and neutralized the effect of IL-1 beta, possibly through its effect on p38 and COX-2 and JNK (12957788).",
        "Curcumin is also a known inhibitor of JNK (12957788,12854631,12582006, 12130649, 12105223, 9674701) and a suppresser of NF-kappaB activation (11753638, 11506818, 12878172, 12825130).",

        "Having shown that these genes, in particular, IL-1beta, COX-2, TNF-alpha, JNK, ERK, NF-kappaB, etc., are involved in retinopathy and in regulating cell proliferation and leukocyte attachment and the breakdown of the blood-retina barrier, and having established that curcumin is capable of inhibiting the activity of these genes we hypothesize that curcumin may have therapeutic value in preventing or ameliorating a number of retinal pathologies.",
        "Our approach has focused on specific genes, in particular to provide clues regarding the relevant biochemical pathways.",

        "Applying this to the domain of colorectal cancer, they are able to identify interesting hypotheses linking genes that were for example, in the same community but had no edge between them.",
        "Our research is based on the open discovery framework proposed by Swanson.",
        "As indicated before, Swanson and Smalheiser made several discoveries using their open and closed discovery methods (Swanson, 1986; Swanson, 1988; Swanson et al., 2001; Smalheiser & Swanson, 1996a; Smalheiser & Swanson, 1996b), that were later validated by bioscientists.",
        "These discoveries together offer a testbed of examples that are being used by other researchers to develop their own discovery algorithms (Gordon & Lindsay, 1996; Lindsay & Gordon, 1999; Srinivasan, 2004; Weeber et al., 2001).",
        "One characteristic that may be useful in distinguishing between text mining efforts is the extent to which they are problem or sub domain specific.",

        "These may be used for a variety of goals, as for example by geneticists involved in understanding the results of microarray experiments and by epidemiologists searching for links between viruses and specific populations.",
        "We believe that the next generation of text mining systems will be judged not only by their effectiveness but also by their flexibility in application."

        "One limitation of the discovery process concerns the evidence gathering phase when analyzing individual C terms.",
        "This process is manual and involves significant investment of time and intellect toward sifting through the literature and collecting evidence relevant to the hypothesized connections.",
