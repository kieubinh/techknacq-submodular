        "There is a great deal of interest in obtaining access to the vast stores of full-text literature held by the various publishers.",
        "The need to balance a reduction of the restrictions on access with the protection of the revenue streams of the publishers is critical.",
        "Without the publishers, the content would not be available and support for several scientific societies would also disappear.",
        "On the other hand, the value of the literature holdings, while it appears to be quite high, is not currently adequately exploited.",
        "Text mining and more effective information retrieval is necessary to take full advantage of the information captured by the millions of electronic journal articles currently available.",
        "The panel will discuss the issues involved in opening access to the literature holdings of the publishers to both academic and corporate entities; it will also initiate conversations on effective compromises.",
        "Sample Questions: 1.",
        "How does loosening access restrictions on the full-text content endanger the publishing revenue stream?",

        "Why aren't the abstracting services sufficient to take advantage of the content?",
