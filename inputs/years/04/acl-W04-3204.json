        "The results of recent WSD exercises, e.g. Senseval21 (Edmonds and Cotton, 2001) show clearly that WSD methods based on hand-tagged examples are the ones performing best.",
        "However, the main drawback for supervised WSD is the knowledge acquisition bottleneck: the systems need large amounts of costly hand-tagged data.",
        "The situation is more dramatic for lesser studied languages.",
        "In order to overcome this problem, different research lines have been explored: automatic acquisition of training examples (Mihalcea, 2002), bootstrapping techniques (Yarowsky, 1995), or active learning (Argamon-Engelson and Dagan, 1999).",
        "In this work, we have focused on the automatic acquisition of examples.",
        "When supervised systems have no specific training examples for a target word, they need to rely on publicly available all-words sense-tagged corpora like Semcor (Miller et al., 1993), which is tagged with WordNet word senses.",
        "The systems performing best in the English all-words task in Senseval-2 were basically supervised systems trained on Semcor.",
        "Unfortunately, for most of the words, this corpus only provides a handful of tagged examples.",
        "In fact, only a few systems could overcome the Most Frequent Sense (MFS) baseline, which would tag each word with the sense occurring most frequently in Semcor.",
        "In our approach, we will also rely on Semcor as the basic resource, both for training examples and as an indicator of the distribution of the senses of the target word.",
        "The goal of our experiment is to evaluate up to which point we can automatically acquire examples for word senses and train accurate supervised WSD systems on them.",
        "This is a very promising line of research, but one which remains relatively understudied (cf.",
        "Section 2).",
        "The method we applied is based on the monosemous relatives of the target words (Leacock et al., 1998), and we studied some parameters that affect the quality of the acquired corpus, such as the distribution of the number of training instances per each word sense (bias), and the type of features used for disambiguation (local vs. topical).",
        "Basically, we built three systems, one fully supervised (using examples from both Semcor and automatically acquired examples), one minimally supervised (using the distribution of senses in Semcor and automatically acquired examples) and another fully unsupervised (using an automatically acquired sense rank (McCarthy et al., 2004) and automatically acquired examples).",
        "This paper is structured as follows.",
        "First, Section 2 describes previous work on the field.",
        "Section 3 introduces the experimental setting for evaluating the acquired corpus.",
        "Section 4 is devoted to the process of building the corpus, which is evaluated in Section 5.",

        "Their experiment is evaluated on 3 words (a noun, a verb, and an adjective) with coarse sense-granularity and few senses.",
        "The results showed that the monosemous corpus provided precision comparable to hand-tagged data.",
        "In another related work, (Mihalcea, 2002) generated a sense tagged corpus (GenCor) by using a set of seeds consisting of sense-tagged examples from four sources: SemCor, WordNet, examples created using the method above, and hand-tagged examples from other sources (e.g., the Senseval-2 corpus).",
        "By means of an iterative process, the system obtained new seeds from the retrieved examples.",

        "We think that this research opens the opportunity for further improvements.",
        "We have to note that the MFS heuristic and the supervised systems based on the Senseval-2 training data are well ahead of our results, and our research aims at investigating ideas to close this gap.",
        "Some experiments on the line of adding automatically retrieved examples to available hand-tagged data (Semcor and Senseval2) have been explored.",
        "The preliminary results indicate that this process has to be performed carefully, taking into account the bias of the senses and applying a quality-check of the examples before they are included in the training data.",
        "For the future we also want to test the performance of more powerful Machine Learning methods, explore feature selection methods for each individual word, and more sophisticated ways to combine the examples from the web corpus with those of Semcor or Senseval.",
        "Now that the monosemous corpus is available for all nouns, we would also like to test the system on the all-words task.",
        "In addition, we will give preference to multiwords that contain the target word when choosing the relatives.",
        "Finally, more sophisticated methods to acquire examples are now available, like ExRetriever (Fernandez et al., 2004), and they could open the way to better examples and performance."
