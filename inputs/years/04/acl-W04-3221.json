        "In most recent research on concept acquisition from corpora (e.g., for lexicon construction), concepts are viewed as vectors of relations, or properties, extracted from syntactic structures (Grefenstette, 1993; Lin, 1998; Curran and Moens, 2002; Kilgarriff, 2003, and many others).",
        "These properties often specify values of attributes such as color, shape, or size: for example, the vector used by Lin (1998) for the concept dog includes the property (dog adj mod brown).",
        "(We will use the term values here to refer to any modifier.)",
        "To our knowledge, however, no attempt has been made by computational linguists to use the attributes themselves in such vectors: i.e., to learn that the description of the concept dog includes elements such as (dog color) or (dog size).",
        "This is surprising when considering that most models of concepts in the AI literature are based on such attributes (Brachman and Levesque, 1985).",
        "Two problems need to be addressed when trying to identify concept attributes.",
        "The first problem is that values are easier to extract.",
        "We found, however, that patterns like the X of the dog, already used in (Berland and Charniak, 1999; Poesio et al., 2002) to find part-of relations (using techniques derived from those used in (Hearst, 1998; Caraballo, 1999) to find hyponymy relations) are quite effective at finding attributes.",
        "A second problem might be that instances of such patterns are less frequent than those used to extract values, even in large corpora such as the British National Corpus (BNC).",
        "But this problem, as well, is less serious when using the Web as a corpus (Kilgarriff and Schuetze, 2003; Keller and Lapata, 2003; Markert et al., submitted).",
        "We report on two experiments whose goal was to test whether identifying attributes leads to better lexical descriptions of concepts.",
        "We do this by comparing the results obtained by using attributes or more general modifiers – that we will simply call values – as elements of concept vectors used to identify concept similarities via clustering.",
        "In Section 2, we discuss how Web data were used to build attribute and value based concept vectors, and our clustering and evaluation methods.",
        "In Section 3, we discuss a first experiment using the set of concepts used in (Lund and Burgess, 1996).",
        "In Section 4, we discuss a second experiment using 214 concepts from WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "In Section 5 we return to the notion of attribute."

        "Our techniques for extracting concept descriptions are simpler than those used in other work in at least two respects.",
        "First of all, we only extracted values expressed as nominal modifiers, ignoring properties expressed by verbal constructions in which the concept occurred as an argument (e.g., Lin’s (dog obj of have)).",
        "(We originally made this simplification to concentrate on the comparison between attributes and values (many verbal relations express more complex properties), but found that the resulting descriptions were still adequate for clustering.)",
        "Secondly, our data were not parsed or POS-tagged prior to extracting concept properties; our patterns are word-based.",
        "Full parsing is essential when complete descriptions are built (see below) and allows the specification of much more general patterns (e.g., matching descriptions modified in a variety of ways, see below), but is computationally much more expensive, particularly when Web data are used, as done here.",
        "We also found that when using the Web, simple text patterns not requiring parsing or POS tagging were sufficient to extract large numbers of instances of properties with a good degree of precision.",
        "Our methods for extracting 'values' are analogous to those used in the previous literature, apart from the two simplifications just mentioned: i.e., we just consider every nominal modifier as expressing a potential property.",
        "The pattern we use to extract values is as follows:",
        "• \"[a|an|the] * C [is|was]\"",
        "where C is a concept, and the wildcard (*) stands for an unspecified value.",
        "The restriction to instances containing is or was to ensure that the C actually stands for a concept (i.e., avoiding modifiers) proved adequate to ensure precision.",
        "An example of text matching this pattern is:",
        "• ... an inexpensive car is ...",
        "The pattern we use for extracting concept attributes is based on linguistic tests for attributes already discussed, e.g., in (Woods, 1975).",
        "According to Woods, A is an attribute of C if we can say [V is a/the A of C]: e.g., brown is a color of dogs.",
        "If no V can be found which is a value of A, then A can not be an attribute for the concept C. This test only selects attributes that have values, and is designed to exclude other functions defined over concepts, such as parts.",
        "But some of these functions can be (and have been) viewed as defining attributes of concepts as well; so for the moment we used more general patterns identifying all relational nouns taking a particular concept as arguments.",
        "(We return on the issue of the characterization of attributes below.)",
        "Our pattern for attributes is shown below:",
        "• \"the * of the C [is|was]\"",
        "where again C is a concept, but the wildcard denotes an unspecified attribute.",
        "Again, is/was is used to increase precision.",
        "An example of text matching this pattern is:",
        "• ... the price of the car was ...",
        "Both of the patterns we use satisfy Hearst's desiderata for good patterns (Hearst, 1998): they are (i) frequent, (ii) precise, and (iii) easy to recognize.",
        "Patterns similar to our attribute pattern were used by Berland and Charniak (1999) and Poesio et al. (2002) to find object parts only; after collecting their data, Berland and Charniak filtered out words ending with \"ness\", \"ing\", and \"ity\", because these express qualities of objects, and used a ranking method to rank the remaining words.",
        "(An accuracy of 55% for the top 50 proposed parts was reported.)",
        "We found that these patterns can be used to collect other sorts of 'attributes', as well."

        "The benefits from using the Web over even large corpora like the BNC for extracting semantic relations, particularly when using simple text patterns, were informally pointed out in (Poesio, 2003) and demonstrated more systematically by Markert et al. (submitted).",

        "This feature allows the user to fragment the search space into a number of periods, hence retrieving only pages that have been updated during a specified period.",
        "In the two experiments presented here, we aimed to collect up to 10,000 matches per search request using the daterage feature: we divided the search space into 100 days starting from January, 1990 until mid 2004.",
