        "In this work we are concerned with building statistical models for parse disambiguation – choosing a correct analysis out of the possible analyses for a sentence.",
        "Many machine learning algorithms for classification and ranking require data to be represented as real-valued vectors of fixed dimensionality.",
        "Natural language parse trees are not readily representable in this form, and the choice of representation is extremely important for the success of machine learning algorithms.",
        "For a large class of machine learning algorithms, such an explicit representation is not necessary, and it suffices to devise a kernel function which measures the similarity between inputs and .",
        "In addition to achieving efficient computation in high dimensional representation spaces, the use of kernels allows for an alternative view on the modelling problem as defining a similarity between inputs rather than a set of relevant features.",
        "In previous work on discriminative natural language parsing, one approach has been to define features centered around lexicalized local rules in the trees (Collins, 2000; Shen and Joshi, 2003), similar to the features of the best performing lexicalized generative parsing models (Charniak, 2000; Collins, 1997).",
        "Additionally non-local features have been defined measuring e.g. parallelism and complexity of phrases in discriminative log-linear parse ranking models (Riezler et al., 2000).",
        "Another approach has been to define tree kernels: for example, in (Collins and Duffy, 2001), the all-subtrees representation of parse trees (Bod, 1998) is effectively utilized by the application of a fast dynamic programming algorithm for computing the number of common subtrees of two trees.",
        "Another tree kernel, more broadly applicable to Hierarchical Directed Graphs, was proposed in (Suzuki et al., 2003).",
        "Many other interesting kernels have been devised for sequences and trees, with application to sequence classification and parsing.",
        "A good overview of kernels for structured data can be found in (Gaert-ner et al., 2002).",
        "Here we propose a new representation of parse trees which (i) allows the localization of broader useful context, (ii) paves the way for exploring kernels, and (iii) achieves superior disambiguation accuracy compared to models that use tree representations centered around context-free rules.",
        "Compared to the usual notion of discriminative models (placing classes on rich observed data) discriminative PCFG parsing with plain context free rule features may look naive, since most of the features (in a particular tree) make no reference to observed input at all.",
        "The standard way to address this problem is through lexicalization, which puts an element of the input on each tree node, so all features do refer to the input.",
        "This paper explores an alternative way of achieving this that gives a broader view of tree contexts, extends naturally to exploring kernels, and performs better.",
        "We represent parse trees as lists of paths (leafprojection paths) from words to the top level of the tree, which includes both the head-path (where the word is a syntactic head) and the non-head path.",
        "This allows us to capture for example cases of non-head dependencies which were also discussed by (Bod, 1998) and were used to motivate large subtree features, such as “more careful than his sister” where “careful” is analyzed as head of the adjective phrase, but “more” licenses the “than” comparative clause.",
        "This representation of trees as lists of projection",
        "paths (strings) allows us to explore string kernels on these paths and combine them into tree kernels.",
        "We apply these ideas in the context of parse disambiguation for sentence analyses produced by a Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG), the grammar formalism underlying the Redwoods corpus (Oepen et al., 2002).",
        "HPSG is a modern constraint-based lexicalist (or “unification”) grammar formalism.1 We build discriminative models using Support Vector Machines for ranking (Joachims, 1999).",
        "We compare our proposed representation to previous approaches and show that it leads to substantial improvements in accuracy."

        "Derivation trees record the combining rule schemas of the HPSG grammar which were used to license the sign by combining initial lexical types.",
        "The derivation tree is also the fundamental data stored in the Redwoods treebank, since the full sign can be reconstructed from it by reference to the grammar.",

        "In HPSG non-local dependencies are represented in the final semantic representation, but can not be obtained via syntactic head annotation.",

        "We proposed a new representation of parse trees that allows us to connect more tightly tree structures to the words of the sentence.",
        "Additionally this representation allows for the natural extension of string kernels to kernels on trees.",
        "The major source of accuracy improvement for our models was this representation, as even with bi-gram features, the performance was higher than previously achieved.",
        "We were able to improve on these results by using more sophisticated Subsequence kernels and by our Repetition kernel which captures some salient properties of word projection paths.",
        "In future work, we aim to explore the definition of new string kernels that are more suitable for this particular application and apply these ideas to Penn Treebank parse trees.",
