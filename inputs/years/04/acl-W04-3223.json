        "The maximum-entropy (ME) principle, which prescribes choosing the model that maximizes the entropy out of all models that satisfy given feature constraints, can be seen as a built-in regularization mechanism that avoids overfitting the training data.",
        "However, it is only a weak regularizer that cannot avoid overfitting in situations where the number of training examples is significantly smaller than the number of features.",
        "In such situations some features will occur zero times on the training set and receive negative infinity weights, causing the assignment of zero probabilities for inputs including those features.",
        "Similar assignment of (negative) infinity weights happens to features that are pseudo-minimal (or pseudo-maximal) on the training set (see Johnson et al.",
        "(1999)), that is, features whose value on correct parses always is less (or greater)",
        "than or equal to their value on all other parses.",
        "Also, if large features sets are generated automatically from conjunctions of simple feature tests, many features will be redundant.",
        "Besides overfitting, large feature sets also create the problem of increased time and space complexity.",
        "Common techniques to deal with these problems are regularization and feature selection.",
        "For ME models, the use of an E2 regularizer, corresponding to imposing a Gaussian prior on the parameter values, has been proposed by Johnson et al.",
        "(1999) and Chen and Rosenfeld (1999).",
        "Feature selection for ME models has commonly used simple frequency-based cut-off, or likelihood-based feature induction as introduced by Della Pietra et al.",
        "(1997).",
        "Whereas E2 regularization produces excellent generalization performance and effectively avoids numerical problems, parameter values almost never decrease to zero, leaving the problem of inefficient computation with the full feature set.",
        "In contrast, feature selection methods effectively decrease computational complexity by selecting a fraction of the feature set for computation; however, generalization performance suffers from the ad-hoc character of hard thresholds on feature counts or likelihood gains.",
        "Tibshirani (1996) proposed a technique based on E1 regularization that embeds feature selection into regularization such that both a precise assessment of the reliability of features and the decision about inclusion or deletion of features can be done in the same framework.",
        "Feature sparsity is produced by the polyhedral structure of the E1 norm which exhibits a gradient discontinuity at zero that tends to force a subset of parameter values to be exactly zero at the optimum.",
        "Since this discontinuity makes optimization a hard numerical problem, standard gradient-based techniques for estimation cannot be applied directly.",
        "Tibshirani (1996) presents a specialized optimization algorithm for E1 regularization for linear least-squares regression called the Lasso algorithm.",
        "Goodman (2003) and Kazama and Tsujii (2003) employ standard iterative scaling and conjugate gradient techniques, however, for regularization a simplified one-sided exponential prior is employed which is non-zero only for non-negative parameter values.",

        "Perkins et al.",
        "(2003) presented an approach that combines E1 based regularization with incremental feature selection.",
        "Their basic idea is to start with a model in which almost all weights are zero, and iteratively decide, by comparing regularized feature gradients, which weight should be adjusted away from zero in order to decrease the regularized objective function by the maximum amount.",
        "The E1 regularizer is thus used directly for incremental feature selection, which on the one hand makes feature selection fast, and on the other hand avoids numerical problems for zero-valued weights since only non-zero weights are included in the model.",
        "Besides the experimental evidence presented in these papers, recently a theoretical account on the superior sample complexity of E1 over E2 regularization has been presented by Ng (2004), showing logarithmic versus linear growth in the number of irrelevant features for E1 versus E2 regularized logistic regression.",
        "In this paper, we apply E1 regularization to log-linear models, and motivate our approach in terms of maximum entropy estimation subject to relaxed constraints.",
        "We apply the gradient-based feature selection technique of Perkins et al.",
        "(2003) to our framework, and improve its computational complexity by an n-best feature inclusion technique.",
        "This extension is tailored to linguistically motivated feature sets where the number of irrelevant features is moderate.",

        "In this approach, an approximate gain in likelihood for adding a feature to the model is used as feature selection criterion, and thresholds on this gain are used as stopping criterion.",
        "Maximization of approximate likelihood gains and gradient feature testing both are greedy approximations to the true gain in the objective function - grafting can be seen as applying one iteration of Newton’s method, where the weight of the newly added feature is initialized at 0, to calculate the approximate likelihood gain.",
        "Efficiency and accuracy of both approaches are comparable, however, the grafting framework provides a well-defined mathematical basis for feature selection and optimization by incorporating selection thresholds naturally as penalty factors of the regularizer.",
        "The idea of adding n-best features in each selection step also has been investigated earlier in the likelihood-based framework (see for example McCallum (2003)).",
        "However, the possible improvements in computational complexity and generalization performance due to n-best selection were not addressed explicitly.",
        "Further improvements of efficiency of grafting are possible by applying Zhou et al.’s (2003) technique of restricting feature selection in each step to the top-ranked features from previous stages.",
        "In sum, we presented an application of E1 regularization to likelihood maximization for log-linear models that has a simple interpretation as bounded constraint relaxation in terms of maximum entropy estimation.",
        "The presented n-best grafting method does not require specialized algorithms or simplifications of the prior, but allows for an efficient, mathematically well-defined combination of feature selection and regularization.",
        "In an experimental evaluation, we showed n-best grafting to outperform E0, 1-best E1, E2 regularization and standard incremental feature selection in terms of computational efficiency and generalization performance."
