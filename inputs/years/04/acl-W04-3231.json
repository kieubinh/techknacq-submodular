        "Morphological information, such as case, number and gender, plays an important role in parsing highly inflectional languages, such as German and Czech.",
        "It can help to resolve syntactic ambiguity in chunking and is particularly useful in dependency parsing of languages with free word-order, since it partly determines the argument structure of the sentence.",
        "More often than not, tagsets standardly used for part-of-speech (POS) tagging do not reflect fine-grained morphological distinctions within word classes, since the inclusion of morphological information in POS labels typically results in large tagsets.",
        "For example, for Czech a tagset containing more than a thousand tags was reported in (Haùicú and Hladka, 1997).",
        "This in turn raises the question as to which methods are suitable for automatic assignment of POS labels with tagsets of such size and the accompanying data sparseness problem.",
        "A stochastic approach that aims at reducing data-sparseness for large tagsets has been described in (Tufis, 2000).",
        "The approach is based on the idea of using a reduced tagset for an intermediate n-gram tagging step.",
        "It provides high accuracy for Romanian and Hungarian.",
        "However, as was shown in (Hinrichs and Trushkina, 2003), the approach has a rather low performance on German data due to the higher ambiguity rate of German (cf. statistics in Table 1).",
        "For Czech, a hybrid model with rule-based and statistical modules (Haùicú et al., 2001) has yielded excellent results.",
        "A similar hybrid tagging system was successfully designed for English (Tapanainen and Voutilainen, 1994).",
        "Given the previous success of hybrid models for other languages, the purpose of this paper is to apply such models for German, which, due to its high ambiguity rates, provides a particularly challenging case for the task at hand.",
        "2 Architecture of the model The model has a layered and sequential architecture consisting of morphological analysis, rule-based disambiguation and statistical tagging.",
        "The order of these modules reflects the relative strengths of the rule-based and statistical methods involved.",
        "The morphological analyzer provides all possible analyses for a given sequence of tokens.",
        "This highly ambiguous output is then fed to the rule-based module.",
        "Its task is to reduce the candidate analyses to be considered by the statistical module.",
        "If used cautiously, the rule-based method will rule out only those candidates for which it has sufficient evidence and will retain all those that are contextually plausible.",
        "The task of the statistical module is to disambiguate the remaining cases of ambiguity.",
        "Statistical disambiguation is made considerably easier by the rule-based pre-filtering module, since the remaining set of hypotheses is greatly reduced.",
        "This reduction in search space corresponds to a gain in precision compared to purely statistical disambiguation."

        "The input to the statistical model in the second experiment was prepared in the following way: all unambiguous analyses produced by the rule-based module are included in the input, except for the analyses of predicative adjectives (the morphological analyzer often mistakens them for adverbs), of imperative verbs (these are often erroneous analyses that are actually foreign material), and of proper nouns without morphology.",
        "In addition, all analyses that have unambiguous POS readings of article, attributive adjective, finite verb, demonstrative, relative or personal pronoun are included in the input for the statistical module, since these parts of speech in most cases are tagged correctly by the rule-based module and since resolution of remaining morphological ambiguity for them does not usually constitute a problem for the statistical module.",
