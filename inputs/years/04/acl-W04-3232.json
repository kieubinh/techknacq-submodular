        "Arabic is a heavily inflected language.",
        "Its grammatical system is traditionally described in terms of a root-and-pattern structure, with about 10,000 roots (Ali, 1988).",
        "Roots such as drs (c)-u.1) and ktb (YZ) are listed alphabetically in standard Arabic dictionaries like the Wehr-Cowan (Beesley, 1996).",
        "The root is the most basic verb form.",
        "Roots are categorized into: triliteral, quadriliteral, or rarely pentaliteral.",
        "Most words are derived from a finite set of roots formed by adding diacritics1 or affixes (prefixes, suffixes, and infixes) through an application of fixed patterns which are templates to help in deriving inflectional and derivational forms of a word.",
        "Theoretically, several hundreds of Arabic words can be derived from a single root.",
        "Traditional Arab grammarians describe Arabic morphology in terms of patterns associated with the basic root f3l (LW, “to do”)- where f, 3, and l are like wildcards in regular expressions: the letter f (L-i ,“pronounced fa”) represents the first consonant (sometimes called a radical), the letter 3 (t , “pronounced ain”) represents the second, and the letter l (J , “pronounced lam”) represents the third",
        "respectively.",
        "Adding affixes to the basic root f3l (J�9, “to do”) allows additional such patterns to be formed.",
        "For instance, adding the letter Alef (1) as a prefix to the basic root f3l (J�9, “to do”) we get the pattern Af3l (J�9�) which is used to form words such as: anhr ( �, “rivers”), arjl (J-J, “legs”), and asgf (����, “ceilings”).",
        "Some examples of the word patterns are Yf3l (J��,), Mf3Wl (�_�L), Af3Al (�u9�), MfA3l (Jc1-), etc.",
        "The following example shows how we can use patterns to form words.",
        "the verb yktb (L.��, , “he writes or he is writing”) is formed by mapping the consonants of the triliteral root ktb (Y mi J) to the pattern yf3l (J��,), where the letters f (L-i), 3 (t), and l (J) in the second, third, and fourth positions of the pattern respectively represent slots for a root consonant.",
        "Figure 1 depicts the process of matching the root ktb (Y mi ) to the pattern yf3l (J��,) to produce the verb yktb (L.��, , “he writes or he is writing”), then adding prefixes and/or suffixes to obtain a word.",
        "The Arabic number system has singular, dual, and plural.",
        "Plurals are traditionally distinguished into two categories: the regular (so-called sound) plurals, and the irregular (so-called broken) plurals.",
        "Sound Plurals are formed by appropriate suffixation (like English: hand 4 hands).",
        "The sound masculine plural is formed by adding the suffix oun (�is) in the nominative case and the suffix een (�,) in the accusative & genitive cases.",
        "The sound feminine plural is formed by attaching the suffix at (mil) to the singular.",
        "Irregular or broken plurals apply mostly to triliteral roots and are formed by altering the singular (as in English: tooth 4 teeth).",
        "Many nouns and adjectives have broken plurals (Haywood and Nahmad, 1976).",
        "In all cases, singulars are affected by applying a number of different patterns that alter long vowels (Alef (1), Waw (s), Yeh (4), and Alef-Magsura (a)), within or outside the framework of the consonants (Cowan, 1958).",
        "Table 1 gives some examples of BPs and their patterns.",

        "These are successful to varying degrees, but have a main practical drawback in the context of information retrieval: they assume that words are fully vowelised.",
        "Unfortunately, short vowels are usually not written in published Arabic text, with the exception of the religious texts (e.g., the Holy Quran), poetry, and books for school children (Abuleil and Evens, 1998)."

        "Given the characterisation of broken plurals one finds in standard Arabic grammars, the most obvious method for identifying a broken plural is to light stem it (strip off any prefixes and/or suffixes), then trying to match the obtained stem against BP patterns found in standard grammars.",
        "Since this method is widely used, we adopted it as a baseline.",
        "As a first step towards a simple BP matching algorithm, we developed a basic light stemmer for Arabic by modifying an existing root stemmer (Khoja and Garside, 1999).",
        "This basic light stemmer was incorporated in a simple BP identification module based on matching, using a list of 39 BP patterns found in grammar books such as Haywood and Nahmad (1976) and Cowan (1958).",
        "The simple BP matching algorithm takes in a word; light-stems it to produce morphological information such as stem, prefix and suffix; and returns TRUE if the stem matches one of the BP patterns in the list.",
        "The stem matches a BP pattern if and only if they have the same number of letters and the same letters in the same positions, excluding the consonants f (-i), 3 (t), and l (J) of the basic root f3l (JW, “to do”) found in the pattern.",
        "In information retrieval and statistical natural language processing, recall and precision are common measures used to gauge a system’s performance.",
        "Recall (R) is the fraction of target items that a system selected, while the precision (P) is the fraction of selected items that a system got right.",
        "A third measure known as F-measure (F)2 (combines R and P) is used in some situation where R is very high and P is very low (Manning and Schütze, 1999).",
        "We implemented R, P, and F to evaluate approaches we present in this paper.",
        "The simple BP matching algorithm was preliminarily evaluated on a subset of an Arabic corpus (referred to as A_Corpus1) obtained from Khoja (1999).",
        "It contains 7172 words whose BP instances were identified (this first set of BPs is referred below as data set1).",
        "The results showed that the simple BP matching approach has very high recall (99.71%), but low precision (13.73%).",
        "We also tested two slightly modified versions of the simple BP matching algorithm, exploiting information about affixes information and proper name detection, respectively.",
        "The first variant was based on the observation that only a limited set of prefixes and suffixes can be attached to a BP stem.",
        "In addition, some BP prefixes and suffixes cannot both be concatenated to a BP stem at the same time.",
        "These observations led to a first variant of the simple matching algorithm incorporating two post-processing strategies for refining the decisions made by the simple BP matching algorithm.",
        "The first refining strategy checks if the produced prefix or suffix is in the list of BP prefixes or suffixes; if it isn’t, the stem will be classified as ‘Not Broken Plural (NBP)’.",
        "The second refining strategy checks if the prefix is a definite article (e.g., al (JI, “the”), wal (JI9 , “and the”), bal (J� , “with the”), etc.)",
