        "To a large extent, knowledge-poor methods suffice to yield good recognition performance.",
        "In particular, supervised learning can be used to produce a system with performance at or near the state of the art (Bikel et al., 1997).",
        "In the supervised learning framework, a corpus of (typically) a few hundred documents is annotated by hand to identify the entities of interest.",
        "Features of local context are then used to train a system to distinguish instances from non-instances in novel texts.",
        "Such features may include literal word tests, patterns of orthography, parts of speech, semantic categories, or membership in special-purpose gazetteers.",

        "Here, we investigate a different approach.",
        "Using a distributional clustering technique called co-clustering, we produce clusters which, intuitively, should be useful for NER.",
        "Table 1 shows example terms from several sample clusters induced using a collection of documents from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ).",
        "Several papers have shown that distributional clustering yields categories that have high agreement with part of speech (Sch¨utze, 1995; Clark, 2000).",
        "As the table illustrates, these clusters also tend to have a useful semantic dimension.",
        "Clustering on the WSJ portion of the North American News corpus yields two clusters that clearly correspond to personal names, one for first names and one for last names.",
        "As an experiment, we scanned the MUC6 NER data set for token sequences consisting of zero or more members of the first name cluster (or an initial followed by a period), followed by one or more members of the last name cluster.",
        "This simple procedure identified 64% of personal names with 77% precision.",
        "In this paper, we attempt to improve on this result by converting the clusters into features to be exploited by a general-purpose machine learning algorithm for information extraction.",
        "In Section 2, we provide a brief description of Boosted Wrapper Induction (BWI), a pattern learner that has yielded promising results on semi-structured information extraction problems (Freitag and Kushmerick, 2000).",

        "Strong corroboration for the approach advocated in this paper is provided by Miller, et al. (2004), in which cluster-based features are combined with a sequential maximum entropy model proposed in Collins (2002) to advance the state of the art.",
        "In addition, using active learning, the authors are able to reduce human labeling effort by an order of magnitude.",
        "Miller, et al., use a proprietary data set for training and testing, so it is difficult to make a close comparison of outcomes.",
        "At roughly comparable training set sizes, they appear to achieve a score of about 0.89 (F1) with a “conventional” HMM, versus 0.93 using the discriminative learner trained with cluster features (compared with 0.86 reached by BWI).",
        "Both the HMM and Collins model are constrained to account for an entire sentence in tagging it, making determinations for all fields simultaneously, in contrast to the individual, local boundary detections made by BWI.",
        "This characteristic probably accounts for the accuracy advantage they appear to enjoy.",
        "An interesting distinguishing feature of Miller, et al., is their use of hierarchical clustering.",
        "While much is made of the ability of their approach to accomodate different levels of granularity automatically, no evidence is provided that the hierarchy provides real benefit.",
        "At the same time, our work shows that significant gains can be realized with a single, sufficiently granular partition of terms.",
        "It is known, moreover, that greedy agglomerative clustering leads to partitions that are suboptimal in terms of a mutual information objective function (see, for example, Brown, et al. (1992)).",
        "Ultimately, it is left to future research to determine how sensitive, if at all, the NER gains are to the details of the clustering."

        "There are several ways in which this work might be extended and improved, both in its particular form and in general: BWI models initial and terminal boundaries, but ignores characteristics of the extracted phrase other than its length.",

        "While global statistical approaches, such as se",
        "quential averaged perceptrons or CRFs (Mc-Callum and Li, 2003), appear better suited to the NER problem than local symbolic learners, the two approaches search different hypothesis spaces.",
        "Based on the surmise that, by combining them, we can realize improvements over either in isolation, we are exploring mechanisms for integration.",
        "The distributional clusters we find are independent of the problem to which we want to apply them and may sometimes be inappropriate or have the wrong granularity.",
        "We are exploring ways to produce groupings that are sensitive to the task at hand.",
        "Our results clearly establish that an unsupervised distributional analysis of a text corpus can produce features that lead to enhanced precision and, especially, recall in information extraction.",
        "We have successfully used these features in lieu of domain-specific, labor-intensive resources, such as syntactic analysis and special-purpose gazetteers.",
        "Distributional analysis, combined with light supervision, is an effective, stable alternative to bootstrapping methods."
