        "Chinese part-of-speech (POS) tagging assigns one POS tag to each word in a Chinese sentence.",
        "However, since words are not demarcated in a Chinese sentence, Chinese POS tagging requires word segmentation as a prerequisite.",
        "We could perform Chinese POS tagging strictly after word segmentation (one-at-a-time approach), or perform both word segmentation and POS tagging in a combined, single step simultaneously (all-at-once approach).",
        "Also, we could choose to assign POS tags on a word-by-word basis, making use of word features in the surrounding context (word-based), or on a character-by-character basis with character features (character-based).",
        "This paper presents an in-depth study on such issues of processing architecture and feature representation for Chinese POS tagging, within a maximum entropy framework.",
        "We found that while the all-at-once, character-based approach is the best, the one-at-a-time, character-based approach is a worthwhile compromise, performing only slightly worse in terms of accuracy, but taking shorter time to train and run.",
        "As part of our investigation, we also built a state-of-the-art Chinese word segmenter, which outperforms the best SIGHAN 2003 word segmenters in the closed track on 3 out of 4 test corpora."

        "As such, we need to perform word segmentation before we can proceed with other tasks such as part-of-speech (POS) tagging and parsing, since one POS tag is assigned to each Chinese word (i.e., all characters in a Chinese word have the same POS tag), and the leaves of a parse tree for a Chinese sentence are words.",
        "To build a Chinese POS tagger, the following questions naturally arise:",
        "(1) Should we perform Chinese POS tagging strictly after word segmentation in two separate phases (one-at-a-time approach), or perform both word segmentation and POS tagging in a combined, single step simultaneously (all-at-once approach)?",
        "(2) Should we assign POS tags on a word-byword basis (like in English), making use of word features in the surrounding context (word-based), or on a character-by-character basis with character features (character-based)?",

        "Much previous research on Chinese language processing focused on word segmentation (Sproat et al., 1996; Teahan et al., 2000; Sproat and Emerson, 2003).",
        "Relatively less work has been done on Chinese POS tagging.",
        "Kwong and Tsou (2003) discussed the implications of POS ambiguity in Chinese and the possible approaches to tackle this problem when tagging a corpus for NLP tasks.",
        "Zhou and Su (2003) investigated an approach to build a Chinese analyzer that integrated word segmentation, POS tagging and parsing, based on a hidden Markov model.",
        "Jing et al.",
        "(2003) focused on Chinese named entity recognition, considering issues like character-based versus word-based approaches.",
        "To our knowledge, our work is the first to systematically investigate issues of processing architecture and feature representation for Chinese POS tagging.",
        "Our maximum entropy word segmenter is similar to that of (Xue and Shen, 2003), but the additional features we used and the post-processing step gave improved word segmentation accuracy.",
        "The research most similar to ours is (Luo, 2003).",
        "Luo presented a maximum entropy character-based parser, which as a consequence of parsing also performed word segmentation and POS tagging.",
        "The all-at-once, character-based approach reported in this paper is essentially the approach proposed by Luo.",
        "While our investigation reveals that such an approach gives good accuracy, our findings however indicate that a one-at-a-time, character-based approach to POS tagging gave quite comparable accuracy, with the benefit of incurring much reduced computational cost."

        "Language differences between English and Chinese have made direct porting of an English POS tagging method to Chinese ineffective.",

        "Using a character-based approach for Chinese POS tagging is more effective than a word-based approach.",
