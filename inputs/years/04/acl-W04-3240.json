        "In this paper we discuss using machine learning methods to classify email according to the intent of the sender.",
        "In particular, we classify emails according to an ontology of verbs (e.g., propose, commit, deliver) and nouns (e.g., information, meeting, task), which jointly describe the “email speech act” intended by the email sender.",
        "A method for accurate classification of email into such categories would have many potential benefits.",
        "For instance, it could be used to help an email user track the status of ongoing joint activities.",
        "Delegation and coordination of joint tasks is a time-consuming and error-prone activity, and the cost of errors is high: it is not uncommon that commitments are forgotten, deadlines are missed, and opportunities are wasted because of a failure to properly track, delegate, and prioritize subtasks.",

        "Our research builds on earlier work defining il-locutionary points of speech acts (Searle, 1975), and relating such speech acts to email and work-flow tracking (Winograd, 1987, Flores & Ludlow, 1980, Weigant et al., 2003).",
        "Winograd suggested that research explicating the speech-act based “language-action perspective” on human communication could be used to build more useful tools for coordinating joint activities.",
        "The Coordinator (Winograd, 1987) was one such system, in which users augmented email messages with additional annotations indicating intent.",
        "While such systems have been useful in limited contexts, they have also been criticized as cumbersome: by forcing users to conform to a particular formal system, they constrain communication and make it less natural (Schoop, 2001); in short, users often prefer unstructured email interactions (Camino et al.",
        "1998).",

        "A limitation of their approach is that these hand-coded linguistic “clues” are language-specific (and in fact limited to Japanese text.)",
        "Prior research on machine learning for text classification has primarily considered classification of documents by topic (Lewis, 1992; Yang, 1999), but also has addressed sentiment detection (Pang et al., 2002; Weibe et al., 2001) and authorship attribution (e.g., Argamon et al., 2003).",

        "However, to our knowledge, none of these systems has investigated learning methods for assigning email speech acts.",

        "Our ontology of nouns and verbs covering some of the possible speech acts associated with emails is summarized in Figure 2.",
        "We assume that a single email message may contain multiple acts, and that each act is described by a verb-noun pair drawn from this ontology (e.g., \"deliver data\").",
        "The underlined nodes in the figure indicate the nouns and verbs for which we have trained classifiers (as discussed in subsequent sections).",
        "To define the noun and verb ontology of Figure 2, we first examined email from several corpora (including our own inboxes) to find regularities, and then performed a more detailed analysis of one corpus.",
        "The ontology was further refined in the process of labeling the corpora described below.",
        "In refining this ontology, we adopted several principles.",
        "First, we believe that it is more important for the ontology to reflect observed linguistic behavior than to reflect any abstract view of the space of possible speech acts.",
        "As a consequence, the taxonomy of verbs contains concepts that are atomic linguistically, but combine several illocu-tionary points.",
        "(For example, the linguistic unit \"let's do lunch\" is both directive, as it requests the receiver, and commissive, as it implicitly commits the sender.",
        "In our taxonomy this is a single 'propose' act.)",
        "Also, acts which are abstractly possible but not observed in our data are not represented (for instance, declarations).",
        "Second, we believe that the taxonomy must reflect common non-linguistic uses of email, such as the use of email as a mechanism to deliver files.",
        "We have grouped this with the linguistically similar speech act of delivering information.",
        "The verbs in Figure 1 are defined as follows.",
        "A request asks (or orders) the recipient to perform some activity.",
        "A question is also considered a request (for delivery of information).",
        "A propose message proposes a joint activity, i.e., asks the recipient to perform some activity and commits the sender as well, provided the recipient agrees to the request.",
        "A typical example is an email suggesting a joint meeting.",
        "An amend message amends an earlier proposal.",
        "Like a proposal, the message involves both a commitment and a request.",
        "However, while a proposal is associated with a new task, an amendment is a suggested modification of an already-proposed task.",
        "A commit message commits the sender to some future course of action, or confirms the senders' intent to comply with some previously described course of action.",
        "A deliver message delivers something, e.g., some information, a PowerPoint presentation, the URL of a website, the answer to a question, a message sent \"FYI”, or an opinion.",
        "The refuse, greet, and remind verbs occurred very infrequently in our data, and hence we did not attempt to learn classifiers for them (in this initial study).",
        "The primary reason for restricting ourselves in this way was our expectation that human annotators would be slower and less reliable if given a more complex taxonomy.",
        "The nouns in Figure 2 constitute possible objects for the email speech act verbs.",
        "The nouns fall into two broad categories.",
        "Information nouns are associated with email speech acts described by the verbs Deliver, Remind and Amend, in which the email explicitly contains information.",
        "We also associate information nouns with the verb Request, where the email contains instead a description of the needed information (e.g., \"Please send your birthdate.\"",
        "versus \"My birthdate is ...\".",
        "The request act is actually for a 'deliver information' activity).",
        "Information includes data believed to be fact as well as opinions, and also attached data files.",
        "Activity nouns are generally associated with email speech acts described by the verbs Propose, Request, Commit, and Refuse.",
        "Activities include meetings, as well as longer term activities such as committee memberships.",
        "Notice every email speech act is itself an activity.",
        "The <verb><noun> node in Figure 1 indicates that any email speech act can also serve as the noun associated with some other email speech act.",
        "For example, just as (deliver information) is a legitimate speech act, so is (commit (deliver information)).",
        "Automatically constructing such nested speech acts is an interesting and difficult topic; however, in the current paper we consider only the problem of determining top-level the verb for such compositional speech acts.",
        "For instance, for a message containing a (commit (deliver information)) our goal would be to automatically detect the commit verb but not the inner (deliver information) compound noun."
