        "Since it was first introduced to the NLP community by Dunning (1993), the G2 log-likelihood-ratio statistic1 has been widely used in statistical NLP as a measure of strength of association, particularly lexical associations.",
        "Nevertheless, its use remains controversial on the grounds that it may be unreliable when applied to rare events.",
        "For instance Pedersen, et al.",
        "(1996) present data showing that significance values for rare bigrams estimated with G2 can differ substantially from the true values as computed by Fisher’s exact test.",
        "Although Dunning argues that G2 is superior to the chi-square statistic2 X2 for dealing with rare events, Agresti (1990, p. 246) cites studies showing “X2 is valid with smaller sample sizes and more sparse tables than G2,” and either X2 or G2 can be unreliable when expected frequencies of less than 5 are involved, depending on circumstances.",
        "The problem of rare events invariably arises whenever we deal with individual words because of the Zipfian phenomenon that, typically, no matter how large a corpus one has, most of the distinct words in it will occur only a small number of times.",
        "For example, in 500,000 English sentences sampled from the Canadian Hansards data supplied for the bilingual word alignment workshop held at HLT-NAACL 2003 (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003), there are 52,921 distinct word types, of which 60.5% oc",
        "cur five or fewer times, and 32.8% occur only once.",
        "The G2 statistic has been most often used in NLP as a measure of the strength of association between words, but when we consider pairs of words, the sparse data problem becomes even worse.",
        "If we look at the 500,000 French sentences corresponding to the English sentences described above, we find 19,460,068 English-French word pairs that occur in aligned sentences more often than would be expected by chance, given their monolingual frequencies.",
        "Of these, 87.9% occur together five or fewer times, and 62.4% occur together only once.",
        "Moreover, if we look at the expected number of occurrences of these word pairs (which is the criteria used for determining the applicability of the X2 or G2 significance tests), we find that 93.2% would be expected by chance to have fewer than five occurrences.",
        "Pedersen et al.",
        "(1996) report similar proportions for monolingual bigrams in the ACL/DCI Wall Street Journal corpus.",
        "Any statistical measure that is unreliable for expected frequencies of less than 5 would be totally unusable with such data."

        "Despite the fact that many of these statistics arise from significance testing, the usual practice in applying them in NLP is to choose a threshold heuristically for the value of the statistic being used and discard all the pairs below the threshold.",
        "Indeed, Inkpen and Hirst say (p. 70) “there is no principled way of choosing these thresholds.” This may seem an odd statement about the measures that arise directly from significance testing, but it is clear that if standard statistical tests are used naively, the results make no sense in these applications.",

        "The question that significance tests for association, such as X2, G2, and Fisher’s exact test, are designed to answer is, given the sample size and the marginal frequencies of the two items in question, what is the probability (or p-value) of seeing by chance as many or more joint occurrences as were observed?",
        "In the case of a joint occurrence of two words that each occur only once, this is trivial to calculate.",
        "For instance, suppose an English word and a French word each occur only once in our corpus of 500,000 aligned sentence pairs of Hansard data, but they happen to occur together.",
        "What is the probability that this joint occurrence happened by chance alone?",
        "We can suppose that the English word occurs in an arbitrary sentence pair.",
        "The probability that the French word, purely by chance, would occur in the same sentence pair is clearly 1 in 500,000 or 0.000002.",
        "Since it is impossible to have more than one joint occurrence of two words that each have only a single occurrence, 0.000002 is the exact p-value for the question we have asked.",
        "Clearly, however, one cannot assume that the association of these two words is 0.999998 certain on this basis alone.",
        "The problem is that there are so many possible singleton-singleton pairs, it is very likely that some of them will occur jointly, purely by chance.",
        "This, too, is easy to calculate.",
        "In our 500,000 sentence pairs there are 17,379 English singletons and 22,512 French singletons; so there are 391,236,048 possible singleton-singleton pairs.",
        "For each pair, the probability of having a joint occurrence by chance is 0.000002, so the expected number of chance joint occurrences of singleton-singleton pairs is 391, 236, 048 x 0.000002, or approximately 782.5.",
        "The question of whether a singleton-singleton pair is signficant or not then turns on how many singleton-singleton pairs we observe.",
        "If we see only about 800, then they are not signficant, because that is just about the number we would expect to see by chance.",
        "In our corpus, however, we see far more than that: 19,312.",
        "Thus our best estimate of the proportion of the singleton-singleton pairs that are due to chance is 782.5/19312 = 0.0405, which we can think of as the “expected noise” in the singleton-singleton pairs.",
        "Looked at another way, we can estimate that at least 95.9% of the observed singleton-singleton pairs are not due to chance, which we can think of as “expected precision”.3 So, we conclude that, for this data, seeing two singletons together is significant at the 0.05 level, but this is more than five orders of magnitude less significant than naive use of standard p-values would suggest."

        "For example, for a joint occurrence of two singletons in 500,000 samples, G2 is approximately 28.24.",
        "Therefore, if we wanted to use G2 as our measure of association, we could compare the number of word pairs expected by chance to have a G2 score greater than or equal to 28.24 with the number of word pairs observed to have a G2 score greater than or equal to 28.24, and compute expected noise and precision just as we did with p-values.",
        "In principle, we can do the same for any measure of association.",
        "The worst that can happen is that if the measure of association is not a good one (i.e., if it assigns values randomly), the expected precision will not be very good no matter how high we set the threshold.",

        "Finally, until we have computed all the expected frequencies and observed frequencies of interest, we don’t know which association score is going to correspond to a desired level of expected precision.",

        "Whenever the first association score greater than or equal to one of the thresholds is encountered, compute the associated p-value, multiply it by the number of possible word pairs corresponding to the combination of marginals (to obtain the expected number of word pairs with the given marginals having that association score or higher), and add the result to the accumluators for all the thresholds that have just been passed.",

        "Next we compute the number of word pairs observed to have an association score equal to or greater than each of the thresholds.",
        "The expected noise for each threshold is just the ratio of the expected number of word pairs for the threshold to the observed number of word pairs for the threshold, and the expected precision is 1 minus the expected noise.",
        "What hidden assumptions have we made that could call these estimates into question?",
        "First, there might not be enough data for the estimates of expected and observed frequencies to be reliable.",

        "A more subtle issue is that our method may overestimate the expected pair counts, resulting in excessively conservative estimates of precision.",
        "Our estimate of the number of pairs seen by chance for a particular value of the association measure is based on considering all possible pairs as nonassociated, which is a valid approximation only if the number",

        "For the corpus used in this paper, this seems unlikely to be a problem.",

        "Since most word pairs have no joint occurrences and far less than 1 expected occurrence, it is difficult to get a handle on how many of these unseen pairs might be negatively associated.",
        "Since we are measuring association on the sentence level, however, it seems reasonable to expect fewer word pairs to have a significant negative association than a positive association, so 40,000,000 seems likely to be a upper bound on how many word pairs are significantly nonindependent.",
        "This, however, is only about 1% of the total number of possible word pairs, so adjusting for the pairs that might be significantly related would not make an appreciable difference in our estimates of expected noise.",

        "When we use Fisher’s exact test to estimate p-values, our new method for estimating noise for collections of rare events seems to give results that are quite consistent with our previous annecdotal experience in using LLR scores as a measure of word association.",
        "Using likelihood ratios to estimate p-values introduces a substantial amount of error, but not the orders-of-magnitude error that Dunning (1993) demonstrated for estimates that rely on the assumption of a normal distribution.",
        "However, since we have also shown that Fisher’s exact test can be applied to this type of problem without a major computational penalty, there seems to be no reason to compromise in this regard."
