        "This paper addresses the Named Entity (NE) alignment of a bilingual corpus, which means building an alignment between each source NE and its translation NE in the target language.",
        "Research has shown that Named Entities (NE) carry essential information in human language (Hobbs et al., 1996).",
        "Aligning bilingual Named Entities is an effective way to extract an NE translation list and translation templates.",
        "For example, in the following sentence pair, aligning the NEs, [Zhi Chun road] and [04�] can produce a translation template correctly.",
        "• Can I get to [LN Zhi Chun road] by eight o’clock?",
        "• A �e\"I� [LN 04�]Vi?",
        "In addition, NE alignment can be very useful for Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) and Cross-Language Information Retrieval (CLIR).",
        "A Named Entity alignment, however, is not easy to obtain.",
        "It requires both Named Entity Recognition (NER) and alignment be handled correctly.",
        "NEs may not be well recognized, or only ∗ The work was done while the first author was visiting Microsoft Research Asia.",
        "parts of them may be recognized during NER.",
        "When aligning bilingual NEs in different languages, we need to handle many-to-many alignments.",
        "And the inconsistency of NE translation and NER in different languages is also a big problem.",
        "Specifically, in Chinese NE processing, since Chinese is not a tokenized language, previous work (Huang et al., 2003) normally conducts word segmentation and identifies Named Entities in turn.",
        "This involves several problems for Chinese NEs, such as word segmentation error, the identification of Chinese NE boundaries, and the mis-tagging of Chinese NEs.",
        "For example, “Q I P3ik” in Chinese is really one unit and should not be segmented as [ON QI P3 ]/ ik .",
        "The errors from word segmentation and NER will propagate into NE alignment.",
        "In this paper, we propose a novel approach using a maximum entropy model to carry out English-Chinese Named Entity1 alignment.",
        "NEs in English are first recognized by NER tools.",
        "We then investigate NE translation features to identify NEs in Chinese and determine the most probable alignment.",
        "To ease the training of the maximum entropy model, bootstrapping is used to help supervised learning.",
        "On the other hand, to avoid error propagations from word segmentation and NER, we directly extract Chinese NEs and make the alignment from plain text without word segmentation.",
        "It is unlike previous work reported in the literature.",
        "Although this makes the task more difficult, it greatly reduces the chance of errors introduced by previous steps and therefore produces much better performance on our task.",
        "To justify our approach, we adopt traditional alignment approaches, in particular IBM Model 4 (Brown et al., 1993) and HMM (Vogel et al., 1996), to carry out NE alignment as our baseline systems.",
        "Experimental results show that in this task our approach outperforms IBM Model 4 and HMM significantly.",
        "Furthermore, the performance",
        "without word segmentation is much better than that with word segmentation.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we discuss related work on NE alignment.",
        "Section 3 gives the overall framework of NE alignment with our maximum entropy model.",
        "Feature functions and bootstrapping procedures are also explained in this section.",
        "We show experimental results and compare them with baseline systems in Section 4.",

        "Translation knowledge can be acquired via word and phrase alignment.",
        "So far a lot of research has been conducted in the field of machine translation and knowledge acquisition, including both statistical approaches (Cherry and Lin, 2003; Probst and Brown, 2002; Wang et al., 2002; Och and Ney, 2000; Melamed, 2000; Vogel et al., 1996) and symbolic approaches (Huang and Choi, 2000; Ker and Chang, 1997).",
        "However, these approaches do not work well on the task of NE alignment.",
        "Traditional approaches following IBM Models (Brown et al., 1993) are not able to produce satisfactory results due to their inherent inability to handle many-to-many alignments.",
        "They only carry out the alignment between words and do not consider the case of complex phrases like some multi-word NEs.",
        "On the other hand, IBM Models allow at most one word in the source language to correspond to a word in the target language (Koehn et al., 2003; Marcu, 2001).",
        "Therefore they can not handle many-to-many word alignments within NEs well.",
        "Another well-known word alignment approach, HMM (Vogel et al., 1996), makes the alignment probabilities depend on the alignment position of the previous word.",
        "It does not explicitly consider many-to-many alignment either.",
        "Huang et al.",
        "(2003) proposed to extract Named Entity translingual equivalences based on the minimization of a linearly combined multi-feature cost.",
        "But they require Named Entity Recognition on both the source side and the target side.",
        "Moore’s (2003) approach is based on a sequence of cost models.",
        "However, this approach greatly relies on linguistic information, such as a string repeated on both sides, and clues from capital letters that are not suitable for language pairs not belonging to the same family.",
        "Also, there are already complete lexical compounds identified on the target side, which represent a big part of the final results.",
        "During the alignment, Moore does not hypothesize that translations of phrases would require splitting predetermined lexical compounds on the target set.",
        "These methods are not suitable for our task, since we only have NEs identified on the source side, and there is no extra knowledge from the target side.",
        "Considering the inherent characteristics of NE translation, we can find several features that can help NE alignment; therefore, we use a maximum entropy model to integrate these features and carry out NE alignment."

        "Without relying on syntactic knowledge from either the English side or the Chinese side, we find there are several valuable features that can be used for Named Entity alignment.",
        "Considering the advantages of the maximum entropy model (Berger et al., 1996) to integrate different kinds of features, we use this framework to handle our problem.",
        "Suppose the source English NE nee, nee = {e1,e2 ... en}, consists of n English words and the candidate Chinese NE ne,, ne, = {,1,,2 ... ,m}, is composed of m Chinese characters.",
        "Suppose also that we have M feature functions hm (ne,, nee), m =1,..., M. For each feature function, we have a model parameter λm , m =1,..., M. The alignment probability can be defined as follows (Och and Ney, 2002):",
        "hm(ne,,nee The decision rule to choose the most probable alignedtarget NE ofthe English NE is (Ochan d Ney, 2002): (3.1) In ourapproach, considering the characteristics ofNE translation, we adopt4 features: translation score, transliterationscore, the source NE and target NE’s co-occurrence score, an d distortion score for distinguishing identical NEs in the same sentence.",
        "Next, we discuss these four features in detail.",
        "It is importantto considerthe translation probabilitybetweenwords in EnglishNE an d characters in Chinese NE.",
        "When processing",
        "Chinese sentence without segmentation, word here refers to single Chinese character.",
        "The translation score here is used to represent how close an NE pair is based on translation probabilities.",
        "Supposing the source English NE nee consists of n English words, nee = {e1, e2...en } and the candidate Chinese NE nec is composed of m Chinese characters, nec = {c1, c2...cm } , we can get the translation score of these two bilingual NEs based on the translation probability between ei and cj:",
        "Given a parallel corpus aligned at the sentence level, we can achieve the translation probability between each English word and each Chinese character p(cj |ei ) via word alignments with IBM Model 1 (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "Without word segmentation, we have to calculate every possible candidate to determine the most probable alignment, which will make the search space very large.",
        "Therefore, we conduct pruning upon the whole search space.",
        "If there is a score jump between two adjacent characters, the candidate will be discarded.",

        "Although in theory, translation scores can build up relations within correct NE alignments, in practice this is not always the case, due to the characteristics of the corpus.",
        "This is more obvious when we have sparse data.",
        "For example, most of the person names in Named Entities are sparsely distributed in the corpus and not repeated regularly.",
        "Besides that, some English NEs are translated via transliteration (Lee and Chang, 2003; Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002; Knight and Graehl, 1997) instead of semantic translation.",
        "Therefore, it is fairly important to make transliteration models.",
        "Given an English Named Entity e, e = {e1, e2 ...en }, the procedure of transliterating e into a Chinese Named Entity c, c = {c 1, c2 ... cm } , can be described with Formula (3.4) (For simplicity of denotation, we here use e and c to represent English NE and Chinese NE instead of nee and nec ).",

        "Since there are more than 6k common-used Chinese characters, we need a very large training corpus to build the mapping directly between English words and Chinese characters.",
        "We adopt a romanization system, Chinese PinYin, to ease the transformation.",
        "Each Chinese character corresponds to a Chinese PinYin string.",
        "And the probability from a Chinese character to PinYin string is P(r |c) ≈1 , except for polyphonous characters.",
        "Thus we have:",
        "Our problem is: Given both English NE and candidate Chinese NEs, finding the most probable alignment, instead of finding the most probable Chinese translation of the English NE.",
        "Therefore unlike previous work (Lee and Chang, 2003; Huang et al., 2003) in English-Chinese transliteration models, we transform each candidate Chinese NE to Chinese PinYin strings and directly train a PinYin-based language model with a separate English-Chinese name list consisting of 1258 name pairs to decode the most probable PinYin string from English NE.",
        "To find the most probable PinYin string from English NE, we rewrite Formula (3.5) as the following:",
        "where ei is an English syllable and ri is a Chinese PinYin substring.",
        "For example, we have English NE “Richard” and its candidate Chinese NE “g-Aft”.",
        "Since both the channel model and language model are PinYin based, the result of Viterbi decoding is from “Ri char d” to “Li Cha De”.",
        "We transform “g-Aft” to the PinYin string “Li Cha De”.",
        "Then we compare the similarity based on the PinYin string instead of with Chinese characters directly.",
        "This is because when transliterating English NEs into Chinese, it is very flexible to choose which character to simulate the pronunciation, but the PinYin string is relatively fixed.",
        "For every English word, there exist several ways to partition it into syllables, so here we adopt a dynamic programming algorithm to decode the English word into a Chinese PinYin sequence.",
        "Based on the transliteration string of the English i = NE and the PinYin string of the original candidate Chinese NE, we can calculate their similarity with the XDice coefficient (Brew and McKelvie, 1996).",
        "This is a variant of Dice coefficient which allows “extended bigrams”.",
        "An extended bigram (xbig) is formed by deleting the middle letter from any three-letter substring of the word in addition to the original bigrams.",
