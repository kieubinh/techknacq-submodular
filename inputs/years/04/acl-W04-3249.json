        "A fundamental issue in text processing and understanding is the ability to detect the topic (i.e. the domain) of a text or of a portion of it.",
        "Indeed, domain detection allows a number of useful simplifications in text processing applications, such as, for instance, in Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD).",
        "In this paper we introduce Domain Relevance Estimation (DRE) a fully unsupervised technique for domain detection.",
        "Roughly speaking, DRE can be viewed as a text categorization (TC) problem (Se-bastiani, 2002), even if we do not approach the problem in the standard supervised setting requiring category labeled training data.",
        "In fact, recently, unsupervised approaches to TC have received more and more attention in the literature (see for example (Ko and Seo, 2000).",
        "We assume a predefined set of categories, each defined by means of a list of related terms.",
        "We call such categories domains and we consider them as a set of general topics (e.g.",
        "SPORT, MEDICINE, POLITICS) that cover the main disciplines and areas of human activity.",
        "For each domain, the list of related words is extracted from WORDNET DOMAINS (Magnini and Cavagli`a, 2000), an extension of WORDNET in which synsets are annotated with domain labels.",
        "We have identified about 40 domains (out of 200 present in WORDNET DOMAINS) and we will use them for experiments throughout the paper (see Table 1).",
        "DRE focuses on the problem of estimating a degree of relatedness of a certain text with respect to the domains in WORDNET DOMAINS.",
        "The basic idea underlying DRE is to combine the knowledge in WORDNET DOMAINS and a probabilistic framework which makes use of a large-scale corpus to induce domain frequency distributions.",
        "Specifically, given a certain domain, DRE considers frequency scores for both relevant and non-relevant texts (i.e. texts which introduce noise) and represent them by means of a Gaussian Mixture model.",
        "Then, an Expectation Maximization algorithm computes the parameters that maximize the likelihood of the empirical data.",
        "DRE methodology originated from the effort to improve the performance of Domain Driven Disambiguation (DDD) system (Magnini et al., 2002).",
        "DDD is an unsupervised WSD methodology that makes use of only domain information.",
        "DDD as-signes the right sense of a word in its context comparing the domain of the context to the domain of each sense of the word.",
        "This methodology exploits WORDNET DOMAINS information to estimate both",
        "the domain of the textual context and the domain of the senses of the word to disambiguate.",
        "The former operation is intrinsically an unsupervised TC task, and the category set used has to be the same used for representing the domain of word senses.",
        "Since DRE makes use of a fixed set of target categories (i.e. domains) and since a document collection annotated with such categories is not available, evaluating the performance of the approach is a problem in itself.",
        "We have decided to perform an indirect evaluation using the DDD system, where unsupervised TC plays a crucial role.",

        "Domains show interesting properties both from a lexical and a textual point of view.",
        "Among these properties there are: (i) lexical coherence, since part of the lexicon of a text is composed of words belonging to the same domain; (ii) polysemy reduction, because the potential ambiguity of terms is sensibly lower if the domain of the text is specified; and (iii) lexical identifiability of text’s domain, because it is always possible to assign one or more domains to a given text by considering term distributions in a bag-of-words approach.",
        "Experimental evidences of these properties are reported in (Magnini et al., 2002).",

        "The domain set used in WORDNET DOMAINS has been extracted from the Dewey Decimal Classification (Comaroni et al., 1989), and a mapping between the two taxonomies has been computed in order to ensure completeness.",

        "Domain labeling is complementary to information already present in WORDNET.",
        "First of all, a domain may include synsets of different syntactic categories: for instance MEDICINE groups together senses from nouns, such as doctor # 1 and hospital # 1, and from verbs, such as operate#7.",
        "Second, a domain may include senses from different WORDNET sub-hierarchies (i.e. deriving from different “unique beginners” or from different “lexicographer files”).",

        "from act#2, and playing field#1 from location#1.",
        "Domains may group senses of the same word into thematic clusters, which has the important side-effect of reducing the level of ambiguity when we are disambiguating to a domain.",
        "Table 2 shows an example.",
        "The word “bank” has ten different senses in WORDNET 1.6: three of them (i.e. bank#1, bank#3 and bank#6) can be grouped under the ECONOMY domain, while bank#2 and bank#7 both belong to GEOGRAPHY and GEOLOGY.",
        "Grouping related senses is an emerging topic in WSD (see, for instance (Palmer et al., 2001)).",
        "Finally, there are WORDNET synsets that do not belong to a specific domain, but rather appear in texts associated with any domain.",
        "For this reason, a FACTOTUM label has been created that basically includes generic synsets, which appear frequently in different contexts.",
