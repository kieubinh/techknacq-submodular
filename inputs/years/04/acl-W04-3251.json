        "Ever since Question Answering (QA) emerged as an active research field, the community has slowly diversified question types, increased question complexity, and refined evaluation metrics - as reflected by the TREC QA track (Voorhees, 2003).",
        "Starting from successful pipeline architectures (Moldovan et al., 2000; Hovy et al., 2000), QA systems have responded to changes in the nature of the QA task by incorporating knowledge resources (Hermjakob et al., 2000; Hovy et al., 2002), handling additional types of questions, employing complex reasoning mechanisms (Moldovan et al., 2003; Nyberg et al., 2003), tapping into external data sources such as the Web, encyclopedias, databases (Dumais et al., 2002; Xu et al., 2003), and merging multiple agents and strategies into meta-systems (Chu-Carroll et al., 2003; Burger et al., 2002).",
        "In recent years, learning components have started to permeate Question Answering (Clarke et al., 2003; Ravichandran et al., 2003; Echihabi and Marcu, 2003).",
        "Although the field is still dominated by knowledge-intensive approaches, components such as question classification, answer extraction, and answer verification are beginning to be addressed through statistical methods.",
        "At the same time, research efforts in data acquisition promise to deliver increasingly larger question-answer datasets (Girju et al., 2003; Fleischman et al., 2003).",
        "Moreover, Question Answering is expanding to different languages (Magnini et al., 2003) and domains other than news stories (Zweigenbaum, 2003).",
        "These trends suggest the need for principled, statistically based, easily re-trainable, language independent QA systems that take full advantage of large amounts of training data.",
        "We propose an instance-based, data-driven approach to Question Answering.",
        "Instead of classifying questions according to limited, predefined ontologies, we allow training data to shape the strategies for answering new questions.",
        "Answer models, query content models, and extraction models are also learned directly from training data.",

        "Most existing Question Answering systems classify new questions according to static ontologies.",
        "These ontologies incorporate human knowledge about the expected answer (e.g. date, location, person), answer type granularity (e.g. date, year, century), and very often semantic information about the question type (e.g. birth date, discovery date, death date).",
        "While effective to some degree, these ontologies are still very small, and inconsistent.",
        "Considerable manual effort is invested into building and maintaining accurate ontologies even though answer types are arguably not always disjoint and hierarchical in nature (e.g. “Where is the corpus callosum?” expects an answer that is both location and body part).",
        "The most significant drawback is that ontologies are not standard among systems, making individual component evaluation very difficult and retraining for new domains time-consuming."

        "The task of determining the answer type of a question is usually considered a hard 1 decision problem: questions are classified according to an answer ontology.",
        "The classification (location, person’s name, etc) is usually made in the beginning of the QA process and all subsequent efforts are focused on finding answers of that particular type.",
        "Several existing QA systems implement feedback loops (Harabagiu et al., 2000) or full-fledged planning (Nyberg et al., 2003) to allow for potential answer type reclassification.",
        "However, most questions can have multiple answer types as well as specific answer type distributions.",
        "The following questions can accommodate answers of types: full date, year, and decade.",
        "However, it can be argued that date is the most likely answer type to be observed for the first question, year the most likely type for the second question, and decade most likely for the third question.",
        "In fact, although the three questions can be answered by various temporal expressions, the distributions over these expressions are quite different.",
