        "We present a new approach to intrinsic summary evaluation, based on initial experiments in van Halteren and Teufel (2003), which combines two novel aspects: comparison of information content (rather than string similarity) in gold standard and system summary, measured in shared atomic information units which we call factoids, and comparison to more than one gold standard summary (in our data: 20 and 50 summaries respectively).",
        "In this paper, we show that factoid annotation is highly reproducible, introduce a weighted factoid score, estimate how many summaries are required for stable system rankings, and show that the factoid scores cannot be sufficiently approximated by unigrams and the DUC information overlap measure."

        "Many researchers in summarisation believe that the best way to evaluate a summary is extrinsic evaluation (SpÄarck Jones, 1999): to measure the quality of the summary on the basis of degree of success in executing a specific task with that summary.",
        "The summary evaluation performed in SUMMAC (Mani et al., 1999) followed that strategy.",
        "However, extrinsic evaluations are time-consuming to set up and can thus not be used for the day-to-day evaluation needed during system development.",
        "So in practice, a method for intrinsic evaluation is needed, where the properties of the summary itself are examined, independently of its application.",
        "Intrinsic evaluation of summary quality is undeniably hard, as there are two subtasks of summarisation which need to be evaluated, information selection and text production | – in fact these two subtasks are often separated in evaluation (Mani, 2001).",
        "If we restrict our attention to information selection, systems are tested by way of comparison against a “gold standard”, a manually produced result which is supposed to be the “correct”, “true” or “best” result.",
        "In summarisation there appears to be no “one truth”, but rather various “good” results.",
        "Human subjectivity in what counts as the most important information is high.",
        "This is evidenced by low agreement on sentence selection tasks (Rath et al., 1961; Jing et al., 1998), and low word overlap measures in the task of creating summaries by reformulation in the summarisers’ own words (e.g. word overlap of the 542 single document summary pairs in DUC-02 averaged only 47%).",
        "But even though the non-existence of any one gold standard is generally acknowledged in the summarisation community, actual practice nevertheless ignores this, mostly due to the expense of compiling summary gold standards and the lack of composite measures for comparison to more than one gold standard.",
        "Other fields such as information retrieval (IR) also have to deal with human variability concerning the question of what “relevant to a query” means.",
        "This problem is circumvented by extensive sampling: many different queries are collected to level out the differences in query formulation and relevance judgements.",
        "Voorhees (2000) shows that the relative rankings of IR systems are stable across annotators even though relevance judgements differ significantly between humans.",
        "Similarly, in MT, the recent BLEU metric (Papineni et al., 2001) also uses the idea that one gold standard is not enough.",
        "Their ngram-based metric derived from four reference translations of 40 general news stories shows high correlation with human judgement.",
        "Lin and Hovy (2002) examine the use of ngram-based multiple gold standards for summarisation evaluation, and conclude “we need more than one model summary although we cannot estimate how many model summaries are required to achieve reliable automated summary evaluation”.",
        "In this paper, we explore the differences and similarities between various human summaries in order to create a basis for such an estimate and examine the degree of difference between the use of a single summary gold standard and the use of a consensus gold standard for two sample texts, based on 20 and 50 summaries respectively.",
        "The second aspect we examine is the similarity measure which compares system and gold standard summaries.",
        "In principle, the comparison can be done via co-selection of extracted sentences (Rath et al., 1961; Jing et al., 1998), by string-based surface measures (Lin and Hovy, 2002), or by subjective judgements of the amount of information overlap (DUC, 2002).",
        "String-based metrics are superior to sentence co-selection, as co-selection cannot take similar or even identical information into account if it does not occur in the sentences which were chosen.",
        "The choice of information overlap judgements as the main metric in DUC reflects the intuition that human judgements of shared “meaning” of two texts should in principle be superior to surface-based similarity.",
        "DUC assessors judge the informational overlap between “model units” (elementary discourse units (EDUs), i.e. clause-like units, taken from the gold standard summary) and “peer units” (sentences taken from the participating summaries) on the basis of the question: “How much of the information in a model unit is contained in a peer unit: 100%, 80%, 60%, 40%, 20%, 0%?” Weighted recall measures report how much gold standard information is present in the summaries.",
        "However, information overlap judgement is not something humans seem to be good at, either.",
        "Lin and Hovy (2002) show the instability of the evaluation, expressed in system rankings.",
        "They also examined those cases where annotators incidentially had to judge a given model{peer pair more than once (because different systems returned the same “peer” sentence).",
        "In those cases, assessors agreed with their own prior judgement in only 82% of the cases.",
        "We propose a novel gold standard comparison based on factoids.",
        "Identifying factoids in text is a more objective task than judging information overlap aµ la DUC.",
        "Our annotation experiments show high human agreement on the factoid annotation task.",
        "We believe this is due to the way how factoids are defined, and due to our precise guidelines.",
        "The factoid measure also allows quantification of the specific elements of information overlap, rather than just giving a quantitative judgement expressed in percentages.",
        "In an example from Lin and Hovy (2002), a DUC assessor judged some content overlap between “Thousands of people are feared dead” and “3,000 and perhaps ... 5,000 people have been killed.” In our factoid representation, a distinction between “killed” and “feared dead” would be made, and different numbers of people mentioned would have been differentiated.",
        "Thus, the factoid approach can capture much finer shades of meaning differentiation than DUC-style information overlap does.",
        "Futher-more, it can provide feedback to system builders on the exact information their systems fail to include or include superfluously.",
        "We describe factoid analysis in section 2, a method for comparison of the information content of different summaries of the same texts, and describe our method for measuring agreement and present results in section 3.",
        "We then investigate the distribution of factoids across the summaries in our data sets in section 4, and define a weighted factoid score in section 5.",
        "In that section, we also perform stability experiments, to test whether rankings of system summaries remain stable if fewer than all summaries which we have available are used, and compare weighted factoid scores to other summary evaluation metrics."

        "We use two texts: a 600-word BBC report on the killing of the Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn (as used in van Halteren and Teufel (2003)), which contains a mix of factual information and personal reactions, and a 573-word article on the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait (used in DUC-2002, LA080290-0233).",
        "For these two texts, we collected human written generic summaries of roughly 100 words.",
        "Our guidelines asked the human subjects to formulate the summary in their own words, in order to elicit different linguistic expressions for the same information.",
        "Knowledge about the variability of expression is important both for evaluation and system building.",
        "The Fortuyn text was summarised by 40 Dutch studentsi, and 10 NLP researchers (native or near-native English speakers), resulting in a total of 50 summaries.",
        "For the Kuwait text, 'Another 20 summaries of the same source were removed due to insufficient English or excessive length.",
        "we used the 6 DUC-provided summaries, 17 ELSNET-02 student participants (7 summaries removed), and summaries by 4 additional researchers, resulting in a total of 20 summaries.",
        "We use atomic semantic units called factoids to represent the meaning of a sentence.",
        "For instance, we represent the sentence “The police have arrested a white Dutch man” by the union of the following factoids:",
        "Factoids are defined empirically based on the data in the set of summaries we work with.",
        "Factoid definition starts with the comparison of the information contained in two summaries, and gets refined (factoids get added or split) as incrementally other summaries are considered.",
        "If two pieces of information occur together in all summaries – and within the same sentence – they are treated as one factoid, because differentiation into more than one factoid would not help us in distinguishing the summaries.",
        "In our data, there must have been at least one summary that contained either only FP25 or only FP26 – otherwise those factoids would have been combined into a single factoid “FP27 The suspect is a Dutch man”.",
        "Factoids are labelled with descriptions in natural language; initially, these are close in wording to the factoid’s occurrence in the first summaries, though the annotator tries to identify and treat equally paraphrases of the factoid information when they occur in other summaries.",
        "Our definition of atomicity implies that the “amount” of information associated with one factoid can vary from a single word to an entire sentence.",
        "An example for a large chunk of information that occurred atomically in our texts was the fact that Fortuyn wanted to become PM (FV71), a factoid which covers an entire sentence.",
        "On the other hand, a single word may break down into more than one factoids.",
        "If (together with various statements in other summaries) one summary contains “was killed” and another “was shot dead”, we identify the factoids",
        "The first summary contains only the first two factoids, whereas the second contains all three.",
        "That way, the semantic similarity between related sentences can be expressed.",
        "When we identified factoids in our summary collections, most factoids turned out to be independent of each other.",
        "But when dealing with naturally occuring documents many difficult cases appear, e.g. ambiguous expressions, slight differences in numbers and meaning, and inference.",
        "Another difficult phenomenon is attribution.",
        "In both source texts, quotations of the reactions of several politicians and officials are given, and the subjects often generalised these reactions and produced statements such as “Dutch as well as international politicians have expressed their grief and disbelief.” Due to coordination of speakers (in the subject) and coordination of reactions (in the direct object), it is hard to accurately represent the attribution of opinions.",
        "We therefore introduce combinatorical factoids, such as “ OG40 Politicians expressed grief” and “OS62 International persons/organizations expressed disbelief” which can be combined with similar factoids to express the above sentence.",
        "We wrote guidelines (10 pages long) which describe how to derive factoids from texts.",
        "The guidelines cover questions such as: how to create generalising factoids when numerical values vary (summaries might talk about “200”, “about 200” or “almost 200 Kuwaitis were killed”), how to create factoids dealing with attribution of opinion, and how to deal with coordination of NPs in subject position, cataphors and other syntactic constructions.",
        "We believe that written guidelines should contain all the rules by which this process is done; this is the only way that other annotators, who do not have access to all the discussions the original annotators had, can replicate the annotation with a high agreement.",
        "We therefore consider the guidelines as one of the most valuable outcomes of this exercise, and we will make them and our annotated material generally available.",
        "The advantage of our empirical, summary-set-dependent definition of factoid atomicity is that the annotation is more objective than if factoids had to be invented by intuition of semantic constructions from scratch.",
        "One possible disadvantage of our definition of atomicity is that the set of factoids used may have to be adjusted if new summaries are judged, as a required factoid might be missing, or an existing one might require splitting.",
        "Using a large number of gold-standard summaries for the definition of factoids decreases the likelihood of this happening."

        "If single summaries are used as gold standard (as many other summarization evaluations do), the correlation between rankings based on two such gold standard summaries can be expected to be low; in our two experiments, the correlations were p=0.20 and 0.48 on average.",
        "According to our estimations, stability with respect to the factoid scores can only be expected if a larger number of summaries are collected (in the range of 20–30 summaries).",
        "System rankings based on the factoid score shows only low correlation with rankings based on a) DUC-based information overlap, and b) unigrams, a measurement based on shared words between gold standard summaries and system summary.",
        "As far as b) is concerned, this is expected, as factoid comparison abstracts over wording and captures linguistic variation of the same meaning.",
        "However, the ROUGE measure currently in development is considering various n-grams and Wordnet-based paraphrasing options (Lin, personal communication).",
        "We expect that this measure has the potential for better ranking correlation with factoid ranking, and we are currently investigating this.",
        "We also plan to expand our data sets to more texts, in order to investigate the presence and distribution of factoids, types of factoids and relations between factoids in summaries and summary collections.",
        "Currently, we have two large factoid-annotated data sets with 20 and 50 summaries, and a workable procedure to annotate factoids, including guidelines which were used to achieve good agreement.",
        "We now plan to elicit the help of new annotators to increase our data pool.",
        "Another pressing line of investigation is reducing the cost of factoid analysis.",
        "The first reason why this analysis is currently expensive is the need for large summary bases for consensus summaries.",
        "Possibly this can be circumvented by using larger numbers of different texts, as is the case in IR and in MT, where discrepancies prove to average out when large enough datasets are used.",
        "The second reason is the need for human annotation of factoids.",
        "Although simple word-based methods prove insufficient, we expect that existing and emerging NLP techniques based on deeper processing might help with automatic factoid identification.",
        "All in all, the use of factoid analysis and weighted factoid score, even though initially expensive to set up, provides a promising alternative which could well bring us closer to a solution to several problems in summarisation evaluation."
