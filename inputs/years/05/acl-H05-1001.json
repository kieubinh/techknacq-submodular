        "Many approaches to summarization can be very broadly characterized as TERM-BASED: they attempt to identify the main ‘topics,’ which generally are TERMS, and then to extract from the document the most important information about these terms (Hovy and Lin, 1997).",
        "These approaches can be divided again very broadly in ‘lexical’ approaches, among which we would include LSA-based approaches, and ‘coreference-based’ approaches .",
        "Lexical approaches to term-based summarization use lexical relations to identify central terms (Barzilay and Elhadad, 1997; Gong and Liu, 2002); coreference- (or anaphora-) based approaches (Baldwin and Morton, 1998; Boguraev and",

        "In addition, to our knowledge no authors have convincingly demonstrated that feeding anaphoric information to a summarizer significantly improves the performance of a summarizer using a standard evaluation procedure (a reference corpus and baseline, and widely accepted evaluation measures).",
        "In this paper we compare two sentence extraction-based summarizers.",
        "Both use Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer, 1997) to identify the main terms of a text for summarization; however, the first system (Steinberger and Jezek, 2004), discussed in Section 2, only uses lexical information to identify the main topics, whereas the second system exploits both lexical and anaphoric information.",
        "This second system uses an existing anaphora resolution system to resolve anaphoric expressions, GUITAR (Poesio and Kabadjov, 2004); but, crucially, two different ways of using this information for summarization were tested.",

        "LSA (Landauer, 1997) is a technique for extracting the ‘hidden’ dimensions of the semantic representation of terms, sentences, or documents, on the basis of their contextual use.",
        "It is a very powerful technique already used for NLP applications such as information retrieval (Berry et al., 1995) and text segmentation (Choi et al., 2001) and, more recently, multi and single-document summarization.",
        "The approach to using LSA in text summarization we followed in this paper was proposed in (Gong and Liu, 2002).",
        "Gong and Liu propose to start by creating a term by sentences matrix A = [Al, A2, ... , An], where each column vector Ai represents the weighted term-frequency vector of sentence i in the document under consideration.",
        "If there are a total of m terms and n sentences in the document, then we will have an m x n matrix A for the document.",
        "The next step is to apply Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to matrix A.",
        "Given an m x n matrix A, the SVD of A is defined as:",
        "(1) A = UrVT",
        "where U= [uij ] is an m x n column-orthonormal matrix whose columns are called left singular vectors, E = diag(σl, σ2, .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", σn) is an n x n diagonal matrix, whose diagonal elements are non-negative singular values sorted in descending order, and V = [vij ] is an n x n orthonormal matrix, whose columns are called right singular vectors.",
        "From a mathematical point of view, applying SVD to a matrix derives a mapping between the m-dimensional space spawned by the weighted term-frequency vectors and the r-dimensional singular vector space.",
        "From a NLP perspective, what the SVD does is to derive the latent semantic structure of the document represented by matrix A: a breakdown of the original document into r linearly-independent base vectors (‘topics’).",
        "Each term and sentence from the document is jointly indexed by these ‘topics’.",
        "A unique SVD feature is that it is capable of capturing and modelling interrelationships among terms so that it can semantically cluster terms and sentences.",
        "Furthermore, as demonstrated in (Berry et al., 1995), if a word combination pattern is salient and recurring in document, this pattern will be captured and represented by one of the singular vectors.",
        "The magnitude of the corresponding singular value indicates the importance degree of this pattern within the document.",
        "Any sentences containing this word combination pattern will be projected along this singular vector, and the sentence that best represents this pattern will have the largest index value with this vector.",
        "As each particular word combination pattern describes a certain topic in the document, each singular vector can be viewed as representing a salient topic of the document, and the magnitude of its corresponding singular value represents the degree of importance of the salient topic.",
        "The summarization method proposed by Gong and Liu (2002) should now be easy to understand.",
        "The matrix VT describes the importance degree of each ’implicit topic’ in each sentence: the summarization process simply chooses the most informative sentence for each term.",
        "In other words, the kth sentence chosen is the one with the largest index value in the kth right singular vector in matrix VT.",
        "The summarization method proposed by Gong and Liu has some disadvantages as well, the main of which is that it is necessary to use the same number of dimensions as is the number of sentences we want to choose for a summary.",
        "However, the higher the number of dimensions of reduced space is, the less significant topic we take into a summary.",
        "In order to remedy this problem, we (Steinberger and Jezek, 2004) proposed the following modifications to Gong and Liu’s summarization method.",
        "After computing the SVD of a term by sentences matrix, we compute the length of each sentence vector in matrix V. This is to favour the index values in the matrix V that correspond to the highest singular values (the most significant topics).",
        "Formally: (2) sk = ✓�i=1 v�k,i ' σi , where skis the length of the vector of k’th sentence in the modified latent vector space, and its significance score for summarization too.",
        "The level of dimensionality reduction (r) is essentially learned from the data.",
        "Finally, we put into the summary the sentences with the highest values in vector s. We showed in previous work (Steinberger and Jezek,",
        "2004) that this modification results in a significant improvement over Gong and Liu’s method."
