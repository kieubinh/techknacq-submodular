        "The standard approach to word alignment from sentence-aligned bitexts has been to construct models which generate sentences of one language from the other, then fitting those generative models with EM (Brown et al., 1990; Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "This approach has two primary advantages and two primary drawbacks.",
        "In its favor, generative models of alignment are well-suited for use in a noisy-channel translation system.",
        "In addition, they can be trained in an unsupervised fashion, though in practice they do require labeled validation alignments for tuning model hyper-parameters, such as null counts or smoothing amounts, which are crucial to producing alignments of good quality.",
        "A primary drawback of the generative approach to alignment is that, as in all generative models, explicitly incorporating arbitrary features of the input is difficult.",
        "For example, when considering whether to align two words in the IBM models (Brown et al., 1990), one cannot easily include information about such features as orthographic similarity (for detecting cognates), presence of the pair in various dictionaries, similarity of the frequency of the two words, choices made by other alignment systems on this sentence pair, and so on.",
        "While clever models can implicitly capture some of these information sources, it takes considerable work, and can make the resulting models quite complex.",
        "A second drawback of generative translation models is that, since they are learned with EM, they require extensive processing of large amounts of data to achieve good performance.",
        "While tools like GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) do make it easier to build on the long history of the generative IBM approach, they also underscore how complex high-performance generative models can, and have, become.",
        "In this paper, we present a discriminative approach to word alignment.",
        "Word alignment is cast as a maximum weighted matching problem (Cormen et al., 1990) in which each pair of words (ej, fk) in a sentence pair (e, f) is associated with a score sjk(e, f ) reflecting the desirability of the alignment of that pair.",
        "The alignment",
        "for the sentence pair is then the highest scoring matching under some constraints, for example the requirement that matchings be one-to-one.",
        "This view of alignment as graph matching is not, in itself, new: Melamed (2000) uses competitive linking to greedily construct matchings where the pair score is a measure of word-to-word association, and Matusov et al.",
        "(2004) find exact maximum matchings where the pair scores come from the alignment posteriors of generative models.",
        "Tiedemann (2003) proposes incorporating a variety of word association “clues” into a greedy linking algorithm.",
        "What we contribute here is a principled approach for tractable and efficient learning of the alignment score sjk(e, f) as a function of arbitrary features of that token pair.",
        "This contribution opens up the possibility of doing the kind of feature engineering for alignment that has been so successful for other NLP tasks.",
        "We first present the algorithm for large margin estimation of the scoring function.",
        "We then show that our method can achieve AER rates comparable to unsymmetrized IBM Model 4, using extremely little labeled data (as few as 100 sentences) and a simple feature set.",
        "Remarkably, by including bidirectional IBM Model 4 predictions as features, we achieve an absolute AER of 5.4 on the English-French Hansards alignment task, a relative reduction of 22% in AER over intersected Model 4 alignments and, to our knowledge, the best AER result published on this task."

        "We represent a matching using a set of binary variables yjk that are set to 1 if word j is assigned to word k in the other sentence, and 0 otherwise.",

        "Note that although the above LP can be used to compute alignments, combinatorial algorithms are generally more efficient.",
        "However, we use the LP to develop the learning algorithm below.",
        "For a sentence pair x, we denote position pairs by xjk and their scores as sjk.",

        "We can include in the feature vector the identity of the two words, their relative positions in their respective sentences, their part-of-speech tags, their string similarity (for detecting cognates), and so on.",
        "At this point, one can imagine estimating a linear matching model in multiple ways, including using conditional likelihood estimation, an averaged perceptron update (see which matchings are proposed and adjust the weights according to the difference between the guessed and target structures (Collins, 2002)), or in large-margin fashion.",
        "Conditional likelihood estimation using a log-linear model P(y |x) = (X exp{wTf(x, y)} requires summing overall z ) matchings to compute the normalization Zw (x), which is #P-complete (Valiant, 1979).",

        "This information can be captured, among many other ways, using a feature whose 'In principle, we can model also model fertility, by allowing 0-k matches for each word rather than 0-1, and having bias features on each word.",

        "value is the Dice coefficient (Dice, 1945):",
        "Here, CE and CF are counts of word occurrences in each language, while CEF is the number of co-occurrences of the two words.",
        "With just this feature on a pair of word tokens (which depends only on their types), we can already make a stab",
        "at word alignment, aligning, say, each English word with the French word (or null) with the highest Dice value (see (Melamed, 2000)), simply as a matching-free heuristic model.",
        "With Dice counts taken from the 1.1M sentences, this gives and AER of 38.7 with English as the target, and 36.0 with French as the target (in line with the numbers from Och and Ney (2003)).",
        "As observed in Melamed (2000), this use of Dice misses the crucial constraint of competition: a candidate source word with high association to a target word may be unavailable for alignment because some other target has an even better affinity for that source word.",
        "Melamed uses competitive linking to incorporate this constraint explicitly, while the IBM-style models get this effect via explaining-away effects in EM training.",
        "We can get something much like the combination of Dice and competitive linking by running with just one feature on each pair: the Dice value of that pair’s words.2 With just a Dice feature – meaning no learning is needed yet – we achieve an AER of 29.8, between the Dice with competitive linking result of 34.0 and Model 1 of 25.9 given in Och and Ney (2003).",
        "An example of the alignment at this stage is shown in Figure 1(a).",
        "Note that most errors lie off the diagonal, for example the often-correct to-6, match.",
        "IBM Model 2, as usually implemented, adds the preference of alignments to lie near the diagonal.",
        "Model 2 is driven by the product of a word-to-word measure and a (usually) Gaussian distribution which penalizes distortion from the diagonal.",
        "We can capture the same effect using features which reference the relative positions j and k of a pair (ej, fk).",
        "In addition to a Model 2-style quadratic feature referencing relative position, we threw in the following proximity features: absolute difference in relative position abs (j / |e |−k/ |f|), and the square and square root of this value.",
        "In addition, we used a conjunction feature of the dice coefficient times the proximity.",
        "Finally, we added a bias feature on each edge, which acts as a threshold that allows",
        "sparser, higher precision alignments.",
        "With these features, we got an AER of 15.5 (compare to 19.5 for Model 2 in (Och and Ney, 2003)).",
        "Note that we already have a capacity that Model 2 does not: we can learn a non-quadratic penalty with linear mixtures of our various components – this gives a similar effect to learning the variance of the Gaussian for Model 2, but is, at least in principle, more flexible.",
        "These features fix the to-6, error in Figure 1(a), giving the alignment in Figure 1(b).",
        "On top of these features, we included other kinds of information, such as word-similarity features designed to capture cognate (and exact match) information.",
        "We added a feature for exact match of words, exact match ignoring accents, exact matching ignoring vowels, and fraction overlap of the longest common subsequence.",

        "The running example now has the alignment in Figure 1(c), where one improvement may be attributable to the short pair feature – it has stopped proposing the-de, partially because the short pair feature downweights the score of that pair.",
        "A clearer example of these features making a difference is shown in Figure 2, where both the exact-match and character overlap fea",
        "tures are used.",
        "One source of constraint which our model still does not explicitly capture is the first-order dependency between alignment positions, as in the HMM model (Vogel et al., 1996) and IBM models 4+.",
        "The the-le error in Figure 1(c) is symptomatic of this lack.",
        "In particular, it is a slightly better pair according to the Dice value than the correct the-les.",
        "However, the latter alignment has the advantage that major-grands follows it.",
        "To use this information source, we included a feature which gives the Dice value of the words following the pair.4 We also added a word-frequency feature whose value is the absolute difference in log rank of the words, discouraging very common words from translating to very rare ones.",
        "Finally, we threw in bilexical features of the pairs of top 5 non-punctuation words in each language.5 This helped by removing specific common errors like the residual tendency for French de to mistakenly align to English the (the two most common words).",
        "The resulting model produces the alignment in Figure 1(d).",
        "It has sorted out the the-le / the-les confusion, and is also able to guess to-de, which is not the most common translation for either word, but which is supported by the good Dice value on the following pair (makefaire).",
        "With all these features, we got a final AER of 10.7, broadly similar to the 8.9 or 9.7 AERs of unsymmetrized IBM Model 4 trained on the same data that the Dice counts were taken from.6 Of course, symmetrizing Model 4 by intersecting alignments from both directions does yield an improved AER of 6.9, so, while our model does do surprisingly well with cheaply obtained count-based features, Model 4 does still outperform it so far.",
        "However, our model can",
        "also easily incorporate the predictions of Model 4 as additional features.",
        "We therefore added three new features for each edge: the prediction of Model 4 in the English-French direction, the prediction in the French-English direction, and the intersection of the two predictions.",
        "With these powerful new features, our AER dropped dramatically to 5.4, a 22% improvement over the intersected Model 4 performance.",
        "Another way of doing the parameter estimation for this matching task would have been to use an averaged perceptron method, as in Collins (2002).",
        "In this method, we merely run our matching algorithm and update weights based on the difference between the predicted and target matchings.",
