        "Phrase reordering is modeled as a first order Markov process with a single parameter that controls the degree of movement.",
        "Our current work is inspired by the block (phrase-pair) orientation model introduced by Till-mann (2004) in which reordering allows neighboring blocks to swap.",
        "This is described as a sequence of orientations (left, right, neutral) relative to the monotone block order.",
        "Model parameters are block-specific and estimated over word aligned trained bitext using simple heuristics.",
