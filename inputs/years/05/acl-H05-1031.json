        "Multi-document summarization has been an active area of research over the past decade (Mani and Maybury, 1999) and yet, barring a few exceptions (Daum´e III et al., 2002; Radev and McKeown, 1998), most systems still use shallow features to produce an extractive summary, an age-old technique (Luhn, 1958) that has well-known problems.",
        "Extractive summaries contain phrases that the reader cannot understand out of context (Paice, 1990) and irrelevant phrases that happen to occur in a relevant sentence (Knight and Marcu, 2000; Barzilay, 2003).",
        "Referring expressions in extractive summaries illustrate this problem, as sentences compiled from different documents might contain too little, too much or repeated information about the referent.",
        "Whether a referring expression is appropriate depends on the location of the referent in the hearer’s mental model of the discourse – the referent’s cognitive status (Gundel et al., 1993).",
        "If, for example, the referent is unknown to the reader at the point of mention in the discourse, the reference should include a description, while if the referent was known to the reader, no descriptive details are necessary.",
        "Determining a referent’s cognitive status, however, implies the need to model the intended audience of the summary.",
        "Can such a cognitive status model be inferred automatically for a general readership?",
        "In this paper, we address this question by performing a study with human subjects to confirm that reasonable agreement on the distinctions can be achieved between different humans (cf. §5).",
        "We present an automatic approach for inferring what the typical reader is likely to know about people in the news.",
        "Our approach uses machine learning, exploiting features based on the form of references to people in the input news articles (cf. §4).",
        "Learning cognitive status of referents is necessary if we want to ultimately generate new, more appropriate references for news summaries."

        "In human communication, the wording used by speakers to refer to a discourse entity depends on their communicative goal and their beliefs about what listeners already know.",
        "The speaker’s goals and beliefs about the listener’s knowledge are both a part of a cognitive/mental model of the discourse.",
        "Cognitive status distinctions depend on two parameters related to the referent – a) whether it already exists in the hearer’s model of the discourse, and b) its degree of salience.",
        "The influence of these distinctions on the form of referring expressions has been investigated in the past.",
        "For example, centering theory (Grosz et al., 1995) deals predominantly with local salience (local attentional status), and the givenness hierarchy (information status) of Prince (1992) focuses on how a referent got in the discourse model (e.g. through a direct mention in the current discourse, through previous knowledge, or through inference), leading to distinctions such as discourse-old, discourse-new, hearer-old, hearer-new, inferable and containing inferable.",

        "The other two cognitive status distinctions, whether an entity is central to the summary or not (major or minor) and whether the hearer can be assumed to be already familiar with the entity (hearer-old vs hearer-new status), have not been previously studied in the context of summarization.",
        "There is a tradeoff, particularly important for a short summary, between what the speaker wants to convey 'The notion of global salience is very important to summarization, both during content selection and during generation on initial references to entities.",

        "In order to evaluate the performance of the classifier, we gave a human annotator the list of people’s names appearing in the machine summaries, together with the input cluster and the machine summary, and asked which of the names on the list would be a suitable keyword for the set (keyword lists are a form of a very short summary).",
        "Out of the 107 names on the list, the annotator chose 42 as suitable for descriptive keyword for the set.",
        "The major/minor classifier was run on the 107 examples; only 40 were predicted to be major characters.",
        "Of the 67 test cases that were predicted by the classifier to be minor characters, 12 (18%) were marked by the annotator as acceptable keywords.",
        "In comparison, of the 40 characters that were predicted to be major characters by the classifier, 30 (75%) were marked as possible keywords.",
        "If the keyword selections of the annotator are taken as ground truth, the automatic predictions have precision and recall of 0.75 and 0.71 respectively for the major class."

        "However, to date, no one has attempted the task of inferring cognitive status from unrestricted news.",
        "We have shown that the hearer-old/new and major/minor distinctions can be inferred using features derived from the lexical and syntactic forms and frequencies of references in the news reports.",
        "We have presented results that show agreement on the familiarity distinction between educated adult American readers with an interest in current affairs, and that the learned classifier accurately predicts this distinction.",
        "We have demonstrated that the acquired cognitive status is useful for determining which characters to name in summaries, and which named characters to describe or elaborate.",
        "This provides the foundation for a principled framework in which to address the question of how much references can be shortened without compromising readability."
