        "(Knuth, 1993) Humor is an essential element in personal communication.",
        "While it is merely considered a way to induce amusement, humor also has a positive effect on the mental state of those using it and has the ability to improve their activity.",
        "Therefore computational humor deserves particular attention, as it has the potential of changing computers into a creative and motivational tool for human activity (Stock et al., 2002; Nijholt et al., 2003).",
        "Previous work in computational humor has focused mainly on the task of humor generation (Stock and Strapparava, 2003; Binsted and Ritchie, 1997), and very few attempts have been made to develop systems for automatic humor recognition (Taylor and Mazlack, 2004).",
        "This is not surprising, since, from a computational perspective, humor recognition appears to be significantly more subtle and difficult than humor generation.",
        "In this paper, we explore the applicability of computational approaches to the recognition of verbally expressed humor.",
        "In particular, we investigate whether automatic classification techniques are a viable approach to distinguish between humorous and non-humorous text, and we bring empirical evidence in support of this hypothesis through experiments performed on very large data sets.",
        "Since a deep comprehension of humor in all of its aspects is probably too ambitious and beyond the existing computational capabilities, we chose to restrict our investigation to the type of humor found in one-liners.",
        "A one-liner is a short sentence with comic effects and an interesting linguistic structure: simple syntax, deliberate use of rhetoric devices (e.g. alliteration, rhyme), and frequent use of creative language constructions meant to attract the readers attention.",
        "While longer jokes can have a relatively complex narrative structure, a one-liner must produce the humorous effect “in one shot”, with very few words.",
        "These characteristics make this type of humor particularly suitable for use in an automatic learning setting, as the humor-producing features are guaranteed to be present in the first (and only) sentence.",
        "We attempt to formulate the humor-recognition",
        "problem as a traditional classification task, and feed positive (humorous) and negative (non-humorous) examples to an automatic classifier.",
        "The humorous data set consists of one-liners collected from the Web using an automatic bootstrapping process.",
        "The non-humorous data is selected such that it is structurally and stylistically similar to the one-liners.",
        "Specifically, we use three different negative data sets: (1) Reuters news titles; (2) proverbs; and (3) sentences from the British National Corpus (BNC).",
        "The classification results are encouraging, with accuracy figures ranging from 79.15% (One-liners/BNC) to 96.95% (One-liners/Reuters).",
        "Regardless of the non-humorous data set playing the role of negative examples, the performance of the automatically learned humor-recognizer is always significantly better than apriori known baselines.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "We first describe the humorous and non-humorous data sets, and provide details on the Web-based bootstrapping process used to build a very large collection of one-liners.",

        "For reasons outlined earlier, we restrict our attention to one-liners, short humorous sentences that have the characteristic of producing a comic effect in very few words (usually 15 or less).",
        "The one-liners humor style is illustrated in Table 1, which shows three examples of such one-sentence jokes.",
        "It is well-known that large amounts of training data have the potential of improving the accuracy of the learning process, and at the same time provide insights into how increasingly larger data sets can affect the classification precision.",
        "The manual con",
        "struction of a very large one-liner data set may be however problematic, since most Web sites or mailing lists that make available such jokes do not usually list more than 50–100 one-liners.",
        "To tackle this problem, we implemented a Web-based bootstrapping algorithm able to automatically collect a large number of one-liners starting with a short seed list, consisting of a few one-liners manually identified.",
        "The bootstrapping process is illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "Starting with the seed set, the algorithm automatically identifies a list of webpages that include at least one of the seed one-liners, via a simple search performed with a Web search engine.",
        "Next, the web-pages found in this way are HTML parsed, and additional one-liners are automatically identified and added to the seed set.",
        "The process is repeated several times, until enough one-liners are collected.",
        "An important aspect of any bootstrapping algorithm is the set of constraints used to steer the process and prevent as much as possible the addition of noisy entries.",
        "Our algorithm uses: (1) a thematic constraint applied to the theme of each webpage; and (2) a structural constraint, exploiting HTML annotations indicating text of similar genre.",
        "The first constraint is implemented using a set of keywords of which at least one has to appear in the URL of a retrieved webpage, thus potentially limiting the content of the webpage to a theme related to that keyword.",
        "The set of keywords used in the current implementation consists of six words that explicitly indicate humor-related content: oneliner, one-liner, humor, humour, joke,",
        "funny.",
        "For example, http://www.berro.com/Jokes or http://www.mutedfaith.com/funny/life.htm are the URLs of two webpages that satisfy this constraint.",
        "The second constraint is designed to exploit the HTML structure of webpages, in an attempt to identify enumerations of texts that include the seed oneliner.",
        "This is based on the hypothesis that enumerations typically include texts of similar genre, and thus a list including the seed one-liner is likely to include additional one-line jokes.",
        "For instance, if a seed one-liner is found in a webpage preceded by the HTML tag < l i> (i.e. “list item”), other lines found in the same enumeration preceded by the same tag are also likely to be one-liners.",
        "Two iterations of the bootstrapping process, started with a small seed set of ten one-liners, resulted in a large set of about 24,000 one-liners.",
        "After removing the duplicates using a measure of string similarity based on the longest common subsequence metric, we were left with a final set of approximately 16,000 one-liners, which are used in the humor-recognition experiments.",
        "Note that since the collection process is automatic, noisy entries are also possible.",
        "Manual verification of a randomly selected sample of 200 one-liners indicates an average of 9% potential noise in the data set, which is within reasonable limits, as it does not appear to significantly impact the quality of the learning."

        "sentences).",

        "These figures are comparable to those reported in Tables 2 and 3 for One-liners/BNC, which suggests that the experimental results reported in the previous sections do not reflect a bias introduced by the negative data sets, since similar results are obtained when the humor recognition is performed with respect to arbitrary negative examples.",
        "As indicated in section 2.2, the negative examples were selected structurally and stylistically similar to the one-liners, making the humor recognition task more difficult than in a real setting.",
        "Nonetheless, we also performed a set of experiments where we made the task even harder, using uneven class distributions.",
        "For each of the three types of negative examples, we constructed a data set using 75% non-humorous examples and 25% humorous examples.",
        "Although the baseline in this case is higher (75%), the automatic classification techniques for humor-recognition still improve over this baseline.",
        "The stylistic features lead to a classification accuracy of 87.49% (One-liners/Reuters), 77.62% (One-liners/BNC), and 76.20% (One-liners/Proverbs), and the content-based features used in a Na¨ıve Bayes classifier result in accuracy figures of 96.19% (One-liners/Reuters), 81.56% (One-liners/BNC), and 87.86% (One-liners/Proverbs).",
        "Finally, in addition to classification accuracy, we were also interested in the variation of classification performance with respect to data size, which is an aspect particularly relevant for directing future research.",
        "Depending on the shape of the learning curves, one could decide to concentrate future work either on the acquisition of larger data sets, or toward the identification of more sophisticated features.",
        "Figure 2 shows that regardless of the type of negative data, there is significant learning only until about 60% of the data (i.e. about 10,000 positive examples, and the same number of negative examples).",
        "The rather steep ascent of the curve, especially in the first part of the learning, suggests that humorous and non-humorous texts represent well distinguishable types of data.",
        "An interesting effect can be noticed toward the end of the learning, where for both classifiers the curve becomes completely flat (One-liners/Reuters, One-liners/Proverbs), or it even has a slight drop (One-liners/BNC).",
        "This is probably due to the presence of noise in the data set, which starts to become visible for very large data sets6.",

        "Finally, through the analysis of learning curves plotting the classification performance with respect to data size, we showed that the accuracy of the automatic humor-recognizer stops improving after a certain number of examples.",
        "Given that automatic humor-recognition is a rather understudied problem, we believe that this is an important result, as it provides insights into potentially productive directions for future work.",
        "The flattened shape of the curves toward the end of the learning process suggests that rather than focusing on gathering more data, future work should concentrate on identifying more sophisticated humor-specific features, e.g. semantic oppositions, ambiguity, and others.",
        "We plan to address these aspects in future work."
