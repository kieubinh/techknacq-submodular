        "Almost every state-of-the-art large vocabulary automatic speech recognition (ASR) system requires the sharing of sub-word units in order to achieve the desired vocabulary coverage.",
        "Traditionally, these sub-word units are determined by the phones or phonemes of a language (depending on desired detail of representation).",
        "However, phonetic (or phonemic) representation has its pitfalls (cf. (Os-tendorf, 1999)).",
        "Among the problems cited in the literature are that (1) segments are often difficult for machines to recognize from the acoustic cues alone, because the acoustic cues to a particular phoneme are multi-faceted, and (2) the intended words and phrases are not always recoverable even from correctly recognized segments, because speakers themselves will also fail to articulate words with the dictionary-listed phonemes.",
        "The first of these problems refers to the discriminability of phonemes within an inventory; the second to the reliability of (actual) phone sequences mapping to the canonical phonemic representations of words.",
        "This is particularly true in conversational speech (such as that found in the Switchboard corpus), where pragmatic context and conversational conventions assist human comprehension (but not current ASR systems).",
        "A common approach for handling pronunciation variation is to introduce alternative entries into the lexicon.",
        "However, phones that are perceived as non-canonical (for example, when an /eh/ is heard as an /ih/ by linguistic transcribers) often are closer in acoustic space to the Gaussian means of the canonical phones, rather than the perceived phones (Sarac¸lar et al., 2000).",
        "This insight suggests that acoustic models need to be cognizant of potential pronunciation changes.",
        "Thus the lexical and acoustic models should work hand in hand.",
        "Another way to model this type of pronunciation variation is to find the commonalities that the canonical and perceived phone share in terms of a sub-phonetic representation.",
        "In the past decade, a significant community in acoustic-phonetic ASR research has been turning to distinctive features (Jakobson et al., 1952) for building ASR lexica.",
        "While an exhaustive description of these approaches is beyond the scope of this paper, estimates of phonological feature probabilities have been combined to obtain phone probabilities (Kirchhoff, 1998), or incorporated into “feature bundles” that allow representation",
        "of phonological processes (Finke et al., 1999).",
        "More recent work has integrated phonological features into graphical models (Livescu et al., 2003) and landmark based systems (Juneja and Espy-Wilson, 2004).",
        "The common thread among this research is the notion that acoustic models should be sensitive to sub-phonetic information.",
        "With this trend in phonological representation research, it is time to re-examine some older hypotheses about lexical access and speech processing in order to gain some insight in this current featural renaissance.",
        "Sub-phonetic ASR research is also driven by the fact that deviations from canonical pronunciation and from correct perception of phones is far from random; indeed, there have been a number of studies demonstrating that both of these variations have defined, modelable trends.",
        "Deviations from canonical pronunciation can be described by phonological rules, and errors in perception also tend to conform to phonological patterns.",
        "By and large, confusions occur (at least in humans) between phones with phonological features in common (e.g., (Miller and Nicely, 1955)).",
        "In particular, three features (voicing, manner, and place) have been postulated as relatively invariant (see e.g., (Stevens, 1981), quoted in (Church, 1987)).",
        "It follows from this phonetic detection based on the most reliable features may handle highly variable speech more robustly than systems which demand full identity over all the features for a given phone or phone sequence.",
        "Consequently, a number of researchers have previously suggested using certain broad classes of segments, rather than full phonemic identification, for a first pass on recognition.",
        "For instance, Shipman and Zue (1982), working on large-vocabulary isolated word recognition, used both two-way consonant-vowel distinctions and a six-way distinction based on manner in order to divide their 20,000-word dictionary into “cohorts” or groups of words.",
        "They found that this partial specification of segments reduced the search space of word candidates significantly.",

        "Briscoe (1989) extended this broad-class approach to address the problem of lexical access on connected speech.",
        "However, Briscoe argues against the use of broad, manner-based classes at all times.",
        "He argues that manner cues provide no particular advantage for stressed syllables, but that all cues are sufficiently reliable in stressed syllables to justify a full segmental analysis.",
        "Working with a 30,000- word lexicon, Briscoe shows that the manner-based broad classes for weak (reduced) syllables, together with full identification of strong (unreduced) syllables constrained the set of possible candidates satisfactorily.",
        "Unfortunately, he only provides results for one sentence from his corpus.",
        "This approach proposes to adjust the granularity of recognition dynamically, depending on the stress level of the current syllable.",
        "The details of how this would be managed are left somewhat vague.",
        "As it stands, it would seem to depend crucially on first detecting the stress of each frame, so as to determine which alphabet of symbols to apply to incoming input.",
        "Alternatively, it could recognize the broad class as a first pass, and then refine this into a full phonemic analysis for stressed syllables in a second pass, at the cost of multiplying passes through the speech data.",
        "It is not possible in this system to recover from the miscategorization of stress.",
        "One possible remedy is to bypass a hard decision on stress and run both a manner-based broad-class detector and a traditional phonemic system in parallel.",
        "These then may be combined according to the probability of lexical stress, such that those frames judged less likely to be stressed weight the broad-class analysis more heavily, and those judged more likely to be stressed weight the narrow phonemic analysis more heavily.",
        "Its advantage is that a full phonemic analysis is recoverable for each frame and phone, but those in weak syllables (and hence less likely to be accurate) weigh in less heavily.",
        "Briscoe’s analysis is in terms of lexical access activations: taking a cue from the lexical access community, he assumes that any “partially activated” word (e.g., “boat” and “both” being active after processing “bo”) will contribute linearly to the processing time in ASR.",
        "However, most large-vocabulary ASR systems today use a tree-based lexicon where common phonetic prefixes of words are processed only once, thus invalidating this conjecture.",
        "Briscoe experimented with several triggers for starting a new word – at every phone, at the beginnings of syllables, at the beginnings of syllables with unreduced vowels, and at the beginnings of word boundaries.",
        "However, the latter three require oracle information as to where word or syllable boundaries can occur.",
        "A more appropriate measure commensurate with current ASR practice would be to only allow words to start where a previous word hypothesis ends.",
        "In the remainder of the paper, we seek to validate (or invalidate) Briscoe’s claim that a hybrid phonetic and feature model is appropriate for ASR processing.",
        "In the 15 years since Briscoe’s paper, the ASR community has developed large phonetically transcribed corpora and more advanced computational tools (such as the AT&T Finite-State Toolkit (Mohri et al., 2001)) that we can apply to this problem."

        "(Note that this is an inverse correlation.)",
        "This describes the static discriminability of the lexicon: systems that have words with the same lexical representation will not be able to discriminate between these two words acoustically and must rely on the language model to discriminate between them.",
        "Before proceeding, it may useful to set upper and lower bounds for this exercise (Table 1).",
        "An obvious upper bound is the full phonemic disambiguation of every word.",
        "Of the 6247 words in the dictionary, 6152 unique pronunciations are found (a few cohorts consisting of sets of homophones).",
        "A convenient lower bound is the lexical stress pattern of the word, devoid of any segmental information: e.g., “unidirectional” has its stress on the 4th of 6 syllables; hence, 000100 is its lexical-stress profile.",
        "84 unique lexical-stress profiles exist in the dictionary.",
        "Between these two bounds, three variant broad-class partitions were explored for isolated word recognition.",

        "The first, with no additional segmental information, produces 4709 distinct cohorts.",
        "The second adds a consonant-vowel (CV) profile for the unstressed syllables, which boosts the number of distinct cohorts to 5609.",
        "The final partition replaces the CV profile with a six-class manner-based broad-class partition (Nasals, Stops, Fricatives, Glides, Liquids, and Vowels).",
        "Including a manner-class representation for unstressed vowels increases the number of cohorts to 6076, which is very close to the upper bound.",

        "As a side experiment, we have shown that very basic methods provide encouraging results (only sketched here due to space constraints).",
        "We re-annotated TIMIT with lexical stress markings, where all frames of each stressed syllable (including onset and coda consonants, not just the nucleus) were marked as stressed.",

        "MLP output was greater than 0.9, a precision of 89% was obtained (recall: 20%).",
        "While far from perfect, this result strongly suggests that even very simple methods can predict lexical stress fairly reasonably.",

        "However, our analysis shows that the argument for this hypothesis plays out along very different lines than in Briscoe’s study.",
        "A hybrid phone-manner lexicon can theoretically benefit ASR because (a) the discriminative power of the lexicon is not reduced greatly, (b) such a representation is a much better model of the types of pronunciation variation seen in spontaneous speech corpora such as Switchboard, and (c) the theoretical average hypothesis space increases only by a little over a factor of 2.",
        "This last fact is contrary to Briscoe’s finding that the search space would be reduced because it incorporates more realistic assumptions about the detection of stressed versus unstressed syllables.",
        "These experiments were designed primarily to investigate the validity of Briscoe’s claims, and thus we attempted to remain true to his model.",
        "However, it is clear that our analysis can be extended in several ways.",
        "We have begun experimenting with pruning the hypothesis graph to remove unlikely arcs – this would give a more accurate model of the ASR processing that would occur.",
        "However, this only makes sense if language model constraints are integrated into the processing, since some word sequences in the graph would be discarded as unlikely.",
        "This analysis could also benefit from a more accurate model of the ASR system’s transformation between realized phones and lexical representations.",
        "This could be achieved by comparing the Gaussian acoustic model distributions in an HMM system or sampling the acoustic model’s space (McAllaster et al., 1998).",
        "Both of these extensions will be considered in future work.",
