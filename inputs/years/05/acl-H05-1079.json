        "Recognising textual entailment (RTE) is the task to find out whether some text T entails a hypothesis H. This task has recently been the focus of a challenge organised by the PASCAL network in 2004/5.1 In Example 1550 H follows from T whereas this is not the case in Example 731.",
        "T: In 1998, the General Assembly of the Nippon Sei Ko Kai (Anglican Church in Japan) voted to accept female priests.",

        "T: The city Tenochtitlan grew rapidly and was the center of the Aztec’s great empire.",
        "H: Tenochtitlan quickly spread over the island, marshes, and swamps.",
        "The recognition of textual entailment is without doubt one of the ultimate challenges for any NLP system: if it is able to do so with reasonable accuracy, it is clearly an indication that it has some thorough understanding of how language works.",
        "Indeed, recognising entailment bears similarities to Turing’s famous test to assess whether machines can think, as access to different sources of knowledge and the ability to draw inferences seem to be among the primary ingredients for an intelligent system.",
        "Moreover, many NLP tasks have strong links to entailment: in summarisation, a summary should be entailed by the text; paraphrases can be seen as mutual entailment between T and H; in IE, the extracted information should also be entailed by the text.",
        "In this paper, we discuss two methods for recognising textual entailment: a shallow method relying mainly on word overlap (Section 2), and deep semantic analysis, using state-of-the-art off-the-shelf inference tools, namely a theorem prover and a model builder (Section 3).",
        "These tools rely on Discourse Representation Structures for T and H as well as lexical and world knowledge.",
        "To our knowledge, few approaches to entailment currently use theorem provers and none incorporate model building (see",
        "Section 5 for a discussion of related work).",
        "Both methods are domain-independent to increase transferrability and have not been tailored to any particular test suite.",
        "In Section 4 we test their accuracy and robustness on the RTE datasets as one of the few currently available datasets for textual inference.",
        "We also combine the two methods in a hybrid approach using machine learning.",
        "We discuss particularly the following questions:",
        "• Can the methods presented improve significantly over the baseline and what are the performance differences between them?",
        "Does the hybrid system using both shallow and deep semantic analysis improve over the individual use of these methods?",
        "• How far does deep semantic analysis suffer from a lack of lexical and world knowledge and how can we perform logical inference in the face of potentially large knowledge gaps?",

        "No word sense disambiguation is performed and all synsets for a particular lemma are considered.",

        "This ensures that wnoverlap is always a real number between 0 and 1 and also ensures independence of the length of the hypothesis.",
        "Apart from wnoverlap we take into account length (as measured by number of lemmas) of text and hypothesis, because in most of the observed cases for true entailments the hypothesis is shorter than the text as it contains less information.",

In contrast, if T does not entail H, H normally introduce some new information (except when it contains negated information), and this will be reflected in the domain size of T+H, which then is larger than the domain size of T.

        "The basic idea of our deep analysis, using a detailed semantic analysis and first-order inference, goes back to (Blackburn and Bos, 2005).",
        "It is similar to some of the recent approaches that were proposed in the context of the PASCAL RTE workshop, i.e. using the OTTER theorem prover (Akhmatova, 2005; Fowler et al., 2005), using EPILOG (Bayer et al., 2005), or abduction (Raina et al., 2005).",
        "None of these systems, however, incorporate model building as a central part of the inference mechanism.",
        "We have shown that solely relying on theorem proving is normally insufficient due to low recall, and that using model builders is a promising way to approximate entailment.",
        "Results of other approaches to determining textual entailment indicate that it is an extremely hard",
        "task.",
        "The aforementioned RTE workshop revealed that participating systems reached accuracy figures ranging between 0.50 and 0.59 and cws scores between 0.50 and 0.69 (Dagan et al., 2005).",
        "Comparing this with our own results (accuracy 0.61 and cws 0.65) shows how well our systems performs on the same data set.",
        "This is partly due to our hybrid approach which is more robust across different datasets."

        "Relying on theorem proving as a technique for determining textual entailment yielded high precision but low recall due to a general lack of appropriate background knowledge.",
        "We used model building as an innovative technique to surmount this problem to a certain extent.",
        "Still, it will be unavoidable to incorporate automatic methods for knowledge acquisition to increase the performance of our approach.",
        "Future work will be directed to the acquisition of targeted paraphrases that can be converted into background knowledge in the form of axioms.",
        "Our hybrid approach combines shallow analysis with both theorem proving and model building and achieves high accuracy scores on the RTE dataset compared to other systems that we are aware of.",
        "The results for this approach also indicate that (a) the choice of entailment recognition methods might have to vary according to the dataset design and/or application and (b) that a method that wants to achieve robust performance across different datasets might need the integration of several different entailment recognition methods as well as an indicator of design methodology or application.",
        "Thus, although test suites establish a controlled way of assessing textual entailment detection systems, the importance of being able to predict textual entailment in NLP might be better justified using task-based evaluation.",
        "This can be achieved by incorporating them in QA or summarisation systems.",
        "Acknowledgements We would like to thank Mirella La-pata and Malvina Nissim as well as three anonymous reviewers for their comments on this paper.",
        "We are also grateful to Valentin Jijkoun and Bonnie Webber for discussion and Steve Clark and James Curran for help on using the CCG-parser."
