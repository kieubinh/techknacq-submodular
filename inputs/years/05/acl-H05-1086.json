        "Sentence retrieval is the task of retrieving a relevant sentence in response to a user's query.",
        "Tasks such as question answering, novelty detection and summarization often incorporate a sentence retrieval module.",
        "In previous work we examined sentence retrieval for question answering (Murdock and Croft, 2004).",
        "This involves the comparison of two well-formed sentences, one a question, one a statement.",
        "In this work we compare well-formed sentences to queries, which can be typical keyword queries of 1 to 3 terms, or a set of sentences or sentence fragments.",
        "The TREC Novelty Track provides this type of data in the form of topic titles and descriptions, and sentence-level relevance judgments for a small subset of the collection.",
        "We present a translation model specifically for monolingual data, and show that it significantly improves sentence retrieval over query-likelihood.",
        "Translation models train on a parallel corpus and in previous work we used a corpus of question/answer pairs.",
        "No such corpus is available for the novelty data, so in this paper we present four ways to construct a parallel corpus, to estimate a translation model.",
        "Many systems treat sentence retrieval as a type of document or passage retrieval.",
        "In our data a sentence is an average of 18 words, most of which occur once.",
        "A document is an average of 700 words, many of which are multiples of the same term.",
        "It is much less likely for a word and its synonym terms to appear in the same sentence than in the same document.",
        "Passages may be any length, either fixed or variable, but are somewhat arbitrarily designated.",
        "Many systems that have a passage retrieval module, on closer inspection have defined the passage to be a sentence.",
        "What is needed is a sentence retrieval mechanism that retains the benefits of passage retrieval, where a passage is longer than a sentence.",
        "We propose that smoothing from the local context of the sentence improves retrieval over the query likelihood baseline, and the larger the context, the greater the improvement.",
        "We describe our translation model in section 2, along with our smoothing approach.",
        "In section 3 we discuss previous work in sentence retrieval for the Novelty task, and translation models for information retrieval tasks.",
        "Section 4 presents four ways to estimate a translation model, in the absence of a parallel corpus, and presents our experimental results.",

        "We retrieved the top 1000 documents for each topic from the TREC and Aquaint collections, and sentence segmented the documents using MXTerminator (Reynar and Rat-naparkhi, 1997), which is a freely available sentence boundary detector.",
        "Each topic was indexed separately and had an average of 30,000 sentences.",
        "It was impractical to do sentence-level relevance assessments for the complete set of 150,000 documents, so we used the relevance assessments provided as part of the Novelty task, recognizing that the results are a lower bound on performance, because the relevance assessments do not cover the collection.",
        "The relevance assessments cover 25 known relevant documents for each topic.",
        "We evaluated precision at N documents because many systems using sentence retrieval emphasize the results at the top of the ranked list, and are less concerned with the overall quality of the list."

        "A major difference between machine translation and sentence retrieval is that machine translation assumes there is little, if any, overlap in the vocabularies of the two languages.",
        "In sentence retrieval we depend heavily on the overlap between the two vocabularies.",
        "With the Berger and Lafferty formulation in equation 1, the probability of a word translating to itself is estimated as a fraction of the probability of the word translating to all other words.",
        "Because the probabilities must sum to one, if there are any other translations for a given word, its self-translation probability will be less than 1.0.",
