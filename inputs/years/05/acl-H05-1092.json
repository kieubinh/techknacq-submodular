        "The goal of this paper is to address this difficult and important task, the extraction of the interactions between proteins from free text.",
        "We use graphical models and a neural net that were found to achieve high accuracy in the related task of extracting the relation types might hold between the entities “treatment” and “disease” (Rosario and Hearst, 2004).",
        "Labeling training and test data is time-consuming and subjective.",
        "Here we report on results using an existing curated database, the HIV-1 Human Protein Interaction Database1, to train and test the classification system.",
        "The accuracies obtained by the classification models proposed are quite high, confirming the validity of the approach.",
        "We also find support for the hypothesis that the sentences surrounding citations are useful for extraction of key information from technical articles (Nakov et al., 2004).",

        "There has been little work in general NLP on trying to identify different relations between entities.",
        "Many papers that claim to be doing relationship recognition in actuality address the task of role extraction: (usually two) entities are identified and the relationship is implied by the co-occurrence of these entities or by some linguistic expression (Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Zelenko et al., 2002).",
        "The ACE competition2 has a relation recognition subtask, but assumes a particular type of relation holds between particular entity types (e.g., if the two entities in question are an EMP and an ORG, then an employment relation holds between them; which type of employment relation depends on the type of entity, e.g., staff person vs partner).",
        "In the BioNLP literature there have recently been a number of attempts to automatically extract protein-protein interactions from PubMed abstracts.",
        "Some approaches simply report that a relation exists between two proteins but do not determine which relation holds (Bunescu et al., 2005; Marcotte et al., 2001; Ramani et al., 2005), while most others start with a list of interaction verbs and label only those sentences that contain these trigger words (Blaschke and Valencia, 2002; Blaschke et al., 1999; Rind-flesch et al., 1999; Thomas et al., 2000; Sekimizu et al., 1998; Ahmed et al., 2005; Phuong et al., 2003; Pustejovsky et al., 2002).",
        "However, as Marcotte et al.",
        "(2001) note, “... searches for abstracts containing relevant keywords, such as interact*, poorly discriminate true hits from abstracts using the words in alternate senses and miss abstracts using different language to describe the interactions.” Most of the existing methods also suffer from low recall because they use hand-built specialized templates or patterns (Ono et al., 2001; Corney et al., 2004).",
        "Some systems use link grammars in conjunction with trigger verbs instead of templates (Ahmed et al., 2005; Phuong et al., 2003).",
        "Every paper evaluates on a different test set, and so it is quite difficult to compare systems.",
        "In this paper, we use state-of-the-art machine learning methods to determine the interaction types and to extract the proteins involved.",

        "specifying the type of interactions.",
        "In this database, the definitions of the interactions depend on the proteins involved and the articles describing the interactions; thus there are several definitions for each interaction type.",
        "For the interaction bind and the proteins ANT and Vpr, we find (among others) the definition “Interaction of HIV1 Vpr with human adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) is presumed based on a specific binding interaction between Vpr and rat ANT.” The database contains 65 types of interactions and 809 proteins for which there is interaction information, for a total of 2224 pairs of interacting proteins.",
        "For each documented protein-protein interaction the database includes information about:",
        "• A pair of proteins (PP), • The interaction type(s) between them (I), and • PubMed identification numbers of the journal article(s) describing the interaction(s) (A).",
        "A protein pair PP can have multiple interactions (for example, AIP1 binds to HIV-1 p6 and also is incorporated into it) for an average of 1.9 interactions per PP and a maximum of 23 interactions for the pair CDK9 and tat p 14.",
        "We refer to the combination of a protein pair PP and an article A as a “triple.” Our goal is to automatically associate to each triple an interaction have been assigned the same type of interaction (aggregation).",

        "Journal articles can contain evidence for multiple interactions: there are 984 journal articles in the database and on average each article is reported to contain evidence for 5.9 triples (with a maximum number of 90 triples).",
        "In some cases the database reports multiple different interactions for a given triple.",
        "There are 5369 unique triples in the database and of these 414 (7.7%) have multiple interactions.",
        "We exclude these triples from our analysis; however, we do include articles and PPs with multiple interactions.",
        "In other words, we tackle cases such as the example above of the pair AIP1, HIV-1-p6 (that can both bind and incorporate) as long as the evidence for the different interactions is given by two different articles.",
        "Some of the interactions differ only in the directionality (e.g., regulates and regulated by, inhibits and inhibited by, etc.",
        "); we collapsed these pairs of related interactions into one5.",
        "Table 1 shows the list of the 25 interactions of the HIV-1 database for which there are more than 10 triples.",
        "For these interactions and for a random subset of the protein pairs PP (around 45% of the total pairs in the database), we downloaded the corresponding full-text papers.",
        "From these, we extracted all and only those sentences that contain both proteins from the indicated protein pair.",
        "We assigned each of these sentences the corresponding interaction I from the database (“papers”).",
        "Nakov et al.",
        "(2004) argue that the sentences surrounding citations to related work, or citances, are a useful resource for bioNLP.",
        "Building on that work, we use citances as an additional form of evidence to determine protein-protein interaction types.",
        "For a given database entry containing PubMed article A, 4T o be precise, there are for this PP (as there are often) multiple articles (three in this case) describing the interaction binds, thus we have the following three triples to which we associate binds: “AIP1 HIV-1-p6 14519844,” “AIP1 HIV-1-p6 14505570” and “AIP1 HIV-1-p6 14505569.” 5We collapsed these pairs because the directionality of the interactions was not always reliable in the database.",
        "This implies that for some interactions, we are not able to infer the different roles of the two proteins; we considered only the pair “prot1 prot2” or “prot2 prot1,” not both.",

        "protein pair PP, and interaction type I, we downloaded a subset of the papers that cite A.",

        "We labeled each of these sentences with interaction type I (“citances”).",
        "There are often many different names for the same protein.",
        "We use LocusLink6 protein identification numbers and synonym names for each protein, and extract the sentences that contain an exact match for (some synonym of) each protein.",
        "By being conservative with protein name matching, and by not doing co-reference analysis, we miss many candidate sentences; however this method is very precise.",
        "On average, for “papers,” we extracted 0.5 sentences per triple (maximum of 79) and 50.6 sentences per interaction (maximum of 119); for “citances” we extracted 0.4 sentences per triple (with a maximum of 105) and 49.2 sentences per interaction (162 maximum).",
        "We required a minimum number (40) of sentences for each interaction type for both “papers” and “citances”; the 10 interactions of Table 2 met this requirement.",
        "We used these sentences to train and test the models described below7.",
        "Since all the sentences extracted from one triple are assigned the same interaction, we ensured that sentences from the same triple did not appear in both the testing and the training sets.",
        "Roughly 75% of the data were used for training and the rest for testing.",
        "As mentioned above the goal is to automatically associate to each triple an interaction type.",
        "The task tackled here is actually slightly more difficult: given some sentences extracted from article A, assign to A an interaction type I and extract the proteins PP involved.",
        "In other words, for the purpose of classification, we act as if we do not have information about the proteins that interact.",
        "However, given the way the sentence extraction was done, all the sentences extracted from A contain the PP.",
        "A hand-assessment of the individual sentences shows that not every sentence that mentions the target proteins PP actually describes the interaction I (see Section 5.4).",
        "Thus the evaluation on the test set is done at the document level (to determine if the algorithm can predict the interaction that a curator would assign to a document as a whole given the protein pair).",
