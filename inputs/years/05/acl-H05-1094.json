        "Many tasks in natural language processing are solved by chaining errorful subtasks.",
        "Within information extraction, for example, part-of-speech tagging and shallow parsing are often performed before the main extraction task.",
        "Commonly these subtasks have their own standard sets of labeled training data: for example, many large data sets exist for learning to extract person names from newswire text; whereas the available training data for new applications, such as extracting appointment information from email, tends to be much smaller.",
        "Thus, we need to transfer regularities learned from a well-studied subtask, such as finding person names in newswire text, to a new, related task, such as finding names of speakers in email seminar announcements.",
        "In previous NLP systems, transfer is often accomplished by training a model for the subtask, and using its prediction as a feature for the new task.",
        "For example, recent CoNLL shared tasks (Tjong Kim Sang & De Meulder, 2003; Carreras & Marquez, 2004), which are standard data sets for such common NLP tasks as clause identification and named-entity recognition, include predictions from a part-of-phrase tagger and a shallow parser as features.",
        "But including only the single most likely subtask prediction fails to exploit useful dependencies between the tasks.",
        "First, if the subtask prediction is wrong, the model for the new task may not be able to recover.",
        "Often, errors propagate upward through the chain of tasks, causing errors in the final output.",
        "This problem can be ameliorated by preserving uncertainty in the subtask predictions, because even if the best subtask prediction is wrong, the distribution over predictions can still be somewhat accurate.",
        "Second, information from the main task can inform the subtask.",
        "This is especially important for learning transfer, because the new domain often has different characteristics than the old domain, which is often a standard benchmark data set.",
        "For example, named-entity recognizers are usually trained on newswire text, which is more structured and grammatical than email, so we expect an off-the-shelf named-entity recognizer to perform somewhat worse on email.",
        "An email task, however, often has domain-specific features, such as PREVIOUS WORD IS Speaker:), which were unavailable or uninformative to the subtask on the old training set, but are very informative to the subtask in the new domain.",
        "While previous work in transfer learning has considered how the old task can help the new task, in this paper we show how the new task can help itself by improving predictions on the old.",
        "In this paper we address the issue of transfer by training a cascade of models independently on the various training sets, but at test time combining them into a single model in which decoding is performed jointly.",
        "For the individual models, we use linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs), because the great freedom that they allow in feature engineering facilitates the learning of richer interactions between the subtasks.",
        "We train a linear chain CRF on each subtask, using the prediction of the previous subtask as a feature.",
        "At test time, we combine the learned weights from the original CRFs into a single grid-shaped factorial CRF, which makes predictions for all the tasks",

        "We evaluate joint decoding for learning transfer on a standard email data set and a standard entity recognition task.",
        "On the email data set, we show a significant gain in performance, including new state-of-the-art results.",
        "Of particular interest for transfer learning, we also show that using joint decoding, we achieve equivalent results to cascaded decoding with 25% less training data."

        "A linear-chain CRF defines a distribution over state sequences s = 181,82,...,ST} given an input sequence X = IX 1, x2i ... , XT by making a first-order Markov assumption on states.",
        "These Markov assumptions imply that the distribution over sequences factorizes in terms of pairwise functions 4>t(st-1i st, x) as:",
        "The potential functions 4>t(st-1, st, x) can be interpreted as the cost of making a transition from state st-1 to state st at time t, similar to a transition probability in an HMM.",

        "By exploiting Markov assumptions, however, Z(x) (as well as the node marginals p(st Ix) and the Viterbi labeling) can be calculated efficiently by variants of the standard dynamic programming algorithms used for HMMs.",
        "We assume the potentials factorize according to a set of features {f k }, which are given and fixed, so that",
        "The model parameters are a set of real weights A = {Ak }, one for each feature.",

        "The chief practical advantage of conditional models, in fact, is that we can include arbitrary highly-dependent features without needing to estimate their distribution, as would be required to learn a generative model.",
        "Given fully-labeled training instances { (sj , xj) } M ��i , CRF training is usually performed by maximizing the penalized log likelihood",
        "where the final term is a zero-mean Gaussian prior placed on parameters to avoid overfitting.",

        "Exact inference in a jointly-trained model, such as forward-backward in an FCRF, implicitly considers all possible subtask predictions with confidence given by the model’s probability of the prediction.",

        "Even with cascaded training, it is possible to preserve some uncertainty in the subtask’s predictions.",

        "For example, Miller et al.",
        "report that they originally attempted to annotate newswire articles for all of parsing, relations, and named entities, but they stopped because the annotation was simply too expensive.",
        "Instead they hand-labeled relations only, assigning parse trees to the training set using a standard statistical parser, which is potentially less flexible than the cascaded training, because the model for main task is trained explicitly to match the noisy subtask predictions, rather than being free to correct them.",
        "In the speech community, it is common to compose separately trained weighted finite-state transducers (Mohri et al., 2002) for joint decoding.",
        "Our method extends this work to conditional models.",
        "Ordinarily, higher-level transducers depend only on the output of the previous transducer: a transducer for the lexicon, for example, consumes only phonemes, not the original speech signal.",
        "In text, however, such an approach is not sensible, because there is simply not enough information in the named-entity labels, for example, to do extraction if the original words are discarded.",
        "In a conditional model, weights in higher-level transducers are free to depend on arbitrary features of the original input without any additional complexity in the finite-state structure.",
        "Finally, stacked sequential learning (Cohen & Car-valho, 2005) is another potential method for combining the results of the subtask transducers.",
        "In this general meta-learning method for sequential classification, first a base classifier predicts the label at each time step, and then a higher-level classifier makes the final prediction, including as features a window of predictions from the base classifier.",
        "For transfer learning, this would correspond to having an independent base model for each subtask (e.g., independent CRFs for named-entity and seminars), and then having a higher-level CRF that includes as a feature the predictions from the base models.",
        "8 Conclusion In this paper we have shown that joint decoding improves transfer between interdependent NLP tasks, even when the old task is named-entity recognition, for which highly accurate systems exist.",
