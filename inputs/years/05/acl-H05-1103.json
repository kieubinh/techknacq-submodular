        "First, they are selected to match the reading level of the student (Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004).",
        "They must also have vocabulary terms known to the student.",
        "To meet this goal, it is necessary to construct an accurate model of the student’s vocabulary knowledge (Brown and Eskenazi, 2004).",
        "Using this model, the system can locate documents that include a given percentage (e.g., 95%) of words that are known to the student.",
        "The remaining percentage (e.g. 5%) consists of new words that the student needs to learn.",
        "This percentage is controlled so that there is not so much stretch in the document that the student cannot focus their attention on understanding the new words and the meaning of the text.",
        "After reading the text, the student’s understanding of new words is assessed.",
        "The student’s responses are used to update the student model, to support retrieval of furture documents that take into account the changes in student word knowledge.",

        "We also report results from a study that was designed to assess the validity of the generated questions.",
        "In addition to the importance of these assessments in the REAP system, tests of word knowledge are central to research on reading and language and are of practical importance for student placement and in enabling teachers to track improvements in word knowledge throughout the school year.",
        "Because tests such as these are traditionally hand-written, development is time-consuming and often relies on methods that are informal and subjective.",
        "The research described here addresses these issues through development of automated, explicit methods for generation of vocabulary tests.",
        "In addition, these tools are designed to capture the graded and complex nature of word knowledge, allowing for more fine-grained assessment of word learning."

        "In this paper, we focus on knowledge of conceptual word meaning.",
        "Because word meaning itself is complex, our focus is not simply on all-or-none estimates of vocabulary knowledge, but also on graded and incomplete knowledge of meanings that readers possess for different words and at different stages of acquisition.",
        "Several models have been proposed to account for these multiple levels of word knowledge.",
        "For example, Dale posited four stages of knowledge of word meaning (Dale and O’Rourke, 1965).",
        "In stage 1, the subject has never seen the word.",
        "In stage 2, she has seen the word but is unable to verbalize its meaning.",
        "In stage 3, the subject recognizes the word in a given context and has partial word knowledge.",
        "In stage 4, the subject has full word knowledge, and can explain the word meaning so that its usage is clear in multiple contexts.",
        "Stahl (1986) proposed a similar model of word knowledge, the levels of which overlap with Dale’s last two stages.",
        "According to this model, the first level is characterized by association processing, or the passive association of the new word meaning with other, familiar concepts.",
        "The second level, comprehension processing, involves active comprehension of the word in a particular context.",
        "The third level, generation processing, requires usage of a word in a novel context reflecting a deep (and multidimensional) understanding of its meaning.",
        "Taking Stahl’s framework as a working model, we constructed multiple types of vocabulary questions designed to assess different “stages” or “levels” of word knowledge."

        "In order to retrieve data from WordNet, we must choose the correct sense of the word.",
        "The system can work with input of varying specificity.",
        "The most specific case is when we have all the data: the word itself and a number indicating the sense of the word with respect to WordNet’s synsets.",
        "When the target words are known beforehand and the word list is short enough, the intended sense can be hand-annotated.",
        "More often, however, the input is comprised of just the target word and its part of speech (POS).",

        "In the REAP system, where the user has just read a specific text, the words of the document were already automatically POS annotated.",
        "When there is only one sense of the word per part of speech, we can simply select the correct sense of the word in WordNet.",
        "Otherwise, we select the most frequently used sense of the word with the correct POS, using WordNet’s frequency data.",
        "If we have only the word, we select the most frequent sense, ignoring part of speech.",
        "Future work will use word sense disambiguation techniques to automatically determine the correct word sense given a document that includes the target word, as in REAP (Brown and Eskenazi, 2004).",
        "Once the system has determined the word sense, it can retrieve data from WordNet for each of the 6 question types.",
        "The definition question requires a definition of the word, available in WordNet’s gloss for the chosen sense.",
        "The system chooses the first definition which does not include the target word.",
        "This question should provide evidence for the first of Stahl’s three levels, association processing, although this was not explicitly evaluated.",
        "The synonym question has the testee match the target word to a synonym.",
        "The system can extract this synonym from WordNet using two methods.",
        "One method is to select words that belong to the same synset as the target word and are thus synonyms.",
        "In addition, the synonym relation in WordNet may connect this synset to another synset, and all the words in the latter are acceptable synonyms.",
        "The system prefers words in the synset to those in synonym synsets.",
        "It also restricts synonyms to single words and to words which are not morphological variants of the target word.",
        "When more than one word satisfies all criteria, the most frequently used synonym is chosen, since this should make the question easier.",
        "This question could be considered either association processing or comprehension processing.",
        "If the testee has seen this synonym (e.g. as a hint), this question type would require association processing as a word is simply being associated with another already-presented word.",
        "Otherwise, this may require comprehension processing – understanding beyond memorization.",
        "The antonym question requires matching a word with an antonymous word.",
        "WordNet provides two kinds of relations that can be used to procure antonyms: direct and indirect antonyms.",
        "Direct antonyms are antonyms of the target word, whereas indirect antonyms are direct antonyms of a synonym of the target.",
        "The words “fast” and “slow” are direct antonyms of one another.",
        "The word “quick” does not have a direct antonym, but it does have an indirect antonym, “slow”, via “fast”, its synonym.",
        "When more than one antonym is available, the most frequently used is chosen.",

        "The example sentence or phrase is retrieved from the gloss for a specific word sense in WordNet.",
        "There is often more than one example phrase.",

        "Passages using the target word are preferred, although examples for any of the words in the synset are appropriate.",
        "The present word is replaced by a blank in the cloze question phrase.",
        "Some consider a cloze question to be more difficult than any of the other question types, but it is still expected to provide evidence for Stahl’s second level.",
        "Although our question types provide evidence for the highest level of schemes such as Dale’s four stages, they do not provide evidence for Stahl’s highest level, generation processing, where the testee must, for instance, write a sentence using the word in a personalized context.",
        "We expect questions that provide evidence of this level to require free-form or near-free-form responses, which we do not yet allow.",

        "For the definition version, each of the items below the wordbank is a definition.",

        "Depending on the question type, the target word may appear in either the stem or the answer choices.",
        "For the definition question type, the stem holds the definition of the target word and one of the answer choices is the target word.",
        "For the word “verbose”, the stem would be “using or containing too many words” and the choices “ancillary”, “churlish”, “verbose”, and “convivial”.",
        "The cloze question is of a similar form, with the stem containing the example sentence or phrase with a blank where the target word should be used.",
        "For “verbose”, we have the stem “___ and ineffective instructional methods” and choices “verbose”, “incipient”, “invidious”, and “titular”.",
        "For the synonym, antonym, hypernym, and hyponym questions, the target word appears in the stem instead of the answer choices.",
        "The synonym question for the word “verbose” would have the stem “Select the word that is most similar in meaning to the word verbose” with choices “inflammable”, “piping”, matrilineal”, and “long-winded”.",
        "The antonym question would have the stem “Select the word that is most opposite in meaning to the word verbose” and the choices “discernable”, “concise”, “unbroken”, and “soused”.",
        "Figure 2 shows a formatted example of an automatically generated multiple-choice cloze question for the word “obdurate”.",
        "Two issues to consider when creating multiple-choice format questions are the wording or appearance of the questions and the criteria for selection of distractors.",
        "We followed the guidelines for good multiple-choice questions described by researchers such as Graesser and Wisher (2001).",
        "In accord with these guidelines, our questions had 4 choices, although the number of choices is a variable supplied to the question generation software.",
        "We also considered the most appropriate wording for these questions, leading us to choose stems such as “Select the word that is most similar in meaning to the word plausible” for the synonym question rather than “Choose the word that means the same as the word plausible.” The latter would be problematic when the correct answer is a near-synonym rather than a word with precisely the same meaning.",
        "Concerning distractor choice, the question generation system chooses distractors of the same part of speech and similar frequency to the correct answer, as recommended by Coniam (1997).",
        "For the synonym, antonym, hypernym, and hyponym questions, the correct answer is the highest frequency word of all the words chosen from WordNet that satisfy all the criteria.",
        "Thus, the distractors are of the same POS and similar frequency to the synonym, antonym, or whatever word is the correct answer, as opposed to the target word.",
        "The system chooses distractors from Kilgarriff’s (1995) word frequency database, based on the British National Corpus (BNC) (Burnage, 1991).",
        "The system chooses 20 words from this database that are of the same POS and are equal or similar in frequency to the correct answer, and randomly chooses the distractors from these words.",
        "Since the distractors may be different for each run of the question generation software, slightly different versions of the same basic question may appear.",
        "The words of the BNC and the word frequency database have been POS tagged using the CLAWS tagger (Leech, 1994).",
        "This tagger uses detailed POS tags, enabling us to choose distractors that are, for instance,",
        "verbs in the past tense, when the correct answer is such as verb, instead of selecting verbs of unknown tense.",
        "In the definition and cloze questions, the correct answer is the target word itself, so distractors are chosen based on this word.",
        "The system also restricts distractors to be in the list of target words so that the testee cannot simply choose the word that appears in the stems of other questions.",
        "An alternate multiple-choice question format is used when the testee has just read a document using the target word, as in the REAP system (Brown and Eskenazi, 2004).",
        "In this case, the system also attempts to finds words which may be semantically related to the correct answer, as in (Nagy, 1985).",
        "This is done by choosing distractors that satisfy the standard criteria and were present in the document.",
        "This should increase the chance that the distractors are semantically related and eliminate the chance that a testee will simply select as the correct answer the word that appeared in the document they just read, without understanding the word meaning."

        "For example, the stem could be “The music was so lenitive...,” with the correct answer “...it was tempting to lie back and go to sleep,” and with distractors such as “...it took some concentration to appreciate the complexity.” The fifth question type was based on the Osgood semantic differential, a factor-analytic model of word-level semantic dimensions (Osgood, 1970).",
        "Numerous studies using the Osgood paradigm have shown that variability in the semantic “structure” of word meanings can largely be accounted for in terms of three dimensions, valence (good–bad), potency (strong–weak), and activity (active–passive).",

        "Thus, both the computer and human-generated questions show good correspondence with an external assessment of vocabulary skill.",
        "Correlations between the accuracy on the question types and the Nelson-Denny reading comprehension test were mixed, showing a higher correlation with vocabulary than reading comprehension.",
        "Correlations between the accuracy on the nine question types and the Raven’s Matrices test of nonverbal reasoning were positive, but low and not statistically significant.",
        "This provides strong evidence that the computer-generated vocabulary questions tap vocabulary knowledge specifically, rather than intelligence in general."

        "Cloze tests are one area of related work.",
        "They were originally intended to measure text readability (Taylor, 1953) since native speakers should be able to reproduce certain removed words in a readable text.",
        "Other researchers have used it to assess reading comprehension (Ruddell, 1964), with students filling in the blanks, given a high quality text.",
        "The main issue in automating the creation of cloze tests is determining which words to remove from the text.",
        "Coniam (1997) examined a several options for determining the words to remove and produced relatively good-quality cloze tests by removing words with the same POS or similar frequency.",
        "Wolfe (1976) automatically generated reading comprehension questions.",
        "This involved various techniques for rewriting sentences into questions, testing syntactic understanding of individual sentences.",
        "Of the 50 questions Wolfe was able to generate for a single text, 34 were found to be satisfactory.",
        "More recently, Kunichika (2003) carried out work in automatically generating reading comprehension questions that included both syntactic and semantic questions, and was able to generate several different types of questions, including asking about the content of a sentence, using dictionaries of synonyms and antonyms to generate questions such as “Is Jane busy?” from sentences like “Jane is free.”, and testing semantic understanding across sentence boundaries.",
        "Approx.",
        "93% of the generated questions were found to be satisfactory.",
        "Aist (2001) automatically generated factoids to assist students reading.",
        "The factoids gave a synonym, an antonym, or a hypernym for the word, which were automatically extracted from WordNet.",
        "He also automated the creation of a single type of vocabulary question, with the target word in the stem and the correct answer a synonym, hypernym, or sibling from WordNet.",
        "It is unclear what type of vocabulary knowledge this question would tap, given the different possible answers."

        "Extending our experiments to the question types that we have not yet assessed is an important next step.",
        "In addition, we want to assess questions individually, evaluating their use of distractors.",
        "Finally, we need to assess questions generated on word lists with different characteristics.",
        "There are also a number of ongoing extensions to this project.",
        "One is the creation of new question types to test other aspects of word knowledge.",
        "Another is using other resources such as text collections to enable us to generate more questions per word, especially for the cloze questions.",
        "In addition, we are looking at ways to predict word knowledge using confidence ratings and morphological and semantic cohorts in situations where we cannot perform a standard assessment or cannot test all the vocabulary words we would like to.",
        "In this paper, we have described our work in automatically generating questions for vocabulary assessment.",
        "We have described the six types of computer-generated questions and the forms in which they appear.",
        "Finally, we have presented evidence that the computer-generated questions give a measure of vocabulary skill for individual words that correlates well with human-written questions and standardized assessments of vocabulary skill."
