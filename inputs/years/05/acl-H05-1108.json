      "text": [
        "Shallow semantic parsing, the task of automatically identifying the semantic roles conveyed by sentential constituents, has recently attracted much attention, partly because of its increasing importance for potential applications.",
        "For instance, information extraction (Surdeanu et al., 2003), question answering (Narayanan and Harabagiu, 2004) and machine translation (Boas, 2002) could stand to benefit from broad coverage semantic processing.",
        "The FrameNet project (Fillmore et al., 2003) has played a central role in this endeavour by providing a large lexical resource based on semantic roles.",
        "In FrameNet, meaning is represented by frames, schematic representations of situations.",
        "Semantic roles are frame-specific, and are called frame elements.",
        "The database associates frames with lemmas (verbs, nouns, adjectives) that can evoke them (called frame-evoking elements or FEEs), lists the possible syntactic realisations of their semantic roles, and provides annotated examples from the British National Corpus (Burnard, 1995).",
        "The availability of rich annotations for the surface realisation of semantic roles has triggered interest in semantic parsing and enabled the development of data-driven models (e.g., Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002).",
        "Table 1 illustrates an example from the FrameNet database, the DEPARTING frame.",
        "It has two roles, a THEME which is the moving object and a SOURCE expressing the initial position of the THEME.",
        "The frame elements are realised by different syntactic expressions.",
        "For instance, the THEME is typically an NP, whereas the SOURCE is often expressed by a prepositional phrase (see the expressions in boldface in Table 1).",
        "The DEPARTING frame can be evoked by abandon, desert, depart, and several other verbs as well as nouns (see the list of FEEs in Table 1).",
        "Although recent advances in semantic parsing1 have greatly benefited from the availability of the English FrameNet, unfortunately such resources are largely absent for other languages.",
        "The English FrameNet (Version 1.1) contains 513 frames covering 7,125 lexical items and has been under development for approximately six years.",
        "Although FrameNets are currently under construction for German, Spanish, and Japanese, these resources are still in their infancy and of limited value for modelling purposes.",
        "Methods for acquiring FrameNets from corpora automatically would greatly reduce the human effort involved and facilitate their development for new languages.",
        "In this paper, we propose a method which employs parallel corpora for acquiring frame elements",
        "THEME The officer left the house.",
        "SOURCE The plane leaves at seven.",
        "His departure was delayed.",
        "We departed from New York.",
        "He retreated from his opponent.",
        "The woman left the house.",
        "abandon.v, desert.v, depart.v, departure.n, emerge.v, emigrate.v, emigration.n, escape.v, escape.n, leave.v, quit.v, retreat.v, retreat.n, split.v, withdraw.v, withdrawal.n",
        "and their syntactic realisations (see the upper half of Table 1) for new languages.",
        "Our method leverages the existing English FrameNet to overcome the resource shortage in other languages by exploiting the translational and structural equivalences present in aligned data.",
        "The idea underlying our approach can be summarised as follows: (1) given a pair of sentences E (English) and L (new language) that are translations of each other, annotate E with semantic roles; and then (2) project these roles onto L. In this manner, we induce semantic structure on the L side of the parallel text, which can then serve as data for training a statistical semantic parser for L that is independent of the parallel corpus.",
        "We first assess if the main assumption of semantic projection is warranted (Section 3), namely whether frames and semantic roles exhibit a high degree of parallelism across languages.",
        "Then we propose two broad classes of projection models that utilise lexical and syntactic information (Section 4), and show experimentally that roles can be projected from English onto German with high accuracy (Section 5).",
        "We conclude the paper by discussing the implications of our results and future work (Section 6)."

        "Sample Selection.",
        "To evaluate the output of our projection algorithms, we created a gold standard corpus of English-German sentence pairs with manual FrameNet frame and role annotations.",
        "The sentences were sampled from Europarl (Koehn, 2002), a corpus of professionally translated proceedings of the European Parliament.",
        "Europarl is available in 11 languages with up to 20 million words per language aligned at the document and sentence level.",
        "Recall that frame projection is only meaningful if the same frame is appropriate for both sentences in a projection pair.",
        "This constrains sample selection for two reasons: first, FrameNet is as yet incomplete with respect to its coverage.",
        "So, a randomly selected sentence pair may evoke novel frames or novel senses of already existing frames (e.g., the “greeting” sense of hail which is currently not listed in FrameNet).",
        "Second, due to translational variance, there is no a priori guarantee that words which are mutual translations evoke the same frame.",
        "For example, the English verb finish is often translated in German by the adverb abschließend, which arguably cannot have a role set identical to finish.",
        "Relying solely on the English FrameNet database for sampling would yield many sentence pairs which are either inappropriate for the present study (because they do not evoke the same frames) or simply problematic for annotation since they are outside the",
        "present coverage of the database.",
        "For the above reasons, our sample selection procedure was informed by two existing resources, the English FrameNet and SALSA, a FrameNet-compatible database for German currently under development (Erk et al., 2003).",
        "We first used the publicly available GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) software to induce English-German word alignments.",
        "Next, we gathered all German-English sentences in the corpus that had at least one pair of aligned words (we7wg), which were listed in FrameNet and SALSA, respectively, and had at least one frame in common.",
        "These sentences exemplify 83 frame types, 696 lemma pairs, and 265 unique English and 178 unique German lemmas.",
        "Sentence pairs were grouped into three bands according to their frame frequency (High, Medium, Low).",
        "We randomly selected 380 pairs from each band.",
        "The total sample consisted of ,140 sentence pairs.",
        "This procedure produces a realistic corpus sample for the role projection task; similar samples can be drawn for new language pairs using either existing bilingual dictionaries (Fung and Chen, 2004) or automatically constructed semantic lexicons (Padó and Lapata, 2005).",
        "Annotation.",
        "Two annotators, with native-level proficiency in German and English, manually labelled the parallel corpus with semantic information.",
        "Their task was to identify the frame for a given predicate in a sentence, and assign the corresponding roles.",
        "They were provided with detailed guidelines that explained the task using multiple examples.",
        "During annotation, they had access to parsed versions of the sentences in question (see Section 5 for details), and to the English FrameNet and SALSA.",
        "The annotation proceeded in three phases: a training phase (40 sentences), a calibration phase (100 sentences), and a production mode phase (1000 sentences).",
        "In the calibration phase, sentences were doubly annotated to assess inter-annotator agreement.",
        "In production mode, sentences were split into two distinct sets, each of which was annotated by a single coder.",
        "We ensured that no annotator saw both parts of any sentence pair to guarantee independent annotation of the bilingual data.",
        "Each coder annotated approximately the same amount of data in English and German.",
        "Table 2 shows the results of our inter-annotator agreement study.",
        "In addition to the widely used Kappa statistic, we computed a number of different agreement measures: the ratio of frames common",
        "between two sentences (Frame Match), the ratio of common roles (Role Match), and the ratio of roles with identical spans (Span Match).",
        "As can be seen, annotators tend to agree in frame assignment; disagreements are mainly due to fuzzy distinctions between frames (e.g., between AWARENESS and CERTAINTY).",
        "As can be seen from Table 2, annotators agree in what roles to assign (Role Match is 0.95 for both English and German); agreeing on their exact spans is a harder problem.",
        "Semantic Parallelism.",
        "Since we obtained parallel FrameNet annotations for English and German, we were able to investigate the degree of semantic parallelism between the two languages.",
        "More specifically, we treated the German annotation as gold standard against which we compared the English annotations.",
        "To facilitate comparisons with the output of our automatic projection methods (see Section 4), we measured parallelism using precision and recall.",
        "Frames and frame roles were counted as matching if they were annotated in a sentence, regardless of their spans.",
        "The results are shown in Table 3.",
        "The cross-lingual data exhibit more than twice the amount of frame differences than monolingual data (compare Tables 2 and 3).",
        "This indicates that frame disambiguation methods must be employed in automatic role projection to ensure that two aligned tokens evoke the same frame.",
        "However, frame disambiguation is outside the scope of the present paper.",
        "On the positive side, role agreement is relatively high (0.91 F-score).",
        "This indicates that in cases where frames match across languages, semantic roles could be accurately transferred (provided that these languages diverge little in their argument structure).",
        "This observation offers support for the",
        "projection approach put forward in this paper.",
        "Note, however, that a practical projection system could attain this level of performance only if it could employ an oracle to recover annotators’ decisions about the span of roles.",
        "We can obtain a more realistic upper bound for an automatic system from the monolingual Role Span agreement figure (F-score 0.84).",
        "The latter represents a ceiling for the agreement we can expect from sentences annotated by different annotators."

Unfortunately, any attempt to compute a match based on categorical data derived from linguistic analyses (e.g., parts of speech, phrase types or grammatical relations), needs to empirically derive cross-linguistic similarities between categories, a task which must be repeated for every new language pair, and requires additional data.",

        "In this paper, we argue that parallel corpora show promise in relieving the lexical acquisition bottleneck for low density languages.",
        "We proposed semantic projection as a means of obtaining FrameNet annotations automatically without additional human effort.",
        "We examined semantic parallelism, a prerequisite for accurate projection, and showed that semantic roles can be successfully projected for predicate pairs with matching frame assignments.",
        "Similarly to previous work (Hwa et al., 2002), we find that some mileage can be gained by assuming direct correspondence between two languages.",
        "However, linguistic knowledge is key in obtaining meaningful projections.",
        "Our experiments show that the use of constituent information yields substantial improvements over relying on word alignment alone.",
        "Nevertheless, the word-based models offer a good starting point for low-density languages for which parsers are not available.",
        "Their output could be further post-processed manually or automatically using bootstrapping techniques (Riloff and Jones, 1999).",
        "We have presented a general, flexible framework for semantic projection which can be easily applied to other languages.",
        "An important direction for future work lies in the assessment of more shallow syntactic information (i.e., chunks) which can be obtained more easily for new languages, and generally in the integration of more linguistic knowledge to guide projection.",
        "Finally, we will incorporate into our projection approach automatic semantic role annotations for the source language and investigate the potential of the projected annotations for training semantic parsers for the target language.",
        "Acknowledgements.",
        "The authors acknowledge the support of DFG (Padó; grant PI-154/9-2) and EPSRC (Lapata; grant GR/T04540/01).",
        "Thanks to B. Kouchnir and P. Kreischer for their annotation."
