        "Query expansion is a simple but very useful technique to improve search performance by adding some terms to an initial query.",
        "While many query expansion techniques have been proposed so far, a standard method of performing is to use relevance information from a user (Ruthven, 2003).",
        "If we can use more relevant documents in query expansion, the likelihood of selecting query terms achieving high search improvement increases.",
        "However it is impractical to expect enough relevance information.",
        "Some researchers said that a user usually notifies few relevance feedback or nothing (Dumais and et al., 2003).",
        "In this paper we investigate the potential performance of query expansion under the condition that we can utilize little relevance information, especially we only know a relevant document and a non-relevant document.",
        "To overcome the lack of relevance information, we tentatively increase the number of relevant documents by a machine learning technique called Transductive Learning.",
        "Compared with ordinal inductive learning approach, this learning technique works even if there is few training examples.",
        "In our case, we can use many documents in a hit-list, however we know the relevancy of few documents.",
        "When applying query expansion, we use those increased documents as if they were true relevant ones.",
        "When applying the learning, there occurs some difficult problems of parameter settings.",
        "We also try to provide a reasonable resolution for the problems and show the effectiveness of our proposed method in experiments.",
        "The point of our query expansion method is that we focus on the availability of relevance information in practical situations.",
        "There are several researches which deal with this problem.",

        "However, unless this assumption holds, it usually gives a worse ranking than the initial search.",
        "Thus several researchers propose some specific procedure to make pseudo feedback be effective (Yu and et al., 2003; Lam-Adesina and Jones, 2001).",
        "In another way, Onoda (Onoda et al., 2004) tried to apply one-class SVM (Support Vector Machine) to relevance feedback.",
        "Their purpose is to improve search performance by using only non-relevant documents.",
        "Though their motivation is similar to ours in terms of applying a machine learning method to complement the lack of relevance information, the assumption is somewhat different.",
        "Our assumption is to utilizes manual but the minimum relevance judgment.",
        "Transductive leaning has already been applied in the field of image retrieval (He and et al., 2004).",
        "In this research, they proposed a transductive method called the manifold-ranking algorithm and showed its effectiveness by comparing with active learning based Support Vector Machine.",
        "However, their setting of relevance judgment is not different from many other traditional researches.",
        "They fix the total number of images that are marked by a user to 20.",
        "As we have already claimed, this setting is not practical because most users feel that 20 is too much for judgment.",
        "We think none of research has not yet answered the question.",

        "One is the setting of “Enough relevant documents are available”, and the other is “No relevant document is available”.",

        "While some techniques focus on the domain specific search which prepares expansion terms in advance using some domain specific training documents (Flake and et al., 2002; Oyama and et al., 2001), most of techniques are based on relevance feedback which is given automatically or manually.",
        "In this technique, expansion terms are selected from relevant documents by a scoring function.",
        "The Robertson’s wpq method (Ruthven, 2003) is often used as such a scoring function in many researches (Yu and et al., 2003; Lam-Adesina and Jones, 2001).",
        "We also use it as our basic scoring function.",
        "It calculates the score of each term by the following formula.",
        "where rt is the number of seen relevant documents containing term t. nt is the number of documents containing t. R is the number of seen relevant documents for a query.",
        "N is the number of documents in the collection.",
        "The second term of this formula is called the Robertson/Spark Jones weight (Robertson, 1990) which is the core of the term weighting function in the Okapi system (Robertson, 1997).",
        "This formula is originated in the following formula.",
        "where pt is the probability that a term t appears in relevant documents.",
        "qt is the probability that a term t appears in non-relevant documents.",
        "We can easily notice that it is very important how the two probability of pt and qt should be estimated.",
        "The first formula estimates pt with Rrt and qt with Nt Rt .",
        "For the good estimation of pt and qt, plenty of relevant document is necessary.",
        "Although pseudo feedback which automatically assumes top n documents as relevant is one method and is often used, its performance heavily depends on the quality of an initial search.",

        "We here consider a query expansion technique which uses manual feedback.",
        "It is no wonder",
        "manual feedback shows excellent and stable performance if enough relevant documents are available, hence the challenge is how it keeps high performance with less amount of manual relevance judgment.",
        "In particular, we restrict the manual judgment to the minimum amount, namely only a relevant document and a non-relevant document.",
        "In this assumption, the problem is how to find more relevant documents based on a relevant document and a non-relevant document.",

        "Several algorithms have been proposed so far (Joachims, 1999; Zhu and et al., 2003; Blum and et al., 2004) and they show the advantage of this approach in various learning tasks.",
        "In order to apply transductive learning to our query expansion, we select an algorithm called “Spectral Graph Transducer (SGT)“ (Joachims, 2003), which is one of the state of the art and the best transductive learning algorithms.",
        "SGT formalizes the problem of assigning labels to U with an optimization problem of the constrained ratiocut.",
        "By solving the relaxed problem, it produces an approximation to the original solution.",
        "When applying SGT to query expansion, X corresponds to a set of top n ranked documents in a hit-list.",

        "We cannot know the true value of fp in advance, thus we have to estimate its approximation value before applying SGT.",
        "According to Joachims, parameter k (the number of k-nearest points of a data ⃗x) and d (the number of eigenvalues to ...) give large influence to SGT’s learning performance.",
        "Of course those two parameters should be set carefully.",
        "However, besides them, fp is much more important for our task because it controls the learning performance.",
