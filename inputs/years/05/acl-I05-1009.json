        "The theme of this paper is the following assumption:",
        "The uncertainty of tokens coming after a sequence helps determine whether",
        "a given position is at a context boundary.",
        "(A) Intuitively, the variety of successive tokens at each character inside a word monotonically decreases according to the offset length, because the longer the preceding character n-gram, the longer the preceding context and the more it restricts the appearance of possible next tokens.",
        "On the other hand, the uncertainty at the position of a word border becomes greater and the complexity increases, as the position is out of context.",
        "This suggests that a word border can be detected by focusing on the differentials of the uncertainty of branching.",
        "This assumption is illustrated in Figure1.",
        "In this paper, we measure this uncertainty of successive tokens by utilizing the entropy of branching (which we mathematically define in the next section).",
        "This assumption dates back to the fundamental work done by Harris [6] in 1955, where he says that when the number of different tokens coming after every prefix of a word marks the maximum value, then the location corresponds to the morpheme boundary.",
        "Recently, with the increasing availability of corpora, this characteristic of language data has been applied for unsupervised text segmentation into words and morphemes.",
        "Kempe [8] reports an experiment to detect word borders in German and English texts by monitoring the entropy of successive characters for 4-grams.",
        "Many works in unsupervised segmentation utilise the fact that the branching stays low inside words but increases at a word or morpheme border.",
        "Some works apply this fact in terms of frequency [10] [2], while others utilise more sophisticated statistical measures: Sun et al.",
        "[12] use mutual information; Creutz [4] use MDL to decompose Finnish texts into morphemes.",
        "This assumption seems to hold not only at the character level but also at the word level.",
        "For example, the uncertainty of words coming after the word sequence, \"The United States of\", is small (because the word America is very likely to occur), whereas the uncertainty is greater for the sequence \"computational linguistics\", suggesting that there is a context boundary just after this term.",
        "This observation at the word level has been applied to term extraction by utilising the number of different words coming after a word sequence as an indicator of collocation boundaries [5] [9].",
        "Fig.",
        "1.",
        "Intuitive illustration of a variety of successive tokens and a word boundary",
        "As can be seen in these previous works, the above assumption (A) seems to govern language structure both microscopically at the morpheme level and macroscopically at the phrase level.",
        "Assumption (A) is interesting not only from an engineering viewpoint but also from a language and cognitive science viewpoint.",
        "For example, some recent studies report that the statistical, innate structure of language plays an important role in children's language acquisition [11].",
        "Therefore, it is important to understand the innate structure of language, in order to shed light on how people actually acquire it.",
        "Consequently, this paper verifies assumption (A) in a fundamental manner.",
        "We address the questions of why and to what extent (A) holds.",
        "Unlike recent, previous works based on limited numbers of corpora, we use a web search engine to obtain statistics, in order to avoid the sparseness problem as much as possible.",
        "Our discussion focuses on correlating the entropy of branching and word boundaries, because the definition of a word boundary is clearer than that of a morpheme or phrase unit.",
        "In terms of detecting word boundaries, our experiments were performed in character sequence, so we chose two languages in which segmentation is a crucial problem: Chinese which contains only ideograms, and Japanese, which contains both ideograms and phonograms.",
        "Before describing the experiments, we discuss assumption (A) in more detail."

        "The two lines correspond to Japanese and English data, from corpora consisting of the Mainichi newspaper (30 MB) and the WSJ (30 MB), respectively.",
        "This phenomenon indicates that X will become easier to estimate as the context of Xn gets longer.",
        "This can be intuitively understood: it is easy to guess that \"e\" will follow after \"Hello!",
        "How ar\", but it is difficult to guess what comes after the short string \"He\".",
        "The last term – log P(X = x\\Xn = xn) in formula above indicates the information of a token of x coming after xn, and thus the branching after xn.",
        "The latter half of the formula, the local entropy value for a given xn indicates the average information of branching for a specific n-gram sequence xn.",
        "As our interest in this paper is this local entropy, we denote simply H(X\\Xn = xn)as /i(xn) in the rest of this paper.",
        "The decrease in H(X\\ Xn) globally indicates that given an n-length sequence xn and another (n + 1)-length sequence yn+i, the following inequality holds on average:",
        "One reason why inequality (2) holds for language data is that there is context in language, and yn+i carries a longer context as compared with xn.",
        "Therefore, if we suppose that xn is the prefix of xn+1, then it is very likely that holds, because the longer the preceding n-gram, the longer the same context.",
        "For example, it is easier to guess what comes after x6 = \"natura\" than what comes after x5 = \"natur\".",
        "Therefore, the decrease in H(X\\Xn) can be expressed as the concept that if the context is longer, the uncertainty of the branching decreases on average.",
        "Then, taking the logical contraposition, if the uncertainty does not decrease, the context is not longer, which can be interpreted as the following:",
        "If the complexity of successive tokens increases, the location is at the context border.",
        "(B)",
        "For example, in the case of x7 = \"natural\", the entropy h(\"natural\") should be larger than h(\"natura\"), because it is uncertain what character will allow x7to succeed.",

        "When two semantic units, both longer than 1, are put together, the entropy would appear as in the first figure of Figure 3.",
        "The first semantic unit is from offsets 0 to 4, and the second is from 4 to 8, with each unit formed by elements of \\.",
        "In the figure, one possible transition of branching degree is shown, where the plot at k on the horizontal axis denotes the entropy for h(x0jk)and xn^m denotes the substring between offsets n and m.",
        "Ideally, the entropy would take a maximum at 4, because it will decrease as k is increased in the ranges of k< 4and 4 <k < 8, and at k = 4, it will rise.",
        "Therefore, the position at k = 4 is detected as the \"local maximum value\" when monitoring h(x0 k)over k. The boundary condition after such observation can be redefined as the following:",
        "Bmax Boundaries are locations where the entropy is locally maximised.",
        "A similar method is proposed by Harris [6], where morpheme borders can be detected by using the local maximum of the number of different tokens coming after a prefix.",
        "This only holds, however, for semantic units longer than 1.",
        "Units often have a length of 1: at the character level, in Japanese and Chinese, there are many one-character words, and at the word level, there are many single words that do not form collocations.",
        "If a unit has length 1, then the situation will look like the second graph in Figure 3, where three semantic units, x0 4, x4j5 x5j8, are present, with the middle unit having length 1.",
        "First, at k =4, thevalueofh increases.",
        "At k = 5, the value may increase or decrease, because the longer context results in an uncertainty decrease, though an uncertainty decrease does not necessarily mean a longer context.When h increases at k = 5, the situation would look like the second graph.",
        "In this case, the condition Bmaxwill not suffice, and we need a second boundary condition:",
        "Bincrease Boundaries are locations where the entropy is increased.",
        "On the other hand, when h decreases at k = 5, then even Bincreasecannot be applied to detect k = 5 as a boundary.",
        "We have other chances to detect k = 5, however, by considering h(xiik)where 0 <i<k. According to inequality (2), then, a similar trend should be present for plots of h(xiik), assuming h(x0 n) > h(x0_n+i); then, we have h(xi,n) >h(xi,n+1 ), for 0 <i<n.",

        "Therefore, the length of n is set to 3, h(xi_3 i) is calculated for all i, and the maximum values are claimed to indicate the word boundary.",
        "This model is illustrated in Figure 4, where the plot at each k indicates the value of h(xk-3lk).",

        "It is not possible, however, to judge whether h(xi-3ii) is larger than h(xi_2,i+1) in general: Kempe's experiments show that the h value simply oscillates at a low value in such cases.",

        "The larger val is, the higher the precision, and the lower the recall.",
        "We varied val in the experiment in order to obtain the precision and recall curve.",
        "As the process is slow and heavy, the experiment could not be run through millions of words.",
        "Therefore, we took out portions of the corpora used for each language, which consisted of around 2000 words (Chinese 2039, Japanese 2254).",
        "These corpora were first segmented into phrases at commas, and each phrase was fed into the procedure described above.",
        "The suggested boundaries were then compared with the original, correct boundaries.",
        "The results are shown in Figure 7.",
        "The horizontal axis and vertical axes represent the precision and recall, respectively.",
        "The figure contains two lines, corresponding to the results for Japanese or Chinese.",
        "Each line is plotted by varying val from 0.0 to 3.0 with a margin of 0.5, where the leftmost points of the lines are the results obtained for val=0.0.",
        "The precision was more than 90% for Chinese with val > 2.5.",
        "In the case of Japanese, the precision deteriorated by about 10%.",
        "Even without a threshold ( val = 0.0), however, the method maintained good precision in both languages.",
        "The locations indicated incorrectly were inside phonogram sequences consisting of long foreign terms, and in inflections in the endings of verbs and adjectives.",
        "In fact, among the incorrect points, many could be detected as correct segmentations.",
        "For example, in Chinese, surnames were separated from first names by our h(xn+1 ) – h(xn) >val.",
        "procedure, whereas in the original corpus, complete names are regarded as single words.",
        "As another example in Chinese, the character is used to indicate \"-ist\" in English, as in \"ï/nps^!\"",
        "(revolutionist) and our process suggested that there is a border in between \"5=np\" and However, in the original corpus, these words are not segmented before \"^\" but are instead treated as one word.",
        "Unlike the precision, the recall ranged significantly according to the threshold.",
        "When val was high, the recall became small, and the texts were segmented into larger phrasal portions.",
        "Some successful examples in Japanese for val=3.0 are shown in the following.",
        "- <$ltf&nk<DtfffflT:\\tt£I t^TLTl^Z, (We think that | it is not the time for breakup).",
        "The segments show the global structure of the phrases, and thus, this result demonstrates the potential validity of assumption (B).",
        "In fact, such sentence segmentation into phrases would be better performed in a word-based manner, rather than a character-based manner, because our character-based experiment mixes the word-level and character-level aspects at the same time.",
        "Some previous works on collocation extraction have tried boundary detection using branching [5].",
        "Boundary detection by branching outputs tightly coupled words that can be quite different from traditional grammatical phrases.",
        "Verification of such aspects remains as part of our future work.",
        "Overall, in these experiments, we could obtain a glimpse of language structure based on assumption (B) where semantic units of different levels (morpheme, word, phrase) overlaid oneanother, asiftoformafractal of the context.",
        "The entropy of branching is interesting in that it has the potential to detect all boundaries of different layers within the same framework.",
        "7Conclusion",
        "We conducted a fundamental analysis to verify that the uncertainty of tokens coming after a sequence can serve to determine whether a position is at a context boundary.",
        "By inferring this feature of language from the well-known fact that the entropy of successive tokens decreases when a longer context is taken, we examined how boundaries could be detected by monitoring the entropy of successive tokens.",
        "Then, we conducted two experiments, a small one in Japanese, and a larger-scale experiment in both Chinese and Japanese, to actually segment words by using only the entropy value.",
        "Statistical measures were obtained using a web search engine in order to overcome data sparseness.",
        "Through analysis of Japanese examples, we found that the method worked better for sequences of ideograms, rather than for phonograms.",
        "Also, we observed that semantic layers of different levels (morpheme, word, phrase) could potentially be detected by monitoring the entropy of branching.",
        "In our larger-scale experiment, points of increasing entropy correlated well with word borders especially in the case of Chinese.",
        "These results reveal an interesting aspect of the statistical structure of language."
