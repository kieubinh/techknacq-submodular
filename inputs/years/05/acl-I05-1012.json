        "Because of the improvement of NLP, research activities which utilize natural language documents as a knowledge base become popular, such as QA track on TREC [1] and NTCIR [2].",
        "However, these QA systems assumed the user model where the user asks what type questions.",
        "On the contrary, there are a few QA systems which assumed the user model where the user asks how type question, in other words, how to do something and how to cope with some problem [3] [4][7].",
        "There are several difficulties in developing a QA system which answers how type questions, and we focus attention to two problems.",
        "First problem is the difficulty of extracting evidential sentences by which the QA system answers how type questions.",
        "It is not difficult to extract evidential sentences by which the QA system answers what type questions.",
        "For example, question (Q1) is a what type question and \"Naoko Takahashi, a marathon runner, won the gold medal at the Sydney Olympics\" is a good evidential sentence for answering question (Q1).",
        "(Q1) Who won the gold medal in women's marathon",
        "at the Sydney Olympics?",
        "(DA1-1) Naoko Takahashi.",
        "It is not difficult to extract this evidential sentence from natural language documents by using common content words and phrases because this sentence and question (Q1) have several common content words and phrases.",
        "On the contrary, it is difficult to extract evidential sentences for answering how type questions only by using linguistic clues, such as, common content words and phrases.",
        "For example, it is difficult to extract evidential sentences for answering how type question (Q2) because there may be only a few common content words and phrases between the evidential sentences and question (Q2).",
        "(Q2) How can I cure myself of allergy?",
        "(DA2-1) You had better live in a wooden floor.",
        "(O2-1-1) Keep it clean.",
        "(O2-1-2) Your room is always dirty.",
        "(DA2-2) Drink two spoonfuls of vinegar every day.",
        "(QR2-2-1) I tried, but, no effect.",
        "To solve this problem, [3] and [4] proposed methods of collecting knowledge for answering questions from FAQ documents and technical manuals by using the document structure, such as, a dictionary-like structure and if-then format description.",
        "However, these kinds of documents requires the considerable cost of developing and maintenance.",
        "As a result, it is important to investigate a method of extracting evidential sentences for answering how type questions from natural language documents at low cost.",
        "To solve this problem, we proposed a method of developing a knowledge base by using mails posted to a mailing list (ML) [8].",
        "We have the following advantages when we develop knowledge base by using mails posted to a mailing list.",
        " – it is easy to collect question and answer mails in a specific domain, and – there is some expectation that information is updated by participants",
        "Furthermore, we developed a QA system and show that mails posted to a mailing list can be used as a knowledge base by which a QA system answers how type questions [8].",
        "Next problem is wrong information.",
        "It is almost inevitable that natural language documents, especially web documents, contain wrong information.",
        "For example, (DA3-1) is opposed by (QR3-1-1).",
        "(Q3) How I set up my wheel mouse for the netscape ?",
        "(DA3-1) You can find a setup guide in the Dec. issue of SD magazine.",
        "(QR3-1-1) I cannot use it although I modified /usr/lib/netscape/ja/Netscape according to the guide.",
        "Wrong information is a central problem of developing a knowledge base by using natural language documents.",
        "As a result, it is important to investigate a method of detecting and correcting wrong information in natural language documents.",
        "In this paper, we first report a method of detecting wrong information in question and answer mails posted to a mailing list.",
        "In our method, wrong information in the mails are detected by using mails which ML participants submitted for correcting wrong information in the previous mails.",
        "Then, the system gives one of the following confirmation labels to each set of question and their answer mails:",
        "positive label shows the information described in a set of a question and its",
        "answer mail is confirmed by the following mails, negative label shows the information is opposed by the following mails, and other label shows the information is not yet confirmed.",
        "Our knowledge base is composed of these labeled sets of a question and its answer mail.",
        "Finally, we describe a QA system: It finds question mails which are similar to user's question and shows the results to the user.",
        "The similarity between user's question and a question mail is calculated by matching of user's question and the significant sentence extracted from the question mail.",
        "A user can easily choose and access information for solving problems by using the significant sentences and confirmation labels."
