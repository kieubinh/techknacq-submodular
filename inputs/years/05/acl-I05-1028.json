        "Recently, sentiment classification has been actively studied and experimental results have shown that machine learning approaches perform well [13,11,10,20].",
        "We argue, however, that we can estimate the polarity of a review more finely.",
        "For example, both reviews A and B in Table 1would be classified simply as positive in binary classification.",
        "Obviously, this classification loses the information about the difference in the degree of polarity apparent in the review text.",
        "We propose a novel type of document classification task where we evaluate reviews with scores like five stars.",
        "We call this score the sentiment polarity score (sp-score).",
