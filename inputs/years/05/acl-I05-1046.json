        "[3] pointed out, over 60% of the QA errors can be attributed to ineffective question processing, including query formulation and query expansion.",
        "A naive solution to query formulation is using the keywords in an input question as the query to a search engine.",
        "However, it is possible that the keywords may not appear in those answer passages which contain answers to the given question.",
        "For example, submitting the keywords in \"Who invented washing machine?\"",
        "to a search engine like Google may not lead to retrieval of answer passages like \"The inventor of the automatic washer was John Chamberlain.\"",
        "In fact, by expanding the keyword set (\"invented', \"washing\", \"machine\") with \"inventor of,\" the query to a search engine is effective in retrieving such answer passages as the top-ranking pages.",
        "Hence, if we can learn how to associate a set of questions (e.g. (\"who invented ...?\")",
        "with effective keywords or phrases (e.g. \"inventor of\") which are likely to appear in answer passages, the search engine will have a better chance of retrieving pages containing the answer.",
        "In this paper, we present a novel Web-based unsupervised learning approach to handling question analysis for QA systems.",
        "In our approach, training-data questions are first analyzed and classified into a set of fine-grained categories of question patterns.",
        "Then, the relationships between the question patterns and n-grams in answer passages are discovered by employing a word alignment technique.",
        "Finally, the best query transforms are derived by ranking the n-grams which are associated with a specific question pattern.",
        "At runtime, the keywords in a given question are extracted and the question is categorized.",
        "Then the keywords are expanded according the category of the question.",
        "The expanded query is the submitted to a search engine in order to bias the search engine to return passages that are more likely to contain answers to the question.",
        "Experimental results indicate the expanded query indeed outperforms the approach of directly using the keywords in the question."

        "We set aside the first 45 questions for testing and used the rest for training.",
        "For each question, we form a query with question keywords and the answer and submitted the query to Google to retrieve top 100 summaries as the answer passages.",
        "In all, we collected 95,926 answer passages.",
        "At training time, we extracted a total of 338 distinct question patterns from 3,806 questions.",
        "We aligned these patterns and keywords with bigrams in the 95,926 answer passages, identified the locations of the answers, and obtained the bigrams appearing within a distance of 3 of the answers.",
        "At runtime, we use the top-ranking bigram to expand each question pattern.",
        "If no such bigrams are found, we use only the keyword in the question patterns.",
        "The expanded terms for question pattern are placed at the beginning of the query.",
        "We submitted forty-five keyword queries and the same number of expanded queries generated by Atlas for the test questions to Google and obtained ten returned summaries for evaluation.",
        "For the evaluation, we use three indicators to measure the performance.",
        "The first indicator is the mean reciprocal rank (MRR) of the first relevant document (or summary) returned.",
        "If the r-th document (summary) returned is the one with the answer, then the reciprocal rank of the document (summary) is 1/r.",
        "The mean reciprocal rank is the average reciprocal rank of all test questions.",
        "The second indicator of effective query is the recall at R document retrieved (Recall at R).",
        "The last indicator measures the human effort (HE) in finding the answer.",
        "HE is defined as the least number of passages needed to be viewed for covering all the answers to be returned from the system.",
        "The average length of these test questions is short.",
        "We believe the proposed question expansion scheme helps those short sentences, which tend to be less effective in retrieving answers.",
        "We evaluated the expanded queries against the same measures for summaries returned by simple keyword queries.",
        "Both batches of returned summaries for the forty-five questions were verified by two human judges.",
        "As shown in Table 7, the MRR produced by keyword-based scheme is slightly lower than the one yielded by the presented query expansion scheme.",
        "Nevertheless, such improvement is encouraging by indicating the effectiveness of the proposed method.",
        "Table 8 lists the comparisons in more details.",
        "It is found that our method is effective in bringing the answers to the top 1 and top 2 summaries as indicated by the high Recall of 0.8 at R = 2.",
        "In addition, Table 8 also shows that less user's efforts are needed by using our approach.",
        "That is, for each question, the average of summaries required to be viewed by human beings goes down from 2.7 to 2.3.",
        "In the end, we found that those bigrams containing a content word and a function word turn out to be very effective.",
