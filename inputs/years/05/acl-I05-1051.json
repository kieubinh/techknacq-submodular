        "Early approach to statistical machine translation relies on the word-based translation model to describe the translation process [1].",
        "However, the underlying assumption of word-to-word translation often fails to capture all properties of the language, i.e. the existence of the phrase where a group of words often function together as a unit.",
        "Many researchers have proposed to move from the word-based to the phrase-based translation model [2] [3] [4].",
        "A phrase-based approach offers many advantages as a phrase translation captures word context and local reordering inherently [3].",
        "It has become popular in statistical machine translation applications.",
        "There are typically two groups of approaches to constructing the phrase-based model.",
        "The first group learns phrase translation directly from the sentence pair.",
        "It learns both word and phrase units simultaneously.",
        "Although these approaches appear intuitive, it usually suffers from a prohibitive computational cost.",
        "It might have to consider all possible multi-word sequences as phrase candidates and all possible pairings as phrase translations at the same time.",
        "Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation: A Level of Detail Approach 577",
        "The second group of approaches learns phrase translations through word-level alignment: alignment template [2] and projection extension [6], just to name a few.",
        "In general, these approaches take the word-level alignment, a by-product of the word-based translation model, as their input and then utilize a heuristic measurement to learn the phrase translation.",
        "The heuristic measurement contains all possible configurations of word-level alignment on a phrase translation.",
        "It is noted that the underlying word-level alignment is just an approximation to the exact alignment.",
        "The approximation is reflected by a probability produced by the word-based translation model.",
        "The majority of approaches do not make use of this probability, whereas it may provide a valuable clue leading to a better phrase translation from a statistical point of view.",
        "Koehn, et.",
        "al [8] compared the representative of both groups and reported that learning phrase translation using a simple heuristic from word alignment yields a better translation performance than learning phrase translation directly from the sentence pair.",
        "Many approaches try to learn all phrase translations in one step, either directly from the sentence pair or through word alignment.",
        "As a result, they may encounter a huge amount of phrase translation candidates at once.",
        "Usually, they limit the maximum phrase length to reduce the choice of candidates.",
        "Although this method is sufficient to satisfy the computational requirement, it comes with the cost of not finding the good phrases longer than the imposed limit.",
        "Additionally, to reduce the candidates, those approaches use a threshold to separate good phrase translation from the rest.",
        "The threshold is ad-hoc and often not capable of making a clear separation.",
        "Therefore, the use of threshold often comes with the cost of the inclusion of undesired phrase translations and the absence of good phrase translations in the phrase translation table.",
        "The cost may be reflected from the size of the phrase translation table that often grows almost linearly over the phrase length limit [6][8].",
        "The growth implies a non-intuitive behavior: two phrases with different length introduce an equal number of additional entries to the phrase translation table.",
        "As longer phrases occur less often, there should be fewer entries introduced into the phrase translation table.",
        "We propose an agglomerative approach to learn phrase translations.",
        "Our approach is motivated by the second group, which is to learn phrase translation through word-alignment, while addressing the common issues: the size of the phrase translation table, the use of underlying translation model probability and the length of the phrase unit.",
        "Only a few approaches move away from one-step learning.",
        "Melamed [13]presented an agglomerative approach to learn the phrases progressively from a parallel corpus by using sub-phrase bigram statistics.",
        "Moore [14] proposed a similar approach which identifies the phrase candidates by parsing the raw training data.",
        "Our idea differs from these approaches in that we look into the association of the alignments rather than the association of the words to discover the phrases.",
        "In this paper, we propose the Level of Detail (LOD) approach for learning of phrase translations in phrase-based statistical machine translation.",
        "Section 2 discusses the background and motivation and then formulates the LOD approach while section 3 describes the learning process in details.",
        "Section 4 describes the experimental results.",
        "In this section, we compare LOD with state-of-the-art word-based approach in translation tasks.",
        "Finally, section 5 concludes this paper by providing some discussion in comparison with other related works.",
        "2 Statistical Machine Translation: A Level of Detail 2.1 Motivation and Background",
        "It is often not intuitive to model the translation of a phrase using the word-based translation model.",
        "First, the literal translation of phrase constituents is often inappropriate from a linguistic point of view.",
        "The word-based translation model treats a phrase as a multi-word.",
        "One such example is the case where a phrase appears as an idiom.",
        "The translation of an idiom cannot be synthesized from the literal translation of its constituents but rather from the semantic translation of the whole.",
        "Besides, the literal translation of an idiom detracts from the intended meaning.",
        "In one such example, the literal translation of French \" manger sur le pouce \"is\" to eat on the thumb\".",
        "This detracts from the correct translation \" to grab a bite to eat \".",
        "In addition, to produce the correct translation, the word-based translation model might have to learn that \"manger\" is translated as \"eat \"or \"pouce \" istranslated as\" thumb\".",
        "Although it may serve the translation purpose, it will introduce many non-intuitive entries to the dictionary.",
        "Second, even if it is possible to translate a phrase verbatim, modeling phrase translation using the word-based translation model suffers from a disadvantage: the number of word alignments required to synthesize the phrase translation is large.",
        "It requires four word alignments to model the translation between \" une minute de silence \"and \" one minute of silence \", whereas one phrase alignment is adequate.",
        "The introduction of more alignments also implies the requirement to estimate more parameters for the translation model.",
        "The implication often comes with the cost of learning wrong word alignments.",
        "Third, a phrase often constitutes some spurious words.",
        "The word-based translation model often has trouble in modeling spurious words, such as function words.",
        "Function words may appear freely in any position and often may not be translated to any word.",
        "We observe that many of these function words appear inside a phrase.",
        "It is beneficial to realize these spurious words inside a phrase unit so as to improve statistical machine translation performance and also to remove the necessity to model them explicitly.",
        "All these suggest that, ideally, a phrase translation should be realized as a phrase alignment, where the lexical correspondence is established on phrase level rather than on its word constituents.",
        "The discussion above suggests that phrase-based translation is a wise choice.",
        "Practically, as a phrase is not a well defined lexical entry, a mechanism is needed to judge what constitutes a phrase in the context of statistical machine translation.",
        "In this paper, we advocate an approach to look into the phrase discovery process at different level of details.",
        "The level of detail refers to the size of a",
        "Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation: A Level of Detail Approach 579 phrase unit.",
        "At its finest level of detail, a phrase translation uses the word-based translation model where a phrase is modeled through its word constituent.",
        "At a coarser level of detail, a sub-phrase unit is introduced as a sequence of words, making it a constituent of the phrase.",
        "The coarsest level of detail refers to the status of a phrase where all word constituents converge into a whole unit.",
        "Our Level-Of-Detail (LOD) approach views the problem of phrase-based translation modeling through a LOD process.",
        "It starts from the finest wordlevel alignment and transforms the phrase translation into its coarsest level of detail.",
        "Let < e, f > be a sentence pair of two sequences of words with e as an English sentence and f as its translation in French1.Let < ê,f > represents the same sentence pair but with the phrase as its atomic unit rather than the word.",
        "To generalize the notation, we treat word and phrase unit similarly by considering a word as a phrase of length one.",
        "Therefore, < e, f > hereafter will be referred as < e,f >(0), which represents the finest level of detail, and < e,f > as < e, f >(N), which represents the coarsest level of detail.",
        "Let each tuple in the sentence pair of any level of detail n, < e, f >(n) be e(n) = {f 0n), f 1n)f(n)f } and f(n) = {/0n), /1(n),..., f (n),..., f ml)} where f 0n),/0n) represent the special token NULL as suggested in [1] and l(n),m(n) represent the length of the corresponding sentence.",
        "Let T(n) be a set of alignment defined over the sentence pair < f, / >(n)with t(n) = [e(n), /j(n)]as its member.The superscript in all notations denotes the level of detail where 0 represents the finest and N represents the coarsest level of detail.",
        "LOD algorithm iteratively transforms < e, f >(0) to < e, f >(N) through realignment of phrases and re-estimation of phrase translation probability.",
        "At nth iteration, LOD harvests all bidirectional alignments from the sentence pair < e,f >(n).",
        "The alignment is obtained by a typical word-based translation model, such as the IBM model, while treating a sub-phrase at nth iteration as a word.",
        "We refer to those alignments as B(n), a pool of sub-phrase alignments unique to the particular iteration.",
        "Afterwards, LOD generates all possible phrase alignment candidates C(n) for a coarser level of detail from these sub-phrase alignments.",
        "A resulting phrase alignment candidate is basically a joining of two adjacent sub-phrase alignments subject to a certain criterion.",
        "It represents the future coarser level alignment.",
        "Up to this point, two sets of alignment are obtained over< e, f >(n): a pool of sub-phrase alignments B(n) at the current level and a pool of phrase alignment candidates C(n) at a coarser level.",
        "From these two sets of alignments B(n) UC(n), we would like to derive a new set of alignments T(n+1)that best describes the training corpus with the re-estimated statistics obtained at nth iteration.",
