        "This paper proposes a sentence ordering algorithm and evaluate its performance with regard to MDS.",
        "MDS is the task of generating a human readable summary from a given set of documents.",
        "With the increasing amount of texts available in electronic format, automatic text summarization has become necessary.",
        "It can be considered as a two-stage process.",
        "In the first stage the source documments are analyzed and a set of sentences are extracted.",
        "However, the document set may contain repeating information as well as contradictory information and these challenges should be considered when extracting sentences for the summary.",
        "Researchers have already investigated this problem and various algorithms exist.",
        "The second stage of MDS creates a coherent summary from this extract.",
        "When summarizing a single document, a naive strategy that arranges extracted sentences according to the appearance order may yield a coherent summary.",
        "However, in MDS the extracted sentences belong to different source documents.",
        "The source documents may have been written by various authors and on various dates.",
        "Therefore we cannot simply order the sentences according to the position of the sentences in the original document to get a comprehensible summary.",
        "This second stage of MDS has received lesser attention compared to the first stage.",
        "Chronological ordering; ordering sentences according to the published date of the documents they belong to [6], is one solution to this problem.",
        "However, showing that this approach is insufficient, Barzilay [1] proposed an refined algorithm which integrates chronology ordering with topical relatedness of documents.",
        "Okazaki [7] proposes a improved chronological ordering algorithm using precedence relations among sentences.",
        "His algorithm searches for an order which satisfies the precedence relations among sentences.",
        "In addition to these studies which make use of chronological ordering, Lapata [3] proposes a probabilistic model of text structuring and its application to the sentence ordering.",
        "Her system calculates the conditional probabilities between sentences from a corpus and uses a greedy ordering algorithm to arrange sentences according to the conditional probabilities.",
        "Even though these previous studies proposed different strategies to decide the sentence ordering, the appropriate way to combine these different methods to obtain more robust and coherent text remains unknown.",
        "In addition to these existing sentence ordering heuristics, we propose a new method which we shall call succession in this paper.",
        "We then learn the optimum linear combination of these heuristics that maximises readability of a summary using a set of human-made orderings.",
        "We then propose two new metrics for evaluating sentence orderings; Weighted Kendall Coefficient and Average Continuity.",
        "Comparing with an intrinsic evaluation made by human subjects, we perform a quantitative evaluation using a number of metrics and discuss the possiblity of the automatic evaluation of sentence orderings.",
        "For sentences taken from the same document we keep the order in that document as done in single document summarization.",
        "However, we have to be careful when ordering sentences which belong to different documents.",
        "To decide the order among such sentences, we implement five ranking experts: Chronological, Probabilistic, Topical relevance, Precedent and Succedent.",
        "These experts return precedence preference between two sentences.",

        "When the expert is undecided of its preference between u and v it will return 0.",

        "The linear weighted sum of these individual preference functions is taken as the total preference by the set of experts as follows:",
        "Therein: E is the set of experts and we is the weight associated to expert e G E. These weights are normalized so that the sum of them is 1.",
        "We use the Hedge learning algorithm to learn the weights associated with each expert's preference function.",
        "Then we use the greedy algorithm proposed by Cohen [2] to get an ordering that approximates the total preference.",
        "Chronological expert emulates conventional chronological ordering [4,6] which arranges sentences according to the dates on which the documents were published and preserves the appearance order for sentences in the same document.",

        "Chronological expert returns 0.5 (undecided) when comparing two sentences which are not in the same article but have the same publication date.",
        "Lapata [3] proposes a probabilistic model to predict sentence order.",
        "Her model assumes that the position of a sentence in the summary depends only upon the sentences preceding it.",
        "For example let us consider a summary T which has sentences Si,...,Sn in that order.",
        "The probability P(T) of getting this order is given by:",
        "She further reduces this probability using bi-gram approximation as follows.",

        "Feature conditional probabilities can be calculated using frequency counts of features as follows:",
        "Lapata [3] uses nouns,verbs and dependency structures as features.",
        "Where as in our expert we implemented only nouns and verbs as features.",
        "We performed back-off smoothing on the frequency counts in equation 7 as these values were sparse.",
        "Once these conditional probabilities are calculated, for two sentences u,v we can define the preference function for the probabilistic expert as follows:",
        "Where, Q is the set of sentences ordered so far and r G Q is the lastly ordered sentence in Q.",
        "Initially, Q is null and we prefer the sentence with higher absolute probability.",
        "When Q is not null and u is preferred to v, i.e. P(u|r) >P(vir), according to definition 8 a preference value greater than 0.5 is returned.",
        "If v is preferred to u, i.e. P( u| r) <P( v| r), we have a preference value smaller than 0.5.",
        "When P(u| r)=P(v| r), the expert is undecided and it gives the value 0.5.",
        "In MDS, the source documents could contain multiple topics.",
        "Therefore, the extracted sentences could be covering different topics.",
        "Grouping the extracted sentences which belong to the same topic, improves readability of the summary.",
        "Motivated by this fact, we designed an expert which groups the sentences which belong to the same topic.",
