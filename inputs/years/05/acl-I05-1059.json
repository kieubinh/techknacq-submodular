        "Our survey shows that around 2/3 of the nouns and verbal nouns in Japanese are kanji words, and more than 1/3 of them can be translated into Chinese directly.",
        "The accuracy of conversion is 97%.",
        "Besides, we obtain translation candidates for 24% of the Japanese words using English as a pivot language with 77% accuracy.",

        "Bilingual dictionaries have unlimited usage.",
        "In order for one to learn a new language, a bilingual dictionary can never be absent.",
        "In natural language processing community, bilingual dictionaries are useful in many areas, such as machine translation and cross language information retrieval.",
        "In this research, we attempt to build a Japanese-Chinese dictionary using public available resources.",
        "There are already some existing Japanese-Chinese dictionaries, such as Shogakukan's Ri-Zhong Cidian [1], but they are not publicly available in electronic form.",
        "Our purpose is to build an electronic dictionary from public resources and make it public available.",
        "The first dictionary that we use is IPADIC [2], a Japanese dictionary used by ChaSen [3], a Japanese morphological analyzer.",
        "We extract only nouns, verbal nouns and verbs from this dictionary, and try to search for their translation equivalents in Chinese.",
        "One can build a new bilingual dictionary for a new pair of languages using two bilingual lexicons [4-8].",
        "Since it is always easier to get bilingual dictionaries that involve English as one of the languages, using English as a pivot language is possible.",
        "In this case, we first look for the English translations of one language, and then try to find the possible candidates in the other language through English.",
        "Then we rank the candidates according to the similarities between the two words using some linguistic knowledge and statistical information.",
        "In our research, we make use of two public resources, EDICT [9] - a Japanaese-English dictionary and CEDICT [10] - a Chinese-English dictionary, to create the new language pair Japanese-Chinese dictionary using English as a pivot language.",
        "We obtain 77% accuracy.",
        "However, this method extracts only translations for about 24% of the Japanese words in IPADIC because the EDICT and CEDICT dictionaries are smaller compared with IPADIC.",
        "Therefore, we also look into the possibility to get the translation words using kanji/hanzi conversion.",
        "In Japanese, there are three types of characters, namely hiragana, katakana and kanji.",
        "Kanji characters are similar to Chinese ideographs.",
        "In Chinese, all characters are written in hanzi.",
        "Since most of the kanji characters are originally from China, the usage should remain unchangeable in certain contexts.",
        "The kanji/hanzi conversion method works only on Japanese words that consist only kanji characters.",
        "We obtain a high accuracy of 97% using this conversion.",
        "By combining the two methods, we increase the number of translation candidates by 9%, from 24% to 33%."

        "Tanaka and Umemura [4] used English as an intermediate language to link Japanese and French.",
        "They are the first who proposed the inverse consultation.",
        "The concept behind is that a translation sometimes may have wider or narrower meaning than the source word.",
        "They first look up the English translations of a given Japanese word, then the French translations of these English translations.",
        "This step gives a set of French candidates equivalent to the Japanese word.",
        "For each French candidate, its translations in English is collected.",
        "The similarity between the Japanese word and the French word is measured by the number of matches in their English translation.",
        "The more matches show the better candidate.",
        "This is referred to as \"one time inverse consultation\".",
        "The extension can be furthered by looking up all the Japanese translations of all the English translation of a given French word and seeing how many times the Japanese word appears; this is referred to as \"two times inverse consultation\".",
        "Bond at al.",
        "[6] applied the \"one time inverse consultation\" in constructing a Japanese-Malay dictionary using a Japanese-English dictionary and a Malay-English dictionary.",
        "They also applied the semantic matching using part of speech and second-language matching.",
        "Matching only compatible parts of speech could cut down a lot of false matches.",
        "The second-language matching score used Chinese as a second intermediate language.",
        "If a word pair could be matched through two different languages, it is considered a very good match.",
        "Their research showed that about 80% of the translations are good if only highest rank pairs are considered, and 77% for all pairs.",
        "Shirai and Yamamoto [7] used English as an intermediate language to link Korean and Japanese.",
        "They tried on 1,000 Korean words and were able to obtain the translations for 365 of them.",
        "They achieved an accuracy of 72% when the degree of similarity calculated by one time inverse consultation is higher than a predefined threshold.",
        "Zhang et al.",
        "[8] used the same approach, that is using English as a pivot language, for constructing Japanese-Chinese pairs.",
        "They used the one time inverse consultation method and also the part of speech information for ranking.",
        "Since there is similarity between Japanese kanji and Chinese hanzi, they have further improved on the method by using the kanji information [11].",
        "First they searched for the Chinese translations of single character words in Japanese into using one time inverse consultation.",
        "If the Unicode of the two characters are the same, then the ranking is higher.",
        "After getting this list of character pairs, the similarity between the Japanese word and the Chinese word is calculated using the edit distance algorithm [12].",
        "Finally, the score obtained from the kanji information is added to the final score function.",
        "Their ranking method was improved and the precision increased from 66.67% to 81.43%.",
        "Since only about 50% of their Japanese words can be translated into Chinese, they also searched for other approaches to translate the remaining words [13] using web information and machines translation method.",
        "Our work is quite similar to Zhang et al.",
        "[11] in the way they constructed the kanji/hanzi conversion table.",
        "The difference is that instead of calculating the similarity between kanji and hanzi using Unicode and one time inverse consultation, we make a direct conversion from kanji to hanzi based on the ideographs.",
        "Our method sounds more intuitive and direct because kanji and hanzi are of the same origin.",
        "Later on, they made use of this conversion table to calcutate the similarity between a Japanese word and a Chinese word from the output of using English as the pivot language.",
        "Their method can make the similar Chinese words to have higher ranking but cannot generate new translation candidates.",
        "On the other hand, our methods works for both."

      "heading": "3. The Proposed Methods",
      "text": [
        "We propose to combine two methods to find the translations of Japanese entries in IPADIC version 2.7.0 [2].",
        "IPADIC is a monolingual dictionary and consists of 239,631 entries.",
        "We only extract nouns, verbal nouns and verbs (a total of 85,553 entries) in our survey.",
        "First, we use English as the pivot languege.",
        "Second, we make direct conversion from kanji to hanzi for kanji word translation.",
        "We now describe in detail the both methods.",
        "First, we use English as the pivot language to find the translations from Japanese to English, and then from English to Chinese.",
        "Since IPADIC is a monolingual dictionary, we use EDICT as the Japanese-English dictionary.",
        "The EDICT version (V05-001) consists of 110,424 entries.",
        "There exist some words that are polyse-mous with multiple entries.",
        "After combining the multiple entry words, we have 106,925 unique entries in the dictionary.",
        "For English to Chinese, we use the CE-DICT dictionary.",
        "It consists of 24,665 entries.",
        "A word can be polysemous in both",
        "C.-L.",
        "dictionary, meaning that for each word there is only one entry but with multiple translations.",
        "All the English translations of different senses are in the same record.",
        "We assume that a bilingual dictionary should be bi-directional, therefore we reverse the CEDICT dictionary to obtain an English-Chinese dictionary.",
        "The ranking method is the one time inverse consultation [4, 6-8].",
        "Since a word can be polysemous in both dictionaries, if a source word shares more English translations with the target translation word, then they can be considered nearer in meaning.",
        "The score is calculated as in equation (1): Let SE(J,Ci) denotes the similarity between the Japanese word J and the Chinese translation word candidate Ci, where E( J) and E(Ci) are the sets of English translations for J and Ci, respectively:",
        "Currently we do not apply the part of speech information in the scoring because this method requires linguistic experts to decide on the similarity between two part of speech tags for different languages.",
        "However, this will become part of our future work.",
        "Table 1 shows the results of using English as the pivot language and one time inverse consultation as the scoring function.",
        "Using the EDICT and CE-DICT only, 32,380 Japanese words obtain their Chinese translation candidates.",
        "In total, we obtain 149,841 pairs of translation.",
        "We get maximum 90 candidates for a Japanese word, and 4.6 candidates per word by average.",
        "Then we check the Japanese words in IPADIC to get their part of speech tags.",
        "We only investigate on three categories of part of speech tags from the IPADIC, which are nouns, verbal nouns and verbs.",
        "We randomly selected 200 Japanese words from each category for evaluation.",
        "The results are judged using 4 categories: Correct means that the first rank word is correct (if there are multiple words in the first rank, it is considered correct if any one of the words is correct), Not-first means that the correct word exists but not at the first rank, Acceptable means that the first rank word is acceptable, and Wrong means that all candidates are wrong.",
        "All the categories are exclusive of each other.",
        "Table 1.",
        "Ranking results",
        "There are about 24.3% of nouns, 31.3% of verbal nouns and 17.0% of verbs in IPADIC that give us some translation candidates in Chinese.",
        "For the evaluation using 200 randomly selected words, we obtain 88%, 69.5% and 73% accuracy, respectively.",
        "The accuracy is 76%, 45% and 50.5%, respectively, if we considered only the first rank.",
        "The accuracy is a bit lower compared with previous work as we did not apply other linguistic resources such as parts of speech for scoring.",
        "Although improving scoring function can make the rank of the correct words higher, it cannot further increase the number of candidates.",
        "Since both EDICT and CEDICT are prepared by different people, the way they translate the words also varies.",
        "Furthermore, there is no standization on the format.",
        "For example, to represent a verb in English, sometimes it is written in base form (e.g. \"discuss\"), and sometimes in infinitive form (e.g. \"to discuss\").",
        "In Chinese, and sometimes in Japanese too, a word shown in the dictionary can be a noun and a verb without inflection.",
        "The part of speech category can only be decided based on the usage in contexts.",
        "Therefore the same word may be translated into a noun in English too (e.g. \"discussion\").",
        "It happened too that we cannot find the matches just because of singular form or plural form (e.g. \"discussions\") of the English translation.",
        "With these non-standardization of the English translation, we cannot match the exact words unless we do a morphological analysis in English.",
        "Therefore, we also look for other ways to increase to number of candidates.",
        "Since Japanese and Chinese share some common characters (kanji in Japanese and hanzi in Chinese), we are looking into the possibility of direct conversion to create the translations.",

        "We should be able to get some acceptable translations of these words after removing the hiragana parts, but most of the cases we cannot obtain the best or good translations.",
        "From the 200 verbs that we used for the evaluation, 139 words exist in Chinese but only 35 are good and 43 are acceptable.",
        "The single characters used in these words are normally used only in ancient Chinese but not in contemporary Chinese.",
        "For example, J&^ls = Ife (eat) and faX h = (throw away), but iff (eat) and 1§r (throw away) in Chinese are also possible translation in certain contexts.",
        "Furthermore, the contemporary Chinese uses two character words more often than single character words even they have the same meaning.",
        "This is to reduce the semantic ambiguity as single character words tend to be polysemous.",
        "Therefore, direct kanji/hanzi conversion is not so appropriate and we need another approach to handle this type of words.",
        "We can apply the kanji/hanzi conversion method directly to most of the Japanese proper nouns, such as person names, organization names and place names because these names are normally written in kanji characters.",
        "Therefore, we do not need any effort to translate these words from Japanese to Chinese if we have the character conversion table.",
