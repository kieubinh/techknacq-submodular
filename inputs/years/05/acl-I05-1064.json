        "To understand a natural language dialogue, a dialogue system must be able to make out the speaker's intentions indicated by utterances.",
        "Since the speech act of an utterance is very important in understanding a speaker's intentions, it is an essential part of a dialogue system.",
        "However, it is difficult to infer the speech act from a surface utterance because the utterance may represent more than one speech act according to the context [5][7].",
        "Various machine learning models have been used to efficiently classify speech acts such as MEM (Maximum Entropy Model) [1], HMM (Hidden Markov Model) with Decision Tree [8][11], Neural Network Model [5].",
        "And there are also studies on methods of automatically selecting efficient features with useful information for speech acts analysis [5][10].",
        "Since the machine learning models can efficiently analyze a large quantity of data and consider many different feature interactions, they can provide a means of associating features of utterances with particular speech acts.",
        "Generally, it is hard to create enough the number of examples for each speech act in the training examples.",
        "Thus this situation has been one of the main causes for errors occurred in speech acts analysis.",
        "That is, the sparse data problem from low frequency of some speech acts has commonly occurred in the previous research [8].",
        "Due to the problem, the accuracy of each speech act in previous research tends to be proportional to the frequency of each speech act in the training data.",
        "Therefore, we first focus on how to scale up statistical learning methods to solve the sparseness problem of training data in speech acts analysis.",
        "Then we propose to construct the commonly-available hierarchies of speech acts and apply a well-understood technique from Statistics called shrinkage to our speech acts analysis system.",
        "It provides improved estimates of parameters that would otherwise be uncertain due to limited amounts of training data [3].",
        "The technique uses a hierarchy to shrink parameter estimates in data sparse children toward the estimates of the data-rich ancestors in ways that are probably optimal under the appropriate conditions [9].",
        "We employ a simple form of shrinkage that creates new parameter estimates for a child by a linear interpolation of all hierarchy nodes from the child to the root.",
        "In addition, discourse structure information can be used to identify the speech acts of utterances [1].",
        "But most previous research has used only speech acts of previous utterances without considering discourse structure information to determine the speech act of current utterance.",
        "Therefore, in order to use discourse structure information for analyzing speech acts, we design a simple discourse stack.",
        "By using the discourse stack, the discourse structure information is easily applied to speech acts analysis.",
        "In this paper, we propose a new speech acts analysis model to improve the performance by using shrinkage and discourse structure information.",
        "From the results of experiments, the proposed system showed significant improvement in comparison with previous research.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 explains the proposed speech acts analysis system in detail.",
        "In section 3, we discuss the empirical results in our experiments.",
