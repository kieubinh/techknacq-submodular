        "Different statistical models have been proposed in the past, but n-gram models (in particular, bi-gram and trigram models) still dominate SLM research.",
        "After that, other approaches were put forward, such as the combination of statistical-based approach and rule-based approach [4,5], self-adaptive language models [6], topic-based model [7] and cache-based model [8].",
        "But when the models are applied, the crucial disadvantages are that they can’t represent and process the semantic information of a natural language, so they can’t adapt well to the environment with changeful topics.",
        "Ontology was recognized as a conceptual modeling tool, which can descript an information system in the semantic level and knowledge level.",
        "After it was first introduced in the field of Artificial Intelligence[9], it was closed combined with natural language processing and are widely applied in many field such as knowledge engineering, digital library, information retrieval, semantic Web, and etc.",
