        "Automatic text summarization research has a long history that dates back to the late 50’s (Mani and Maybury, 1999).",

        "The summaries obtained with these techniques, so called extracts, have been used for judging the importance of the texts.",
        "We have started research on automatic summarization for the purpose of information dissemination, namely summarization of news texts for broadcast news.",
        "Recently, we have studied the entire manual summarization process of the Japan Broadcasting Corporation (NHK).",
        "NHK has been making manual summarizations of news text on a daily basis since December 2000, when it started satellite digital broadcasting.",
        "The summarized text has been used for the data service of the digital broadcasting and on Web pages accessible by mobile phones.",
        "We interviewed NHK’s professional abstractors and analyzed a considerable amount of news summaries.",
        "We matched these summaries with the original news and studied the summarization process based on the results of our analysis and interviews.",
        "In this paper, we report on what we found during the interviews with the abstractors and the results of the automatic text alignment between summaries and the original news together with the word position matching.",
        "We also propose a summarization model for an automatic or semi-automatic summarization system."

        "We asked professional abstractors about the summarization environment and process and in so doing discovered the following.",
        "• Abstractor",
        "The original news is written by NHK reporters, and the text is summarized by different writers, i.e., professional abstractors.",
        "Most professional abstractors are retired reporters who have expertise in writing news.",
        "• Compression rate and time allowance",
        "The original news is compressed to a maximum length of 105 Japanese characters.",
        "We will",
        "show in section 4 that the average compression rate is about 22.5%.",
        "The upper bound is decided from the display design of the data service of digital TV broadcasting.",
        "The abstractors must work quickly because the summary news must be broadcast promptly.",
        "• Techniques",
        "The abstractors use only information contained in the original news.",
        "They scan the original news quickly and repeatedly, not to understand the full content, but to select the parts to be used in the summary news.",
        "The abstractors’ special reading tendency has been reported in (Mani, 2001), and we can say the same tendency was observed in our Japanese abstractors.",
        "The abstractors focus on the lead (the opening part) of the original news.",

        "There have been several attempts to construct <summary text, original text> corpora (Marcu, 1999; Jing and McKeown, 1999).",
        "We decided to use the method proposed by Jing and McKeown (1999) for the reasons given below.",
        "As our abstractors mentioned that they used only information available in the original news, we hypothesize that the summary and the original news share many surface words.",
        "This indicates that the surface-word-based matching methods such as (Marcu, 1999; Jing and McKeown, 1999) will be effective.",
        "In particular, the word position matching realized in (Jing and McKeown, 1999) seems especially useful.",
        "We thought that we might be able to observe the summarization process precisely by tracing the word position links, and we employed their work with a little modification.",

        "In the following explanation, we use the notion of summary and text instead of summary news and original news for simplicity.",
        "(1) The word position in a summary is represented by <I>.",

        "If it appears, all of the positions in the text are stored in the form of <S, W> to form a position trellis.",
        "(4) Scan the n summary words from left to right and find the path on the trellis that maximizes the score of formula (1).",
        "This formula is the repeated product of the probability that the two adjacent words in a summary (Ii and Ii+1) appear at positions (S1, W1) and (S2, W2) in the text, respectively.",
        "This quantity represents the goodness of the summary and the text word matching.",

        "The lowest probability of 0.5 was given when two adjacent words in a summary appear in different sentences in the text with a certain distance or greater.",
        "We fixed the distance at two sentences, considering the average sentence count of the original news texts.",

        "Their method has a special treatment for a summary word that does not appear in the text.",
        "It assumes that such a word does not exist in the summary and therefore skips the trellis at this word with a probability of 1.",
        "This unfavorably biases news text that contains fewer matching words.",
        "To alleviate this problem, we experimentally found that the probability score of 0.55 works well for such a case (This score was the second smallest of the original six-grade score).",
