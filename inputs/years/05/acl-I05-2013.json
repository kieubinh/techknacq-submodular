        "A lot of research is dedicated to anaphora resolution since it is a crucial issue, for example, for Information Retrieval or Text Summarization.",
        "Among anaphora, third person pronouns are quite frequent and therefore widely studied.",
        "Pronoun il in French, it in English, can be used either \"impersonally\" (\"expletively\") (il pleut, it rains) or anaphorically (il est violet, it is purple).",
        "Therefore, authors who have developed a pronoun resolution system acknowledge that the impersonal pronoun occurrences must be recognized first, before dealing with anaphoric pronouns.",
        "There exists a number of works on the English pronoun it, among them (Lapin, Leass, 1994), (Kennedy, Bogurev, 1996) and (Evans 2001).",
        "However, no work has been done on the French pronoun il1.",
        "This paper presents a tool, ILIMP, which is designed to mark any occurrence of il with either tag [IMP] or tag [ANA] (for impersonal or anaphoric use, respectively).",
        "This tool is rule based (as it is the case for Lapin and Leass' system); it works on raw texts (contrarily to Lapin and Leass' system which relies on a syntactic analysis).",
        "If ILIMP is imperative for an anaphora resolution system, it is also a tool which can be integrated into a processing chain within a modular approach to syntactic analysis.",
        "First, it should be noted that [IMP] and [ANA] can be viewed as an enhancement of the part-of-speech tag set generally used in taggers: the tag “pronoun” would be replaced by two tags, “anaphoric pronoun” versus “impersonal (expletive) pronoun”.",
        "It is known that the richer the tag set is, the better would the syntactic analysis based on tagging be (Nasr, 2004).",
        "Moreover, it will be shown that tools derived from ILIMP can be used for other linguistic annotations.",
        "Section 2 presents the method, which is based, on linguistic grounds, on a French linguistic resource, the Lexicon-Grammar, and on computational grounds, on a tool, Unitex.",
        "Section 3 presents the realization of ILIMP, the",
        "difficulties which have been encountered and the choices made to solve them.",
        "Finally, Section 4 presents an evaluation of ILIMP and discusses its positioning within a modular syntactic analysis."
