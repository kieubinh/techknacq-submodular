        "Honorific agreement is one of the main properties of languages like Korean or Japanese, playing an important role in appropriate communication.",
        "This makes the deep processing of honorific information crucial in various computational applications such as spoken language translation and generation.",
        "We argue that, contrary to the previous literature, an adequate analysis of Korean honorification involves a system that has access not only to morpho-syntax but to semantics and pragmatics as well.",
        "Along these lines, we have developed a typed feature structure grammar of Korean (based on the framework of HPSG), and implemented it in the Linguistic Knowledge Builder System (LKB).",

        "Honorification, one of the main features of spoken language in Korean, plays a key role in proper and successful verbal communication (Chang 1996, Lee 1998, Sohn 1999).",
        "The Korean honorific system basically requires that when the subject is in the honorific form (usually with the marker -nim), the predicate also be inflected with the honorific form -(u)si as in (1):1 (1) a. sensayng-nim-i wus-usi-ess-e. teacher-HON-NOM laugh-HON-PST-DECL ‘The teacher laughed.’ b.#sensayng-nim-i wus-ess-e.",
        "This type of agreement is often assumed to be purely pragmatic, mainly because certain contexts allow disagreeing cases between the subject and the verb: the utterance of (1)b can be felicitous when the speaker does not honor the referent of the subject (marked by #).",
        "The possibility of having such disagreement has often to an assumption in the literature that using the -nim and -si form of verbs is a matter of gradience and appropriateness rather than grammaticality (cf. Chang 1996, Pollard and Sag 1994, Lee 1998).",
        "However, one often neglected fact is that this agreement constraint must be observed when the subject is non-human as in (2) (cf. Sohn 1999):",
        "If we rely only on pragmatic information, we would have difficulty understanding why, in contrast to the disagreement in (1)b, disagreement like that in (2) are rarely found in real language usages.",
        "In addition, there exist agreement-sensitive syntactic phenomena such as auxiliary verb constructions:",
        "c. sensayng-nim-i nolay-lul teacher-HON-NOM song-ACC pwulu-si-na po-(*si)-e. sing-HON-COMP seem-HON-DECL",
        "‘The teacher seems to sing a song.’ As noted here, even though the subject is honored in each case, the honorific marker on the main predicate in (3)a is optional with the auxiliary anh- ‘not’; in (3)b the marker must appear only on the auxiliary verb twu- ‘hold’; meanwhile in (3)c the marker cannot appear on the auxiliary po ‘seem’.",
        "Such clear contrasts, we can hardly attribute to pragmatic factors.2 2 Honorification in a Typed Feature Structure Grammar A closer look at the honorific phenomena of the language in the previous section suggests that an adequate theory of honorification aiming for integration into a proper communication system requires not just complex pragmatic information but also morpho-syntactic information.",
        "The basic framework of the grammar we adopt for modelling the language is the type-feature structure grammar of HPSG.",
        "HPSG seeks to model human languages as systems of constraints on typed feature structures.",
        "In particular, the grammar adopts the mechanism of a type hierarchy in which every linguistic sign is typed with appropriate constraints and hierarchically organized.",
        "This system then allows us to express cross-classifying generalizations about linguistic entities such as lexemes, stems, words, and phrases in the language (cf. Kim and Yang 2004, Kim 2004).",
        "2I n addition to this subject-verb agreement, the language employs addressee agreement marked on a verbal suffix depending on the honoring relationship between speaker and addressee.",
        "Such agreement, though implemented in our grammar, is not presented here because of space limit here."

        "Our grammar, named KPSG (Korean Phrase Structure Grammar), first assumes that a nominal with -nim and a verbal with -si bear the head feature specification [HON +].",
        "This is supported by the contrast in the following:",
        "As seen here, it is the honorific information on the head noun sensayng-nim in (4)a that agrees with that of the verb.",
        "With this head feature information, the grammar builds the honorific nominal type (n-hon) from the basic lexeme (n-lxm) as represented in the following feature structures:3",
        "As seen in (5)a, a nominal lexeme with no honorific marker -nim is underspecified for the HON feature.4 Meanwhile, the subject of an honorific verbal element carries the feature [HON +] in addition to the relevant pragmatic information: 3 The information our grammar encodes for such lexeme entries is only the shaded part: all the other information is inherited from its supertypes defined in the grammar.",
        "For a more comprehensive system of morphology built within such a system, see Kim (2004) and Kim and Yang (2004).",
        "4 The boxed number here is used as a way of showing that semantic value of the lexeme, n-lxm is identical with that of the honorific noun n-hon.",
        "The basic verbal lexeme type v-lxm in (6)a does not carry any restriction on its subject.",
        "However, as given in (6)b, the v-hon type with the -(u)si suffix adds the information that its subject (the first element in the ARG-ST (argument structure)) is [HON +], in addition to the information that the speaker is honoring the subject referent as given in the CTXT value.",
        "One of the key points in this system is that even though the [HON +] verb selects a [HON +] subject, the subject of a nonhonorific verb can be either in the honorific or nonhonorific form since its value is underspecified with respect to the verb.",
        "This then correctly allows disagreeing examples like (1)b where the subject is [HON +] and the verb’s HON value is ‘boolean’: (7) sensayng-nim-i wuc-ess-e. ‘The teacher laughed.’ The nonhonorific verb combines with the honorific subject with no honoring intention from the speaker since the nonhonorific verb does not bear the pragmatic constraint that the speaker honors the referent of the subject.",
