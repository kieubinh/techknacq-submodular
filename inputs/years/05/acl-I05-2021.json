        "We present the first known empirical test of an increasingly common speculative claim, by evaluating a representative Chinese-to-English SMT model directly on word sense disambiguationperformance, using standard WSD evaluation methodology and datasets from the Senseval-3 Chinese lexical sample task.",
        "Much effort has been put in designing and evaluating dedicated word sense disambiguation (WSD) models, in particular with the Senseval series of workshops.",
        "At the same time, the recent improvements in the BLEU scores of statistical machine translation (SMT) suggests that SMT models are good at predicting the right translation of the words in source language sentences.",
        "Surprisingly however, the WSD accuracy of SMT models has never been evaluated and compared with that of the dedicated WSD models.",
        "We present controlled experiments showing the WSD accuracy of current typical SMT models to be significantly lower than that of all the dedicated WSD models considered.",
        "This tends to support the view that despite recent speculative claims to the contrary, current SMT models do have limitations in comparison with dedicated WSD models, and that SMT should benefit from the better predictions made by the WSD models.",
        "Word sense disambiguation or WSD, the task of identifying the correct sense of a word in context, is a central problem for all natural language processing applications, and in particular machine translation: different senses of a word translate differently in other languages, and resolving sense ambiguity is needed to identify the right translation of a word.",
        "Much work has been done in building dedicated WSD models.",
        "The recent Senseval series of workshop promoted controlled comparison of very different WSD models with common accuracy metrics and common data sets.",
        "These efforts yielded steady improvements in WSD accuracy, but for WSD evaluated as a standalone task.",
        "Senseval focuses on the evaluation of standalone, generic WSD models, even though many application-specific systems – machine translation, information retrieval, and so on – all perform WSD either explicitly or implicitly.",
        "Since the Senseval models have been built and optimized specifically to address the WSD problems, they typically use richer disambiguating information than SMT systems.",
        "This, however, raises the question of whether the sophisticated WSD models are in fact needed in practice.",
        "In many machine translation architectures, in particular most current statistical machine translation (SMT) models, the WSD problem is typically not explicitly addressed.",
        "However, recent progress in machine translation and the continuous improvement on evaluation metrics such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) suggest that SMT systems are already very good at choosing correct word translations.",
        "BLEU score with low order n-grams can be seen as an evaluation of the translation adequacy, which suggests that as SMT systems achieve higher BLEU score, their ability to disambiguate word translations improves.",
        "In other work, we have been conducting comparative studies testing whether state-of-the-art WSD mod",
        "els can improve SMT translation quality (Carpuat and Wu, 2005).",
        "Using a state-of-the-art Chinese word sense disambiguation model to choose translation candidates for a typical IBM statistical MT system, we found that word sense disambiguation does not yield significantly better translation quality than the statistical machine translation system alone.",
        "The surprising difficulty of this challenge might suggest that SMT models are sufficiently strong at word level disambiguation on their own, and has recently encouraged speculation that SMT performs WSD as well as the dedicated WSD models.",
        "The studies described in this paper are aimed at directly testing this increasingly common speculation.",
        "The comparison of SMT and WSD strengths is not obvious; there are strong arguments in support of both the WSD and the SMT models.",
        "A controlled empirical comparison is therefore needed to better assess the strengths and weaknesses of each type of model on the WSD task.",
        "We therefore propose to evaluate statistical machine translation models on a WSD task, in terms of standard WSD accuracy metrics.",
        "This addresses the inverse, complementary question to the other study mentioned above (of whether WSD models can help SMT systems in terms of machine translation quality metrics).",
        "Senseval provides a good framework for this evaluation, and allows a direct comparison of the performance of the SMT model with state-of-the-art WSD models on a common dataset.",
        "We built a Chinese-to-English SMT system using freely available toolkits, and show that it does not perform as well as the WSD models specifically built for this task."

        "SMT models learn from large sets of bisentences but the correct word alignment between the two sentences is unknown.",

        "Sense distinctions and granularity are often manually predefined, which means that they can be adapted to the task at hand, but also that the translation candidates are limited to an existing set.",
        "To improve accuracy, dedicated WSD models typically employ features that are not limited to the local context, and that include more linguistic information than the surface form of words.",
        "For example, a typical dedicated WSD model might employ features as described by Yarowsky and Florian (2002) in their “feature-enhanced naive Bayes model”, with position-sensitive, syntactic, and local collocational features.",
        "The feature set made available to the WSD model to predict lexical choices is therefore much richer than that used by a statistical MT model.",
        "Also, dedicated WSD models can be supervised, which yields significantly higher accuracies than unsupervised.",
        "For the experiments described in this study we employed supervised training, exploiting the annotated corpus that was produced for the Senseval-3 evaluation.",
        "Again, this brief comparison shows that both models have important and very different strengths, which motivates our controlled empirical comparison of their WSD performance."
