        "A range of measures for corpus similarity have been put forward in past literature: (Kilgarriff and Rose 98; Kilgarriff 2001) investigated on the similarity of corpora and compared “Known Similarity Corpora” (KSC) using perplexity and cross-entropy on words, word frequency measures, and a x2-test which they found to be the most robust.",
        "However(as acknowledged in (Kilgarriff and Rose 98)), using KSC requires that the two corpora chosen for comparison are sufficiently similar that the most frequent lexemes in them almost perfectly overlap.",

        "(Denoual 2004) showed that similarity between corpora could be quantified with a coefficient based on the cross-entropies of probabilistic models built upon reference data.",
        "The approach needed no explicit selection of features and was language independent, as it relied on character based models (as opposed to word based models) thus bypassing the word segmentation issue and making it applicable on any electronic data.",
