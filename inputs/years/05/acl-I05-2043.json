        "In short, this paper is useful for recognizing trends in Japanese NLP and for constructing methods of supporting trend surveys using NLP.",
        "In the future, we would like to perform an international trend survey on natural language processing using international conference and journal papers such as IJCNLP, ACL, and the Journal of Computational Linguistics.",
        "We would also like to do trend surveys on other topics such as AI, biology, politics, and sociology.",
        "The kinds of investigations we did can easily be altered to do many other kinds of investigations as well.",
        "For example, we can use the dual scaling method by investigating the relationship between the reference years and the research organizations/areas.",
        "We can also use the representation in contour for the relationship between research organizations and research areas.",
        "Although we showed the data in ascending order of the average value of the published years, we could show the data in different order, for example, the order of the total number of papers or the order of the location, i.e., showing similar research organizations/areas that are located near each other by clustering research organizations/areas using their cooccurrent words.",
        "We would like to continue to study these kinds of support methods for trend surveys in the future."
