        "Trees as Important NLP Resources Domain specific words (DSWs) are important anchoring words for natural language processing applications that involve word sense disambiguation (WSD).",
        "It is appreciated that multi-sense words appearing in the same document tend to be tagged with the same word sense if they belong to the same common domain in the semantic hierarchy (Yarowsky, 1995).",
        "The existence of some DSWs in a document will therefore be a strong evidence of a specific sense for words within the document.",
        "For instance, the existence ofbasketball in a document would strongly suggest thesport sense of the word ^^ (Pistons), rather than itsmechanics sense.",
        "It is also a personal belief that DSW-based sense disambiguation, document classification and many similar applications would be easier than sense-based models since sense-tagged documents are rare while domain-aware training documents are abundant on the Web.",
        "DSW identification is therefore an important issue.",
        "On the other hand, the semantics hierarchy among words (especially among sets of domain specific words) as well as the membership of domain specific words are also important resources for general natural language processing applications, since the hierarchy will provide semantic links and ontological information (such asis-A andpart-of relationships) for words, and, domain specific words belonging to the same domain may have thesynonym or antonym relationships.",
        "A hierarchical lexicon tree (or a network, in general) (Fellbaum, 1998; Jurafsky and Martin, 2000), indicative of sets of highly associated domain specific words and their hierarchy, is therefore invaluable for NLP applications.",
        "Manually constructing such a lexicon hierarchy and acquiring the associated words for each node in the hierarchy, however, is most likely unaffordable both in terms of time and cost.",
        "In addition, new words (or new usages of words) are dynamically produced day by day.",
        "For instance, the Chinese word (pistons) is more frequently used as thesport or basketball sense (referring to theDetroit",
        "Pistons) in Chinese web pages rather than the mechanics orautomobile sense.",
        "It is therefore desirable to find an automatic and inexpensive way to construct the whole hierarchy.",
        "Since the hierarchical web pages provide semantic tag information (explicitly from the HTML/XML tags or implicitly from the directory names) and useful semantic links, it is desirable that the lexicon construction process could be conducted using the web corpora.",
        "Actually, the directory hierarchy of the Web can be regarded as a kind of classification tree for web documents, which assigns an implicit hidden tag (represented by the directory name) to each document and hence the embedded domain specific words.",
        "Converting such a hierarchy into a lexicon tree is therefore feasible, provided that we can remove non-specific terms from the associated document sets.",
        "For instance, the domain-specific words for documents under thesport hierarchy are likely to be tagged with asport tag.",
        "These tags, in turn, can be used in various word sense disambiguation (WSD) tasks and other hot applications like anti-spamming mail filters.",
        "Such rich annotation provides a useful knowledge source for mining various semantic links among words.",
        "We therefore will explore a non-conventional view for constructing a lexicon tree from the web hierarchy, where domain-specific word identification turns out to be a key issue and the first step toward such a construction process.",

        "Terms of high association are then clustered bottom-up using some clustering techniques to build the hierarchy.",
        "The clustered hierarchy is then submitted to lexicographers to assign a semantic label to each sub-cluster.",
        "The cost will be reduced in this way, but could still be unaffordable.",
        "Besides, it still depends on the lexicographers to assign appropriate semantic tags to the list of highly associated words.",
        "There are several disadvantages with this approach.",
        "Firstly, the hierarchical relationship among the web documents, and hence the embedded DSWs, is lost during the document collection process, since the words are collected without considering where they come from in the document hierarchy.",
        "The loss of such hierarchical information implies that the clustered one will not match human perception quite well.",
