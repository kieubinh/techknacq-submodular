        "Fluent dialogues require effective turn transitions between speakers.",
        "Research in turn-taking, typified by (Duncan, 1974), posits several key signals for turn-taking, including a turn-change signal which offers to cede the floor, speaker-state signal which indicates taking the floor, within-turn signal, and continuation signals.",
        "This process fundamentally requires cooperation between participants both to produce the contextually appropriate signals and to interpret those of their interlocutor.",
        "These analyses have proposed a wide range of cues to turn status, ranging from gaze and gesture in a multi-modal context to prosodic cues including pitch, intensity, and duration as well as lexical and syntactic cues.",
        "Much of this fundamental research as well as computational implementations have focused on English, a language with well-studied intonational sentence and discourse structure.",
        "A substantial body of work has identified sentence-like units as well as fragments and repairs in conversational speech, including (Ostendorf, forthcoming; Liu et al., 2004; Shriberg et al., 2001) These approaches have employed lexical and prosodic cues in diverse frameworks, including Hidden Markov Models employing decision trees and hidden state language models, neural networks, and maximum entropy models.",
        "(Shriberg et al., 2001) identified jump-in points and jump-in words in multi-party meeting speech using prosodic and language model features at accuracies of 65 and 77% under equal priors.",
        "Furthermore, (Ward and Tsukahara, 2000) demonstrated that backchannels occurred at predictable points"

        "Fluent dialogue requires that speakers successfully negotiate and signal turn-taking.",
        "While many cues to turn change have been proposed, especially in multi-modal frameworks, here we focus on the use of prosodic cues to these functions.",
        "In particular, we consider the use of prosodic cues in a tone language, Mandarin Chinese, where variations in pitch height and slope additionally serve to determine word meaning.",
        "Within a corpus of spontaneous Chinese dialogues, we find that turn-unit final syllables are significantly lower in average pitch and intensity than turn-unit initial syllables in both smooth turn changes and segments ended by speaker overlap.",
        "Interruptions are characterized by significant prosodic differences from smooth turn initiations.",
        "Furthermore, we demonstrate that these contrasts correspond to an overall lowering across all tones in final position, which largely preserves the relative heights of the lexical tones.",
        "In classification tasks, we contrast the use of text and prosodic features.",
        "Finally, we demonstrate that, on balanced training and test sets, we can distinguish turn-unit final words from other words at R 93% accuracy and interruptions from smooth turn unit initiations at 62% accuracy.",
        "with specific prosodic characteristics in both English and Japanese.",
        "In the current paper, we consider the interaction of potential prosodic intonational cues related to turn-taking with the realization of lexical tone in a tone language, Putonghua or Mandarin Chinese.",
        "Mandarin employs four canonical lexical tones distinguished by pitch height and pitch contour: high level, mid-rising, low falling-rising, and high falling.",
        "We explore whether prosodic features are also employed in turn-taking behavior in this language and whether the forms are comparable to those employed in languages with lexical tone.",
        "We demonstrate that intonational cues quite similar to those in English are also employed in Chinese with lower pitch and intensity at ends of turn units than at the beginnings of those turn units.",
        "Interruptions likewise are distinguished from smooth turn transitions by prosodic means, including greater pitch elevation.",
        "We demonstrate how these changes interact with lexical tone by substantial lowering of average pitch height across all tones in final positions and contrast pitch contours in final and non-final positions.",
        "Finally, these cues in conjunction with silence and durational features can be employed to distinguish turn-unit final words from non-final words in the dialogue and words that initiate interruptions from those which start smoother turn transitions.",
        "In the remainder of the paper we will briefly describe the data set employed in these experiments and the basic extraction of prosodic features (Section 2).",
        "We then present acoustic analyses contrasting turn unit final and turn unit initial syllables under different turn transition types (Section 3).",
        "We will describe the impact of these intonational cues on the realization of lexical tone (Section 4).",
        "Finally we will apply these prosodic contrasts to enable classification of words for finality and interruption status (Section 5)."

        "The elevation of initial pitch is further enhanced in interruptions, when a new speaker seizes the floor beginning with an overlap of the current speaker.",
        "These contrasts are similar to those observed for English, and consistent with signals described in the literature.",
        "These changes result in an overall reduction in pitch for syllables in final position across all tones, but relative pitch height employed by lexical tone is preserved in most cases.",
        "Finally, we employed these cues to train classifiers to distinguish turn unit final words from other words in the dialogue and to distinguish interruption initial words from initial words in smooth transitions with no overlap.",
        "We further contrasted the utility of text and prosodic features for the identification of turn boundary position and type.",
        "We find that silence is the most reliable cue both to identify final turn boundaries and to distinguish types of turn transitions.",
        "In conjunction with silence features, text, prosodic, and joint text-prosodic features can fare comparably.",
        "However, for turn unit boundaries, the availability of a variety of prosodic features proves to be essential for relatively better classification in the absence of silence information.",
        "In future work, we plan to enhance tone recognition by better contextual modeling that will compensate for the effects of a variety of discourse boundaries, including turn and topic, on tone realization.",
        "We also plan to embed turn-based classification in a sequential discriminative model to further facilitate integration of prosodic and lexical features as well as sequence constraints on turn structure."
