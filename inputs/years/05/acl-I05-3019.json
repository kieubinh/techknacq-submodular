        "The underlying algorithm in our word segmentation system is the unigram language model in which words in a sentence are assumed to occur independently.",
        "For an input sentence, we examine all possible ways to segment the new sentence with respect to the segmentation dictionary, and choose the segmentation of the highest probability, which is estimated based on the unigram model.",
        "Our system also has a few preprocessors and postprocessors.",
        "The main preprocessors include recognizers for extracting names of people, places and organizations, and recognizer for numeric expressions.",
        "The proper name recognizers are built based on the maximum entropy model, and the numeric expression recognizer is built as a finite state automaton.",
        "The conditional maximum entropy model in our implementation is based on the one described in Section 2.5 in (Ratnaparkhi, 1998), and features are the same as those described in (Xue and Shen, 2003).",
        "One of the post-processing steps is to combine single characters in the initial segmentation if each character in a sequence of characters occurs in a word much more frequently than as a word on its own.",
        "The other post-processing procedure checks the segmentation of a text fragment in the input text against the segmentation in the training data.",
        "If the segmentation produced by our system is different from the one in the training data, we will use the segmentation in the training data as the final segmentation.",
        "More details on the segmentation algorithm and the preprocessors and postprocessors can be found in (Chen, 2003).",
        "Our system processes a sentence independently.",
        "For an input sentence, the preprocessors are applied to the input sentence to extract numeric expressions and proper names.",
        "The extracted numeric expressions and proper names are added to the segmentation dictionary, if they are not already in the dictionary.",
        "Then the input sentence is segmented into words.",
        "Finally the post-processing procedures are applied to the initial segmentation to produce the final segmentation.",
        "Our system processes texts encoded in UTF-8; and it is used in all 8 tasks."
