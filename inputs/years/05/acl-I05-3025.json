        "The Chinese word segmenter we built is similar to the maximum entropy word segmenter we employed in our previous work (Ng and Low, 2004).",
        "Our word segmenter uses a maximum entropy framework (Ratnaparkhi, 1998; Xue and Shen, 2003) and is trained on manually segmented sentences.",
        "It classifies each Chinese character given the features derived from its surrounding context.",
        "Each Chinese character can be assigned one of four possible boundary tags: s for a character that occurs as a single-character word, b for a character that begins a multi-character (i.e., two or more characters) word, e for a character that ends a multi-character word, and m for a character that is neither the first nor last in a multi-character word.",

      "heading": "1.1 Basic Features",
      "text": [
        "The basic features of our word segmenter are similar to our previous work (Ng and Low, 2004):",
        "(a) Cn(n = −2, −1,0,1,2) (b) CnCn+1 (n = −2, −1, 0,1) (c) C-1C1 (d) Pu(C0) (e) T(C-2)T(C-1)T(C0)T(C1)T(C2)",
        "In the above feature templates, C refers to a Chinese character.",
        "Templates (a) – (c) refer to a context of five characters (the current character and two characters to its left and right).",
        "C0 denotes the current character, Cn(C – n ) denotes the character n positions to the right (left) of the current character.",
        "For example, given the character sequence “, t jS”, when considering the character C0 “fit”, C-2 denotes ”IW”, C1C2 denotes “j� S%”, etc.",
        "The punctuation feature, Pu(C0), checks whether C0 is a punctuation symbol (such as “?”, “–”, “,”).",
        "For the type feature (e), four type classes are defined: numbers represent class 1, dates (“ F1”, “A ”, “'”, the Chinese characters for “day”, “month”, “year”, respectively) represent class 2, English letters represent class 3, and other characters represent class 4.",
        "For example, when considering the character “4H'” in the character sequence “ fL,T ��R”,the feature T(C-2) ...T(C2) = 11243",
        "will be set to 1 (“ �L” is the Chinese character for “9” and “T” is the Chinese character for “0”).",
        "Besides these basic features, we also made use of character normalization.",
        "We note that characters like punctuation symbols and Arabic digits have different character codes in the ASCII, GB, and BIG5 encoding standard, although they mean the same thing.",
        "For example, comma “,” is represented as the hexadecimal value 0x2c in ASCII, but as the hexadecimal value 0 x a 3 a c in GB.",
        "In our segmenter, these different character codes are normalized and replaced by the corresponding character code in ASCII.",
        "Also, all Arabic digits are replaced by the ASCII digit “0” to denote any digit.",
        "Incorporating character normalization enables our segmenter to be more robust against the use of different encodings to represent the same character.",
        "For all the experiments that we conducted, training was done with a feature cutoff of 2 and 100 iterations, except for the AS corpus which had a feature cutoff of 3.",
        "A major difficulty faced by a Chinese word segmenter is the presence of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words.",
        "Segmenting a text with many OOV words tends to result in lower accuracy.",
        "We address the problem of OOV words in two ways: using an external dictionary containing a list of predefined words, and using additional training corpora which are not segmented according to the same segmentation standard."

        "If a sequence of characters in a sentence matches a word in an existing dictionary, it may be a clue that the sequence of characters should be segmented as one word.",
        "We used an online dictionary from Peking University downloadable from the Internet2, consisting of about 108,000 words of length one to four characters.",
        "If there is some sequence of neighboring characters around C0 in the sentence that matches a word in this dictionary, then we greedily choose the longest such matching word W in the dictionary.",
        "Let t0 be the boundary tag of C0 in W, L the number of characters in W, and C1 (C-1) be the character",
        "immediately following (preceding) C0 in the sentence.",

        "For example, consider the sentence “.'i It\" �± IL5P.... ”.",
        "When processing the current character C0 “Ift\"”, we will attempt to match the following candidate sequences “Ift\"”, “��”, “��”, “� �t” ,“ t��” , “.T�t��”, and “����” against existing words in our dictionary.",
        "Suppose both “i fit” and “M � fit” are found in the dictionary.",

        "The presence of different standards in Chinese word segmentation limits the amount of training corpora available for the community, due to different organizations preparing training corpora in their own standards.",
        "Indeed, if one uniform segmentation standard were adopted, more training data would have been available, and the OOV problem could be significantly reduced.",
        "We observed that although different segmentation standards exist, the differences are limited, and many words are still segmented in the same way across two different segmentation standards.",
        "As such, in our work, we attempt to incorporate corpora from other segmentation standards as additional training data, to help reduce the OOV problem.",

        "5.",
        "Evaluate the accuracy of the new word segmenter on the same test data annotated in the original segmentation standard of Do.",
        "For the current bakeoff, when training a word segmenter on a particular training corpus, the additional training corpora are all the three corpora in the other segmentation standards.",
        "For example, when training a word segmenter for the AS corpus, the additional training corpora are CITYU, MSR, and PKU.",
        "The necessary character encoding conversion between GB and BIG5 is performed, and the probability threshold θ is set to 0.8.",
        "We found from our experiments that setting θ to a higher value did not further improve segmentation accuracy, but would instead increase the training set size and incur longer training time."

        "During testing, the probability of a boundary tag sequence assignment ti ... tn given a character sequence Cl ... Cn is determined by using the maximum entropy classifier to compute the probability that a boundary tag ti is assigned to each individual character Ci.",
        "If we were to just assign each character the boundary tag with the highest probability, it is possible that the classifier produces a sequence of invalid tags (e.g., m followed by s).",
        "To eliminate such possibilities, we implemented a dynamic programming algorithm which considers only valid boundary tag sequences given an input character sequence.",
        "At each character position i, the algorithm considers each last word candidate ending at position i and consisting of K characters in length (K = 1, ... , 20 in our experiments).",
        "To determine the boundary tag assignment to the last word W with K characters, the first character of W is assigned boundary tag b, the last character of W is assigned tag e, and the intervening characters",
        "are assigned tag m. (If W is a single-character word, then the single character is assigned tag s).",
        "In this way, the dynamic programming algorithm only considers valid tag sequences.",
        "After word segmentation is done by the maximum entropy classifier, a post-processing step is applied to correct inconsistently segmented words made up of 3 or more characters.",
        "A word W is defined to be inconsistently segmented if the concatenation of 2 to 6 consecutive words elsewhere in the segmented output document matches W. In the post-processing step, the segmentation of the characters of these consecutive words is changed so that they are segmented as a single word.",
        "To illustrate, if the concatenation of 2 consecutive words “ TF ” and “Ir5l” in the segmented output document matches another word “TMIt”, then the 2 consecutive words “W” and “��” will be re-segmented as a single word “*41 rA”."
