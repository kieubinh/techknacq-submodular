        "A knowledgebase which systemizes lexical and conceptual information of human knowledge is a basic infrastructure for Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications.",
        "Wordnets, pioneered by the Princeton WordNet (WN, Fellbaum 1998), and greatly enriched by EuroWordnet (EWN, Vossen 1998), have become the standard for a lexical knowledgebase enriched with lexical semantic relations.",
        "In addition to the multilingual architecture of EWN, there are some proposals to construct the expansion for monolingual wordnets to parallel wordnet systems, such as Pianta and Girardi (2002).",
        "However, the construction of multilingual wordnets eventually faces the challenge of low-density languages, which is dealt with in Huang, et al.",
        "(2002).",
        "Low-density languages, as opposed to high-density languages, usually refer to languages that are not spoken by a large number of people.",
        "However, there is neither a direct correspondence between language population and language technology, nor an objective population number that defines density level.",
        "In this work, we use the availability of language resources instead to define language density.",
        "That is, low-density languages are languages that do not have enough language resources to support fully automated language processing, such as machine translation.",
        "In our current line of work, we (Huang et al.",
        "2002) refer to low-density languages as those which do not have enough existing resources for semi-automatic construction of monolingual wordnet.",
        "There are two alternative approaches to build parallel wordnets, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "The first approach relies on two fully annotated monolingual wordnets with synsets and LSR’s.",
        "The second approach requires only one fully annotated WN in addition to LSR-based cross-lingual translation correspondences.",
        "Approach I maps and pairs Language A synsets with Language B synsets and annotates cross-lingual LSR’s.",
        "The result is a fully annotated parallel wordnet.",
        "Approach II maps language A synsets to language B through translation equivalents.",
        "After language B synsets are thus established, language B LSR’s are predicted based on corresponding LSR’s in language A.",
        "A new set of monolingual LSR’s is bootstrapped and predicted basing on inference rules governed by translation LSR’s (T-LSR’s).",
        "In general, approach I applies to high-density languages while approach II applies to low-density languages.",
        "In this paper, we will focus on the application of approach II to build a Chinese Wordnet with conceptual cohesion.",
        "The current model was first explored in Huang et al.",
        "(2003).",
        "This previous study covered 210 lemmas, consisted of the top ranked lemmas in each part-of-speech (POS).",
        "The translation LSR’s discussed in the previous model were antonymy, hypernymy and hyponymy.",
        "In this current work, we expand our study to all possible LSR’s as well as to all the bilingual lexical pairs in our English-Chinese translation equivalents databases.",
        "Moreover, the LSR’s in Princeton WordNet are again used as the basis for bootstrapping.",
        "In addition, we establish a set of evaluation for the results.",
        "The approach will be evaluated in term of both the precision of prediction and the confidence of prediction.",
        "We aim to show that T-LSR’s bootstrapped approach does provide an effective model for building parallel wordnets for low-density languages.",
        "After the introduction, the main part of this paper consists of the following sections: in section 2, we briefly introduce the existing resources required for this work.",
        "We discuss methodology of T-LSR bootstrapping step by step in section 3.",
        "A series of LSR-predicting inference rules are also given in this section.",
        "In section 4, we plan to evaluate the results of our experiment and demonstrate the feasibility of maintaining conceptual cohesion in cross-lingual LSR mapping."

        "As we mentioned above, WN does not only express the knowledge of lexicons but also cover the semantic relations of lexicons.",
        "Therefore, in order to present such semantic relations clearly and logically, Huang (2002) proposed to use cross-lingual Lexical Semantic Relations (LSRs) to predict the semantic relations in the target language.",
        "The proposed framework is shown in Diagram 1.",

        "LSR i and ii are the T-LSRs stipulating the semantic relations between the head words and their Chinese TEs.",
        "In WN, each synset is linked to a network of their synsets through a number of LSR’s.",
        "Hence, we use LSR x to represent the semantic relation",
        "between EW 1 and EW2.",
        "The four LSR’s form a closed network that includes three know LSR’s: two T-LSRs, i and ii, and one English LSR, x, from WN.",
        "The only unknown LSR is y, the semantic relation between CW1 and CW2.",
        "Huang et al. (2002) claimed that LSR y can be inferred as a functional combination of the three LSRs - i, x and ii.",
        "Language translation does not only involve the semantic correspondences but also the human decision in choosing translation equivalents that are affected by the social and cultural factors.",
        "Our main priority in this paper is to infer the lexical semantic information across different language rather than the translational idiosyncrasies, so the elements regarding translational idiosyncrasies are excluded here.",
        "In order to simplify the complexity of LSR combination and get a better prediction of LSR, here, we only take account of the situations when LSR ii is exactly equivalent, EW2=CW2 or ii=0.",
        "Therefore, we have a reduced model of the translation-mediated LSR Prediction as shown in diagram 2.",
        "Synonym, hypernym, hyponym, holonym, meronym and near-synonym are the main semantic relations that we will discuss in the following sections.",
        "First of all, we would like to discuss the foundational situation of LSR prediction, synonym, as shown in diagram 3.",
        "When translation LSR i is exactly equivalent, i.e. CW1=EW1, and LSR ii is also exactly equivalent, i.e. EW2=CW2, the LSR combination, LSR y, is directly inherited the semantic relation of LSR x.",
        "As shown in diagram 4 above, according to the ECTED, the English head word ‘thin’ is exactly equivalent with ‘shou4’ in Chinese.",
        "The LSR x between EW 1 and EW2 in WN is marked ‘ANT’ which means ‘fat’ is the antonym of ‘thin.’ Therefore, according to the prediction in diagram 3, we can infer that the CW2 (fei2pang4de5) is the antonym of CW1 (shou4).",
        "The above inference can also be applied to another example in diagram 4.",
        "The LSR prediction in WN plays a very crucial role in determining the unknown LSR y.",
        "Even an English head word may have more than one sense, it is still very clear to infer the LSR between the TEs.",
        "However, there is a potential problem within this inference.",
        "If a head word has more than one Chinese TEs which can all correspond to the head word, there might be a problem to consider whether those TEs are really synonyms.",
        "However, the situation is not always that ideal as above.",
        "When the Chinese translation equivalents and the corresponded English synset have a non-identical semantic relation, CW 1 EW 1, the prediction of LSR y needs to be considered further and carefully.",
        "Logically, hypernym and hyponym are symmetric semantic relations.",
        "For instance, if A is a hypernym of B, B is a hyponym of A.",
        "For instance, as shown in diagram 5, the English word ‘nick’ is the hypernym of the Chinese term ‘shang1kou3’ and ‘cut’ is the hypernym of ‘nick’ in WN and the exact translation equivalent of ‘cut’ in Chinese is ‘jian3kai1.’ According to the logicality, ‘jian3kai1’ is the hypernym of ‘shang1kou3.’ The example of hyponym is shown in diagram 6.",
        "Due to the varied semantic relations in WN, the inferences of LSRs , the unknown LSR y = i + x ,for hypernym, hyponym, near-synonym, holonym, and mernoym are listed as below: Hypernym(HYP)",
        "(a) IF x=ANT LSR y =HYP +ANT =ANT (CW2 is the antonym of CW1.)",
