        "We focus on two features of our system: the demand for “loose paraphrases” between the various reports on a given patient, with a high degree of semantic overlap but some necessary amount of distinctive content; and the requirement for paraphrasing at primarily the discourse level."

        "Patient records are typically large collections of documents that reflect the medical history of a patient over a period of time.",
        "On average, the electronic patient record of a cancer patient contains information from over 150 documents, representing consult notes, referral letters, letters to and from the patient’s GP, hospital admission and discharge notes, laboratory test results, surgery and other treatment descriptions, and drug dispensing notes.",
        "Although each document in this collection will have a specified purpose, there tends to be a high degree of redundancy between documents, but the sheer volume of information makes access extremely difficult.",
        "The work presented in this paper is part of the Clinical E-Science Framework project (CLEF), which aims at providing tools to facilitate easy access to a patient’s medical history.",
        "In particular, we describe a natural language generation system that produces a range of summarised reports of patient records from data-encoded views of patient histories which we call chronicles.",
        "Although we are concentrating on cancer patients, we aim to produce good quality reports without the need to construct extensive domain models.",
        "Our typical user is a GP or clinician who uses electronic patient records at the point of care to familiarise themselves with a patient’s medical history and current situation.",
        "A number of specific requirements arise from this particular setting:",
        "• Reports that provide a quick potted overview of the patient’s history are essential; this type of report should not be too long (ideally they should fit entirely on a computer screen) and should take less than a minute to read; • At the same time, a complete view of the medical history must always be available on demand; • Clinicians often need to examine a patient’s history from a particular perspective (e.g., tests administered, treatments undertaken, drugs prescribed), and having focussed reports is also a requirement; • Reports should be formatted to enhance readability; • The selection of events for inclusion in a report should follow some basic rules:",
        "– Events that deviate from what is considered to be normal are more important than normal events (for example, an examination of the lymphnodes that reveals lymphadenopathy is more important than an examination that doesn’t).",
        "– Some events are more important than others and should not only be included in the report but also highlighted (e.g., through colour coding, graphical timelines or similar display features).",
        "– Less important events should be available on a need-to-know basis These requirements impose important restrictions on the content of the reports and implicitly on the variety of lexical and syntactical devices we can employ: (a) the veracity of the report is essential, therefore we are not at liberty to employ synonymy or lexical paraphrasing that may alter (however slightly) the meaning of the original input, (b) we are required to maintain a certain syntactical ordering throughout a report in order to allow the user to quickly scan through the report with ease, and (c) we have to produce several types of reports from the same input data.",
        "In this paper, we focus on this last requirement, describing the methods we employ for reformulating content according to the type and focus of the generated report."

        "The process of content selection is currently driven by two parameters of a report: type and length.",
        "We define the concept of report spine to represent a list of concepts that are essential to the construction of a given type of report.",
        "For example, in a report of the diagnoses, all events of type Problem will be part of the spine.",
        "Events linked to the spine through some kind of relation may or may not be included in the summary, depending on the type and length of the summary (see Figure 1).",
        "The design of the system does not restrict the spine to containing only events of the same type.",
        "In future extensions to the system where the user will be able to select facts they want in the summary, a spine could contain, for example, problems of type cancer, investigations of type x-ray and interventions of type surgery.",
        "Spines are not predefined templates, but structures that are constructed dynamically with each request and they depend on the type of request and on the length of the summary.",
        "Important events are selected according to semantic relations.",
        "The first step in the selection process is to cluster related events based on the relations stored in the chronicle.",
        "A cluster of events may tell us, for example, that a patient was diagnosed with cancer following a clinical examination, for which she had a mastectomy to remove the tumour, was given a histopathological test of the removed tumour, which confirmed the cancer, and had a complete radiotherapy course to treat the cancer; the radiotherapy caused an ulcer, which in turn was treated with some drug.",
        "A typical chronicle contains a small number of clusters, typically one or two large clusters and several small ones.",
        "Smaller clusters are generally not related to the main thread of events.",
        "The summarisation process starts with the removal of small clusters, which in the current implementation are defined as clusters containing at most three events4.",
        "This excludes some specified types of information that will be included in the report even when they only appear in short clusters; for example, all reports will contain essential information such as the initial diagnosis and the cause of death (if available).",

        "Each cluster of events is a graph, with some nodes representing spine events.",
        "For each cluster, the spine events are selected, as well as all nodes that are at a distance of less than n from spine events,",
        "where the depth n is a user-defined parameter used to adjust the size of the report.",
        "For example, in the cluster presented in Fig. 2, assuming a depth value of 1, the content selector will choose cancer, left breast and radiotherapy but not radiotherapy cycle or ulcer.",
        "A document plan is typically a hierarchical structure that contains and combines the messages to be conveyed by the report generator.",

        "These rules facilitate the construction of a partial rhetorical structure tree.",
        "Messages that are not connected in the tree are by default assumed to be in a List relation to other messages in the group, and their position is set arbitrarily.",

        "However, this level of aggregation that only takes into account the semantics of individual messages may be not enough, since clinical examinations are performed repeatedly and consist of the same types of investigation.",
        "Two approaches have been implemented in the Report Generator, both of which make use of domain specific rules.",

        "Reports that are required at the point of care (e.g., for a doctor interviewing a newly referred patient, or a team of medics on ward rounds) are likely to be short “30-second” potted histories.",
        "At other times longer, more detailed reports will be required, as will reports that focus on particular aspects of the patient’s “journey” through their disease (e.g., from the perspective of the diagnoses that have been made, the drugs they have been prescribed, or surgery they have undergone).",
        "The system is fully implemented in Java and currently generates this full range of reports on-the-fly.",
        "A summarised report based on about 1000 input events is constructed in less than 2 seconds, a speed which is highly appropriate to the demands of clinical practice.",
        "While the various types of generated report all share the same input (i.e., the patient’s chronicle), and thus will have a large degree of conceptual overlap, clearly there will be occassions when information that is included in some reports will not be in others.",
        "The range of reports for any given patient at any given point in their illness thus present a special class of paraphrase, with a looser adherance to semantic equivalence between versions than is typically found in other paraphrase generators, for example Kozlowski et al. (2003), McKeown et al. (1994), Power, Scott and Bouyaad-Agha (2003), Rosner and Stede (1994),(1996), and Scott and Souza (1990).",
        "In this sense, our Report Generator is rather closer in spirit to Hovy’s PAULINE system, which generates descriptions of given news events from different perspectives and with different stylistic goals (Hovy, 1988).",
        "However, we achieve our goal with less reliance on terminological variation and more on structural variation at the discourse level.",
        "Syntactic variation, where it does occur, is almost always simply a side-effect of an earlier discourse choice.",
