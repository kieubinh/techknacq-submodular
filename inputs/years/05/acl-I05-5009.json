        "This paper proposes a method to evaluate whether a paraphrasing pair is contextually independent.",
        "Evaluating a paraphrasing pair is important when we extract paraphrases from a corpus or apply a paraphrase to a sentence, since we must guarantee that the paraphrase carries almost the same meaning.",
        "However, the meaning carried by a sentence is affected by its context.",
        "Thus, we focus on the contextual dependency of paraphrases.",
        "A thing can be expressed by various expressions, and a single idea can be paraphrased in many ways to enrich its expression or to increase understanding.",
        "Paraphrasing plays a very important role in natural language expressions.",
        "However, it is very hard for machines to handle different expressions that carry the same meaning.",
        "The importance of paraphrasing has been widely acknowledged, and many paraphrasing studies have been carried out.",
        "Using only surface similarity is insufficient for evaluating paraphrases because there are not only surface differences but many other kinds of differences between paraphrased sentences.",
        "Thus, it is not easy to evaluate whether two sentences carry almost the same meaning.",
        "Some studies have constructed and evaluated handmade rules (Takahashi et al., 2001; Ohtake and Yamamoto, 2001).",
        "Others have tried to extract paraphrases from corpora (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Lin and Pantel, 2001), which are very useful because they enable us to construct paraphrasing rules.",
        "In addition, we can construct an example-based or a Statistical Machine Translation (SMT)-like paraphrasing system that utilizes paraphrasing examples.",
        "Thus, collecting paraphrased examples must be continued to achieve high-performance paraphrasing systems.",
        "Several methods of acquiring paraphrases have been proposed (Barzilay and McKeown, 2001; Shimohata and Sumita, 2002; Yamamoto, 2002).",
        "Some use parallel corpora as resources to obtain paraphrases, which seems a promising way to extract high-quality paraphrases.",
        "However, unlike translation, there is no obvious paraphrasing direction.",

        "When extracting paraphrasing pairs from corpora, whether the paraphrasing pairs are con",
        "textually dependent paraphrases is a serious problem, and thus there is a specific paraphrase direction for each pair.",
        "In addition, it is also important to evaluate a paraphrasing pair not only when extracting but also when applying a paraphrase.",
        "Consider this example, automatically extracted from a corpus: Can I pay by traveler’s check?",
        "/ Do you take traveler’s checks?",
        "This example seems contextually independent.",
        "On the other hand, here is another example: I want to buy a pair of sandals.",
        "/ I’m looking for sandals.",
        "This example seems to be contextually dependent, because we don’t know whether the speaker is only looking for a single pair of sandals.",
        "In some contexts, the latter sentence means that the speaker is seeking or searching for sandals.",
        "In other words, the former sentence carries specific meaning, but the latter carries generic meaning.",
        "Thus, the paraphrasing sentences are contextually dependent, and although the paraphrasing direction from specific to generic might be acceptable, the opposite direction may not be.",
        "We can solve part of this problem by inferring the contexts of the paraphrasing sentences.",
        "A text model with latent variables can be used to infer the topic of a text, since latent variables correspond to the topics indicated by texts.",
        "We assume that a topic indicated by a latent variable of a text model can be used as an approximation of context.",
        "Needless to say, however, such an approximation is very rough, and a more complex model or more powerful approach must be developed to achieve performances that match human judgement in evaluating paraphrases.",
        "The final goal of this study is the evaluation of paraphrasing pairs based on the following two factors: contextual dependency and paraphrasing direction.",
        "In this paper, however, as a first step to evaluate paraphrasing pairs, we focus on the evaluation of contextual dependency by using probabilistic Latent Semantic Indexing (pLSI) (Hofmann, 1999) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003) as text models with latent variables."

        "showed that LDA outperforms pLSI in (Blei et al., 2003); however, in some of the cases shown in Tables 2 and 3, pLSI outperforms LDA.",
        "On the contrary, using a cosine metric, LDA has a significant problem: it loses its distinguishing ability when the number of topics (latent variables) becomes large.",
        "With such a large number of topics, LDA always infers a point near the gravity point of the topic simplex.",
        "In addition, using a cosine metric also requires a threshold to",
        "judge a pair of paraphrasing sentences.",
        "From Table 6, LDA seems robust against the inclusion of noisy sentences with a large window, but it is easily affected by a small window.",
        "On the other hand, pLSI seems robust against information shortages due to a small window, but it is not effective with a large window.",
        "The best performances were shown at window size 15 for both pLSI and LDA, since the average number of sentences in a document (segment) is 18.7, as shown in Section 4.1.",
        "Table 7 shows that in spite of the difference in programing language, pLSI is faster than LDA in practice.",
        "In addition, Table 8 reveals that judging the contextual dependency of paraphrasing pairs does not require fine-grained topics.",
        "From the results shown in Table 10, we can conclude that topic inference by latent variable models resembles context judgement by humans as recorded in error rate.",
        "However, we note that the error rate was not weighted for contextually independent or dependent results.",
        "Error rate is simply a relative index.",
        "For example, if there is a result in which all of the inferences reflect the same topic, then the error rate becomes 0.3426.",
        "Thus it is important to detect a contextually dependent paraphrase.",
        "Considering these points, pLSI20 with window size 11 shows very good results in Table 10.",
        "In Section 4.4, we showed the potential upper bound of this method.",
        "The smallest error rate is 0.231, and we can estimate a corrected error by the following formula: IDindep I+ ISdep I C # of judged pairs - C, where C denotes the correction value that corresponds to the number of paraphrasing pairs judged incorrectly with only contextual information.",
        "In our experiments, from the results shown in Table 9, C is set to 25.",
        "From the results shown in Table 10, we can conclude that the performance of our method is almost the same as that by the manually annotated topics, and the accuracy of our method is almost 80% for paraphrasing pairs that can be judged by contextual information.",
        "There are several possibilities for improving accuracy.",
        "One is using a fixed window to obtain contextual information.",
        "Irrelevant sentences are sometimes included in fixed windows, and latent variable models fail on inference.",
        "If we could infer a boundary of topics with high accuracy,",
        "we would be able to dynamically detect a precise window using some other reliable text models specialized to text segmentation.",
        "So far, we have mainly discussed the contextual dependency of paraphrasing pairs.",
        "However, when a paraphrasing pair is contextually dependent, it is also important to infer its specific paraphrasing direction.",
        "Unfortunately, we conclude that inferring the paraphrasing direction with contextual information is difficult.",
        "In the experimental results, however, there were several examples whose direction could be inferred from their contextual information.",
        "Thus, contextual information may benefit the inference of paraphrasing direction.",
        "Actually, in the experiments, 11 of 37 contextual dependent pairs had obvious paraphrasing directions.",
        "In most of the paraphrasing pairs, different words were used or inserted, or some words were deleted.",
        "Thus, to infer a paraphrasing direction, we need more specific information for words or sentences; for example what words carry specific or generic meaning and so on.",
        "One might consider a supervised learning method, such as Support Vector Machine, to infer topics (e.g., (Lane et al., 2004)).",
        "However, we cannot know the best number of topics for an application in advance.",
