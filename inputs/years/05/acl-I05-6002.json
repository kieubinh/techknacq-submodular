        "An attempt was made to semi-automatically obtain “lexical units” (LUs) for Japanese from the English LUs defined in the semantic frame database provided by Berkeley FrameNet (BFN) using an English-Japanese bilingual corpus.",
        "This task was a prerequisite to building a complete database of semantic frames for Japanese.",
        "In the task, a Japanese word is first translated into an English word or phrase, E. E is one of the lexical units that evoked a particular semantic frame, F, in the BFN database.",
        "When other lexical units of F are translated back into Japanese, this defines a candidate set of F for the lexical units of F in Japanese.",
        "The viability of the proposed method was tested on a Japanese verb (X-ga Y-wo) osou (roughly meaning “X attack(s) Y,” “X hit(s) Y,” “X surprise(s) Y” in English, showing that it is a relatively pol-ysemous word).",
        "The resulting translation was compared to semantic descriptions provided by IPAL and Nihongo Goi-Taikei (A Japanese Lexicon), two well-known language resources for Japanese, and also by the Frame Oriented Concept Analysis of Language (FOCAL).",

        "Making use of deep semantics in information processing is one of the major problems confronting today’s NLP community.",
        "More and more NLP researchers are realizing that they need semantic/lexical resources that go beyond such ones as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) that only specify hierarchical semantic relationships.",
        "One of the crucial reasons for this is that raw linguistic data embodies semantic associations that are difficult to capture in terms of such hierarchical relationships, one of which is the so-called “semantic field” effect, a class of associative relationships among words (or concepts).",
        "To deal with these issues, deeper semantics are needed with descriptions that incorporate ontological inferences.",
        "Let us assume that X attacked Y is to be interpreted.1 This is a complex situation.",
        "In interpreting The man attacked a bank, it may be necessary to specify (by inference) that the subject used a weapon (e.g., a gun) and his purpose was to obtain money (illegally), whereas in interpreting The wolf attacked a flock of sheep, it may be necessary to specify that the subject never used a weapon and its purpose was to eat one or two individual sheep (rather than the entire flock) after killing them.",
        "Relevant inferences are clearly situation-based, or “case-based” in the sense of Case-based Reasoning (Kolodner, 1993), and difficult to specify in terms of the lexical semantic descriptions available in resources such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) which don’t specify associative relationships among concepts, including the relationships between ROBBER (e.g., a man) and WAREHOUSE OF VALUABLES (e.g., a bank, museum, jewelry shop), and the one between a PREDATOR (e.g., a wolf) and its PREY (e.g., sheep, rabbit).",
        "Thus, the NLP community has a critical need for resources that encode this kind of information.",
        "Along with PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002; Ellsworth et al., 2004), Berkeley FrameNet",
        "(BFN) (Baker et al., 1998) is an ongoing research project that is attempting to meet the demand for resources that encode deeper lexical semantics by providing a semantic frame lexicon (sometimes called the “FrameNet”) and a corpus annotated for semantic information encoded in terms of semantic frames.",
        "Thus far, BFN has produced “a lexical database that currently contains more than 8,900 lexical units, more than 6,100 of which are fully annotated, in more than 625 semantic frames, exemplified in more than 135,000 annotated sentences” (cited from the FrameNet web page).",
        "Other ongoing projects, i.e., the German FrameNet or “SALSA” (Erk et al., 2003), the Spanish FrameNet (Subirats and Petruck, 2003), and the Japanese FrameNet (Ohara et al., 2003), are trying to build lexical resources that are compatible with the BFN, but for Japanese at least, no data has been released in a usable form, except for a few annotation examples for verbs of motion.",
        "In sum, no useful resource exists for frame-based description/analysis of Japanese.",
        "This is one of the reasons that we attempted the task in this paper, along with our efforts to assess the usefulness of the database provided by BFN.",
        "The anonymous reviewers of our paper pointed out that there have been some similar projects and other methodologies that have tried to translate BFN into other languages automatically, such as BiFrameNet (Chen and Fung, 2004) and Romance FrameNet2, and that it would have been better to include the comparison against them.",
        "BiFrameNet presented an automatic approach to constructing a bilingual semantic network using the Chinese HowNet, which is a Chinese ontology.",
        "While it is an interesting approach, we have not compared their results with ours, mainly because they seem to have used different resources and had somewhat different goals, along with the space consideration.",
        "No papers are released, let alone being available to us, related to the Romance FrameNet project for the time being.",

        "They face problems when we try to account for the constrast between The shark attacked the swimmer and ?",
        "*The shark attacked the bank, for example.",
        "The latter sentences doesn’t makes sense unless it is reinterpreted some way, while it is straightforward to interpret the first sentence against a predatory situation.",
        "In interpreting the second, there is a clear conflict or “competition” between two strong readings: one interpretation (reading 1) is against the situation of (Predation), where the shark is interpreted as a (Predator) and the bank as a (Prey).",
        "Another (reading 2) is against the situation of (Bank Robbery), where the shark is interpreted as a (Bank Robber) and the bank as a (Warehouse of Valuables) (or simply as a (Bank)).",
        "If reading 2 wins out, an implicit “type coercion” (Puste-jovsky, 1995) takes place to the shark so that the referent of the shark is switched to a human who acts as a (Robber) with a nickname “shark.” If reading 1 wins out, by contrast, another kind of implicit type coercion takes place to the bank so that the referent of the bank is switched to an animal (an instance of fish, dolphin, or whale) which acts as a (Prey), being called “the bank” for some unclear reasons.",
        "The preference of the reinterpretation for reading 2 over the other can be accounted for if we are allowed to say that to find someone being called “shark” is more likely than to find some animal being called “bank.” What this suggests is this: pieces of semantic information that would account for “selectional restrictions” of this sort are not specified in the BFN definitions (yet).",
        "Therefore, it can be said that the frames constructed from BFN do not classify all meanings of osou in the same way IPAL does not, but these frames specify some finer-grained, selectional aspects of osou’s lexical meaning than the IPAL description.",

        "FOCAL is a theoretical framework for semantic analysis and annotation.",
        "Its development has been strongly influenced by BFN, but it also tries to extend BFN’s scope of semantic analysis to the next stage.",
        "In the case of X-ga Y-wo osou, FOCAL recognizes 15 frames in total, listed in Table 4, specifying their hierarchical organization.14 These frames are identified and classified based on the semantic co-variations between (Harm Cause(r))) X, a special case of (Cause(r)), and (Harm Experiencer) Y, a special case of (Experiencer).",
        "This is important to note that FOCAL puts more emphasis on the specification of the semantic covariation between X and Y in terms of semantic features because they are crucial characteristics of a semantic frame, which are not captured in the Goi Taikei and IPAL descriptions, and are not clearly encoded even in the BFN description.",
        "In FOCAL, frames are defined as idealized models of situations such as Robbery, Predation, assuming that human understanding is situation-based.",
        "The descriptive task of FOCAL, then, is to recognize situations and give adequately detailed descriptions to them.",
        "Given M is a set of situation-specific roles {r1, ... , rn}, which are called semantic roles in BFN.",
        "Semantic frames are useful only if they serves as specifications of the co-variations among such Rs.",
        "For example, F06, as a subclass of the (Attack) class event is defined as follows:",
        "= Hunt(Hunter(X), Target(Y), Purpose(Z)) where Z = Eat(Eater(X), Food(Y), Purpose(Z�)); where ZZ = Satisfy (r1 (Z), Hunger) There seems to be no English noun that names r1 .",
        "These are the frames that account for more or less all possible readings ofX-ga Y-wo osou.",
        "The",
        "validity of this claim was confirmed through psychological experiments, and reported in (Kuroda et al., 2004; Nakamoto et al., to appear).",
        "The BFN identifies 3 frames relevant to the semantics of osou, while FOCAL uses a total of 15 frames to determine the range of situations against which people understand the sentences whose main verb is osou.",
        "The 3 BFN frames have been compared with the 15 frames below to assess how well they correspond to one another:",
        "This comparison revealed several differences.",
        "First, FOCAL specifies situations that the (Attack) frame applies to in much greater detail, although its descriptions are based on semantic frames like BFN’s descriptions are.",
        "This is mainly because FOCAL identifies frames in terms of conceivable differences in the “purposes,” or “intended effects” of the (Harm",
        "Cause(r))15, of which BFN’s (Assailant) is a special case.",
        "This suggests that BFN frames can be further elaborated according to the subclassification of (Assailant) in terms of its purpose.",
        "16 The same is conversely true of (Causeharm) and (Cause impact) frames.",
        "These BFN frames need to be generalized so that they include nonhuman, nonintentional agents, which is not done in the current BFN.",
        "Better matches would be found if the (Causeharm) and (Causeimpact) frames were further classified according to the properties of the (Harm causer) and (Impactor) just as in the (Attack) frame.",
        "While FOCAL explicitly groups the F01–F05 frames into G1 and combines it with another group, G2, to yield a more general semantic class {G1, G21, it is not clear whether BFN captures this hybrid class, since the hierarchical relationships among frames are not sufficiently specified.",
        "In fact, the comparison with FOCAL revealed that BFN does not classify the (Assailant) types in as much detail as FOCAL does.",
        "According to FO-CAL’s assumptions, it is (Assailant)’s (Purpose) (including the “null” value) that defines the differences in otherwise similar situations.",
        "To identify such subtle differences is exactly what humans are very good at and computers are not.",
        "Specification of information of this kind is one of the serious demands arising from many of the NLP tasks.",
        "To conclude, we noted that the granularity of the semantic descriptions provided by BFN, IPAL, Goi Taikei, and FOCAL had the following hierarchy: FOCAL > BFN R: Goi Taikei > IPAL This suggests that, while BFN is clearly useful for a variety of purposes, its semantic descriptions are not detailed enough, particularly when dealing with the polysemy of relatively frequent words like osou in Japanese or hit in English.",
        "While our result is only suggestive at best, let 15 This is not the same as BFN’s (Harmcauser) role, which is much more specific than (Harm Cause(r)) in FO-CAL’s sense.",
        "16 The question of “where to stop,” addressed by one of the anonymous reviewers, would have been answered if we had enough space to show that those 15 frames/situations are nearly optimal to account for all the semantic classifications reflected in selectional restrictions, as explained in note 14.",
        "Clearly, we do not need to identify all semantically possible subclassifications; we just need to identify psychologically real subclassifications.",
        "us make a brief comment on some methodological aspects of the BFN framework.",
        "Overall, BFN definitions for semantic frames are much more oriented or even “biased” for descriptions of activities intended and caused by human, volitional agents.",
        "In fact, BFN took a methodological decision not to include metaphorical uses and other “problematic” uses of words for ease of lexicon-building, thereby sacrificing its descriptive range, causing a problem with biased data coverage, as far as we could see.",
        "In the case of osou, for example, there were clearly many examples in which harm is not caused by a human, i.e., cases described by FOCAL frame clusters G2: F06–F07, G3: F08–F11, G4: F12, and G5: F13–F15.",
        "Therefore, as far as we are concerned with the viability of the frame-based description of situations that can be expressed using osou in Japanese, the current status of the BFN database is only partially successful in that it successfully captures the class of situations specified by G1."
