        "The verb class is divided into auxiliaries and lexical verbs.",
        "The auxiliary class notes modals, perfect auxiliaries, passive auxiliaries, semi-auxiliaries, and semip-auxiliaries (those followed by -ing verbs).",
        "The lexical verbs are further annotated according to their complementation types.",
        "There are altogether seven types: complex transitive, complex ditransitive, copular, dimono-transitive, ditransitive, intransitive, mono-transitive, and TRANS.",
        "Figure 1 shows the sub-categorisations of the verb class.",
        "The notation TRANS of the transitive verb class is used in the ICE project to tag those transitive verbs followed by a noun phrase that may be the subject of the following non-finite clause.",
        "This type of verb can be analysed differently according to various tests into, for instance, monotransitives, ditransitives and complex transitives.",
        "To avoid arbitrary decisions, the complementing non-finite clause is assigned a catch-all term ‘transitive complement’ in parsing, and its preceding verb is accordingly tagged as TRANS in order to avoid making a decision on its transitivity type.",

        "Each tree in the ICE parsing scheme is represented as a functionally labelled hierarchy, with features describing the characteristics of each constituent, which is represented as a pair of function-category labels.",
        "In the case of a terminal node, the function-category descriptive labels are appended by the lexical item itself in curly brackets.",

        "[12] We will be introducing new exam systems for both schools and universities.",
        "According to Figure 2, we know that [12] is a parsing unit (PU) realised by a clause (CL), which governs three daughter nodes: SU NP (NP as subject), VB VP (VP as verbal), and OD NP (NP as direct object).",
        "Each of the three daughter nodes are sub-branched until the leaves nodes with the input tokens in curly brackets.",
        "The direct object node, for example, has three immediate constituents: NPPR AJP (AJP as NP pre-modifier), NPHD N(com,plu) (plural common noun as the NP head), and NPPO PP (PP as NP post-modifier).",
        "Note that in the same example, the head of the complementing NP of the prepositional phrase is initially analysed as a coordinated construct (COORD), with two plural nouns as the conjoins (CJ) and a coordinating conjunction as coordinator (COOR).",
        "In all, there are 58 non-terminal parsing symbols in the ICE parsing scheme, compared with 20 defined in the Penn Treebank project.",
        "The Suzanne Treebank has 43 function/category symbols, discounting those that are represented as features in the ICE system.",
        "2 The generation of a formal grammar The British component of the ICE corpus, annotated in fashions described above, has been used to automatically generate a formal grammar that has been subsequently applied in an automatic parsing system to annotate the rest of the corpus (Fang 1995, 1996, 1999).",
        "The grammar consists of two sets of rules.",
        "The first set describes the five canonical phrases (AJP, AVP, NP, PP, VP) as sequences of grammatical tags terminating at the head of the phrase.",
        "For example, the sequence AUX(modal,pres) AUX (prog, infin) V (montr, ingp) is a VP rule describing instantiations such as will be introducing in [12].",
        "The second set describes the clause as sequences of phrase types.",
        "The string in [12], for instance, is described by a sequence NP VP NP PP in the set of clausal rules.",
        "To empirically characterise the grammar, the syntactically parsed ICE corpus was divided into ten equal parts according to the number of component texts.",
        "One part was set aside for testing, which was further divided into five test sets.",
        "The remaining nine parts were used as training data in a leave-one-out fashion.",
        "In this way, the training data was used to generate 9 consecutive training sets, each increased by one part over the previous set, with Set 1 formed of one training set, Set 2 two training sets, and Set 3 three training sets, etc.",
        "The evaluation thus not only aims to establish the potential coverage of the grammar but also to indicate the function between the coverage of the grammar and the training data size.",
        "Figure 3 shows the growth of the number of phrase structure rules as a function of the growth of training data size.",
        "The Y-axis indicates the number of rules generated from the training data and the X-axis the gradual increase of the training data size.",
        "It can be observed that AJP and AVP show only a marginal increase in the number of different rules with the increase of training data size, therefore demonstrating a relatively small core set.",
        "In comparison, VPs are more varied but still exhibit a visible plateau of growth.",
        "The other two phrases, NP and PP, show a much more varied set of rules not only through their large numbers (9,184 for NPs and 13,736 for PPs) but also the sharp learning curve.",
        "There are many reasons for the potentially large set of rules for PPs since they structurally subsume the clause as well as all the phrase types.",
        "Their large number is therefore more or less expected.",
        "The",
        "large set of NP rules is however a bit surprising since they are often characterised, perhaps too simplistically, as comprising a determiner group, a premodifier group, and the noun head but the grammar has 9,184 different rules for this phrase type.",
