        "There has been a growing interest in recent years in Discourse Structure.",
        "A prominent example of this is the RST Treebank (Carlson et al., 2002), which imposes hierarchical structures on multi-sentence discourses.",
        "Since the texts in the RST Treebank are taken from the syntactically annotated Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993), it is natural to ask what the relation is between the discourse structures in the RST Treebank and the syntactic structures of the Penn Treebank.",
        "In our view, the most natural relationship would be that discourse structures always relate well-formed syntactic expressions, typically sentences.",
        "Discourse trees would then be seen as elaborations of syntactic trees, adding relations between sentential nodes that are not linked by syntactic relations.",
        "This would allow discourse structures and syntactic structures to coexist in a combined hierarchical structure.",
        "Surprisingly, this is not what we have found in examining the syntax-discourse relation in the RST Treebank.",
        "A large proportion of relations apply to subsentential spans of text; 1 spans that may or may not correspond to nodes in the syntax tree.",
        "Is this complicated relation between syntax and discourse necessary?",
        "Our hypothesis is that the subsentential relations in the RST Treebank are in fact redundant; if this is true it should be possible to automatically infer these relations based solely on Penn Treebank syntactic information.",
        "In this paper, we present the results of an initial study that strongly supports our hypothesis.",
        "We examine the Attribution relation, which is of particular interest for the following reasons: It appears quite frequently in the RST Treebank (15% of all relations, according to Marcu et al.",
        "(1999)) It always appears within, rather than across, sentence boundaries It conflicts with Penn Treebank syntax, always relating text spans that do not correspond to nodes in the syntax tree We describe a system that identifies Attributions by simple, clearly defined syntactic features.",
        "This system identifies RST Attributions within precision and recall over 90%.",
        "In our view, this strongly supports the view that Attribution is in fact a syntactic relation.",
        "The system performs dramatically better than the results reported in (Soricut and Marcu, 2003) for automatic identification of such relations, where the precision and recall were reported at below .76.",
        "Furthermore, human annotator agreement reported in the RST Treebank project is also well below our results, with reported f-scores no higher than .77.",
        "(Soricut and Marcu, 2003) In what follows, we first describe Attributions as they are understood in the RST Treebank project.",
        "Next we present the Attribution identification procedure, followed by a presentation of results.",
        "We compare these results with related work, as well as with inter-coder agreement reported in the RST Treebank project.",
        "Finally, we discuss plans for future work."
