        "To varying extents, languages have ways to reflect the speaker’s deference towards the addressee and people being referred to in utterances (c.f.",
        "Brown and Levinson 1987): by adopting a more polite air or tone of voice, avoiding coarse language, and modifying one’s choice of specific vocabulary.",
        "This is prominent in Asian languages, Japanese and Korean in particular, which exhibit an extensive use of honorifics (respectful words).",
        "Morphologically for example, French has a choice of the familiar tu and the formal vous (a third person plural) for the second person referent.",
        "Similarly Greek has the same choice: esei and eseis respectively.",
        "European languages commonly project one’s deference by the use of different personal pronouns and titles (e.g. Mr., Dr., and Hon.).",
        "Japanese and Korean, on the other hand, have numerous ways to say ‘I’ or ‘you’ calibrated by social position, age, gender and other factors.",
        "The projection of honorifics extends over the vocabulary of verbs, adjectives, and nouns as well as sentence structures, to elevate a person or humble oneself.",
        "(1) and (2) below from Japanese are such examples, which use honorific verbs instead of neutral forms kuru ‘come’, iku ‘go/accompany’, and motomeru ‘seek’:",
        "come-when accompany ‘When (an honouree) comes, (an honourer) accompanies (the honoree).’",
        "‘(A lower ranked person) turns to (a higher ranked person) for help.’ Examples (1) and (2) also reveal the notorious problem of zero pronoun resolution in Japanese, where the subject and the object of a sentence are frequently left unexpressed (Nakaiwa 2002, Nariyama 2003, inter alia).",
        "It is clear from the examples that coding the honorific relations of referents provides vital information for identifying what zero pronouns refer to; namely, to know whether or not a predicate denotes disparity of social rank between referents and to identify the rank of the referents.",
        "This is what this paper proposes to do.",
        "Siegel (2000) reported that 23.9% of Japanese zero pronouns in task-oriented dialogues can be resolved using information gleaned from honorification.",
        "Coding of honorifics also improves machine translation outputs into Japanese in choosing the correct predicate depending on the relationship of the referents.",
        "Inappropriate use of honorifics, in particular the use of the plain form where an honorific form should be used, is rude and can be offensive.",
        "Section 2 reviews some earlier work on this topic in NLP; Section 3 elaborates on honorifics; Section 4 formulates the ranking factors; Section 5 proposes a way to assign ranks to referents; Section 6 discusses a way to calibrate rankings of referents, as ranks are relative to the ranks of other referents in the sentence; Section 7 describes our annotation scheme, and finally conclusion in Section 8."

        "The Japanese honorification system has been studied extensively in linguistics, particularly in sociolinguistics.",
        "Because of its importance and frequent use in the Japanese language, there has been some related work in NLP; within the framework of grammar formalism, GPSG by Ikeya (1983), JPSG by Gunji (1987), and more recently HPSG by Siegel (2000); work from a view point of resolving zero pronouns in dialogues by Dohsaka (1990).",
        "Of these, the most thorough work on Japanese honorification is seen in JACY, a Japanese HPSG grammar (Siegel 2000, Siegel and Bender 2002).",
        "It extends the BACKGR (owe – honour) relation (Pollard and Sag 1994), which accounts only for subject honorifics, to accommodate the other types of honorification used in Japanese (see Section 3.1 for the types).",
        "The full account of the Japanese honorification system requires syntactic and pragmatic information in many dimensions, with more input from the latter, the gathering of which is an extremely convoluted task.",

        "Ranking referents in social hierarchy 2.",
        "Calibrating the ranks",
        "Regarding 1, honorifics tell which referent is higher in rank, so each referent must be assigned a rank to make use of honorific information.",
        "This is crucial when generating sentences to assign appropriate forms of honorific nouns and predicates in machine translation output into Japanese.",
        "In processing, ranking referents is not usually of importance when referents are overt, but it is when referents are zero pronouns.",
        "The identification of zero pronouns relies heavily on the honorific information conveyed in the predicates.",
        "Regarding 2, social rank is not absolute, but relative, so that the same referent may be higher or lower depending on which referent it appears with in a sentence.",
        "For example, the president of a company is socially regarded as ranked higher than the managers, who are in turn higher than clerks, but this rank is outweighed when their clients come in the sentence, in which case the president is ranked lower than their clients."

        "In addition, the use of causative that imposes the interpretation ‘a high ranked person acts on the lower’ is accounted for under Social ranking (see Subsection 3.2.3).",
