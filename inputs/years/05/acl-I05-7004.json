        "This paper presents MANAGELEX, \"a generic lexicon management tool\" (Vertan and von Hahn, 2002) and its possible use for the Semantic Web, namely how ontologies and lexicons managed by the tool can be related.",
        "The paper is structured in six sections.",
        "The first section offers a general introduction on Semantic Web.",
        "The following three sections describe the MANAGELEX tool - structure and functionality - one of its models (LexMod), and one of its modules (StructTool).",
        "In the realization of Lex-Mod, Semantic Web technologies (OWL language) are used.",
        "In the fifth section it is shown how MANAGELEX can be used in a Semantic Web context, by adding to a concept of an ontology, entries of a lexicon (with all lexical information) that define that concept.",
        "Also the concept hierarchy from the ontology attached to a lexicon can be useful for the HLT area.",
        "The last section presents the conclusions and further work to be done."

        "\"The Semantic Web is an extension of the current Web in which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation.",
        "It is based on the idea of having data on the Web defined and linked such that it can be used for more effective discovery, automation, integration, and reuse across various applications\" (Jim Hendler et.",
        "al, 2002).",
        "The Semantic Web makes this possible by the addition of documents that encode the \"knowledge\" about a web page, photo, or database, in a publicly accessible, machine-readable form.",
        "Driving the Semantic Web is the organization of content into specialized vocabularies - ontologies-, which can be used by Web tools to provide new capabilities.",
        "Due to the development of the Semantic Web, in the last years appeared the problem of combining Semantic Web technologies and resources with HLT elements, and of finding a way for the integration of ontologies in HLT applications.",
        "Having lexical information and information given by the hierarchy of an ontology, more power, in both HLT and Semantic Web applications, is gained.",
        "This paper introduces a possible connection (in both directions) between ontologies (Semantic Web resources) and lexicons (HLT elements), using a lexicon management tool in order to have the lexicon structure mapped on some ontology."

        "Standard lexicon models and formats solve most of the problems related to the re-usability of lexical resources.",
        "They succeed to unify the existing lexical resources and to make them reusable.",
        "However, important problems remain unsolved (existing of procedural elements, structures too complex and too hard to manipulate, not all types of languages taken into consideration, problems in merging lexicons, etc.)",
        "and there will be some time until everybody will use the same standard models and formats.",
        "General lexical management tools, which help the user to manipulate and validate lexicons, represent an alternative to standardization.",
        "Such a tool is MANAGELEX, in development at Hamburg University, Natural Language Systems Department.",
        "This tool is not intended for replacing the present standards, but for managing the already existing lexicons (standard or nonstandard).",
        "The MANAGELEX is a tool that permits the user to create, read, convert, and combine lexicons.",
        "It is thought in such a way that makes it format, language and platform independent.",
        "Following the ANSI data modeling specification (1999), the MANAGELEX structure is made of three levels of abstraction: the meta-model level, the model level and the real-world level.",
        "The real-world level contains real objects, their concrete features and the relations that can appear between them.",
        "These objects correspond to the encoded lexicon files (DocA), entry files (Entry A) - lexical contents, and to the structure files (StructA) - lexicon structure.",
        "The model level contains objects and attribute classes (real world objects with their features) and rearranges the relations between them.",
        "These objects correspond to the following tools: EditTool: writes, reads and edits lexicon entries: Struct Tool: defines and changes the linguistic specification; EncodTool: decodes lexicon files and encodes entries into files; Map Tool: merges two lexicons with possible different structure.",
        "The meta-model level deals with objects that appear in the model level and with the relations between them.",
        "There are proposed three models as object of this level: LexMod: rich model of possible lexical information.",
        "The model will be detailed in the next section; Encod/EncodMod: model that specifies the data structure for a specific entry in a lexicon; Map/MapMod: specifies the way of mapping two lexicons, taking into account mutual gaps, complex categories, etc.",
        "Regarding the functionality of this tool, it ca do the following: Reading a lexicon; Updating a lexicon, either at the structure level, or at an entry level; Merging two lexicons; Creating a new lexicon, having as starting point LexMod, or from scratch.",
        "The exact steps of each operation are illustrated in Figure 1."

        "LexMod is a generic lexicon model, which tries to contain as much lexical information as possible.",
        "In this model, linguistic features with possible values that may appear in a language are specified.",
        "The model is based on the study of more than 12 machine-readable lexicons (e.g. CELEX, MULTEXT, GermaNet, Verbmobil) and on several standard lexicon models (e.g. PAROLE/SIMPLE and MILE).",
        "LexMod has a flexible formal specification and is OWL encoded.",
        "The model allows for adding new lexical features, deleting, selecting, renaming, merging or splitting existing ones.",
        "A specific feature of the LexMod is the separation of the linguistic data and the language data (e.g. examples can be added in the entries but not in the lexicon structure).",
        "This was done because language data examples can be added at any level.",
        "LexMod can be updated with new linguistic features specific to other languages or linguistic focus.",
        "As being a generic lexicon model, LexMod contains no optional grammatical features.",
        "It also has no relations between features.",
        "If needed (e.g. in case of a relational structure), these can be specified later using StrucfTool.",
        "The LexMod structure contains the following levels of information (see Figure 2): Lexicon Information; Entry Information; o Morphological Information; o Phonological Information; o Syntactical Information; o Semantic Information; o Multilingual Information.",
        "Using XML would have introduced a lot of redundant information (e.g. he values of gender' should have been mentioned for every part of speech, etc.).",
        "RDF/RDF S offers a limited set of relations between classes or properties (e.g. no synonymy relation) and does not allow some specifications (e.g. cardinality restrictions) Although it is too complex (for the LexMod needs), it permits the user to express all the property constraints he/she needs.",
        "For the LexMod encoding it was used OWL Lite.",
        "If at a certain point it will be necessary, more complex OWL versions can be used.",
        "In encoding the LexMod structure only a subset of the OWL tags were used: (e.g. owlxardinality, owl:Class, owLDatatypeProperty, owl:maxCardinality, owl:minCardinality, etc.).",
        "There were used 15 tags out of 48.",
        "The rdfsxom-ment tag, although it does not encode linguistic information, is used for elements and data type properties.",
        "In this tag, the name that appears on the graphical interface is written.",
        "The main ideas in describing a lexicon structure, and in establishing what should be an element and what a property, are the following: If a grammatical feature can have one or several literal values, than it is a data type property.",
        "If a grammatical feature is described using other features, that it is an element.",
        "If there are relations between classes, than an object property is used.",
        "Below, in Table 1, some classes and properties that appear in the LexMod encoding, are mentioned.",
        "The LexMod OWL encoding has 34 elements, 88 data type properties, and 23 object properties.",

        "As seen from this figure there is a tree representation."

        "At the end the new structure is saved in another structure file OWL encoded, similar to Lex-Mod.",

        "This means that the lexicon and the ontology are encoded in the same way and this way there are not needed more tools for parsing or manipulating structures.",
