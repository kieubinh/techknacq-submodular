        "A semantically insightful way to describe events of change is in terms of their preconditions and effects.",
        "If a car accelerates, that means that the value of the \"speed\" attribute as applied to the car's motion is higher in the effect than in the precondition of the acceleration event; and if the importance of a certain political theory grows, that means that the value of the modality \"saliency\" scoping over that political theory is higher in the effect than in the precondition of the change event.",
        "Such explanatory interpretations of change events provide more information for automated reasoning than would a simple pointer to an ontological concept like \"accelerate\" or \"grow\".",
        "In this paper we describe the treatment of the lexical and compositional semantics of change events within the Ontological Semantics theory of NLP (Nirenburg and Raskin 2004).",
        "Using the example of increase, we discuss how lexical and ontological static resources combine with procedural semantic routines to create text-meaning representations (TMRs) of sufficient depth to support sophisticated reasoning applications.",
        "The material also provides a good example of the continuous interplay and interdependence between lexical-semantic descriptions, on the one hand, and ontological descriptions, on the other.",
        "We demonstrate that explanatory, NLP-oriented ontologies do not need to have a concept for every word sense or even for every synonym set.",
        "Many lexical entries can be well described using relatively few ontological concepts - provided the ontological metalanguage includes a sufficient inventory of properties (relations and attributes) to characterize ontological concepts well beyond their position in the subsumption hierarchy.",
        "2 A Very Brief Snapshot of OntoSem OntoSem is a text processing environment that takes as input unrestricted raw text and carries out its tokenization, morphological analysis, syntactic analysis, and semantic analysis to yield formal text-meaning representations (TMRs).",
        "Text analysis relies on: • The OntoSem language-independent ontology, which currently contains over 8,000 concepts (amounting to over 140,000 RDF resource-property-value triples).",
        "The meta-vocabulary of the ontology is comprised of about 350 basic properties (relations and attributes).",
        "The number of concepts is intentionally restricted, such that a given ontological concept is typically used, with necessary local modifications, in the lexical descriptions of many words and phrases, not only close synonyms.",
        "• An OntoSem lexicon for each language processed, whose entries contain, among other information, syntactic and semantic zones (linked through special variables) as well as procedural-semantic attachments that we call meaning procedures.",
        "The semantic zone most frequently invokes ontological concepts, either directly or with modifications, but can also describe word meaning extra-ontologically, for example, in terms of parameterized values of modality, aspect, time or combinations thereof.",
        "The English lexicon currently contains about 35,000 senses, not counting word forms productively analyzed on the fly using lexical rules (taking those into account significantly increases the number of \"understood senses\" in our lexicon).",
        "• A fact repository, which is a persistent knowledge base of what logicians call assertions.",
        "It contains real-world facts represented as numbered \"remembered instances\" of ontological concepts: e.g., speech-act-3 186 is the 3186th instantiation of the concept speech-act in the world model constructed during text processing.",
        "• The OntoSem text analyzers, covering everything from tokenization to extended TMR creation (extended TMRs differ from basic TMRs in that they reflect the results of procedural semantic reasoning).",
        "• The TMR language, which is the metalanguage for representing text meaning, compatible with the metalanguage of the ontology and the fact repository.",
        "TMRs represent, to our knowledge, the most semantically rich, automatically generated expressions of text meaning produced by any extant system.",

        "In this section we describe four types of semantic contexts requiring different interpretations of increase: increase as applied to scalar attributes (3.1), modalities (3.2), count nouns (3.3) and non-count nouns (3.4).",
        "For brevity's sake, for each semantic subtype we present just one lexical sense: for example, we discuss the intransitive The weight of the elephant increased but not the corresponding transitive They increased the weight of the elephant or the nominal the increase in the weight of the elephant, which are treated similarly.",
        "All in all, we currently have sixteen senses of increase.",
        "Most of these have some number of synonyms, and most include some number of optional syntactic components.",
        "Factoring in all the relevant lexemes and syntactic configurations, over 500 lexico-syntactic input combinations are covered by this microtheory of lexemes indicating increase (and a similar number are covered by the corresponding treatment of decrease).",
        "Among the properties defined in the property branch of the OntoSem ontology are scalar-attributes, a random sample of which (selected from many dozens) includes complexity, cost, intensity, usefulness, rapidity, age and abstractness.",
        "While scalar-attributes can take various types of objects or events as their domain, they all take a numerical value, or range of values, as their range.",
        "That value can either be a real value or a point on an abstract {0,1} scale.",
        "For example, expensive is lexically described as .8 on the scale of cost.",
        "(Of course, one could quibble about whether expensive should be rendered as .7, .8, between .7 and .9, etc.",
        "; but lingering over such questions does not support practical solutions.)",
        "Automatic reasoning systems can interpret these abstract values relative to the ontologically listed \"normal\" range of property values listed for a concept (e.g., an expensive car is a car whose cost is around .8 of the maximum cost listed for cars).",
        "During lexicon acquisition we attempt to be consistent in our interpretation of points on the scale: just as expensive is .8 on the scale of cost, tall is .8 on the scale of height and heavy is .8 on the scale of weight.",
        "Likewise, very consistently shifts the given value by .1 toward the extreme of the scale, and extremely shifts it by .2, so very heavy will be .9 on the scale of weight and extremely heavy will be 1 (see McShane et al.",
        "2004b for further discussion of modifications to scalars).",
        "In terms of change events, however, it is the relative values of scalar attributes that are most important: if the size of something increases, the value of its range is higher in the effect of the change event than in the precondition.",
        "Let us consider how one of the verbal senses for increase (increase-vl, below) supports such an interpretation.",
        "For orientation, lexicon entries in OntoSem are written using an extended variety of LFG in LISP-compatible format.",
        "Elements of the syntactic structure (syn-struc) and semantic structure (sem-struc) are linked using variables, and the same variables are referred to in the procedural attachments {meaning-procedure) zone.",
        "The caret (A) preceding variable names in the sem-struc indicates \"the meaning of (the variable)\".",
        "Refsem is a reserved term used primarily for reification.",
        "Ontological concepts are written in small caps.",
        "(increase-vl (def \"of scalar attributes: the value of the range is larger in the effect than in the precondition\") (ex \"The weight of the elephant increased (by 500 (sem-struc (change-event (precondition (value refseml)) (effect (value refsem2)) (change-in-value ((value A$var3) add))) (refseml (scalar-attribute (range (value A$var5)))) (refsem2 (scalar-attribute (range (value ASvar7)))) (< (value refseml .range) (value refsem2.range)) (ASvar2 (null-sem +)) (ASvar4 (null-sem +)) (ASvar6 (null-sem +))) (meaning-procedure (seek-specification (value refseml) (value ASvarl)) (seek-specification (value refsem2) (value ASvarl)) (fill-in-missing-values-for-increasel))) The basic ontological mapping is to change-event, which is quite high on the tree of inheritance: its parents are physical-event and mental-event, which themselves are children of event.",
        "As a high-level ontological concept, change-event does not have very constrained property values.",
        "The main work of interpreting change-events, therefore, lies in the further specification of their preconditions and effects.",
        "Let us start by considering the case when none of the optional PPs is overt in the context, as in the sentence The weight of the elephant increased.",
        "The meaning is that the value of the range of weight is greater in the effect than in the precondition of increase.",
        "This information is captured in the sem-struc statement: (< (value refseml .range) (value refsem2.range)) Refseml and refsem2 refer to some scalar-attribute whose specification requires knowing the meaning of the subject of the clause.",
        "The relevant procedural semantic routine is seek-specification, which is called in the meaning-procedure zone of the entry.",
        "It says 'Seek the meaning of refseml/refsem2 using the meaning of $varl as an input parameter.'",
        "Assuming that the subject of the sentence is the weight of the elephant, the analyzer will select the following sense of the word weight?",
        "One bit of lexical complexity is worth mentioning.",
        "Some words that map to scalar-attributes have two different interpretations: one in which the range of the attribute is un-(weight-nl (def \"indicates physical heaviness\") (ex \"The weight of the child is 9 lbs.\") (syn-struc ((root SvarO) (cat n) This sense says that the word weight instantiates the ontological concept weight whose domain is the meaning of $var2, which is in this case maps to elephant.",
        "(The descriptor (null-sem +) indicates that no compositional meaning should be attributed to the preposition since its meaning - or, more precisely, function - is taken care of already in the semantic description.)",
        "The result of the seek-specification meaning procedure, therefore, is to replace, in the TMR, the scalar-attribute instantiated by increase with weight (domain: elephant).",
        "The TMR resulting from the input sentence The weight of the elephant increased will be: change-event-1 textpointer precondition effect time increased weight-1 weight-2 textpointer weight domain elephant-1 precondition-of change-event-1 specified, and the other in which the range is understood as having a high value.",
        "For example, height can mean either \"distance from the base of something to the top\" or \"the condition or attribute of being relatively or sufficiently high or tall\".",
        "Under the first interpretation, the range of height is unspecified, whereas under the second interpretation it is, say, (> .7).",
        "If one says / was surprised by the height of that steeple, the interpretation is (height (> .7)), whereas if one says The height of the tree increased, the initial and ending heights could be anything.",
        "We are working on developing heuristics for such disambiguation in the context of our larger work on semantic disambiguation (see, e.g., Beale et al.",
        "2003 for an overview of disambiguation in OntoSem).",
        "This is a call to a meaning procedure that seeks the anchor time in a dateline or other text source.",
        "Since the anchor time cannot be resolved in our short context, the reference to the meaning procedure (which means \"prior to the anchor time\" and reflects the past tense of the verb) remains in the TMR.",
        "weight-2 domain effect-of elephant-1 domain-of elephant-1 change-event-1 elephant This text-meaning representation was generated from input in which none of the optional PPs for increase were overt: that is, there was no indication of the elephant's starting weight, ending weight or change in weight.",
        "However, as shown in the \"example\" field for increase-vl, any combinations of PPs can be overt: The weight of the elephant increased (by 500 lbs.)",
        "(from 1000 lbs.)",
        "(to 1500 lbs.).",
        "When such optional information is present, it can be used in two ways.",
        "First, it directly fills in slots in the sem-struc (e.g., the value of a toPP fills in the range of refsem2), which is then rendered as a more information-rich TMR.",
        "Second, if at least two of the three values are provided or can be recovered from the context, the full template of values (the value before the increase, after the increase, and the amount of increase) can be filled in.",
        "This is the ideal situation for one of the main applications of OntoSem: populating a Fact Repository with real-world facts, both explicit in the text and inferred with a high degree of confidence.",
        "Consider the TMR for the input The weight of the elephant increased by 500 lbs.",
        "to 1500 lbs.",
        "change-event-2 precondition effect change-in-value time (< weight-3 .range weight-3 precondition-of weight-4 domain range weight-3 weight-4 elephant-2 change-event-2 elephant-2 This is a call to another meaning procedure that seeks the anchor time in a dateline or other text source.",
        "Since the anchor time cannot be resolved in our short context, the reference to the meaning procedure (which means \"prior to the anchor time\" and reflects the past tense of the verb) remains in the TMR.",
        "(< weight-1.range weight-2 .range) weight-1 effect-of change-event-2 elephant-2 textpointer elephant domain-of weight-3 weight-4 Since we have two values (end value and amount of change) we can calculate the starting value (the range of weight-3).",
        "The meaning procedure called to do this is descriptively named fill-in-missing-values-for-increase 1.",
        "It is actually a multi-part routine (whose full call is not presented here) that does several things: if two values are present, it calculates the third; if only the amount of change is present, it seeks out the initial or final value from the preceding context (more specifically, the text-meaning representations of the preceding context) and, if successful, uses the now-known two values to calculate the third one.",
        "Notice that the fill-in-missing-values-for-increasel has a different status than seek-specification: whereas seek-specification is essential to interpreting the actual textual input, fill-in-missing-values-for-increasel attempts to go beyond the input in order to arrive at a fuller representation of all available meaning for the Fact Repository.",
        "Although we have been talking about the example of weight throughout, we must emphasize that this sense of increase covers input in which the subject refers to any scalar attribute.",
        "One final note is worth mentioning before we leave the topic of scalar attributes.",
        "Increase is a particularly complex example since one cannot record beforehand which scalar attribute is in question – that must be compositionally determined based on the meaning of the subject.",
        "However, for many other lexemes the relevant scalar attribute can be lexically encoded: e.g., to accelerate refers to increasing the value of velocity, to smooth out refers to increasing the value of smoothness, and to dry refers to decreasing the value of wetness.",
        "The description of such lexemes and their representation in TMR are very similar to the case of increase except that the seek-specification procedural routine is not required.",
        "Modalities express an attitude on the part of the speaker toward the content of a proposition.",
        "Within OntoSem, they are treated as extra-ontological aspects of meaning.",
        "The modalities currently used in OntoSem are: epistemic, belief, obligative, permissive, potential, evaluative, intentional, epiteuctic, effort, volitive, and saliency.",
        "The scale for the values of each modality goes from 0 to 1, with any decimal value or range in between being valid.",
        "Examples of lexical items whose meanings are conveyed by values of modality are: must obligative: 1 important saliency: .8 loathe evaluative: 0 Modalities are defined for type, scope, value and attributed-to, with the latter defaulting to the speaker if not overtly specified.",
        "For example, one sense of importance is described as follows: (importance-nl (cat n) (def \"some unspecified value of the modality 'saliency'; this sense is used mainly in contexts of comparison (since the sense 'highly important' is the default otherwise)\") (ex \"the importance of taking vitamins\") (syn-struc ((root SvarO) (cat n) (pp ((root Svarl) (cat prep) (root of) (opt +) (obj ((root $var2) (cat n))))))) (sem-struc (modality (type saliency) (scope (value A$var2))) (ASvarl (null-sem +)))) Values for modality are compared in inputs like the following, extracted from a corpus: The importance of this issue <The need for help, The emphasis on health care, Efforts by insurers> increased.",
        "The lexical sense of increase that covers such inputs is increase-v2: (increase-v2 (def \"used with modalities: the value increases\") (ex \"The importance of diplomacy has increased\") (syn-struc person's having the attribute of being honorable.",
        "For further discussion of semantic ellipsis, see McShane et al.",
        "2004a.",
        "Another sense of importance is 'high level of importance', in which the value for saliency would be (> .7).",

        "Apart from its relative simplicity due to a lack of optional PPs, increase-vl is actually quite similar to increase-vl, the differences reducing to those listed in Table 1.",
        "The analysis of an input like The importance of diplomacy increased will produce the following TMR: change-event- 3 (< modality-1 val modality-1 scope type precondition-of modality-2 effect-of diplomatic-event-1 modality-1 modality-2 (< find-anchor-time) ue modality-2.value) importance diplomatic-event-1 saliency change-event-3 textpointer diplomacy scope-of modality-1 modality-2 The semantic analyzer can disambiguate between increase-vl and increase-v2 because each sense imposes semantic constraints on A$varl: in increase-vl it must be a scalar-attribute and in increase-v2 it must be a type of modality.",
        "Ellipsis in language is widespread, which poses well-known problems for NLP.",
        "However, some cases of ellipsis are predictable and can be planned for using a combination of static resources and programs that use them.",
        "Consider the following corpus excerpts:",
        "• After that the mosquitoes increased and there was a considerable amount of fever in October and November.",
        "• Following cessation of wolf control in 1960 wolves increased and attained densities of approximately 16 wolves/1000 kmby 1970.",
        "• As Figure 2 shows, total accidents increased modestly from 1993 through 1997.",
        "The implications of the above three sentences are, respectively, that the number of mosquitoes, the number of wolves and the number of accidents increased, even though there is no explicit reference to number in any of the contexts.",
        "The pivotal clue that underpins the automated interpretation of such contexts is the recognition that the subject NP is a count noun - regardless of whether it refers to an ontological object (mosquito, wolf) or event (accident).",

        "Count nouns are mapped to concepts which are in the domain of cardinality, whereas non-count nouns are mapped to concepts that are in the domain of amount.",

        "As is clear from the examples above, OntoSem provides significant expressive power for meaning representation, which includes mapping to the ontology (which itself is rich in property-value descriptors), mapping to the ontology with lexical supplementation of properties, or referring to ex-tra-ontological microtheories like those that treat modality, aspect, comparison, ellipsis resolution, time, etc.",
        "What must be emphasized, however, is how language neutral - and therefore portable across languages - the semantic descriptions are.",
        "Whereas it is typical to assume that lexicons are language-specific whereas ontologies are language-independent, most aspects of the sem-struc zones of the OntoSem lexicons are language-independent, apart from the linking of specific variables to their counterparts in the syn-struc.",
        "Stated differently, if we consider sem-strucs - no matter for what language they originate - to be building blocks of the representation of lexical meaning (as opposed to conceptual meaning, as is done in the ontology), then the job of writing a lexicon for L2 based on the lexicon for LI is in large part limited to a) providing an L2 translation for the head word(s), b) making any necessary syn-struc adjustments and c) checking/modifying the linking among variables in the syn- and sem-strucs.",
        "This conception of cross-linguistic lexicon development derives in large part from the Principle of Practical Effability (Nirenburg and Raskin 2004), which states that what can be expressed in one language can somehow be expressed in all other languages, be it by a word, a phrase, etc.",
        "Apart from this theoretical justification for conceptualizing the sem-strucs as building blocks for lexical representation, there are two practical rationales: supporting consistency of meaning representation across languages and using acquirer time most efficiently in large-scale lexical acquisition.",
        "As regards consistency, the potential for paraphrase must be considered when building multilingual resources.",
        "For instance, 'weapons of mass destruction' can be described as the union of chemical-weapon and biological-weapon, or it can be described as weapon with the ability to kill > 10,000 humans (the actual number recorded will be treated by the analyzer in a fuzzy fashion; however, it would be less than ideal for a lexicon for L2 to record 10,000 while a lexicon for L3 recorded 50,000).",
        "While both representations are valid, it is desirable to use the same one in all languages covered.",
        "In addition, the decision of how to describe a notion - whether by ontologizing it, describing it using extra-ontological means, describing it using an existing concept with additional properties and values defined - is often a judgment call.",
        "It would not be desirable for the acquirer of German to map the word Schimmel 'white horse' to the concept horse with the lexical restriction color: white, while the acquirer of some other language that also has a word for 'white horse' introduced an ontological concept specifically for this entity.",
        "Again, while both representations are valid and, in this case, semantically equivalent, the general tendency should be to strive toward uniformity where possible.",
        "As concerns acquisition time, composing sem-strucs is, by far, the most time and effort-intensive aspect of writing OntoSem lexicon entries.",
        "This is a result of the richness of expressive means available to the acquirer; the fact that microtheories of time, reference, etc., are naturally built during lexicon development (recall that our environment is fully integrated with processors); and the fact that ontology development occurs hand-in-hand with lexicon development.",
        "Therefore, work on the first lexicon entry that describes a word sense takes much more time than editing a word sense for a new language.",

        "• That elephant's weight increased from 1000 to 1500 pounds.",
        "• The elephant used to weigh 1000 pounds, now it weighs 1500.",
        "• That elephant's weight went from 1000 lbs.",
        "to 1500 lbs.",
        "• That same elephant gained a whopping 500 pounds: now it's 1500 pounds.",
        "• The elephant put on 500 pounds, recently weighing in at 1500 lbs.",
        "Within our environment, all of these inputs do, in fact, result in the same basic Fact Repository information.",
        "In this way, when applications like question-answering, knowledge extraction and reasoning use OntoSem's Fact Repository as their search space, they use knowledge that is decoupled from the form in which it is expressed in text.",
        "Preparing the system to arrive at the same basic knowledge representation for such syntactically and lexically differing inputs requires the type of detailed acquisition efforts described in this paper.",
        "A final word about implementation and evaluation.",
        "The research we are reporting is fresh off the presses, with the algorithmic work complete and implementation underway.",
        "We expect all aspects of processing described here to be implemented and tested prior to the conference.",
        "In the bigger picture, our research group is currently experiencing an exciting burst of progress, having recently implemented a development environment, called DEKADE, that supports the creation and evaluation of text-meaning representations, as well as the acquisition of the requisite knowledge resources, in a far more sophisticated manner than ever before (see McShane et al.",
        "2005 for a description).",
        "Within the year we expect to collect a sufficient amount of data to permit a meaningful evaluation of the cost and efficiency of lexical and ontological acquisition.",
        "We have also started an evaluation regimen for the quality and efficiency of ontological-semantic analysis (see Nirenburg et al.",
        "2004a).",
        "This regimen is by necessity, quite different from the ones typical of shallow-semantic systems, since the glass-box analysis of failures will be key to the continued improvement of the text-processing environment.",
        "Our longer-term goal with respect to evaluation is to conduct a full-scale evaluation of OntoSem within an end application.",
        "Zooming out further still, versions of the OntoSem analyzer have already been used in a variety of applications, including question answering, machine translation and information extraction.",
        "While work must continue on both the OntoSem processors and its static knowledge resources (centrally including the ontology and the lexicons), the above applications have demonstrated the utility of this approach for higher-end NLP applications.",
        "OntoSem has been used with languages including English, Spanish, Chinese, Arabic and Persian, to varying degrees of lexical coverage (e.g., earlier, less fine-grained English and Spanish lexicons contained 40K entries and were used for MT in the Mikrokosmos project).",
        "What makes OntoSem amenable to efficient cross-linguistic usage is that many of the resources are either fully language independent (the ontology, the fact repository, the TMR metalanguage) or parameterizable in well understood ways (the lexicon)."
