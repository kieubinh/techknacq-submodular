        "The last example involves homographs (different words which happen to be spelled the same).",
        "However, it should be noted that only a small percentage of word sense ambiguity is due to homography.",
        "(We obtained an estimate of approximately 2% by random sampling of English and French dictionaries [12, 21, 22, 24].)",

        "Picoche (1992) states that the majority of words in French have a scholarly origin and were introduced by clerics, jurists, intellectuals, and scientists directly from Latin and Greek.",
        "However, it is clear that many words are of popular origin (e.g., bike, trainers, and OK in English or v´elo, baskets, and OK in French) and have become accepted terms as the result of common use.",
        "The principal reason why new (word, sense) pairs are introduced is to adapt language to new communicative requirements (Schendl 2001).",
        "Discoveries and inventions can give rise to neologisms (e.g., kangaroo, quark, Internet) or new senses for existing words (e.g., the ‘armoured vehicle’ sense of tank which coexists with the earlier ‘large container’ sense).",
        "Another driving force in historical semantics is the human tendency toward efficiency of communication, by, for example, shortening words or expressions (e.g., clipping of omnibus to bus), ignoring unnecessary semantic distinctions, and inventing new words to replace long expressions.",
        "Other reasons for semantic change",
        "have more to do with human psychology than with practical necessity.",
        "Taboo leads to the introduction of slang words or euphemisms, such as to terminate for ‘to kill’ or senior for ‘old’.",
        "Litotes is a special case in which a word is replaced by the negation of its opposite (e.g., not bad for ‘good’).",
        "New words may be employed to make an old product sound more modern, exotic, or appetizing (e.g., the old-fashioned British word chips is often replaced by french fries or frites on menus).",

        "We can divide the mechanisms for neologism into three categories (Algeo 1998; Antilla 1989; Chalker and Weiner 1994; Gramley 2001; Schendl 2001; Stockwell and Minkova 2001):",
        "1.",
        "Word-creation from no previous etymon.",
        "This is rare but is the most likely explanation for echoic words such as vroom, cuckoo, oh!",
        "(Bloomfield 1933).",
        "2.",
        "Borrowing from another language.",
        "This includes loan words (e.g., strudel from German, pizza from Italian) and loan translations in which each element of a word is translated (e.g., spring roll from Chinese, dreamtime from the Australian aboriginal alcheringa (Gramley 2001), and chien-chaud, which is the French Quebec version of hot dog).",
        "3.",
        "Word formation from existing etyma (words or word components).",
        "This includes (a) compounding (e.g., bookcase, bushfire), (b) blending (e.g., brunch, motel), (c) affixation (e.g., overcook, international, likeness, privatize), (d) shortening (e.g., petrol(eum), radar, telly, AIDS), (e) eponyms (e.g., kleenex, sandwich, jersey, casanova), (f) internal derivations (Gramley 2001) (e.g., extend/extent or sing/song), (g) reduplication (Stockwell and Minkova 2001) (e.g., fifty-fifty, dum-dum), (h) morphological reanalysis (Schendl 2001) (e.g., the nonexistent verb to edit was formed from the noun editor; the word cheeseburger was derived from hamburger even though this word comes from the proper name Hamburg).",
        "Mechanisms 1 and 3(f)–(h) are rare compared to 2 and 3(a)–(e) (Algeo 1998).",
        "Clearly, the above mechanisms are not exclusive.",
        "Borrowing and word formation are obviously both at play in examples such as blitz, which is a clipping of the German word blitzkreig, and the French word tennisman, which is a compound of two English words.",
        "Word creation, borrowing, and word formation generally produce a new word with a single sense, except when by coincidence the word being created, borrowed, or formed already exists with a different sense.",
        "In the rest of the article, we consider homographs produced by such coincidences to be different words.",
        "In most dictionaries, homographs have distinct entries.",
        "For example, the term bug, meaning‘error in a computer program,’ was borrowed into French as bogue (by assimilation with the already existing word with the unrelated meaning ‘husk’), but these two meanings of bogue are listed in French dictionaries as two distinct words.",
        "Nevertheless, we should mention three cases in which a neologism is often not recognized as a genuinely new word: ellipsis (Antilla 1989) (e.g., daily (newspaper)), zero derivation (Nevalainen 1999) (also known as conversion [Gramley 2001; Schendl 2001]) (e.g., to cheat > a cheat), and borrowing of an already-existing word with a related sense (e.g., to control was borrowed into French as contrˆoler, thus giving an extra sense to this French word meaning ‘to verify’).",
        "The following is a list of mechanisms which can create a new sense for an already-existing word (adapted from Algeo [1998]):",
        "1. referential shift (e.g., to print now also refers to laser printers).",
        "2. generalization (e.g., chap used to mean ‘a customer’) or abstraction (e.g., zest denoted orange or lemon peel used for flavoring before being used in the abstract sense of ‘gusto’).",
        "3. specialization (e.g., in Old English fowl meant any kind of bird and meat any kind of food [Onions 1966; Schendl 2001]) or concretion.",
        "4. metaphor (e.g., kite, meaning ‘bird of prey,’ applied to a toy).",
        "5. metonymy (literally, ‘name change’), that is, naming something by any of its parts, accompaniments, or indexes (e.g., the crown for the sovereign, the City for the people who work there, tin for the container made of that metal, cognac for the drink originating from that region) (Traugott and Dasher 2002).",
        "6. clang association or folk etymology (e.g., belfry meant ‘a movable tower used in attacking walled positions,’ but the first syllable was associated with bell, and now the basic meaning is ‘bell tower’ [Antilla 1989]).",
        "7. embellishment of language by using words which are more acceptable, attractive, or flattering than existing terms (hyperbole, litotes, euphemisms, etc., as discussed above).",

        "In order to study the relative importance of neologism, obsolescence, and the creation of new meanings for existing words, we counted the number of senses listed per word in several different monolingual dictionaries.",
        "We observed the following general empirical rule satisfied to within a fairly high degree of accuracy by all the dictionaries studied [9,12,19, 20, 21, 23, 24, 28, 31, 32]: Near-Exponential Rule: The number of senses per word in a monolingual dictionary has an approximately exponential distribution.",
        "One way of testing this rule is by plotting log(Ns) against s, where NS is the number of words in the dictionary with exactly s senses.",
        "If the near-exponential rule is satisfied, then the resulting plot should be very close to a straight line with a negative slope.",
        "This is indeed the case for the dictionaries tested, with varying values of the slope depending on the dictionary.",
        "Figures 1 and 2 show the plot of Ns, on a logarithmic scale, against s",
        "Plot of Ns (number of entries with s senses) for four different dictionaries, each showing a nonexponential distribution.",
        "for four English [19, 24, 28, 31] and five French [9,12, 20, 21, 23] dictionaries.",
        "Only those points (s, Ns) for which Ns > 12 are plotted in the figures.",
        "For each dictionary, the values of Ns were obtained by sampling a random set of pages of the dictionary.",
        "Sampling was performed independently for each dictionary, meaning that the random sample of words was different in each case.",
        "We excluded entries corresponding to proper names, foreign words, spelling variants, derived words (such as past participles), regional words, abbreviations, and expressions.",
        "We allowed hyphens within words but not spaces.",
        "Thus cat-o’-nine-tails counted as a word, but tower block and phrasal verbs such as give up did not.",
        "Only words forming part of British English or French spoken in metropolitan France were considered.",
        "All words were treated equally irrespective of their relative frequencies.",
        "Thus the words get and floccinaucinihilipilification were given the same importance.",
        "The size of each dictionary that was sampled is given in the reference section.",
        "The dictionaries sampled vary in size from 20,000 to 80,000 words.",
        "To ensure that the near-exponential rule was not simply an artifact of our choice of experimental procedure or of lexicographical practice, we performed the same analysis on a dictionary of abbreviations and acronyms [7], a dictionary of scientific terms [1], a bilingual dictionary of slang words [17], and a dictionary of French synonyms [10].",
        "The resulting curves, shown in Figure 3, are far from straight lines.",
        "We performed similar counts for bilingual dictionaries.",
        "Figures 4 and 5 show the number of words NTt with t translations plotted against t for several pairs of languages.",
        "The NTt scale is again logarithmic.",
        "Although the near-exponential rule could also be said to hold for certain bilingual dictionaries, the curvature of the log NTt against t curve varies considerably depending on the distance between the two languages.",
        "For pairs of languages with strong etymological connections (such as French and Spanish), the average curvature is positive (Figure 4), but for pairs of distant languages (such as Japanese and English) the average curvature is negative (Figure 5).",
        "A theoretical explanation of this phenomenon is outside the scope of the present article, but it is",
        "Number NTt of words in language A with t translations in language B, for distant languages A and B. probably due to the greater differences in the segmentation of semantic space by distant languages (see Resnik and Yarowsky [2000] for some illustrative examples).",

        "For example, the compiler of a dictionary may choose to include archaic words as a historical record or to exclude whole categories of words such as slang or technical terms.",
        "Consider the evolution of LD as a stochastic process in which each step is either (a) the elimination of a word sense (by obsolescence), (b) the introduction of a new word (by creation, borrowing, word-formation, or any other mechanism), or (c) the addition of a new sense for an existing word (by association with an existing sense).",
        "Let t be the probability of a step of type (a), u the probability of a step of type (b), and v the probability of a step of type (c).",

        "To test it we require two editions of the same dictionary.",
        "The 1994 edition of the Dictionnaire de l’acad´emie fran¸caise indicates which words are new compared to the 1935 edition.",
        "Less than 17% of these words are polysemic.",
        "Furthermore, this corresponds, according to our model and to within-sample error, to the proportion of originally monosemic words entering the language that can be expected to acquire new senses during the period between the publication of the two editions.",
        "Assumption 2 above is not as important as assumption 1, since later we restrict ourselves to a no-obsolescence model.",
        "As discussed in the previous section, the set of s senses of an ambiguous word may correspond to a number c of essentially distinct concepts, where c is some number between one and s. For example, the plumbing and anatomy senses of joint correspond to the same concept, since they could inspire the same new senses by association.",
        "The ‘cigarette containing cannabis’ sense of joint clearly corresponds to a different concept, since it could inspire a very different set of new senses by association.",

        "3.",
        "Associations are with concepts: The probability that a concept gives rise to a new sense for a word w by association is proportional to the number of concepts represented by w in LD, which is assumed to be on average 1 + α(s – 1), where s is the number of senses of w and α is a constant.",
        "The concept creation factor α is another unknown which will be estimated from the values of Ns.",

        "4.",
        "Stationary-state hypothesis: LD considered as a stochastic process is in a stationary state, in the sense that the probability P(s) that an arbitrary word of LD has exactly s senses does not change as LD evolves.",
        "To test the validity of the stationary-state hypothesis, we compared the 1933 and 1993 editions of the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (SOED) [32, 28].",
        "In the space of 60 years, the number of words in the SOED increased by 24%.",
        "Nevertheless the values of P(s) (s = 1, 2, ... , 9) remained almost constant.",

        "could be accounted for by sampling error.",
        "The corresponding values of NS are given in Table 1.",

If r denotes the expected net increase in the number of words in LD during one step of the process, then we must have 1 r2t = m, since m is a constant.",

        "Denote the expected net increase in NS by δs = dP(s), for some constant d. We then have",

        "The distribution of the number of meanings of scientific and technical terms [1] can, on the other hand, be partly explained by our model.",
        "The reason that the distribution of these types of terms is so far from satisfying the near-exponential rule is simply that 75% of the terms listed in scientific and technical dictionaries are composed of at least two words.",
        "When we count only single-word entries (as we did for all dictionaries in",
        "Figures 1 and 2), we obtain a distribution which can be explained by our model.",
        "We found that, although the average number of senses listed per word for the scientific and technical dictionary we examined [1] was much less than for English dictionaries of everyday language [19, 24, 28, 31, 32] (1.35 compared to 2.0), the number of concepts per word was approximately the same at 1.32.",

        "In this article, we have chosen the pragmatically simple definition that the words of a language can be approximated by those sequences of characters without spaces whose meanings are listed in a given dictionary.",
        "Applying this definition to a German monolingual dictionary [13], we observed the usual near-exponential distribution in Ns.",
        "The best-fit values of the parameters of our model were m = 1.20, α = 0.80, and c = 1.16.",
        "The average number of meanings per word m and the average number of concepts per word c are low, no doubt because many specialized terms which are expressed by a sequence of words in other languages count, according to our definition, as a single word in German.",
        "Further research is required to test our model on other languages with complex morphology.",
        "Finally, we were surprised that the number of concepts per word was almost identical for the five English dictionaries tested (see Table 2).",
        "However, we found that this was not always the case, since further trials on six other English dictionaries gave a larger range of values, shown in Table 4, varying from 1.23 to 1.55.",
        "One application of our model is a simple method for testing whether an attempt to group word senses into distinct concepts (as defined in section 4) has been successful.",
        "The number NWi of words representing i concepts should demonstrate a distribution with α close to one, whereas the number NCj of concepts covering j dictionary meanings should demonstrate a distribution with α close to zero (i.e., an exponential distribution, as illustrated in Figure 6).",
        "Such a grouping of word senses into concepts is clearly useful not only in computer models of natural languages, but also in lexicography and historical linguistics.",
        "In lexicography, different rules have been proposed for identifying polysemy, based on etymology, statistical analysis of colocations in corpora, the existence of zeugma (such as *there is a pen on the table and one outside for the sheep), the existence of different synonyms (such as present–now, present–gift), antonyms (right–wrong, right– left), or paronyms (race–racing, race–racist), and the existence of ambiguous questions (such as the canine/male ambiguity of the word dog brought out by the question ‘Is it a dog?’) (Robins 1987; Ayto 1983; Cruse 1986).",
