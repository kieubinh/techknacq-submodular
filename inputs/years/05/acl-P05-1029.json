        "The development of dialogue systems in which a human agent interacts using natural language with a computational system is by now a flourishing domain (see e.g. (NLE, 2003)), buttressed by an increasing theoretical and experimental literature on the properties of dialogue (see e.g. recent work in the SEMDIAL and SIGDIAL conferences).",
        "In contrast, the development of multilogue systems, in which conversation with 3 or more participants ensue – is still in its early stages, as is the theoretical and experimental study of multilogue.",
        "The fundamental issue in tackling multilogue is: how can mechanisms motivated for dialogue (e.g. information states, protocols, update rules etc) be scaled up to multilogue?",
        "In this paper we extract from a conversational corpus, the British National Corpus (BNC), several benchmarks that characterize dialogue and multilogue interaction.",
        "These are based on the resolution possibilities of non-sentential utterances (NSUs).",
        "We then use these benchmarks to evaluate certain general transformations whose application to a dialogue interaction system yield a system appropriate for multilogue.",
        "There are of course various plausible views of the relation between dialogue and multilogue.",
        "One possible approach to take is to view multilogue as a sequence of dialogues.",
        "Something like this approach seems to be adopted in the literature on communication between autonomous software agents.",
        "However, even though many situations considered in multiagent systems do involve more than two agents, most interaction protocols are designed only for two participants at a time.",
        "This is the case of the protocol specifications provided by FIPA (Foundation for Intelligent Physical Agents) for agent communication language messages (FIPA, 2003).",
        "The FIPA interaction protocols (IP) are most typically designed for two participants, an initiator and a responder.",
        "Some IPs permit the broadcasting of a message to a group of addressees, and the reception of multiple responses by the original initiator (see most particularly the Contract Net IP).",
        "However, even though more than two agents participate in the communicative process, as (Dignum and Vreeswijk, 2003) point out, such conversations can not be considered multilogue, but rather a number of parallel dialogues.",
        "The Mission Rehearsal Exercise (MRE) Project (Traum and Rickel, 2002), one of the largest multilogue systems developed hitherto, is a virtual reality environment where multiple partners (including humans and other autonomous agents) engage in multi-conversation situations.",
        "The MRE is underpinned by an approach to the modelling of interaction in terms of obligations that different utterance types bring about originally proposed for dialogue (see e.g. (Matheson et al.",
        ", 2000)).",
        "In particular, this includes a model of the grounding process (Clark, 1996) that involves recognition and construction of common ground units (CGUs) (see (Traum, 2003)).",
        "Modelling of obligations and grounding becomes more complex when considering multilogue situations.",
        "The model of grounding implemented in the MRE project can only be used in cases where there is a single initiator and responder.",
        "It is not clear what the model should be for",
        "multiple addressees: should the contents be considered grounded when any of the addressees has acknowledged them?",
        "Should evidence of understanding be required from every addressee?",
        "Since their resolution is almost wholly reliant on context, non sentential utterances provide a large testbed concerning the structure of both dialogue and multilogue.",
        "In section 2 we present data from the British National Corpus (BNC) concerning the resolution ofNSUs in dialogue and multilogue.",
        "The main focus of this data is with the distance between antecedent and fragment.",
        "We use this to extract certain benchmarks concerning multilogue interaction.",
        "Thus, acknowledgement and acceptance markers (e.g. ‘mmh’, ‘yeah’) are resolved with reference to an utterance (assertion) which they ground (accept).",
        "The data we provide shows that acknowledgements in multilogue, as in dialogue, are adjacent to their antecedent.",
        "This provides evidence that, in general, a single addressee serves to signal grounding.",
        "In contrast, BNC data indicates the prevalence in multilogue of short answers that are resolved using material from an antecedent question located several turns back, whereas in dialogue short answers are generally adjacent to their antecedent.",
        "This provides evidence against reducing querying interaction in multilogue to a sequence of dialogues.",
        "We show that long distance short answers are a stable phenomenon for multilogue involving both small (<5 persons) and large (> 5 persons) groups, despite the apparently declining interactivity with increasing group size flagged in experimental work (see (Fay et al., 2000)).",
        "In section 3 we sketch the basic principles of issue based dialogue management which we use as a basis for our subsequent investigations of multilogue interaction.",
        "This will include information states and formulation of protocols for querying and assertion in dialogue.",
        "In section 4 we consider three possible transformations on dialogue protocols into multilogue protocols.",
        "These transformations are entirely general in nature and could be applied to protocols stated in whatever specification language.",
        "We evaluate the protocols that are generated by these transformations with reference to the benchmarks extracted in section 2.",
        "In particular, we show that one such transformation, dubbed Add Side Parti-cipants(ASP), yields protocols for querying and assertion that fulfill these benchmarks.",
        "Finally, section 5 provides some conclusions and pointers to future work."

        "All NSUs encountered within the corpus were classified according to the NSU typology presented in (Fern´andez and Ginzburg, 2002).",

        "The classes of NSU which feature in our discussion below are boldfaced.",
        "The BNC annotation includes tagging of units approximating to sentences, as identified by the CLAWS segmentation scheme (Garside, 1987).",
        "Each sentence unit is assigned an identifier number.",
        "By default it is assumed that sentences are non-overlapping and that their numeration indicates temporal sequence.",
        "When this is not the case because speakers overlap, the tagging scheme encodes synchronous speech by means of an alignment map used to synchronize points within the transcription.",
        "However, even though information about simultaneous speech is available, overlapping sentences are annotated with different sentence numbers.",
        "In order to be able to measure the distance between the NSUs encountered and their antecedents, all instances were tagged with the sentence number of their antecedent utterance.",
        "The distance we report is therefore measured in terms of sentence numbers.",
        "It should however be noted that taking into account synchronous speech would not change the data reported in Table 2 in any significant 1 This classification was done by one expert annotator.",
        "To assess its reliability a pilot study of the taxonomy was performed using two additional non-expert coders.",
        "These annotated 50 randomly selected NSUs (containing a minimum of 2 instances of each NSU class, as labelled by the expert annotator.).",
        "The agreement achieved by the three coders is reasonably good, yielding a kappa score r, = 0.76.",
        "We also assessed the accuracy of the coders’ choices in choosing the antecedent utterance using the expert annotator’s annotation as a gold standard.",
        "Given this, one coder’s accuracy was 92%, whereas the other coder’s was 96%.",
        "way, as manual examination of all NSUs at more than distance 3 reveals that the transcription portion between antecedent and NSU does not contain any completely synchronous sentences in such cases.",

        "Although the proportion of NSUs found in dialogue and multilogue is roughly the same (see Table 1 above), when taking into account the distance of NSUs from their antecedent, the proportion of long distance NSUs in multilogue increases radically: the longer the distance, the higher the proportion of NSUs that were found in multilogue.",

        "On this view each dialogue participant’s view of the common ground, their Dialogue Gameboard (DGB), is structured by a number of attributes including the following three: FACTS: a set of facts representing the shared assumptions of the CPs, LatestMove: the most recent grounded move, and QUD (‘questions under discussion’): a partially ordered set – often taken to be structured as a stack – consisting of the currently discussable questions.",
        "Querying and Assertion Both querying and assertion involve a question becoming maximal in the querier/asserter’s QUD:3 the posed question q for a query where q is posed, the polar question p?",
        "for an assertion where p is asserted.",
        "Roughly, the responder can subsequently either choose to start a discussion (of q or p?)",
        "or, in the case of assertion, to update her FACTS structure with p. A dialogue participant can downdate q/p?",
        "from QUD when, as far as her (not necessarily public) goals dictate, sufficient information has been accumulated in FACTS.",
        "The querying/assertion protocols (in their most basic form) are summarized as follows:",
        "3I n other words, pushed onto the stack, if one assumes QUD is a stack.",
        "4A n utterance whose content is either a proposition P About max-qud or a question ql on which max-qud Depends.",
        "For the latter see footnote 7.",
        "If one assumes QUD to be a stack, then ‘max-qud–specific’ will in this case reduce to ‘q–specific’.",
        "But the more general formulation will be important below.",
        "decompose interaction protocols into conversational update rules – functions from DGBs into DGBs using Type Theory with Records (TTR).",
        "This allows simple interfacing with the grammar, a Constraint-based Grammar closely modelled on HPSG but formulated in TTR (see (Ginzburg, forthcoming)).",
        "Grounding Interaction Grounding an utterance u : T (‘the sign associated with u is of type T’) is modelled as involving the following interaction.",
        "(a) Addressee B tries to anchor the contextual parameters of T. If successful, B acknowledges u (directly, gesturally or implicitly) and responds to the content of u.",
        "(b) If unsuccessful, B poses a Clarification Request (CR), that arises via utterance coercion (see (Ginzburg and Cooper, 2001)).",
        "For reasons of space we do not formulate an explicit protocol here – the structure of such a protocol resembles the assertion protocol.",
        "Our subsequent discussion of assertion can be modified mutatis mutandis to grounding.",
        "NSU Resolution We assume the account of NSU resolution developed in (Ginzburg and Sag, 2000).",
        "The essential idea they develop is that NSUs get their main predicates from context, specifically via unification with the question that is currently under discussion, an entity dubbed the maximal question under discussion (MAX-QUD).",
        "NSU resolution is, consequently, tied to conversational topic, viz. the MAX-QUD.5 Distance effects in dialogue short answers If one assumes QUD to be a stack, this affords the potential for non adjacent short answers in dialogue.",
        "These, as discussed in section 2, are relatively infrequent.",
        "Two commonly observed dialogue conditions will jointly enforce adjacency between short answers and their interrogative antecedents: (a) Questions have a simple, one phrase answer.",
        "(b) Questions can be answered immediately, without preparatory or subsequent discussion.",
        "For multilogue (or at least certain genres thereof), both these conditions are less likely to be maintained: different CPs can supply different answers, even assuming that relative to each CP there is a simple, one phrase answer.",
        "The more CPs there are in a conversation, the smaller their common ground and the more likely the need for cla-rificatory interaction.",
        "A pragmatic account of this type of the frequency of adjacency in dialogue short answers seems clearly preferable to any actual mechanism that would rule out long distance short answers.",
        "These can be perfectly felicitous – see e.g. example (1) above which 5 The resolution of NSUs, on the approach of (Ginzburg and Sag, 2000), involves one other parameter, an antecedent sub-utterance they dub the salient-utterance (SAL-UTT).",
        "This plays a role similar to the role played by the parallel element in higher order unification–based approaches to ellipsis resolution (see e.g. (Pulman, 1997).",
        "For current purposes, we limit attention to the MAX-QUD as the nucleus of NSU resolution.",
        "would work fine if the turn uttered by Sue had been uttered by Allan instead.",

        "It also enforces quick reaction to an assertion – anyone wishing to dissent from p must get their reaction in early i.e. immediately following the assertion since further discussion of p?",
        "is not countenanced if acceptance takes place.",
        "The latter can happen of course as a consequence of a dissenter not being quick on their feet; on this protocol to accommodate such cases would require some type of backtracking.",
        "Applying ASP to the dialogue querying protocol yields the following protocol:",
        "(15) Querying for a conversation involving { A,B,C1,... ,C. J 1.",
        "LatestMove = Ask(A,q) 2.",
        "A: push q onto QUD; release turn 3.",
        "Ci: push q onto QUD; 4.",
        "B: push q onto QUD; take turn; make max-qud– specific utterance.",
        "This improves on the DR generated protocol because it does allow responders to comment on previous responders – the context is modified as in the dialogue protocol.",
        "Nonetheless, as it stands, this protocol won’t fully deal with examples such as (4) – the issue introduced by each successive participant takes precedence given that QUD is assumed to be a stack.",
        "This can be remedied by slightly modifying this latter assumption: we will assume that when a question q is pushed onto QUD it doesn’t subsume all existing questions in QUD, but rather only those on which q does not depend:7 (16) q is QUDmod(dependence) maximal iff for any qo in QUD such that �Depend(q, ql): q >- qo.",
        "7 The notion of dependence we assume here is one common in work on questions, e.g. (Ginzburg and Sag, 2000), intuitively corresponding to the notion of ‘is a subquestion of’.",
        "ql depends on q2 iff any proposition P such that P resolves q2 also satisfies P is about ql.",
        "This is conceptually attractive because it reinforces that the order in QUD has an intuitive semantic basis.",
        "One effect this has is to ensure that any polar question p?",
        "introduced into QUD, whether by an assertion or by a query, subsequent to a wh-question q on which p?",
        "depends does not subsume q.",
        "Hence, q will remain accessible as an antecedent for NSUs, as long as no new unrelated topic has been introduced.",
        "Assuming this modification to QUD is implemented in the above ASP–generated protocols, both MLDSA and MAG benchmarks are fulfilled."

        "In this paper we consider how to scale up dialogue protocols to multilogue, settings with multiple conversationalists.",
        "We have extracted two benchmarks, MLDSA and MAG, to evaluate scaled up protocols based on the long distance resolution possibilities of NSUs in dialogue and multilogue in the BNC.",
        "MLDSA, the requirement that multilogue protocols license long distance short answers, derives from the statistically significant increase in frequency of long distance short answers in multilogue as opposed to dialogue.",
        "MAG, the requirement that multilogue protocols enforce adjacency of acceptance and grounding interaction, derives from the overwhelming locality of acceptance/grounding interaction in multilogue, as in dialogue.",
        "In light of these benchmarks, we then consider three possible transformations to dialogue protocols formulated within an issue-based approach to dialogue management.",
        "Each transformation can be intuited as adding roles that correspond to distinct categories of an audience originally suggested by Goffman.",
        "The three transformations would appear to be complementary – it seems reasonable to assume that application of all three (in some formulation) will be needed for wide coverage of multilogue.",
        "MLDSA and MAG can be fulfilled within an approach that combines the Add Side Participants transformation on protocols with an independently motivated modification of the structure of QUD from a canonical stack to a stack where maximality is conditioned by issue dependence.",
        "With respect to long distance short answers our account licences their occurrence in dialogue, as in multilogue.",
        "We offer a pragmatic account for their low frequency in dialogue, which indeed generalizes to explain a statistically significant correlation we observe between their increased incidence and increasing active participant size.",
        "We plan to carry out more detailed work, both corpus–based and experimental, in order to evaluate the status of MAG and, correspondingly to assess just how local acceptance and grounding interaction really are.",
        "We also intend to implement multilogue protocols in CLARIE so it can simulate multilogue.",
        "We will then evaluate its ability to process NSUs from the BNC."
