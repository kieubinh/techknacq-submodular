        "Linguistic and prosodic differences between genders in American English have been studied for decades.",

        "From the scientific perspective, it will increase our understanding of language production.",
        "From the engineering perspective, it can help improve the performance of a number of natural language processing tasks, such as text classification, machine translation or automatic speech recognition by training better language models.",
        "Traditionally, these differences have been investigated in the fields of sociolinguistics and psycholinguistics, see for example (Coates, 1997), (Eckert and McConnell-Ginet, 2003) or http://www.ling.lancs.ac.uk/groups/gal/genre.htm for a comprehensive bibliography on language and gender.",
        "Sociolinguists have approached the issue from a mostly non-computational perspective using relatively small and very focused data collections.",
        "Recently, the work of (Koppel et al., 2002) has used computational methods to characterize the differences between genders in written text, such as literary books.",
        "A number of monologues have been analyzed in (Singh, 2001) in terms of lexical richness using multivariate analysis techniques.",
        "The question of gender linguistic differences shares a number of issues with stylometry and author/speaker attribution research (Stamatatos et al., 2000), (Doddington, 2001), but novel issues emerge with analysis of conversational speech, such as studying the interaction of genders.",
        "In this work, we focus on lexical differences between genders on telephone conversations and use machine learning techniques applied on text categorization and feature selection to characterize these differences.",
        "Therefore our conclusions are entirely data-driven.",
        "We use a very large corpus created for automatic speech recognition - the Fisher corpus described in (Cieri et al., 2004).",
        "The Fisher corpus is annotated with the gender of each speaker making it an ideal resource to study not only the characteristics of individual genders but also of gender pairs in spontaneous, conversational speech.",
        "The size and",
        "scope of the Fisher corpus is such that robust results can be derived for American English.",
        "The computational methods we apply can assist us in answering questions, such as “To which degree are gender-discriminative words content-bearing words?” or “Which words are most characteristic for males in general or males talking to females?”.",
        "In section 2, we describe the corpus we have based our analysis on.",
        "In section 3, the machine learning tools are explained, while the experimental results are described in section 4 with a specific research question for each subsection.",

        "The Fisher corpus (Cieri et al., 2004) was used in all our experiments.",
        "It consists of telephone conversations between two people, randomly assigned to speak to each other.",
        "At the beginning of each conversation a topic is suggested at random from a list of 40.",
        "The latest release of the Fisher collection has more than 16 000 telephone conversations averaging 10 minutes each.",
        "Each person participates in 1-3 conversations, and each conversation is annotated with a topicality label.",
        "The topicality label gives the degree to which the suggested topic was followed and is an integer number from 0 to 4, 0 being the worse.",
        "In our site, we had an earlier version of the Fisher corpus with around 12 000 conversations.",
        "After removing conversations where at least one of the speakers was non-native1 and conversations with topicality 0 or 1 we were left with 10 127 conversations.",
        "The original transcripts were minimally processed; acronyms were normalized to a sequence of characters with no intervening spaces, e.g. t. v. to tv; word fragments were converted to the same token wordfragment; all words were lower-cased; and punctuation marks and special characters were removed.",
        "Some non-lexical tokens are maintained such as laughter and filled pauses such as uh, um.",
        "Backchannels and acknowledgments such as uh-huh, mm-hmm are also kept.",
        "The gender distribution of the Fisher corpus is 53% female and 47% male.",
        "Age distribution is 38% 16-29, 45% 30-49% and 17% 50+.",
        "Speakers were connected at random",
        "from a pool recruited in a national ad campaign.",
        "It is unlikely that the speakers knew their conversation partner.",
        "All major American English dialects are well represented, see (Cieri et al., 2004) for more details.",
        "The Fisher corpus was primarily created to facilitate automatic speech recognition research.",
        "The subset we have used has about 17.8M words or about 1 600 hours of speech and it is the largest resource ever used to analyze gender linguistic differences.",
        "In comparison, (Singh, 2001) has used about 30 000 words for their analysis.",
        "Before attempting to analyze the gender differences, there are two main biases that need to be removed.",
        "The first bias, which we term the topic bias is introduced by not accounting for the fact that the distribution of topics in males and females is uneven, despite the fact that the topic is preassigned randomly.",
        "For example, if topic A happened to be more common for males than females and we failed to account for that, then we would be implicitly building a topic classifier rather than a gender classifier.",
        "Our intention here is to analyze gender linguistic differences controlling for the topic effect as if both genders talk equally about the same topics.",
        "The second bias, which we term speaker bias is introduced by not accounting for the fact that specific speakers have idiosyncratic expressions.",
        "If our training data consisted of a small number of speakers appearing in both training and testing data, then we will be implicitly modeling speaker differences rather than gender differences.",
        "To normalize for these two important biases, we made sure that both genders have the same percent of conversation sides for each topic and there are 8899 speakers in training and 2000 in testing with no overlap between the two sets.",
        "After these two steps, there were 14969 conversation sides used for training and 3738 sides for testing.",
        "The median length of a conversation side was 954."

        "The first, is to classify the transcript of each speaker, i.e. each conversation side, to the appropriate gender category.",
        "This approach can show the cumulative effect of all terms on the distinctiveness of gender categories.",
        "The second approach is to apply feature selection methods, similar to those used in text categorization, to reveal the most characteristic features for each gender.",
        "Classifying a transcript of speech according to gender can be done with a number of different learning methods.",
        "We have compared Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Naive Bayes, Maximum Entropy and the tfidf/Rocchio classifier and found SVMs to be the most successful.",
        "A possible difference between text classification and gender classification is that different methods for feature weighting may be appropriate.",
        "In text classification, inverse document frequency is applied to the frequency of each term resulting in the deweighting of common terms.",
        "This weighting scheme is effective for text classification because common terms do not contribute to the topic of a document.",
        "However, the reverse may be true for gender classification, where the common terms may be the ones that mostly contribute to the gender category.",
        "This is an issue that we will investigate in section 4 and has implications for the feature weighting scheme that needs to be applied to the vector representation.",
        "In addition to classification, we have applied feature selection techniques to assess the discriminative ability of each individual feature.",
        "Information gain has been shown to be one of the most successful feature selection methods for text classification (Forman, 2003).",
        "It is given by:",

        "We have also implemented another feature selection mechanism, the KL-divergence, which is given by:",
        "In the KL-divergence we have used the multinomial model, i.e. each document is represented as a vector of word counts.",

        "14969 conversation sides are used for training and 3738 sides are used for testing.",
        "No feature selection was performed; in all classifiers a vocabulary of all unigrams or bi-grams with 5 or more occurrences is used (20513 for unigrams, 306779 for bigrams).",
        "For all algorithms, except Naive Bayes, we have used the tffidf representation.",
        "The Rainbow toolkit (McCallum, 1996) was used for training the classifiers.",
        "Results show that differences between genders are clear and the best results are obtained by using SVMs.",
