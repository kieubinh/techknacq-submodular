        "Word alignment, which can be defined as an object for indicating the corresponding words in a parallel text, was first introduced as an intermediate result of statistical translation models (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "In statistical machine translation, word alignment plays a crucial role as word-aligned corpora have been found to be an excellent source of translation-related knowledge.",
        "Various methods have been proposed for finding word alignments between parallel texts.",
        "There are generally two categories of alignment approaches: statistical approaches and heuristic approaches.",
        "Statistical approaches, which depend on a set of unknown parameters that are learned from training data, try to describe the relationship between a bilingual sentence pair (Brown et al., 1993; Vogel and Ney, 1996).",
        "Heuristic approaches obtain word alignments by using various similarity functions between the types of the two languages (Smadja et al., 1996; Ker and Chang, 1997; Melamed, 2000).",
        "The central distinction between statistical and heuristic approaches is that statistical approaches are based on well-founded probabilistic models while heuristic ones are not.",
        "Studies reveal that statistical alignment models outperform the simple Dice coefficient (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "Finding word alignments between parallel texts, however, is still far from a trivial work due to the diversity of natural languages.",
        "For example, the alignment of words within idiomatic expressions, free translations, and missing content or function words is problematic.",
        "When two languages widely differ in word order, finding word alignments is especially hard.",
        "Therefore, it is necessary to incorporate all useful linguistic information to alleviate these problems.",
        "Tiedemann (2003) introduced a word alignment approach based on combination of association clues.",
        "Clues combination is done by disjunction of single clues, which are defined as probabilities of associations.",
        "The crucial assumption of clue combination that clues are independent of each other, however, is not always true.",
        "Och and Ney (2003) proposed Model 6, a log-linear combination of IBM translation models and HMM model.",
        "Although Model 6 yields better results than naive IBM models, it fails to include dependencies other than IBM models and HMM model.",

        "statistical model to find word alignments, which allow easy integration of context-specific features.",
