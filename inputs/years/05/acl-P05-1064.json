        "It is interesting to note that the bag-of-sounds classifier outperforms its P-PRLM counterpart by a wide margin (14.9% vs 22.0%).",
        "This is attributed to the global phonotactic features in Al M .",
        "The performance gain in (Torres-Carrasquillo et al., 2002; Singer et al., 2003) was obtained mainly by fusing scores from several classifiers, namely GMM, P-PRLM and SVM, to benefit from both acoustic and language model scores.",
        "Noting that the bag-of-sounds classifier in this work solely relies on the LM score, it is believed that fusing with scores from other classifiers will further boost the LID performance.",
        "Besides the error rate reduction, the bag-of-sounds approach also simplifies the on-line computing procedure over its P-PRLM counterpart.",
        "It would be interesting to estimate the on-line computational need of MMC.",
        "The cost incurred has two main components: 1) the construction of the",
        "pseudo document vector, as done via Eq.",
        "(5); 2) L′ = L × M vector comparisons.",
        "The computing cost is estimated to be O(Q2) per test trial (Bellegarda, 2000).",
        "For typical values of Q, this amounts to less than 0.05 Mflops.",
        "While this is more expensive than the usual table lookup in conventional n-gram LM, the performance improvement is able to justify the relatively modest computing overhead."

        "We have proposed a phonotactic LM approach to LID problem.",
        "The concept of bag-of-sounds is introduced, for the first time, to model phonotactics present in a spoken language over a larger context.",
        "With bag-of-sounds phonotactic LM, a spoken document can be treated as a text-like document of acoustic tokens.",
        "This way, the well-established LSA technique can be readily applied.",
        "This novel approach not only suggests a paradigm shift in LID, but also brings 12.4% error rate reduction over one of the best reported results on the 1996 NIST LRE data.",
        "It has proven to be very successful.",
        "We would like to extend this approach to other spoken document categorization tasks.",
        "In monolingual spoken document categorization, we suggest that the semantic domain can be characterized by latent phonotactic features.",
        "Thus it is straightforward to extend the proposed bag-of-sounds framework to spoken document categorization."
