        "American Sign Language (ASL) is a full natural language – with a linguistic structure distinct from English – used as the primary means of communication for approximately one half million deaf people in the United States (Neidle et al., 2000, Liddell, 2003; Mitchell, 2004).",
        "Without aural exposure to English during childhood, a majority of deaf U.S. high school graduates (age 18) have only a fourth-grade (age 10) English reading level (Holt, 1991).",
        "Technology for the deaf rarely addresses this literacy issue; so, many deaf people find it difficult to read text on electronic devices.",
        "Software for translating English text into animations of a computer-generated character performing ASL can make a variety of English text sources accessible to the deaf, including: TV closed captioning, teletype telephones, and computer user-interfaces (Huenerfauth, 2005).",
        "Machine translation (MT) can also be used in educational software for deaf children to help them improve their English literacy skills.",
        "This paper describes the design of our English-to-ASL MT system (Huenerfauth, 2004a, 2004b, 2005), focusing on ASL generation.",

        "In ASL, several parts of the body convey meaning in parallel: hands (location, orientation, shape), eye gaze, mouth shape, facial expression, head-tilt, and shoulder-tilt.",
        "Signers may also interleave lexical signing (LS) with classifier predicates (CP) during a performance.",
        "During LS, a signer builds ASL sentences by syntactically combining ASL lexical items (arranging individual signs into sentences).",
        "The signer may also associate entities under discussion with locations in space around their body; these locations are used in pronominal reference (pointing to a location) or verb agreement (aiming the motion path of a verb sign to/from a location).",
        "During CPs, signers’ hands draw a 3D scene in the space in front of their torso.",
        "One could imagine invisible placeholders floating in front of a signer representing real-world objects in a scene.",
        "To represent each object, the signer places his/her hand in a special handshape (used specifically for objects of that semantic type: moving vehicles, seated animals, upright humans, etc.).",
        "The hand is moved to show a 3D location, movement path, or surface contour of the object being described.",
        "For example, to convey the English sentence “the car parked next to the house,” signers would indicate a location in space to represent the house using a special handshape for ‘bulky objects.’ Next, they would use a ‘moving vehicle’ handshape to trace a 3D path for the car which stops next to the house."

      "text": [
        "NLG researchers think of communication signals in a variety of ways: some as a written text, other as speech audio (with prosody, timing, volume, and intonation), and those working in Multimodal NLG as text/speech with coordinated graphics (maps, charts, diagrams, etc).",
        "Some Multimodal NLG focuses on “embodied conversational agents” (ECAs), computer-generated animated characters that communicate with users using speech, eye gaze, facial expression, body posture, and gestures (Cassell et al., 2000; Kopp et al., 2004).",
        "The output of any NLG system could be represented as a stream of values (or features) that change over time during a communication signal; some NLG systems specify more values than others.",
        "Because the English writing system does not record a speaker’s prosody, facial expression or gesture1, a text-based NLG system specifies fewer communication stream values in its output than does a speech-based or ECA system.",
        "A text-based NLG system requires literate users, to whom it can transfer some of the processing burden; they must mentally reconstruct more of the language performance than do users of speech or ECA systems.",
        "Since most writing systems are based on strings, text-based NLG systems can easily encode their output as a single stream, namely a sequence of 1 Some punctuation marks loosely correspond to intonation or pauses, but most prosodic information is lost.",
        "Facial expression and gesture is generally not conveyed in writing, except perhaps for the occasional use of “emoticons.” ;-) words/characters.",
        "To generate more complex signals, multimodal systems decompose their output into several sub-streams – we’ll refer to these as “channels.” Dividing a communication signal into channels can make it easier to represent the various choices the generator must make; generally, a different processing component of the system will govern the output of each channel.",
        "The trade-off is that these channels must be coordinated over time.",
        "Instead of thinking of channels as dividing a communication signal, we can think of them as groupings of individual values in the data stream that are related in some way.",
        "The channels of a multimodal NLG system generally correspond to natural perceptual/conceptual groupings called “modalities.” Coarsely, audio and visual parts of the output are thought of as separate modalities.",
        "When parts of the output appear on different portions of the display, then they are also generally considered separate modalities.",
        "For instance, a multimodal NLG system for automobile driving directions may have separate processing channels for text, maps, other graphics, and sound effects.",
        "An ECA system may have separate channels for eye gaze, facial expression, manual gestures, and speech audio of the animated character.",
        "When a language has no commonly-known writing system – as is the case for ASL – then it’s not possible to build a text-based NLG system.",
        "We must produce an animation of a character (like an ECA) performing ASL; so, we must specify how the hands, eye gaze, mouth shape, facial expression, head-tilt, and shoulder-tilt are coordinated over time.",
        "With no conventional string-encoding of ASL (that would compress the signal into a single stream), an ASL signal is spread over multiple channels of the output – a departure from most Multimodal NLG systems, which have a single linguistic channel/modality that is coordinated with other non-linguistic resources (Figure 1).",
        "Of course, we could invent a string-based notation for ASL so that we could use traditional text-based NLG technology.",
        "(Since ASL has no writing system, we would have to invent an artificial notation.)",
        "Unfortunately, since the users of the system wouldn’t be trained in this new writing system, it could not be used as output; we would still need to generate a multimodal animation output.",
        "An artificial writing system could only be used for internal representation and processing, However, flattening a naturally multichannel signal into a single-channel string (prior to generating a multichannel output) can introduce its own complications to the ASL system’s design.",
        "For this reason, this project has been exploring ways to represent the hierarchical linguistic structure of information on multiple channels of ASL performance (and how these structures are coordinated or uncoordinated across channels over time).",
        "Some multimodal systems have explored using linguistic structures to control (to some degree) the output of multiple channels.",
        "Research on generating animations of a speaking ECA character that performs meaningful gestures (Kopp et al., 2004) has similarities to this ASL project.",
        "First of all, the channels in the signal are basically the same; an animated human-like character is shown onscreen with information about eye, face, and arm movements being generated.",
        "However, an ASL system has no audio speech channel but potentially more fine-grained channels of detailed body movement.",
        "The less superficial similarity is that (Kopp et.",
        "al, 2004) have attempted to represent the semantic meaning of some of the character’s gestures and to synchronize them with the speech output.",
        "This means that, like an ASL NLG system, several channels of the signal are being governed by the linguistic mechanisms of a natural language.",
        "Unlike ASL, the gesture system uses the speech audio channel to convey nearly all of the meaning to the user; the other channels are generally used to convey additional/redundant information.",
        "Further, the internal structure of the gestures is not generally encoded in the system; they are typically atomic/lexical gesture events which are synchronized to co-occur with portions of speech output.",
        "A final difference is that gestures which co-occur with English speech (although meaningful) can be somewhat vague and are certainly less systematic and conventional than ASL body movements.",
        "So, while both systems may have multiple linguistic channels, the gesture system still has one primary linguistic channel (audio speech) and a few channels controlled in only a partially linguistic way."

        "In particular, since this MT system will generate animations of classifier predicates (CPs), the system consults a 3D model of real-world scenes under discussion.",
        "Further, since multimodal NLG requires a form of scheduling (events on multiple channels are coordinated over a performance timeline), all of the linguistic models consulted and modified during ASL generation are time-indexed according to a timeline of the ASL performance being produced.",
        "Previous ASL phonological models were designed to represent non-CP ASL, but CPs use a reduced set of handshapes, standard eye-gaze and head-tilt patterns, and more complex orientations and motion paths.",
        "The phonological model developed for this system makes it easier to specify CPs.",
        "Because ASL signers can use the space in front of their body to visually convey information, it is possible during CPs to show the exact 3D layout of objects being discussed.",
        "(The use of channels representing the hands means that we can now indicate 3D visual information – not possible with speech or text.)",
        "To represent this 3D detailed form of meaning, this system has an unusual semantic model for generating CPs.",
        "We populate the volume of space around the signer’s torso with invisible 3D objects representing entities discussed by CPs being generated (Huenerfauth, 2004b).",
        "The semantic model is the set of placeholders around the signer (augmented with the CP handshape used for each).",
        "Thus, the semantics of the “car parked next to the house” example (section 1.1) is that a ‘bulky’ object occupies a particular 3D location and a ‘vehicle’ object moves toward it and stops.",
        "Of course, the system will also need more traditional semantic representations of the information to be conveyed during generation, but this 3D model helps the system select the proper 3D motion paths for the signers’ hands when “drawing” the 3D scenes during CPs.",
        "The work of (Kopp et al., 2004) studies gestures to convey spatial information during an English speech performance, but unlike this system, they use a logical-predicate-based semantics to represent information about objects referred to by gesture.",
        "Because ASL CPs indicate 3D layout in a linguistically conventional and detailed way, we use an actual 3D model of the objects being discussed.",
        "Such a 3D model may also be useful for ECA systems that wish to generate more detailed 3D spatial gesture animations.",
        "The discourse model in this ASL system records features not found in other NLG systems.",
        "It tracks whether a 3D location has been assigned to each discourse entity, where that location is around the signer, and whether the latest location of the entity has been indicated by a CP.",
        "The discourse model is not only relevant during CP performance; since ASL LS performance also assigns 3D locations to objects under discussion (for pronouns and verbal agreement), this model is also used for LS."

        "To build the 3D place-holder model, this system uses preexisting scene-visualization software to analyze an English text describing the motion of real-world objects and build a 3D model of how the objects mentioned in text are arranged and move (Huenerfauth, 2004b).",
        "This model is “overlaid” onto the volume in front of the ASL signer (Figure 2).",
        "For each object in the scene, a corresponding invisible placeholder is positioned in front of the signer; the layout of placeholders mimics the layout of objects in the 3D scene.",
        "In the “car parked next to the house” example, a miniature invisible object representing a ‘house’ is positioned in front of the signer’s torso, and another object (with a motion path terminating next to the ‘house’) is added to represent the ‘car.’ The locations and orientations of the placeholders are later used by the system to select the locations and orientations for the signer’s hands while performing CPs about them.",
        "So, the motion path calculated for the car will be the basis for the 3D motion path of the signer’s hand during the classifier predicate describing the car’s motion.",

        "These two subsystems use the space around the signer differently; during CPs, locations in space associated with objects under discussion must be laid out in a 3D manner corresponding to the topological layout of the real-world scene under discussion.",
