        "Most of the natural language generation (NLG) components in current dialog systems are implemented through the use of simple techniques such as a library of hand-crafted and prerecorded utterances, or a template-based system where the templates contain slots in which different values can be inserted.",
        "These techniques are unmanageable if the dialog system aims to provide variable, natural-sounding output, because the number of prerecorded strings or different templates becomes very large (Theune, 2003).",
        "These techniques also make it difficult to port the system into another subject domain or language.",
        "In order to be widely successful, natural language generation components of future dialog systems need to provide natural-sounding output while being relatively easy to port.",
        "This can be achieved by developing more sophisticated techniques based on concepts from deep linguistically-based NLG and text generation, and through the use of existing resources that facilitate both the natural-sounding and the portability requirement.",
        "We might wonder what exactly it means for a computer to generate ‘natural-sounding’ output.",
        "Computer-generated natural-sounding output should not mimic the output a human would construct, because spontaneous human dialog tends to be teeming with disfluencies, interruptions, syntactically incorrect and incomplete sentences among others (Zue, 1997).",
        "Furthermore, Oberlander (1998) points out that humans do not always take the most efficient route in their reasoning and communication.",
        "These observations lead us to define natural-sounding computer-generated output to consist of utterances that are free of disfluencies and interruptions, and where complete and syntactically correct sentences convey the meaning in a concise yet clear manner.",
        "Secondly we can define the portability requirement to include both domain and language independence.",
        "Domain-independence suggests that the system must be easily portable between different domains, while language-independence requires that the system must be able to accommodate a new natural language without any changes to the core components.",

        "The main event (main verb) is identified as the lexical item buy.",
        "The parser looks up this lexical item in FrameNet, and identifies it as belonging to the commerce_buy frame.",
        "This frame is defined in FrameNet as: “... describing a basic commercial transaction involving a buyer and a seller exchanging money and goods, taking the perspective of the buyer.” (http://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/).",
        "All other elements in the meaning representation are extracted from the input utterance.",
        "This meaning representation is then sent to the dialog manager.",

        "The following verbs are lexical units in commerce_buy: buy, lease, purchase, rent.",
        "These verbs are not necessarily synonyms or near-synonyms of each other, but do belong to the same frame.",

        "The only lexical item that is also listed in one of the senses of buy is purchase.",

        "• Acquire: get • Gain: acquire, win • Get: acquire • Obtain: get, find, receive, incur • Secure: no items on the list",
        "How exactly lexical choice determines that get and acquire are possible candidates, while the others are not (because they aren’t suitable in the context in which we use them) is as of yet an open issue.",
        "It is also an open issue whether WordNet is the most appropriate resource to use for this goal; we must consider other options, such as Thesaurus, etc...",
        "In step 3 we investigate the other relations that FrameNet presents.",
        "To date, we have only investigated the ‘use relation’.",
