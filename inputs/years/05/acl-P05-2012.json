        "Since its revival in the beginning of the 1990s, statistical machine translation (SMT) has shown promising results in several evaluation campaigns.",
        "From original word-based models, results were further improved by the appearance of phrase-based translation models.",
        "However, many SMT systems still ignore any morphological analysis and work at the surface level of word forms.",
        "For highly-inflected languages, such as German or Spanish (or any language of the Romance family) this poses severe limitations both in training from parallel corpora, as well as in producing a correct translation of an input sentence.",
        "This lack of linguistic knowledge in SMT forces the translation model to learn different translation probability distributions for all inflected forms of nouns, adjectives or verbs (’vengo’, ’vienes’, ’viene’, etc.",
        "), and this suffers from usual data sparseness.",
        "Despite the recent efforts in the community to provide models with this kind of information (see Section 6 for details on related previous work), results are yet to be encouraging.",
        "In this paper we address the incorporation of morphological and shallow syntactic information regarding verbs and compound verbs, as a first step towards an SMT model based on linguistically-classified phrases.",
        "With the use of POS-tags and lemmas, we detect verb structures (with or without personal pronoun, single-word or compound with auxiliaries) and substitute them by the base form1 of the head verb.",
        "This leads to an improved statistical word alignment performance, and has the advantages of improving the translation model and generalizing to unseen verb forms, during translation.",
        "Experiments for the English - Spanish language pair are performed.",
        "The organization of the paper is as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes the rationale of this classification strategy, discussing the advantages and difficulties of such an approach.",
        "Section 3 gives details of the implementation for verbs and compound verbs, whereas section 4 shows the experimental setting used to evaluate the quality of the alignments.",
        "Section 5 explains the current point of our research, as well as both our most-immediate to-do tasks and our medium and long-term experimentation lines.",
        "Finally, sections 6 and 7 discuss related works that can be found in literature and conclude, respectively."

      "text": [
        "State-of-the-art SMT systems use a log-linear combination of models to decide the best-scoring target sentence given a source sentence.",
        "Among these models, the basic ones are a translation model Pr(eI f ) and a target language model Pr (e), which can be complemented by reordering models (if the language pairs presents very long alignments in training), word penalty to avoid favoring short sentences, class-based target-language models, etc (Och and Ney, 2004).",
        "The translation model is based on phrases; we have a table of the probabilities of translating a certain source phrase fj into a certain target phrase ek.",
        "Several strategies to compute these probabilities have been proposed (Zens et al., 2004; Crego et al., 2004), but none of them takes into account the fact that, when it comes to translation, many different inflected forms of words share the same translation.",
        "Furthermore, they try to model the probability of translating certain phrases that contain just auxiliary words that are not directly relevant in translation, but play a secondary role.",
        "These words are a consequence of the syntax of each language, and should be dealt with accordingly.",
        "For examples, consider the probability of translating ’in the’ into a phrase in Spanish, which does not make much sense in isolation (without knowing the following meaning-bearing noun), or the modal verb ’will’, when Spanish future verb forms are written without any auxiliary.",
        "Given these two problems, we propose a classification scheme based on the base form of the phrase head, which is explained next."

        "In a secondary step, one can learn word alignment relationships inside aligned classes by realigning them as a separate corpus, if that is desired.",
        "Improvement of translation probabilities.",

        "At the moment, we learn this model from relative frequency across all tuples that share the same source phrase, dividing the times we see the pair ( fj, ez) in the training by the times we see �fj.",
        "Unseen instances.",
        "To produce a target instance f given the tuple T and an unseen e, our idea is to combine both the information of verb forms seen in training and off-the-shelf knowledge for generation.",
        "A translation memory can be built with all the seen pairs of instances with their inflectional affixes separated from base forms.",
        "For example, suppose we translate from English to Spanish and see the tuple T=(V[go],V[ir]) in training, with the following instances:",
        "we will go VB 1P F we will go VB 1P P These alternatives can be weighted according to the times we have seen each case in training.",
