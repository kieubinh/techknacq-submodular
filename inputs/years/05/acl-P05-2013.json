        "Turkish is an agglutinating language, a single word can be a sentence with tense, modality, polarity, and voice.",
        "It has free word-order, subject to discourse restrictions.",
        "All these properties make it a challenge to language theories like CCG (Steedman (2000)).",
        "Several studies have been made into building a CCG for Turkish (Bozs¸ahin, 2002; Hoffman, 1995).",
        "Bozs¸ahin builds a morphemic lexicon to model the phrasal scope of the morphemes which cannot be acquired with classical lexemic approach.",
        "He handles scrambling with type raising and composition.",
        "Hoffman proposes a generalisation of CCG (MultisetCCG) for argument scrambling.",
        "She underspecifies the directionality, which results in an undesirable increase in the generative power of the grammar.",
        "However, Baldridge (2002) gives a more restrictive form of free order CCG.",
        "Both Hoffman and Baldridge ignore morphology and treat the inflected forms as different words.",
        "The rest of this section contains an overview of the underlying formalism (1.1).",
        "This is followed by a review of the relevant work (1.2).",
        "In Section 2, the properties of the data are explained.",
        "Section 3 then gives a brief sketch of the algorithm used to induce a CCG lexicon, with some examples of how certain phenomena in Turkish are handled.",
        "As is likely to be the case for most languages for the foreseeable future, the Turkish treebank is quite small (less than 60K words).",
        "A major emphasis in the project is on generalising the induced lexicon to improve coverage.",
        "Results and future work are discussed in the last two sections."
