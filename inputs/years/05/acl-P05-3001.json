        "People work together to make sure they understand one another.",
        "For example, when identifying an object, speakers are prepared to give many alternative descriptions, and listeners not only show whether they understand each description but often help the speaker find one they do understand (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986).",
        "This natural collaboration is part of what makes human communication so robust to failure.",
        "We aim both to explain this ability and to reproduce it.",
        "In this paper, we present a novel model of collaboration in referential linguistic communication, and we describe and illustrate its implementation.",
        "As we argue in Section 2, our approach is unique in combining a concise abstraction of the dynamics of joint activity with a reversible grammar-driven model of referential language.",
        "In the new information-state model of reference we present in Section 3, interlocutors work together over multiple turns to associate an entity with an agreed set of concepts that characterize it.",
        "On our approach, utterance planning and understanding involves reasoning about how domain-independent linguistic forms can be used in context to contribute to the task; see Section 4.",
        "Our system reduces to four modules: understanding, update, deliberation and generation, together with some supporting infrastructure; see Section 5.",
        "This design derives the efficiency and flexibility of referential communication from carefully-designed representation and reasoning in this simple architecture; see Section 6.",
        "With this proof-of-concept implementation, then, we provide a jumping-offpoint for more detailed investigation of knowledge and processes in conversation."

        "Our demonstration system plays a referential communication game, much like the one that pairs of human subjects play in the experiments of Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs (1986).",
        "We describe each episode in this game as an activity involving the coordinated action of two participants: a director D who knows the referent R of a target variable T and a matcher M whose task is to identify R. Our system can play either role, D or M, using virtual objects in a graphical display as candidate targets and distractors, and using text as its input and output.",
        "Our system uses the same task knowledge and the same grammar whichever role it plays.",
        "Of course, the system also draws on private knowledge to decide how best to carry out its role; for now it describes objects using the domain-specific iteration proposed by Dale and Reiter (1995).",
        "The knowledge we have formalized is targeted to a proof-of-concept implementation, but we see no methodological obstacle in adding to the",
        "system’s resources.",
        "We exemplify what our system does in (1).",

        "S: This one is a square.",

        "The system (S) and user (U) exchange seven utterances in the course of identifying a tan solid square.",
        "We achieve this interaction using the information-state approach to dialogue system design (Larsson and Traum, 2000).",
        "This approach describes dialogue as a coordinated effort to maintain an agreed record of the state of the conversation.",
        "Our model contrasts with traditional plan-based models, as exemplified by Heeman and Hirst’s model of goals and beliefs in collaborative reference (1995).",
        "Our approach abstracts away from such details of individuals’ mental states and cognitive processes, for principled reasons (Stone, 2004a).",
        "We are able to capture these details implicitly in the dynamics of conversation, whereas plan-based models must represent them explicitly.",
        "Our representations are simpler than Heeman and Hirst’s but support more flexible dialogue.",
        "For example, their approach to (1) would have interlocutors coordinating on goals and beliefs about a syntactic representation for the tan solid square; for us, this description and the interlocutors’ commitment to it are abstract results of the underlying collaborative activity.",
        "Another important antecedent to our work is Purver’s (2004) characterization of clarification of names for objects and properties.",
        "We extend this work to develop a treatment of referential descriptive clarification.",
        "When we describe things, our descriptions grow incrementally and can specify as much detail as needed.",
        "Clarification becomes correspondingly cumulative and open-ended.",
        "Our revised information state includes a model of cumulative and open-ended collaborative activity, similar to that advocated by Rich et al.",

        "Our information state (IS) models the ongoing collaboration using a stack of tasks.",

        "In any state, D and M have agreed on a target variable T and a set of constraints that the value of T must satisfy.",
        "When M recognizes that these constraints identify R, the task ends successfully.",
        "Until then, D can take actions that contribute new constraints on R. Importantly, what D says adds to what is already known about R, so that the identification of R can be accomplished across multiple sentences with heterogeneous syntactic structure.",
        "Our IS also allows subtasks of questioning or clarification that interlocutors can use to maintain alignment.",
        "The same constraint-satisfaction model is used not only for referring to displayed objects but also for referring to abstract entities, such as actions or properties.",

        "Note, however, that we do not factor updates to the IS through an abstract taxonomy of speech acts.",
