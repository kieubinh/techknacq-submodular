        "The task of word sense disambiguation consists of assigning the most appropriate meaning to a polyse-mous word within a given context.",
        "Applications such as machine translation, knowledge acquisition, common sense reasoning, and others, require knowledge about word meanings, and word sense disambiguation is considered essential for all these applications.",
        "Most of the efforts in solving this problem were concentrated so far toward targeted supervised learning, where each sense tagged occurrence of a particular word is transformed into a feature vector, which is then used in an automatic learning process.",
        "The applicability of such supervised algorithms is however limited only to those few words for which sense tagged data is available, and their accuracy is strongly connected to the amount of labeled data available at hand.",
        "Instead, methods that address all words in unrestricted text have received significantly less attention.",
        "While the performance of such methods is usually exceeded by their supervised lexical-sample alternatives, they have however the advantage of providing larger coverage.",
        "In this paper, we present a method for solving the semantic ambiguity of all content words in a text.",
        "The algorithm can be thought of as a minimally supervised word sense disambiguation algorithm, in that it uses a relatively small data set for training purposes, and generalizes the concepts learned from the training data to disambiguate the words in the test data set.",
        "As a result, the algorithm does not need a separate classifier for each word to be disambiguated, but instead it learns global models for general word categories."

        "For some natural language processing tasks, such as part of speech tagging or named entity recognition, regardless of the approach considered, there is a consensus on what makes a successful algorithm.",
        "Instead, no such consensus has been reached yet for the task of word sense disambiguation, and previous work has considered a range of knowledge sources, such as local collocational clues, common membership in semantically or topically related word classes, semantic density, and others.",
        "In recent SENSEVAL-3 evaluations, the most successful approaches for all words word sense disambiguation relied on information drawn from annotated corpora.",
        "The system developed by (Decadt et al., 2004) uses two cascaded memory-based classifiers, combined with the use of a genetic algorithm for joint parameter optimization and feature selection.",

        "The performance of this system on the SENSEVAL-3 English all words data set was evaluated at 65.2%.",
        "Another top ranked system is the one developed by (Yuret, 2004), which combines two Naive Bayes statistical models, one based on surrounding collocations and another one based on a bag of words around the target word.",
        "The statistical models are built based on SemCor and WordNet, for an overall disambiguation accuracy of 64.1%.",
        "A different version of our own SENSELEARNER system (Mihalcea and Faruque, 2004), using three of the semantic models described in this paper, combined with semantic generalizations based on syntactic dependencies, achieved a performance of 64.6%."

        "Our goal is to use as little annotated data as possible, and at the same time make the algorithm general enough to be able to disambiguate as many content words as possible in a text, and efficient enough so that large amounts of text can be annotated in real time.",
        "SENSELEARNER is attempting to learn general semantic models for various word categories, starting with a relatively small sense-annotated corpus.",
        "We base our experiments on SemCor (Miller et al., 1993), a balanced, semantically annotated dataset, with all content words manually tagged by trained lexicographers.",
        "The input to the disambiguation algorithm consists of raw text.",
        "The output is a text with word meaning annotations for all open-class words.",
        "The algorithm starts with a preprocessing stage, where the text is tokenized and annotated with part-of-speech tags; collocations are identified using a sliding window approach, where a collocation is defined as a sequence of words that forms a compound concept defined in WordNet (Miller, 1995); named entities are also identified at this stage1.",
        "Next, a semantic model is learned for all predefined word categories, which are defined as groups of words that share some common syntactic or semantic properties.",
        "Word categories can be of various granularities.",
        "For instance, using the SENSELEARNER learning mechanism, a model can be defined and trained to handle all the nouns in the test corpus.",
        "Similarly, using the same mechanism, a finer-grained model can be defined to handle all the verbs for which at least one of the meanings is of type <move>.",
        "Finally, small coverage models that address one word at a time, for example a model for the adjective small, can be also defined within the same framework.",
        "Once defined and trained, the models are used to annotate the ambiguous words in the test corpus with their corresponding meaning.",
        "Section 4 below provides details on the various models that are currently implemented in SENSELEARNER, and information on how new models can be added to the SENSELEARNER framework.",
        "Note that the semantic models are applicable only to: (1) words that are covered by the word category defined in the models; and (2) words that appeared at least once in the training corpus.",
        "The words that are not covered by these models (typically about 10-15% of the words in the test corpus) are assigned with the most frequent sense in WordNet.",
        "An alternative solution to this second step was suggested in (Mihalcea and Faruque, 2004), using semantic generalizations learned from dependencies identified between nodes in a conceptual network.",
        "Their approach however, although slightly more accurate, conflicted with our goal of creating an efficient WSD system, and therefore we opted for the simpler back-off method that employs WordNet sense frequencies.",
