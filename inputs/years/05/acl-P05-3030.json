        "For example, current news stories can be read on web sites such as those for CNN,1 TIME ,2 or the BBC.3 Specialized reading materials for EFL learners are also provided on web sites like EFL Reading.4 This situation, however, does not mean that EFL learners and teachers can easily select proper texts suited to their specific purposes, for example, learning vocabulary through reading.",
        "On the contrary,",
        "EFL teachers have to carefully select texts, if they want their students to learn a specialized vocabulary through reading in a particular discipline such as medicine, engineering, or economics.",
        "However, it is problematic for teachers to select materials for learning a target vocabulary with short authentic texts.",
        "It is possible to automate this selection process given the target vocabulary to be learned and the target corpus from which texts are gathered (Utiyama et al., 2004).",
        "In this research (Utiyama et al., 2004), we used a specialized vocabulary for an English certification test as the target vocabulary and used newspaper articles from The Daily Yomiuri as the target corpus.",
        "We then organized a set of reading materials, which we called courseware5, using the algorithm in Section 2.",
        "The courseware consisted of 116 articles and contained all the target vocabulary.",
        "We used the courseware in university English classes from May 2004 to January 2005.",
        "We found that the courseware was effective in learning vocabulary (Tanimura and Utiyama, in preparation).",
        "Based on the promising results, our next goal is to distribute courseware (produced with our algorithm) to EFL teachers and learners so that we can receive wider feedback.",
        "To this end, the courseware we constructed (Utiyama et al., 2004) is inadequate because it was prepared from The Daily Yomiuri, which is copyrighted.",
        "We therefore replaced The Daily Yomiuri with English Wikipedia,6 a free-content encyclopedia, and developed new course",

        "We want to prepare efficient courseware for learning a target vocabulary.",
        "We defined efficiency in terms of the amount of reading materials that must be read to learn a required vocabulary.",

        "We used a greedy method to develop the efficient courseware (Utiyama et al., 2004).",
        "Let C be the courseware under development and V be the target vocabulary to be learned.",
        "We iteratively select a document (from the target corpus) that has the largest number of new types8 (types contained in V but not in C) and put it into C until C covering all of V. “C covers all of V” means that each word in V occurs at least once in a document in C. More concretely, let Vtodo be the part of V not covered by C, and let Vdone be V – Vtodo.",
        "We iteratively put document d into C that maximizes G(•),",
        "where W (d) is the set of types in d, E(I W (•) I) is the average for I W () I over the whole corpus, and ki and b are parameters that depend on the corpus.",
        "We set ki as 1.5 and b as 0.75. g(dl V,,) takes a large value when there is a large number of common types between W (d) and V,, and d is short.",
        "These effects are due to I W (d) n V,, I and EI(IWW(() I �) respectively.",
        "As g(•) is based on the Okapi BM25 function (Robertson and Walker, 2000), which has been shown to be quite efficient in information retrieval,9 we expected",

        "(1), a is used to combine the scores of document , which are obtained by using Vtodo and Vdone.",
        "It is defined as",
        "This implies that even if I W (d) n Vtodo I is 1, it is as important as IW(d) n Vdone I = IVdone I. Consequently, G(•) uses documents that have new types of the given vocabulary in preference to documents that have covered types.",
        "To summarize, efficient courseware is constructed by putting document d with maximum G(.)",
        "into C until C covers all of V. This allows us to construct efficient courseware because G(•) takes a large value when a document has a large number of new types and is short."
