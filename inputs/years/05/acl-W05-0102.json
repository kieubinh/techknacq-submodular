        "Hands-on interaction with dialogue systems is a necessary component of a course on computational linguistics and natural language technology.",
        "And yet, it is clearly impracticable to have students in a quarter-long or semester-long course build a dialogue system from scratch.",
        "For this reason, instructors of these courses have experimented with various options to allow students to view the code of a working dialogue system, tweak code, or build their own application using a dialogue system toolkit.",
        "Some popular options include the NLTK (Loper and Bird, 2002), CSLU (Cole, 1999), Trindi (Larsson and Traum, 2000) and Regulus (Rayner et al., 2003) toolkits.",
        "However, each of these options has turned 9 out to have disadvantages.",
        "Some of the toolkits require too much knowledge of linguistics for the average computer science student, and vice-versa, others require too much programming for the average linguist.",
        "What is needed is an extensible dialogue toolkit that allows easy application building for beginning students, and more sophisticated access to, and tweakability of, the models of discourse for advanced students.",
        "In addition, as computational linguists become increasingly interested in the role of non-verbal behavior in discourse and dialogue, more of us would like to give our students exposure to models of the interaction between language and nonverbal behaviors such as eye gaze, head nods and hand gestures.",
        "However, the available dialogue system toolkits either have no graphical body or if they do have (part of) a body – as in the case of the CSLU toolkit – the toolkit does not allow the implementation of alternative models of body–language interaction.",
        "We feel, therefore, that there is a need for a toolkit that allows the beginning graduate student – who may have some computer science or some linguistics background, but not both – to implement a working embodied dialogue system, as a way to experiment with models of discourse, dialogue, collaborative conversation and the interaction between verbal and nonverbal behavior in conversation.",
        "We believe the community as a whole must be engaged in the design, implementation and fielding of this kind of educational software.",
        "In this paper, we survey the experience that has led us to these conclusions and frame the broader discussion we hope the TNLP workshop will help to further.",
        "2 Our Courses the course – only fair, since they are at the advan-Our perspective in this paper draws on more than tage when it comes to implementation.",
        "But comfifteen course offerings at the graduate level in disputer scientists see the value in the exercise: even course and dialogue over the years.",

        "Context is central, and under that umbrella we explicitly discuss both the perceptual environment in which conversation takes place and the non-verbal actions that contribute to the management of conversation and participants’ real-world collaborations.",
        "Our unusual focus means that we can not readily take advantage of software toolkits such as NLTK (Loper and Bird, 2002) or Regulus (Rayner et al., 2003).",
        "These toolkits are great at helping students implement and visualize the fundamentals of natural language processing – lexicon, morphology, syntax.",
        "They make it easy to experiment with machine learning or with specific models for a small scale, short course assignment in a specific NLP module.",
        "You can think of this as a “horizontal” approach, allowing students to systematically develop a comprehensive approach to a single processing task.",
        "But what we need is a “vertical” approach, which allows students to follow a specific choice about the representation of communicative behaviors or communicative functions all the way through an end-to-end dialogue system.",
        "We have not succeeded in conceptualizing how a carefully modularized toolkit would support this kind of student experience.",
        "Still, we have not met with success with alternative approaches, either.",
        "As we describe in Section 3.1, our own research systems may allow the kinds of experiments we want students to carry out.",
        "But they demand too much expertise of students for a one-semester course.",
        "In fact, as we describe in Section 3.2, even broad research systems that come with specific support for students to carry out a range of tasks may not enable the specific directions that really turn students on to the challenge of discourse and dialogue.",
        "However, our experience with implementing dedicated modules for teaching, as described in Section 3.3, is that the lack of synergy with ongoing research can result in impoverished tools that fail to engage students.",
        "We don’t have the tools we want – but our experience argues that we think the tools we really want will be developed only through a collaborative effort shared across multiple sites and broadly engaged with a range of research issues as well as with pedagogical challenges."

      "text": [
        "Cassell has experimented with the use of her research platforms REA (Cassell et al., 1999) and BEAT (Cassell et al., 2001) for course projects in discourse and dialogue.",
        "REA is an embodied conversational agent that interacts with a user in a real estate agent domain.",
        "It includes an end-to-end dialogue architecture; it supports speech input, stereo vision input, conversational process including presence and turn-taking, content planning, the context-sensitive generation of communicative action and the animated realization of multimodal communicative actions.",
        "BEAT (the behavior expression animation toolkit), on the other hand, is a module that fits into animation systems.",
        "It marks up text to describe appropriate synchronized nonverbal behaviors and speech to realize on a humanoid talking character.",
        "In teaching dialogue at MIT, Cassell invited students to adapt her existing REA and BEAT system to explore aspects of the theory and practice of discourse and dialogue.",
        "This led to a range of interesting projects.",
        "For example, students were able to explore hypothetical differences among characters – from virtual “Italians” with profuse gesture, to virtual children whose marked use of a large gesture space contrasted with typical adults, to characters who showed new and interesting behavior such as the repeated foot-tap of frustrated condescension.",
        "However, we think we can serve students much better.",
        "Many of these projects were accomplished only with substantial help from the instructor and TAs, who were already extremely familiar with the overall system.",
        "Students did not have time to learn how to make these changes entirely on their own.",
        "The foot-tapping agent is a good example of this.",
        "To add foot-tapping is a paradigmatic “vertical” modification.",
        "It requires adding suitable context to the discourse state to represent uncooperative user behavior; it requires extending the process for generating communicative actions to detect this new state and schedule an appropriate behavioral response; and then it requires extending the animation platform to be able to show this behavior.",
        "BEAT makes the second step easy – as it should be – even for linguistics students.",
        "To handle the first and third steps, you would hope that an interdisciplinary team containing a communication student and a computer sci",

        "In order to alogue (Larsson and Traum, 2000), or approaches add the behavior to REA, students needed not only that emphasize the grounding of conversation in the background in the relevant technology – like what a specifics of a particular ongoing collaboration (Rich computer scientist would learn in a general human et al., 2001).",
