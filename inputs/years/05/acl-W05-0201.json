        "Computer-assisted item generation (CAIG) allows the creation of large-scale item banks, and has attracted active study in the past decade (Deane and Sheehan, 2003; Irvine and Kyllonen, 2002).",
        "Applying techniques for natural language processing (NLP), CAIG offers the possibility of creating a large number of items of different challenging levels, thereby paving a way to make computers more adaptive to students of different competence.",
        "Moreover, with the proliferation of Web contents, one may search and sift online text files for candidate sentences, and come up with a list of candidate cloze",
        "items economically.",
        "This unleashes the topics of the test items from being confined by item creators’ personal interests.",
        "NLP techniques serve to generate multiple-choice cloze items in different ways.",
        "(For brevity, we use cloze items or items for multiple-choice cloze items henceforth.)",
        "One may create sentences from scratch by applying template-based methods (Dennis et al., 2002) or more complex methods based on some predetermined principles (Deane and Sheehan, 2003).",
        "Others may take existing sentences from a corpus, and select those that meet the criteria for becoming test items.",
        "The former approach provides specific and potentially well-controlled test items at the costs of more complex systems than the latter, e.g., (Sheehan et al., 2003).",
        "Nevertheless, as the Web provides ample text files at our disposal, we may filter the text sources stringently for obtaining candidate test items of higher quality.",
        "Administrators can then select really usable items from these candidates at a relatively lower cost.",
        "Some researchers have already applied NLP techniques to the generation of sentences for multiple-choice cloze items.",
        "Stevens (1991) employs the concepts of concordance and collocation for generating items with general corpora.",
        "Coniam (1997) relies on factors such as word frequencies in a tagged corpus for creating test items of particular types.",
        "There are other advanced NLP techniques that may help to create test items of higher quality.",
        "For instance, many words in English may carry multiple senses, and test administrators usually want to test a particular usage of the word in an item.",
        "In this case, blindly applying a keyword matching method, such as a concordancer, may lead us to a list of irrelevant sentences that would demand a lot of postprocess",
        "ing workload.",
        "In addition, composing a cloze item requires not just a useful sentence.",
        "Figure 1 shows a multiple-choice item, where we call the sentence with a gap the stem, the answer to the gap the key, and the other choices the distractors.",
        "Given a sentence, we still need distractors for a multiple-choice item.",
        "The selection of distractors affects the item facility and item discrimination of the cloze items (Poel and Weatherly, 1997).",
        "Therefore, the selection of distractors calls for deliberate strategies, and simple considerations alone, such as word frequencies, may not satisfy the demands.",
        "To remedy these shortcomings, we employ the techniques for word sense disambiguation (WSD) for choosing sentences in which the keys carries specific senses, and utilize the techniques for computing collocations (Manning and Sch¨utze, 1999) for selecting distractors.",
        "Results of empirical evaluation show that our methods could create items of satisfactory quality, and we have actually used the generated cloze items in freshmen-level English classes.",
        "For broadening the formats of cloze items, we also design software that assists teachers to create listening cloze items.",
        "After we defining a metric for measuring similarity between pronunciations of words, our system could choose distractors for listening cloze items.",
        "This addition opens a door to offering different challenging levels of cloze items.",
        "We sketch the flow of the item generation process in Section 2, and explain the preparation of the source corpus in Section 3.",
        "In Section 4, we elaborate on the application of WSD to selecting sentences for cloze items, and, in Section 5, we delve into the application of collocations to distractor generation.",

        "The item shown in this figure is very similar to that shown in Figure 1, except that students read and hear the options.",
        "From this most primitive format, we can image and implement other more challenging formats.",
        "For instance, we can replace the stem, currently in printed form in Figure 6, into clickable links, demanding students to hear the stem rather than reading the stem.",
        "A middle ground between this more challenging format and the original format in the figure is to allow the gap to cover more words in the original sentence.",
        "This would require the students to listen to a longer stream of sound, so can be a task more challenging than the original test.",
        "In addition to controlling the lengths of the answer voices, we can try to modulate the speed that the voices are replayed.",
        "Moreover, for multiple-word listening cloze, we may try to find word sequences that sound similar to the answer sequence to control the difficulty of the test item.",
        "Defining a metric for measuring similarity between two recordings is the key to support the aforementioned functions.",
        "In (Huang et al., 2005), we consider such features of phonemes as place and manner of pronunciation in calculating the similarity between sounds.",
        "Using this metric we choose as distractors those sounds of words that have similar pronunciation with the key of the listening cloze.",
        "We have to define the distance between each phoneme so that we could employ the minimal-edit-distance algorithm for computing the distance between the sounds of different words."

      "text": [
        "We believe that NLP techniques can play an important role in computer assisted language learning, and this belief is supported by papers in this workshop and the literature.",
        "What we have just explored is limited to the composition of cloze items for English vocabulary.",
        "With the assistance of WSD techniques, our system was able to identify sentences that were qualified as candidate cloze items 65% of the time.",
        "Considering both word frequencies and collocation, our system recommended distractors for cloze items, resulting in items that had unique answers 90% of the time.",
        "In addition to assisting the composition of cloze items in the printed format, our system is also capable of helping the composition of listening cloze items.",
        "The current system considers features of phonemes in computing distances between pronunciations of different word strings.",
        "We imagine that NLP and other software techniques could empower us to create cloze items for a wide range of applications.",
        "We could control the formats, contents, and timing of the presented material to manipulate the challenging levels of the test items.",
        "As we have indicated in Section 7, cloze items in the listening format are harder than comparable items in the printed format.",
        "We can also control when and what the students can hear to fine tune the difficulties of the listening cloze items.",
        "We must admit, however, that we do not have sufficient domain knowledge in how human learn languages.",
        "Consequently, tools offered by computing technologies that appear attractive to computer scientists or computational linguists might not provide effective assistance for language learning or diagnosis.",
        "Though we have begun to study item comparison from a mathematical viewpoint (Liu, 2005), the current results are far from being practical.",
        "Expertise in psycholinguistics may offer a better guidance on our system design, we suppose."
