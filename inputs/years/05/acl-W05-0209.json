        "With few exceptions, systems for evaluating language proficiency and for Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) do not use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.",
        "Typically, existing commercial and non-commercial programs apply some sort of pattern-matching techniques to analyze texts.",
        "These techniques not only reduce the quality and the nature of the feedback but also limit the range of possible CALL applications.",
        "In this paper, we present a system that implements an automatic analysis of texts freely written by learners.",
        "Research on Second Language Acquisition (SLA) has shown that writing your own text in a communicative and meaningful situation with a feedback and/or an evaluation of its quality and its form constitutes an excellent exercise to develop second language skills.",
        "The aim of the program, called Direkt Profil, is to evaluate the linguistic level of the learners’ texts in the shape of a learner profile.",
        "To analyze sentences, the program relies on previous research on second language development in French that itemized a number of specific constructions corresponding to developmental sequences."

        "This corpus currently contains approximately 100,000 words (Agren, 2005).",
        "The texts are narratives of varied length and levels.",
        "We elicited them by asking 85 Swedish high-school students and 22 young French to write stories evoked by a sequence of images.",
        "Figure 1 shows pictures corresponding to one of them: Le voyage en Italie “The journey to Italy”.",

        "The following narrative is an example from a be",
        "This text contains a certain number of typical constructions for French as a foreign language: parataxis, very simple word order, absence of object pronouns, basic verb forms, agreement errors, spelling mistakes.",
        "Research on the acquisition of French as a foreign language has shown that these constructions (and others) appear in a certain systematic fashion according to the proficiency level of the learners.",
        "With Direkt Profil, we aim at detecting automatically these structures and gathering them so that they represent a grammatical learner profile.",

        "The analyzer parses the text of a learner, annotates the constructions, and counts the number of occurrences of each phenomenon.",
        "The result is a text profile based on these criteria and, possibly, an indication of the level of the text.",

        "The line of programs leading to PLNLP (Jensen et al., 1993) and NLPWin (Heidorn, 2000) is one of the most notable achievements.",
        "The grammatical checker of PLNLP carries out a complete parse.",
        "It uses binary phrase-structure rules and takes into account some dependency relations.",
        "PLNLP is targeted primarily, but not exclusively, to users writing in their mother tongue.",
