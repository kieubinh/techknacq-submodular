        "This paper proposes the automatic generation of Fill-in-the-Blank Questions (FBQs) together with testing based on Item Response Theory (IRT) to measure English proficiency.",
        "First, the proposal generates an FBQ from a given sentence in English.",
        "The position of a blank in the sentence is determined, and the word at that position is considered as the correct choice.",
        "The candidates for incorrect choices for the blank are hypothesized through a thesaurus.",
        "Then, each of the candidates is verified by using the Web.",
        "Finally, the blanked sentence, the correct choice and the incorrect choices surviving the verification are together laid out to form the FBQ.",
        "Second, the proficiency of nonnative speakers who took the test consisting of such FBQs is estimated through IRT.",
        "Our experimental results suggest that:",
        "(1) the generated questions plus IRT estimate the non-native speakers’ English proficiency; (2) while on the other hand, the test can be completed almost perfectly by English native speakers; and (3) the number of questions can be reduced by using item information in IRT.",
        "The proposed method provides teachers and testers with a tool that reduces time and expenditure for testing English proficiency."

        "English has spread so widely that 1,500 million people, about a quarter of the world’s population, speak it, though at most about 400 million speak it as their native language (Crystal, 2003).",
        "Thus, English education for non-native speakers both now and in the near future is of great importance.",
        "The progress of computer technology is advancing an electronic tool for language learning called Computer-Assisted Language Learning (CALL) and for language testing called Computer-Based Testing (CBT) or Computer-Adaptive Testing (CAT).",
        "However, no computerized support for producing a test, a collection of questions for evaluating language proficiency, has emerged to date.",
        "* Fill-in-the-Blank Questions (FBQs) are widely used from the classroom level to far larger scales to measure peoples’ proficiency at English as a second language.",
        "Examples of such tests include TOEFL (Test Of English as a Foreign Language, http://www.ets.org/toefl/) and TOEIC (Test Of English for International Communication, http://www.ets.org/toeic/).",
        "A test comprising FBQs has merits in that (1) it is easy for test-takers to input answers, (2) computers can mark them, thus marking is invariable and objective, and (3) they are suitable for the modern testing theory, Item Response Theory (IRT).",
        "Because it is regarded that writing incorrect choices that distract only the non-proficient test-taker is a highly skilled business (Alderson, 1996), FBQs have been written by human experts.",
        "Thus, test construction is time-consuming and expensive.",
        "As a result, utilizing up-to-date texts for question writing is not practical, nor is tuning in to individual students.",
        "To solve the problems of time and expenditure, this paper proposes a method for generating FBQs using a corpus, a thesaurus, and the Web.",
        "Experiments have shown that the proficiency estimated through IRT with generated FBQs highly correlates with non-native speakers’ real proficiency.",
        "This system not only provides us with a quick and inexpensive testing method, but it also features the following advantages: (I) It provides “anyone” individually with up-to-date and interesting questions for self-teaching.",
        "We have implemented a program that downloads any Web page such as a news site and generates questions from it.",
        "(II) It also enables on-demand testing at “anytime and anyplace.” We have implemented a system that operates on a mobile phone.",
        "Questions are generated and pooled in the server, and upon a user’s request, questions are downloaded.",
        "CAT (Wainer, 2000) is then conducted on the phone.",
        "The system for mobile phone is scheduled to be deployed in May of 2005 in Japan.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
