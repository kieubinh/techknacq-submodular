        "The creation of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993) and the word sense-annotated SEMCOR (Fellbaum, 1997) have shown how even limited amounts of annotated data can result in major improvements in complex natural language understanding systems.",
        "These annotated corpora have led to high-level improvements for parsing and word sense disambiguation (WSD), on the same scale as previously occurred for Part of Speech tagging by the annotation of the Brown corpus and, more recently, the British National Corpus (BNC) (Burnard, 2000).",
        "However, the creation of semantically annotated corpora has lagged dramatically behind the creation of other linguistic resources: in part due to the perceived cost, in part due to an assumed lack of theoretical agreement on basic semantic judgments, in part, finally, due to the understandable unwillingness of research groups to get involved in such an undertaking.",
        "As a result, the need for such resources has become urgent.",
        "Many recent annotation efforts for English have focused on pieces of the larger problem of semantic annotation, rather than producing a single unified representation like Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (Pollard and Sag 1994) or the Prague Dependency Tecto-gramatical Representation (Hajicova & Kucerova, 2002).",
        "PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) annotates predicate argument structure anchored by verbs.",
        "NomBank (Meyers, et.",
        "al., 2004a) annotates predicate argument structure anchored by nouns.",
        "TimeBank (Pustejovsky et al., 2003) annotates the temporal features of propositions and the temporal relations between propositions.",
        "The Penn Discourse Treebank (Miltsakaki et al. 2004a/b) treats discourse connectives as predicates and the sentences being joined as arguments.",
        "Researchers at Essex were responsible for the coreference markup scheme developed in MATE (Poesio et al., 1999; Poesio, 2004a) and have annotated corpora using this scheme including a subset of the Penn Treebank (Poesio and Vieira, 1998), and the GNOME corpus (Poesio, 2004a).",
        "This paper discusses the issues involved in creating a Unified Linguistic Annotation (ULA) by merging annotation of examples using the schemata from these efforts.",
        "Crucially, all individual annotations can be kept separate in order to make it easy to produce alternative annotations of a specific type of semantic information without need to modify the annotation at the other levels.",
        "Embarking on separate annotation efforts has the advantage of allowing researchers to focus on the difficult issues in each area of semantic annotation and the disadvantage of inducing a certain amount of tunnel vision or task-centricity – annotators working on a narrow task tend to see all phenomena in light of the task they are working on, ignoring other factors.",
        "However, merging these annotation efforts allows these biases to be dealt with.",
        "The result, we believe, could be a more detailed semantic account than possible if the ULA had been the initial annotation effort rather than the result of merging.",
        "There is a growing community consensus that general annotation, relying on linguistic cues, and in particular lexical cues, will produce an enduring resource that is useful, replicable and portable.",
        "We provide the beginnings of one such level derived from several distinct annotation efforts.",
        "This level could provide the foundation for a major advance in our ability to automatically extract salient relationships from text.",
        "This will in turn facilitate breakthroughs in message understanding, machine translation, fact retrieval, and information retrieval."

        "There are several technical and theoretical issues that will need to be resolved in order to bring these different layers together seamlessly.",
        "Most of these approaches have annotated the same type of data, Wall Street Journal text, so it is also important to demonstrate that the annotation can be extended to other genres such as spoken language.",
        "The demonstration of success for the extensions would be the training of accurate statistical semantic taggers.",
        "PropBank: The Penn Proposition Bank focuses on the argument structure of verbs, and provides a corpus annotated with semantic roles, including participants traditionally viewed as arguments and adjuncts.",
        "An important goal is to provide consistent semantic role labels across different syntactic realizations of the same verb, as in the window in [ARG0 John] broke [ARG1 the window] and [ARG1 The window] broke.",
        "Arg0 and Arg1 are used rather than the more traditional Agent and Patient to keep the annotation as theory-neutral as possible, and to facilitate mapping to richer representations.",
        "The 1M word Penn Treebank II Wall Street Journal corpus has been successfully annotated with semantic argument structures for verbs and is now available via the Penn Linguistic Data Consortium as PropBank I (Palmer, et.",
        "al., 2005).",
        "Coarse-grained sense tags, based on groupings of WordNet senses, are being added, as well as links from the argument labels in the Frames Files to FrameNet frame elements.",

        "al., 1998; Fillmore & Atkins, 1998; Fillmore & Baker, 2001), Salsa (Ellsworth, et.al, 2004), Prague Tectogrammatics (Hajicova & Kucerova, 2002) and IAMTC, (Helmreich, et.",
        "al., 2004) NomBank: The NYU NomBank project can be considered part of the larger PropBank effort and is designed to provide argument structure for instances of about 5000 common nouns in the Penn Treebank II corpus (Meyers, et.",
        "al., 2004a).",
        "PropBank argument types and related verb Frames Files are used to provide a commonality of annotation.",
        "This enables the development of systems that can recognize regularizations of lexically and syntactically related sentence structures, whether they occur as verb phrases or noun phrases.",
        "For example, given an IE system tuned to a hiring scenario (MUC-6, 1995), NomBank and PropBank annotation facilitate generalization over patterns.",
        "PropBank and NomBank would both support a single IE pattern stating that the object (ARG1) of appoint is John and the subject (ARG0) is IBM, allowing a system to detect that IBM hired John from each of the following strings: IBM appointed John, John was appointed by IBM, IBM's appointment of John, the appointment of John by IBM and John is the current IBM appointee.",
        "Coreference: Coreference involves the detection of subsequent mentions of invoked entities, as in George Bush,... he....",

        "Parallel coreference annotation efforts funded by ACE have resulted in similar guidelines, exemplified by BBN’s recent annotation of Named Entities, common nouns and pronouns.",
        "These two approaches provide a suitable springboard for an attempt at achieving a community consensus on coreference.",
        "Discourse Treebank: The Penn Discourse Treebank (PDTB) (Miltsakaki et al. 2004a/b) is based on the idea that discourse connectives are predicates with associated argument structure (for details see (Miltsakaki et al. 2004a, Miltsakaki et al. 2004b).",
        "The long-range goal is to develop a large scale and reliably annotated corpus that will encode coherence relations associated with discourse connectives, including their argument structure and anaphoric links, thus exposing a clearly defined level of discourse structure and supporting the extraction of a range of inferences associated with discourse connectives.",
        "This annotation references the Penn Treebank annotations as well as PropBank, and currently only considers Wall Street Journal text.",
        "TimeBank: The Brandeis TimeBank corpus, funded by ARDA, focuses on the annotation of all major aspects in natural language text associated with temporal and event information (Day, et al., 2003, Pustejovsky, et al., 2004).",
        "Specifically, this involves three areas of the annotation: temporal expressions, event-denoting",
        "expressions, and the links that express either an anchoring of an event to a time or an ordering of one event relative to another.",
        "Identifying events and their temporal anchorings is a critical aspect of reasoning, and without a robust ability to identify and extract events and their temporal anchoring from a text, the real aboutness of the article can be missed.",

        "However, a wayward NomBank annotator might construct a support chain (player + defeated) to link rival with its ARG1 Jimmy Connors.",
        "In such a case, a merging of annotation could reveal annotation errors.",
        "In contrast, a NomBank annotator would be correct in linking John as an argument of walk in John took a series of walks (the support chain took + series consists of a support verb and a transparent noun), but this may not be obvious to the non-NomBanker.",
        "Thus the merging of annotation may result in the more consistent specifications for all.",
        "In our view, this process of annotating all layers of information and then merging them in a supervised manner, taking note of the conflicts, is a necessary prerequisite to defining more clearly the boundaries between the different types of annotation and determining how they should fit together.",
        "Other areas of annotation interaction include: (1) NomBank and Coreference, e.g. deriving that John teaches Mary from John is Mary's teacher involves: (a) recognizing that teacher is an argument nominalization such that the teacher is the ARG0 of teach (the one who teaches); and (b) marking John and teacher as being linked by predication (in this case, an instance of type coreference); and (2) Time and Modality - when a fact used to be true, there are two time components: one in which the fact is true and one in which it is false.",
        "Clearly more areas of interaction will emerge as more annotation becomes available and as the merging of annotation proceeds."
