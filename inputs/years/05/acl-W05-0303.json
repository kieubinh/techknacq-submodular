        "Annotation of referential relations involves two main tasks: the identification of markables, i.e., identifying the class of expressions that can enter into referential relations, and the identification of the particular referential relations that two or more expressions enter into.",
        "Identification of markables requires at least partial syntactic annotation of the text.",
        "If referential relations need to be annotated from plain text, then markables must be identified semi-automatically from the output of a chunker or full parser, if available, or otherwise completely manually.",
        "However, in each of these two scenarios, identification of markables is a time-consuming process.",
        "In case of semi-automatic annotation, the effort required depends on the quality of the parser, but will require at least some amount of manual post-correction of the parser output.",
        "Identification of markables is considerably easier for treebank data since treebanks already provide the necessary syntactic information.",
        "For German, there are currently two large-scale treebanks available: the NEGRA/TIGER (Brants et al., 2002) treebank and the Tübingen treebanks for spoken and written German (Stegmann et al., 2000; Telljohann et al., 2003).",
        "All the treebanks were annotated with the help of the annotation tool Annotate (Plaehn, 1998).",
        "The treebank annotations are available in the Annotate export format (Brants, 1997) and in an XML format.",
        "The SYN-RA project is based on the Tübingen treebank of written German (TüBa-D/Z).",
        "This treebank uses as its data source a collection of articles of the German daily newspaper taz (die tageszeitung).",
        "The treebank currently comprises appr.",
        "15 000 sentences, with a new release of 7 000 additional sentences scheduled for June of this year.",
        "Due to its fine grained syntactic annotation, the TüBa-D/Z treebank data are ideally suited as a basis for the identification of markables and for extracting relevant syntactic and semantic properties for each markable.",
        "The TüBa-D/Z annotation scheme distinguishes four levels of syntactic constituency: the lexical level, the phrasal level, the level of topological fields, and the clausal level.",
        "The primary ordering principle of a clause is the inventory of topological fields, which characterize the word or",
        "der regularities among different clause types of German and which are widely accepted among descriptive linguists of German (cf. e.g. (Drach, 1937; Höhle, 1986)).",
        "The TüBa-D/Z annotation relies on a context-free backbone (i.e. proper trees without crossing branches) of phrase structure combined with edge labels that specify the grammatical function of the phrase in question.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example tree from the TüBaD/Z treebank for sentence (10).",
        "The sentence is divided into two clauses (SIMPX), and each clause is subdivided into topological fields.",
        "The main clause is made up of the following fields: VF (mnemonic for: Vorfeld – ’initial field’) contains the sentence-initial, topicalized constituent.",
        "LK (for: linke Satzklammer–’left sentence bracket’) is occupied by the finite verb.",
        "MF (for: Mittelfeld –’middle field’) contains adjuncts and complements of the main verb.",

        "The subordinate clause is again divided into three topological fields: C (for: Komplementierer – ’complementizer’), MF, and VC (for: Verbalkomp-lex – verbal complex).",
        "Edge labels are rendered in boxes and indicate grammatical functions.",
        "The sentence-initial NX (for: noun phrase) is marked as OA (for: accusative complement), the pronouns sie in the main and subordinate clause as ON (for: nominative complement).",
        "(10) Ihre Schulkameradin Cassie Bernall fragten Their fellow student Cassie Bernall asked glaube.",
        "believes.",
        "’They asked their fellow student Cassie Bernall whether she believes in God.’ Topological field information and grammatical function information is crucial for anaphora resolution since binding-theory constraints crucially rely on sentence-structure (if the binding theory principles are stated configurationally (Chomsky, 1981)) or on argument-obliqueness (if the binding theory principles are stated in terms of argument structure, as in (Pollard and Sag, 1994)).",
        "In the case at hand, the subject pronoun of the main clause, sie, cannot be anaphorically related to the object NP Ihre Schulkameradin Cassie Bernall since they are co-arguments of the same verb.",
        "However, the possessive pronoun ihre and the subject pronoun sie of the subordinate clause, can be and, in fact, are anaphorically related, since they are not co-arguments of the same verb.",
        "This can be directly inferred from the treebank annotation, specifically from the sentence structure and the grammatical function information",
        "encoded on the edge labels.",
        "Most published computational algorithms of anaphora resolution, including (Hobbs, 1978; Lappin and Leass, 1994; Ingria and Stallard, 1989), rely on such binding-constraint filters to minimize the set of potential antecedents for pronouns and reflexives.",
        "As already pointed out, the sample sentence contains four markables: one possessive pronoun Ihre, two occurrences of the pronoun sie and one complex NP Ihre Schulkameradin Cassie Bernall.",
        "The latter NP is a good example of SYN-RA’s longest-match principle for identifying markables.",
        "In case of complex NPs, the entire NP counts as a markable, but so do its subconstituents – in the case at hand, particularly the possessive pronoun ihre.",
        "All of this information can be directly derived from the treebank account.",
        "Compared to other annotation efforts for German where markables have to be chosen manually (Müller and Strube, 2003), manual annotation in the SYN-RA project can, thus, be restricted to the selection of the appropriate referential relations between referentially dependent expressions and their nominal antecedents."

        "The annotation of the first personal pronoun is an example for the annotation of an anaphoric chain.",
        "Ihre and sie belong to the same chain.",

        "The latter relation is also the reason for encoding the relational information as XML elements, and not as attributes of a word or a node.",

        "While the pie-in-the-sky scheme is clearly still under development, the following characteristics and goals can already be gleaned from its web-page and the annotation examples presented there: The annotation is feature-structure-based and incorporates various levels of linguistic annotation, in particular a PROPBANK style predicate-argument structure, dependency style syntactic information, as well as morpho-syntactic and word class information.",

        "The SYN-RA annotation scheme resembles the pie-in-the-sky scheme in that it also uses one level of representation, in this case hierarchical syntactic structure, as the organizing principle and treats referential relations, grammatical function information, and morpho-syntactic annotation as subordinated types of information.",
        "More generally, the pie-in-the-sky and the SYN-RA representations offer a particular view of the annotation, each with its own “perspective”: semantics-based (pie-in-the-sky) and syntax-based (SYN-RA).",
