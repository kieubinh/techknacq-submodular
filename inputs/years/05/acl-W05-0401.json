        "Generally speaking, because not all features we predefine are important for each NER or non-NER, we should distinguish them by a reasonable measure mode.",
        "According to the selection criterion we propose - self-similarity, which is a quantitative measure for the concentrative degree of the same kind of NERs or non-NERs in the corresponding pattern library, the effective feature sets - general-character feature (GCF) sets for NERs and individual-character feature (ICF) sets for non-NERs are built.",
        "Moreover, the GCF and ICF feature weights serve as a pro portion determination of the features’ degree of importance for identifying NERs against non-NERs.",
        "Subsequently, identification thresholds can also be determined.",
        "In the NER identification, we may be confronted with the problem that an NER candidate in a new case matches more than one positive case, or both positive and negative cases.",

        "In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning and identification approach PNCBL&I.",
        "This approach exhibits the following advantages: (i) The defined negative cases are used to improve the NER identification performance as compared to only using positive cases; (ii) All of the tasks, building of NER and non-NER patterns, feature selection, feature weighting and identification threshold determination, are automatically completed.",
        "It is able to adapt the variation of NER and non-NER pattern library; (iii) The information provided by the relation features deals with multiple linguistic levels, depicts both NER and non-NER patterns, as well as satisfies the requirement of Chinese language processing; (iv) Self-similarity is a reasonable measure for the concentrative degree of the same kind of NERs or non-NERs, which can be used to select general-character and individual-character features for NERs and non-NERs respectively; (v) The strategies used for achieving an optimal NER identification tradeoff, resolving NER conflicts, and inferring missing NERs can further improve the performance for NER identification; (vi) It can be applied to sentence groups containing multiple sentences.",
        "Thus identified NERs are allowed to cross sentences boundaries.",
        "The experimental results have shown that the method is appropriate and effective for improving the identification performance of NERs in Chinese."
