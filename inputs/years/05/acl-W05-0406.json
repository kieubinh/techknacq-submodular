        "In the previous literature these have been called “pleonas-tic”, “expletive”, and “non-anaphoric”.",

        "only to end up with inaccurate results.",
        "The task of identifying non-referential it could be incorporated into a part-of-speech tagger or parser, or viewed as an initial step in semantic interpretation.",
        "We develop a linguistically-motivated classification for non-referential it which includes four types of non-referential it: extrapositional, cleft, weather/condition/time/place, and idiomatic, each of which will be discussed in more detail in Section 2.",

        "Non-referential it makes up a significant proportion of the occurrences of it in our corpus, which contains a selection of written texts of various genres, approximately one-third prose fiction, one-third newspaper text, and one-third other non-fiction.",

        "As mentioned in Section 2.2, clefts can be difficult to identify.",
        "Decision tree algorithms seem suited to this kind of task and have been used previously, but C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993) decision tree algorithm did not perform as well as TiMBL on our data, compare the TiMBL results (MBL) with the C4.5 results (DT) in Table 7.",
        "This may be because the verb and adjective lemma features (F10-F12) had hundreds of possible values and were not as useful in a decision tree as in the memory-based learning algorithm.",
        "With the addition of more relevant, generalized grammatical patterns, the precision and accuracy have increased significantly, but the same cannot be said for recall.",
        "Because many of the patterns are designed to match specific function words as the right bracket, cases where the right bracket is omitted (e.g., extraposed clauses with no overt complementizers, truncated clefts, clefts with reduced relative clauses) are difficult to match.",
        "Other problematic cases include sentences with a lot of intervening",
        "material between it and the right bracket or simple idioms which cannot be easily differentiated.",
        "The results for cleft, weather, and idiomatic it may also be due in part to sparse data.",
        "When only 2% of the instances of it are of a certain type, there are fewer than one hundred training instances, and it can be difficult for the memory-based learning method to be very successful."

        "The accurate classification of it as referential or non-referential is important for natural language tasks such as reference resolution (Ng and Cardie, 2002).",
        "Through an examination of the types of constructions containing non-referential it, we are able to develop a set of detailed grammatical patterns associated with non-referential it.",
        "In previous rule-based systems, word lists were created for the verbs and adjectives which often occur in these patterns.",
        "Such a system can be limited because it is unable to adapt to new texts, but the basic grammatical patterns are still reasonably consistent indicators of non-referential it.",
        "Given a POS-tagged corpus, the relevant linguistic patterns can be generalized over part-of-speech tags, reducing the dependence on brittle word lists.",
        "A machine learning algorithm is able to adapt to new texts and new words, but it is less able to generalize about the linguistic patterns from a small training set.",
        "To be able to use our knowledge of relevant linguistic patterns without having to specify lists of words as indicators of certain types of it, we developed a machine learning system which incorporates the relevant patterns as features alongside part-of-speech and lexical information.",
        "Two short lists are still used to help identify weather it and a few idioms.",
        "The k-nearest neighbors algorithm from the Tilburg Memory Based Learner is used with 25 features and achieved 88% accuracy, 82% precision, and 71% recall for the binary classification of it as referential or non-referential.",
        "Our classifier outperforms previous systems in both accuracy and precision, but recall is still a problem.",
        "Many instances of non-referential it are difficult to identify because typical clues such as com-plementizers and relative pronouns can be omitted.",
        "Because of this, subordinate and relative clauses cannot be consistently identified given only a POS-tagged corpus.",
        "Improvements could be made in the future by integrating chunking or parsing into the pattern-matching features used in the system.",
        "This would help in identifying extrapositional and cleft it.",
        "Knowledge about context beyond the sentence level will be needed to accurately identify certain types of cleft, weather, and idiomatic constructions."
