        "Our long term goal is the development of methods which will allow one to produce optimal analyses from arbitrary natural language corpora, where by optimization we understand an MDL (minimum description length; Rissanen, 1989) interpretation of the term: an optimal analysis is one which finds a grammar which simultaneously minimizes grammar length and data compression length.",
        "Our specific and primary focus is on morphology, and on how knowledge of morphology can be a useful step towards a more complete knowledge of a language’s linguistic structure.",
        "Our strategy is based on the following observation: knowing the rightmost suffix of a word is very useful information in inferring (or guessing) a word’s part of speech (POS), but due to the ambiguity of many suffixes, it is even better to know both a word’s suffix and the range of other suffixes that the word’s stem appears with elsewhere, i.e., its signature.",
        "As we will see below, this conjunction of “better” information is what we call the signature transform, and in this paper, we explore how knowledge of signature transform can be merged with knowledge of the context vector to draw conclusions about morphology and syntax.",
        "In the distant future, we would like to be able to use the signature transform in a general process of grammar induction, but that day is not here; we therefore test our experiments by seeing how well we are able to predict POS as assigned by an available tagger (TreeTagger; Schmid 1994).",
        "In particular, we wish to decrease the uncertainty of a word’s POS through the morphological analysis described here.",
        "This decrease of uncertainty will enter into our calculation through an increase in the probability assigned to our test corpus once the corpus has been augmented with TreeTagger assigned POS tags.",
        "But to be clear on our",
        "process: we analyze a completely raw text morphologically, and use the POS tags from TreeTagger only to evaluate the signature transforms that we generate.",
        "We assume without argument here that any adequate natural language grammar will contain a lexicon which includes both lexical stems which are specified for morphological properties, such as the specific affixes with which they may occur, and affixes associated with lexical categories.",
        "We also explicitly note that many affixes are homophonous: they are pronounced (or written) identically, but have different morphological or syntactic characteristics, such as the English plural –s and the verbal 3rd person singular present –s.",
        "We focus initially on unsupervised learning of morphology for three reasons: first, because we already have a quite successful unsupervised morphological learner; second, the final suffix of a word is typically the strongest single indicator of its syntactic category; and third, analysis of a word into a stem T plus suffix F allows us (given our knowledge that the suffix F is a stronger indicator of category than the stem T) to collapse many distinct stems into a single cover symbol for purposes of analysis, simplifying our task, as we shall see.1 We eschew the use of linguistic resources with hand-(i.e., human-)assigned morphological information in order for this work to contribute, eventually, to a better theoretical understanding of human language acquisition.",
        "We present in this paper an algorithm that modifies the output of the morphology analyzer by combining redundant signatures.",
        "Since we ultimately want to use signatures and signature transforms to learn syntactic categories, we developed an algorithm that uses the syntactic contextual information.",
        "We evaluate the changes to the morphological analysis from the standpoint of efficient and adequate representation of lexical categories.",
        "This paper presents a test conducted on English, and thus can only be considered a preliminary step in the",
        "eventually development of a language-independent tool for grammar induction based on morphology.",
        "Nonetheless, the concepts that motivate the process are language-independent, and we are optimistic that similar results would be found in tests based on texts from other languages.",
        "In section 2 we discuss the notion of signature and signature transform, and section 3 present a more explicit formulation of the general problem.",
        "In section 4 we present our algorithm for signature collapse.",
        "Section 5 describes the experiments we ran to test the signature collapsing algorithm, and section 6 presents and discusses our results."

        "We employ the unsupervised learning of morphology developed by Goldsmith (Goldsmith, 2001).",
        "Regrettably, some of the discussion below depends rather heavily on material presented there, but we attempt to summarize the major points here.",
        "Two critical terms that we employ in this analysis are signature and signature transform.",
        "A signature found in a given corpus is a pair of lists: a stem-list and a suffix-list (or in the appropriate context, a prefix-list).",
        "By definition of signature 6, the concatenation of every stem in the stem-list of 6 with every suffix in the suffix-list of 6 is found in the corpus, and a morphological analysis of a corpus can be viewed as a set of signatures that uniquely analyze each word in the corpus.",
        "For example, a corpus of English that includes the words jump, jumps, jumped, jumping, walk, walks, walked, and walking might include the signature 61 whose stem list is { jump, walk } and whose suffix list is { fly, ed, ing , s }.",
        "For convenience, we label a signature with the concatenation of its suffixes separated by period ‘.’.",
        "On such an analysis, the word jump is analyzed as belonging to the signature 0. ed.",
        "ing.s, and it bears the suffix fly.",
        "We say, then, that the signature transform of jump is 0.ed.ing.s_ 0, just as the signature transform of jumping is 0.ed.ing.s_ing; in general, the signature transform of a word W, when W is morphologically analyzed as stem T followed by suffix F, associated with signature 6, is defined as 6_F.",
        "In many of the experiments described below, we use a corpus in which all words whose frequency rank is greater than 200 have been replaced by their signature transforms.",
        "This move is motivated by the observation that high frequency words in natural languages tend to have syntactic distributions poorly predictable by any feature other than their specific identity, whereas the distribution properties of lower frequency words (which we take to be words whose frequency rank is 200 or below) are better predicted by category membership.",
        "In many cases, there is a natural connection between a signature transform and a lexical category.",
        "Our ultimate goal is to exploit this in the larger context of grammar induction.",
        "For example, consider the signature O.er.ly, which occurs with stems such as strong and weak; in fact, words whose signature transform is O.er.ly_ O are adjectives, those whose signature transform is O.er.ly_er are comparative adjectives, and those whose signature transform is O.er.ly_ly are adverbs.",
        "The connection is not perfect, however.",
        "Consider the signature O.ed.ing.s and its four signature transforms.",
        "While most words whose σ transform is O.ed.ing.s_s are verbs (indeed, 3rd person singular present tense verbs, as in he walks funny), many are in fact plural nouns (e.g., walks in He permitted four walks in the eighth inning is a plural noun).",
        "We will refer to this problem as the signature purity problem–it is essentially the reflex of the ambiguity of suffixes.",
        "In addition, many 3rd person singular present tense verbs are associated with other signature transforms, such as O.ing.s_s, O.ed.s_s, and so forth; we will refer to this as the signature-collapsing problem, because all other things being equal, we would like to collapse certain signatures, such as O.ed.ing.s and O.ed.ing, since a stem that is associated with the latter signature could have appeared in the corpus with an s suffix; removing the O.ed.ing signature and reassigning its stems to the O.ed.ing.s signature will in general give us a better linguistic analysis of the corpus, one that can be better used in the problem of lexical category induction.",
        "This is the reflex of the familiar data sparsity concern.2 Since we ultimately want to use signatures and signature transforms to learn syntactic categories, we base the similarity measure between the signatures on the context."

        "2 The signature-collapsing problem has another side to it as well.",

        "As we 3 We do not sum over all occurrences of a word in the corpus; we count the compressed length of each word type found in the corpus.",
        "This decision was made based on the observation that the (compressed length of the) data term grows much faster than the length of the grammar as the corpus gets large, and the loss in ability of the model to predict word frequencies overwhelms any increase in model simplicity when we count word tokens in the data terms.",
        "We recognize the departure from the traditional understanding of MML here, and assume the responsibility to explain this in a future publication.",
        "have seen, a path from a particular signature σ to a particular affix f constitutes what we have called a particular signature transform σ_f ; and we condition the probabilities of the POS tags in the data on the preceding signature transformation.",

        "The differences between the models are found in the added final term in (3b), which specifies the information required to predict, or specify, the part of speech given the signature",
        "transform, and the corresponding term in the corpus compression expression (3c).",
        "The model in (3) implicitly assumes that the true POSs are known; in a more complete model, the POSs play a direct role in assigning a higher probability to the corpus (and hence a smaller compressed size to the data).",
        "In the context of such a model, an MDL-based learning device searches for the best assignment of POS tags over all possible assignments.",
        "Instead of doing that in this paper, we employ the TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994) based tags (see section 5 below), and make the working assumption that optimization of description length over all signature-analyses and POS tags can be approximated by optimization over all signature-analyses, given the POS tags provided by TreeTagger."
