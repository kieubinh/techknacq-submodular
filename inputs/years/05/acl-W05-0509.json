        "Current research in language learning supports the view that developing grammatical competence involve mastering and integrating multiple, parallel, probabilistic constraints defined over different types of linguistic (and non linguistic) information (Seidenberg and MacDonald 1999, MacWhinney 2004).",
        "This is particularly clear when we focus on the core of grammatical development, namely the ability to properly identify syntactic relations.",
        "Psycholinguistic evidence shows that children learn to identify sentence subjects and direct objects by combining various types of probabilistic cues, such as word order, noun animacy, definiteness, agreement, etc.",
        "The relative prominence of each of these cues during the development of a child’s syntactic competence can considerably vary cross-linguistically, mirroring their relative salience in the adult grammar system (cf. Bates et al.",
        "1984).",
        "If grammatical constraints are inherently probabilistic (Manning 2003), the path through which the child acquires adult grammar competence can be viewed as the process of building a stochastic model out of the linguistic input.",
        "Consistently with “usage-based” approaches to language acquisition (cf. Tomasello, 2000) grammatical constraints would thus emerge from language use thanks to the child’s ability to keep track of statistical regularities in linguistic cues.",
        "In turn, this raises the issue of how children are able to exploit the statistical distribution of cues in the linguistic input.",
        "Various types of cross-linguistic evidence converge on the hypothesis that children are actually able to take great advantage of the highly skewed distribution of naturalistic language data.",
        "Goldberg et al.",
        "(2004), Matthews et al.",
        "(2003), Ninio (1999) among the others argue that verbs with high token frequency in the input have a facilitatory effect in allowing children to derive robust syntactic generalizations even from surprisingly minimal input.",
        "According to this model, syntactic learning is driven by a small pool of verbs occurring with the highest token frequency: they approximately correspond to so-called “light verbs” such as English go, give, want etc.",
        "These verbs would act as “cata",
        "lysts” in allowing children to converge on the most salient grammar constraints of the language they are acquiring.",
        "In computational linguistics, Maximum Entropy models have proven to be robust statistical learning algorithms that perform well in a number of processing tasks (cf. Ratnaparkhi 1998).",
        "In this paper, we discuss successful application of a Maximum Entropy (ME) model to the processing of Italian syntactic relations.",
        "We believe that this discussion is of general interest for two basic reasons.",
        "First, the model is able to learn, from corpus data, a set of experimentally and theoretically well-motivated linguistic constraints, as well as their relative salience in the processing of Italian.",
        "This suggests that it is possible for a child to bootstrap and use this type of knowledge on the basis of a specific distribution of real language data, a conclusion that bears on the question of the role and type of innate inductive biases.",
        "Secondly, the model is also shown to acquire robust syntactic generalizations by relying on the evidence provided by a small number of high token frequency verbs only.",
        "With some qualifications, this evidence sheds light on the interaction between highly skewed language data distributions and language maturation.",
        "Robust grammar generalizations emerge on the basis of exposure to early, statistically stable and lexically underspecified evidence, thus providing a reliable backbone to children’s syntactic development and later lexical organization.",
        "In the following section we first broach the general problem of parsing subjects and objects in Italian.",
        "Section 3 describes an ME model of the problem.",
        "Section 4 and 5 are devoted to a detailed empirical analysis of the interaction of different feature configurations and of the interplay between verb token frequency and relevant generalizations.",
        "Conclusions are drawn in the final discussion."

      "text": [
        "Children that learn how to process subjects and objects in Italian are confronted with a twofold challenge: i) the relatively free order of Italian sentence constituents and ii) the possible absence of an overt subject.",
        "The existence of a preferred Subject Verb Object (SVO) order in Italian main clauses does not rule out all other possible permutations of these units: in fact, they are all attested, albeit with considerable differences in distribution and degree of markedness (Bartolini et al.",
        "2004).1 Moreover, because of pro-drop, an Italian Verb Noun (VN) sequence can either be interpreted as a VO construction with subject omission (e.g. ha dichiarato guerra ‘(he) declared war’) or as an instance of postverbal subject (VS, e.g. ha dichiarato Giovanni ‘John declared’).",
        "Symmetrically, an NV sequence is potentially ambiguous between SV and OV: compare il bambino ha man-giato ‘the child ate’ with il gelato ha mangiato ‘the ice-cream, (he) ate’.",
        "These grammatical facts are in keeping with what we know about Italian children’s parsing strategies.",
        "Bates et al.",
        "(1984) show that while, in English, word order is by and large the most effective cue for subject-object identification (henceforth SOI) both in syntactic processing and during the child’s syntactic development, the same cue plays second fiddle in Italian.",
        "Bates and colleagues bring empirical evidence supporting the hypothesis that Italian children show extreme reliance on NV agreement and, secondly, on noun animacy, rather than word order.",
        "They conclude that the following syntactic constraints dominance hierarchy is operative in Italian: agreement > animacy > word order.",
        "The fact that animacy can reliably be resorted to in Italian SOI receives indirect confirmation from corpus data.",
        "We looked at the distribution of animate subjects and objects in the Italian Syntactic Semantic Treebank (ISST, Montemagni et al., 2003), a 300,000 tokens syntactically annotated corpus, including articles from contemporary Italian newspapers and periodicals covering a broad variety of topics.",
        "Subjects and objects in ISST were automatically annotated for animacy using the SIMPLE Italian computational lexicon (Lenci et al.",
        "2000) as a background semantic resource.",
        "The annotation was then checked manually.",
        "Corpus analysis highlights a strong asymmetry in the distribution of animate nouns in subject and object roles: over 56.6% of ISST subjects are animate (out of a total number of 12,646), while only the 11.1% of objects are animate (out of a total number of 5,559).",
        "Such an overwhelming preference for inanimate objects in adult language data makes animacy play a very important role in SOI, both as a key developmental factor in the bootstrapping of the syntax-semantics mapping and as a reliable",
        "processing cue, consistently with psycholinguistic data.",
        "On the other hand, the distribution of word order configurations in the same corpus shows another interesting asymmetry.",
        "NV sequences receive an SV interpretation in 95.6% of the cases, and an object interpretation in the remaining 4.4% (most of which are clitic and relative pronouns, whose preverbal position is grammatically constrained).",
        "The situation is quite different when we turn to VN sequences, where verb-object pairs represent 73.4% of the cases, with verb-subject pairs representing the remaining 26.6%.",
        "We infer that – at least in standard written Italian – VS is a much more consistently used construction than OV, and that the role of word order in Italian parsing is not a marginal one across the board, but rather relative to VN contexts only.",
        "In NV constructions there is a strong preference for a subject interpretation, and this suggests a more dynamic dominance hierarchy of Italian syntactic constraints than the one provided above.",
        "As for agreement, it represents conclusive evidence for SOI only when a nominal constituent and a verb do not agree in number and/or person (as in leggono il libro ‘(they) read the book’).",
        "On the contrary, when noun and verb share the same person and number the impact of agreement on SOI is neutralised, as in il bambino legge il libro ‘the child reads the book’ or in ha dichiarato il presi-dente ‘the president declared’.",
        "Although this ambiguity arises in specific contexts (i.e. when the verb is used in the third person singular or plural and the subject/object candidate agrees with it), it is interesting to note that in ISST: third person verb forms cover 95.6% of all finite verb forms; and, more interestingly for our present concerns, 87.9% of all VN and NV pairs involving a third person verb form contains an agreeing noun.",
        "From this we conclude that the contribution of agreement to our problem is fairly limited, as lack of agreement shows up only in a limited number of contexts.",
        "All in all, corpus data lend support to the idea that in Italian SOI is governed by a complex interplay of probabilistic constraints of a different nature (morpho-syntactic, semantic, word order etc.).",
        "Moreover, distributional asymmetries in language data seem to provide a fairly reliable statistical basis upon which relevant probabilistic constraints can be bootstrapped and combined consistently.",
        "In the following section we shall present a ME model of how constraints and their interaction can be bootstrapped from language data."

      "text": [
        "The Maximum Entropy (ME) framework offers a mathematically sound way to build a probabilistic model for SOI, which combines different linguistic cues.",
        "Given a linguistic context c and an outcome a A that depends on c, in the ME framework the conditional probability distribution p(a|c) is estimated on the basis of the assumption that no a priori constraints must be met other than those related to a set of features fj(a,c) of c, whose distribution is derived from the training data.",
        "It can be proven that the probability distribution p satisfying the above assumption is the one with the highest entropy, is unique and has the following exponential form (Berger et al.",
        "1996):",
        "where Z(c) is a normalization factor, fj(a, c) are the values of k features of the pair (a,c) and correspond to the linguistic cues of c that are relevant to predict the outcome a.",
        "Features are extracted from the training data and define the constraints that the probabilistic model p must satisfy.",
        "The parameters of the distribution a1, ..., ak correspond to weights associated with the features, and determine the relevance of each feature in the overall model.",
        "In the experiments reported below feature weights have been estimated with the Generative Iterative Scaling (GIS) algorithm implemented in the AMIS software (Miyao and Tsujii 2002).",
        "We model SOI as the task of predicting the correct syntactic function f {subject, object} of a noun occurring in a given syntactic context s. This is equivalent to build the conditional probability distribution p(f |s) of having a syntactic function f in a syntactic context s .",
        "Adopting the ME approach, the distribution p can be rewritten in the parametric form of (1), with features corresponding to the linguistic contextual cues relevant to SOI.",
        "The context s is a pair <vs, ns>, where vs is the verbal head and ns its nominal dependent in s. This notion of s departs from more traditional ways of describing an SOI context as a triple of one verb and two nouns in a certain syntactic configuration (e.g, SOV or VOS, etc.).",
        "In fact, we assume that SOI can be stated in terms of the more",
        "local task of establishing the grammatical function of a noun n observed in a verb-noun pair.",
        "This simplifying assumption is consistent with the claim in MacVVhinney et al.",
        "(1984) that SVO word order is actually derivative from SV and VO local patterns and downplays the role of the transitive complex construction in sentence processing.",
        "Evidence in favour of this hypothesis also comes from corpus data: in ISST, there are 4,072 complete subject-verb-object-configurations, a small number if compared to the 11,584 verb tokens appearing with either a subject or an object only.",
        "Due to the comparative sparseness of canonical SVO constructions in Italian, it seems more reasonable to assume that children should pay a great deal of attention to both SV and VO units as cues in sentence perception (Matthews et al.",
        "2004).",
        "Reconstruction of the whole lexical SVO pattern can accordingly be seen as the end point of an acquisition process whereby smaller units are re-analyzed as being part of more comprehensive constructions.",
        "This hypothesis is more in line with a distributed view of canonical constructions as derivative of more basic local positional patterns, working together to yield more complex and abstract constructions.",

        "This allows us to evaluate the probabilistic model also with respect to its ability to replicate psycholinguistic experimental results and to be consistent with linguistic generalizations.",
        "Features are binary functions fki,f (f ,s), which test whether a certain cue ki for the function f occurs in the context s. For our ME model of SOI, we have selected the following types of features: Word order tests the position of the noun wrt the verb, for instance:",
        "Animacy tests whether the noun in s is animate or inanimate (cf. §.2).",

        "According to this hierarchy, subjects with a low degree of definiteness are more marked than subjects with a high degree of definiteness (for objects the reverse pattern holds).",
        "Given the importance assigned to the definiteness markedness hierarchy in current linguistic research, we have included the definiteness cue in the ME model.",
        "It is worth remarking that, unlike animacy, in psycholinguistic experiments definiteness has not been assigned any effective role in SOI.",
        "This makes testing this cue in a computational model even more interesting, as a way to evaluate its effective contribution to Italian SOI.",

        "pair i) is a name or a pronoun ii) has a definite article iii), has an indefinite article or iv) is a “bare” noun (i.e. with no article).",
        "It is worth saying that “bare” nouns are usually placed at the bottom end of the definiteness scale.",
        "The three types of features above only refer to nominal cues in the context pairs.",
        "Nevertheless, specific lexical properties of the verb can also be resorted to in SOI.",
        "The probability for ns to be subject or object may also depend on the specific lexical preferences of vs. To take this lexical factor into account, we add a set of lexical cues to the three general feature types above.",

        "By including lexical cues, we are thus able to test the interplay of lexical constraints with general grammatical ones.",
        "Note that in our ME model we have not included agreement as a feature, in spite of its prominent role in Italian.",

        "To address these open issues and put the alleged “pathbreaking” role of light verbs to the challenging test of a probabilistic model, we carried out a second battery of experiments to learn the general, non-lexical constraints from two training corpora of roughly equivalent size where overall type and token verb frequencies were controlled for.",
        "Both corpora are a subset of the original training set:",
        "1. skewed frequency corpus (SF) – it includes",
        "5,261 context pairs, obtained by selecting 15 verbs occurring more than 100 times in ISST (figures in parentheses give their token frequency): essere ‘be’ (2406), avere ‘have’ (708), fare ‘do, make’ (527), dire ‘say, tell’ (275), dare ‘give’ (173), ve-dere ‘see’ (134), andare ‘go’ (126), sembrare ‘seem’ (124), cercare ‘try’ (122), mettere ‘put’ (122), portare ‘take’ (121), trovare ‘find’ (112), volere ‘want’ (105), lasciare ‘leave’ (105), riuscire ‘manage’ (101).",
        "It is worth noticing that this set includes typical “pathbreaking” verbs; 2. balanced frequency corpus (BF) – this corpus includes 5,373 context pairs selected in such a way to ensure that every verb type in the original training set is attested in BF and occurs at most 6 times.",
        "For verbs occurring with a higher frequency, the pairs to be included in BF have been randomly selected.",
        "Thus SF and BF represent two opposite training situations: SF contains few types with very high token frequencies, while BF contains a high number of verb types (i.e. 1457), with very low and uniform token frequency.",
        "These training sets resemble the structure of linguistic input used by Goldberg et al.",
        "(2004) for their experiments.",
        "In that case, one group of subjects was exposed to linguistic inputs in which some verbs occurred with a much higher frequency than the others; a second group of subjects was instead exposed to linguistic stimuli in which every verb occurred with roughly equal frequency.",
        "Therefore, by training our ME model on SF and BF we are able to evaluate the effective role of high token frequency verbs in driving syntactic learning.",
        "The ME model with the general features only (i.e. NTC) was first trained on SF, and then tested on the 645-pair corpus in §.5, showing a 90% accuracy.",
        "The same ME model was then trained on BF, and then tested on the 645-pair corpus, scoring a 87% accuracy.",
        "The ME model trained on the skewed frequency data thus outperforms the model trained on BF in a statistically significant way (?2 = 4.97; a=0.05; p-value = 0.025).",
        "By using a training set formed only by the verbs with the highest token frequency, the model has thus been able to acquire robust syntactic constraints for SOI.",
        "Once these constraints have been applied to unseen events, the model has achieved a performance comparable to the one of the general models in §.5.",
        "This is somehow even more significant if we consider that the training set was now formed by less than one-third of the pairs on which the models in §.5 were trained.",
        "Data quantity aside, the most relevant fact is that it is the way verb frequencies are distributed to determine the learning path, with a significant positive effect produced by high token frequency verbs.",
        "In the model trained on SF, feature ranking is also governed by markedness relations, and the relative prominence of the various constraints is utterly similar to the one discussed in §.5.",
        "In other terms, the results of this experiment prove that frequent verbs are actually able to act as “catalysts” of the syntactic acquis ition process.",
        "It is possible for children to converge on the correct generalizations governing SOI in Italian, just by relying on the linguistic evidence provided by the most frequent verbs.",
        "This view suggests a way out of the apparent paradox of the “pathbreaking” hypothesis: highly frequent verbs can be assumed to provide stable and consistent multiple probabilistic cues for the assignment of subject/object relations.",
        "The existence of positional patterns that occur with high token frequency may well provide a deeply entrenched and highly salient set of distributional cues that act as probabilistic constraints on constructional generalizations.",
        "We hypothesize that similar constructions of other less frequent verbs",
        "are processed, for lack of more specific overriding information, in the light of these constraints.",
        "Since processing is the result of a “conspiracy” of distributed constraints, “pathbreaking” prototypes need not be real construction exemplars but highly schematic patterns.",
        "We proved that highly frequent local positional patterns offer the right sort of constraint conspiracy."

      "text": [
        "It appears that the distributional evidence of high frequency light verbs may well provide a solid cognitive anchor for sweeping perceptual generalizations on the syntax-semantics mapping.",
        "These generalizations are local, in that they involve positional NV and VN pairs only, and are perceptual as they address the issue of identifying appropriate syntactic relations by relying on perceptual features of linguistic contexts, such as position, animacy, etc.",
        "On the basis of these findings, one can reasonably argue that complex lexical constructions (in the sense of Goldberg 1998) are built upon these local patterns, by combining them in those contexts where the presence of a particular verb licenses such a combination.",
        "The two feature configurations discussed in §.5 (i.e. NLC and LC) can thus be viewed as two successive steps along the path that leads towards the emergence of complex, lexically-driven constructions.",
        "This can actually be modeled as the incremental process of adding more and more lexical constraints to early lexicon-free generalizations (based on word order, animacy, definiteness etc.).",
        "As a result of such additional constraints, the presence of an intransitive verb may completely rule out the object interpretation of a VN pattern, flying in the face of a general bias towards viewing VN as a transitive pattern.",
        "This picture is compatible with the well-known observation that constructions are used rather conservatively by children at early stages of language maturation (Tomasello 2000).",
        "In fact, if early generalizations are mainly perceptual and local, we do not expect them to be used in production, at least until the child reaches a stage where they are combined into bigger lexically-driven constructions.",
        "ME has proven to be a sound computational learning framework to simulate the interplay of complex probabilistic constraints in language.",
        "Our experiments confirm linguistic generalizations and psycholinguistic data for subjects and objects in Italian, while raising new interesting issues at the same time.",
        "This is the case of the role of definiteness in SOI.",
        "In fact, the model features neatly reproduce the definiteness markedness hierarchy, but definiteness does not appear to be really influential for subject and object processing.",
        "Various hypotheses are compatible with such results, including that definiteness is not a cue on which speakers rely for SOI in Italian.",
        "Another more interesting possibility is that definiteness constraints may indeed play a decisive role when the learner is asked to assign subject and object relations in the context of a more complex construction than a simple NV pair.",
        "Suppose that both nouns of a noun-noun-verb triple are amenable to a subject interpretation, but that one of them is a more likely subject than the other due to its being part of a definite noun phrase.",
        "Then, it is reasonable to expect that the model would select the definite noun phrase as the subject in the triple and opt for an object interpretation of the other candidate noun phrase.",
        "As part of our future work, we plan to train the ME model on a more realistic corpus of parental input to Italian children, available in the CHILDES database (MacWhinney, 2000: http://childes.psy.",
        "cmu.edu/data/Romance/Italian).",
        "In fact, there is converging evidence that the use of particular constructions in parental speech is largely dominated by the use of each construction with one specific, highly frequent verb (e.g. go for the intransitive construction).",
        "The same trends noted in mother’s speech to children are mirrored in children’s early speech (Goldberg et al., 2004).",
        "Quochi (in preparation) reports a similar distributional pattern for the caused motion and intransitive motion verbs in two Italian CHILDES corpora (named “Italian-Antelmi” and “Italian-Calambrone”).",
        "If these findings are confirmed, the high accuracy of our ME model trained on the skewed frequency corpus (SF) allows us to expect an equally high accuracy when training the model on evidence from Italian parental speech.",
        "This brings us to another related point: lack of correction/supervision in parental input.",
        "Since our ME model heavily relies on previously classified noun-verb pairs, we can legitimately wonder how easily it can be extended to simulate child language learning in an unsupervised mode.",
        "In fact, it should be appreciated that, in our experiments, compar-tively little rests on supervised classification.",
        "Iden",
        "tification of the contextually-relevant subject is, for lack of explicit morphosyntactic clues such as agreement and diathesis, simply a matter of guessing the more likely agent of the action expressed by the verb on the basis of semantic and pragmatic features such as animacy, definiteness and noun position to the verb.",
        "Mutatis mutandis, the same holds for object identification.",
        "It is then highly likely that salient evidence for the correct subject/object classification comes to the child from direct observation of the situation described by a sentence.",
        "It is such systematic coupling of linguistic evidence from the sentence with perceptual evidence of the situation described by the sentence that can assist the child in developing interface notions such as subject, object and the like."
