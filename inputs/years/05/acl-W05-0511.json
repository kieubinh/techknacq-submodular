        "The present Machine Learning Paradigm Much of computational linguistics has converged onto a machine learning paradigm that provides us soothing clarity.",
        "The machine learning approach defines a problem as a mapping problem – map some acoustic stream onto a list of word tokens, map a list of word tokens onto a parse tree, map a parse tree onto a set of semantic roles or “logical form”, map each word in a tree onto its best sense, and so on.",
        "We then develop a learning algorithm to accomplish the desired mapping.",
        "Multiple groups describe how well their algorithm maps various test sets given various training sets, and describe a “result” to improve upon.",
        "The clarity provided by this paradigm is so soothing, one gets the sense we can turn a crank, and indeed, in many cases, progress has been made proceeding precisely along these lines.",
        "Turning the crank on deep lexical acquisition, however, we might feel something is missing.",
        "What is it?",
        "Underlying any model of deep lexical acquisition is a theory of the human conceptual apparatus.",
        "Unlike our handle on acoustic streams, word lists, and parse trees, our handle on a suitable “output” for the space of word meanings is remarkably poor.",
        "Somehow, via experience (of some kind or another), children acquire a mapping from a space of vocabulary items to a space of lexicalizable concepts – the lexicon; our task as modelers is to figure out how this mapping can occur.",
        "Many models for the space of lexicalizable concepts exist: concepts are points in Rn, concepts are Jackendoff’s lexical conceptual structures, concepts are FrameNet’s frame elements, concepts are Schankian script activators, concepts are distributions over syntactic frames, concepts are grounded in sensorimotor statistics, or all of the above.",
        "Almost everyone nowadays reports how their algorithm accomplished some mapping to one or more of these models of concepts.",
        "They have to, because today’s de facto idea of what constitutes a “result” according the machine learning paradigm today is to do exactly this.",
        "The Golden Oldies formed our concept models Our models of conceptual spaces did not originate from computational linguists following the machine learning paradigm.",
        "They were proposed from linguists, psychologists and philosophers back in earlier eras - what we will call Golden Oldies – when the idea of a “result” was somewhat different.",
        "There are too many to recall: Quine (1960) argued that the linguist watching the natives uttering Gavagai!",
        "in the context of a rabbit would nec",
        "essarily require far more constraints than met the eye.",
        "Brown (1957) showed that children used syntactic cues to disambiguate between possible meanings; Landau and Gleitman (1985) followed on these insights, showing just how deep it could be, that even blind children could learn look and see, basing their mapping on syntactic constraints.",
        "Chomsky’s (1965) notion of “deep structure” – proposed to account for commonplace syntactic phenomena – motivated many insights explored in Gruber (1965)’s thesis, Fillmore (1968)’s classical thematic roles, and Jackendoff (1983)’s Lexical conceptual structures.",
        "Hale and Keyser and many linguists labored under the MIT Lexicon project in the 1980s to determine the fundamental features of the lexicon; many of these hard-earned observations appear in Levin (1993).",
        "Schank (1972)’s Conceptual dependency theory, Minsky (1975)’s Frames were proposed for the broader goals of capturing commonsense knowledge.",
        "Quillian’s (1968) and Miller et al. (1990)’s WordNet were not intended for models of lexical acquisition or databases to be used in computational linguistics but as models of human semantic memory.",
        "Many other Golden Oldies exist, and our debt to them is quite large.",
        "Ask what motivates our collection of subcategorization statistics or what drives the quest for semantic roles, and the roots are found in the science questions of the Golden Oldies.",
        "The present Myopic Learning Paradigm It would have been extremely myopic to take any one of these classical results and accuse their authors of not demonstrating a learning algorithm, not evaluating them on large corpora, and not getting together in workshops to share the results on test sets.",
        "The standard for what constituted a result back then consisted of none of these things, because today’s machine learning paradigm was just not present then.",
        "The questions were:",
        "• Question (1): What is a lexicalizable concept?",
        "• Question (2): How can a word-concept mapping be learned from evidence?",
        "But for reasons that no one really talks about, somehow, the standard of what constitutes a result changed from some balance of Question (1) and (2) to a machine learning paradigm essentially focused on Question (2).",
        "The dependency between Question (1) and (2) is quite well-understood, but do we have an adequate answer to (1)?",
        "We tell ourselves: We’ve gotta build betterparsers, speech recognizers, search engines, machine translation systems, so... let’s take shortcuts on Question (1) so as to make progress on Question (2).",
        "For many, that shortcut consists of semantic role labels and learning from frame distributions.",
        "These shortcuts don’t answer Question (1), unfortunately."

        "On this view, word meanings are couched in changing naive theories of how the world works.",

        "Developmental psychology has not been explicit about the precise form of T*, nor have they characterized how T* relates to lexicalizable concepts.",

        "Adults (T3) judge that the raccoon-looking figure in both conditions is still a skunk.",
        "Apparently, preschoolers’ theory T1",
        "lacks the belief that an animal’s kind is determined at birth, but this becomes part of the adult’s T3.",
        "Similarly, preschool children at T1 have concept of death involving a belief in a continued existence in an alternate location (like sleep); When asked whether dead people dream, eat, defecate, and move, 4 to 6 year olds will say that dead people do all of these, except move (Slaughter et al., 2001).",
        "Missing in T1 are the causes of death (a total breakdown of bodily functions) and that death is an irreversible, inevitable end.",
        "Between 4 and 6, children become superficially aware of the general function of various body parts (e.g “You need a heart to live”).",
        "Other phenomena serve the same point: the child at T1 thinks uncle means friendly middle-aged man, and at T2 thinks it means parent’s brother.",
        "The child at T1 thinks island means a beachy territory and at T2 thinks it means body of land surrounded by water (Keil 1989).",
        "And, “theory of mind” concepts/words such as belief, desire, wonder, pretend (Wellman and Bartsch 1995, Leslie 2000) are similarly situated.",
        "How “theory-like” T1 and T2 are is subject to considerable debate (diSessa 1993, Leslie 2000).",
        "disessa (1993) describes a large number of causal “p-prims” that are highly context specific and considerably larger in number than what Carey (1985) describes; these are shown to apply to everyday physical phenomena – “force as mover”, “vaccu-ums impel”, “overcoming”, “springiness”, “bigger means lower pitch (or slower)”, to name a few.",
        "Each of these have a FrameNet-like causal syntax, of some unknown mapping to vocabulary items.",
        "Similarly, Rozenblit and Keil (2003) show that non-expert adults have a remarkably superficial notion of how common mechanisms work – such as how a helicopter changes from hovering to forward flight.",

        "Very limited instances of a theory-based lexicon can be constructed already for subjects at the end of the experiment – such a theory-based lexicon has (1) T2 in the UT metalanguage; (2) the mapping in L to G(T2): gorp = AB, pilk = C', seb = D. This constructive theory-based lexicon would be in stark contrast to differential lexicons such as WordNet and FrameNet.",
        "Grounding language in perception is insufficient Many have proposed deep lexical acquisition by “grounding language in perception” (Siskind 1996, Regier 1996, Roy and Pentland 2002, Yu and Ballard 2004), constructing systems that can learn to utter, e.g. red, banana, hit and triangle in contexts where there are, e.g., three triangles hitting red bananas.",
        "Such systems also propose a space of possible concepts exhausted by a fixed set of primitives, as in the Golden Oldies model.",
        "The initial state of the TAD (T* (t = 0)) can explicitly incorporate all these attributes and relations (contact, luminance, ...); but then, the TAD can further change state to yield new kinds, attributes, relations, and causal mechanisms not present in the initial state, but motivated by the data (see Gopnik and Meltzoff 1997).",
        "As such, vague appeal to grounding is insufficient; associative processes that may work on red, hit, banana, eye, three are extremely challenging to generalize to color, kind, wonder, pilk, seb, telescope, maybe and uninvented groobles that cannot be perceived.",

        "But specifying the telic role of beer and movie to be drink and watch does not constitute an adequate theory – we require constraints that relate to the state space of the human conceptual apparatus.",
        "Pustejovsky (1995)’s telic, formal, constitutive, agentive roles may be mapped onto T*’s characterization of artifacts, materials, and so on.",

        "Falkenhainer et al. 1989, Bailey et al. 1997) and conceptual blending (Faucon-nier and Turner 1998).",
        "These processes may motivate TAD state changes.",
        "In most cases, the the underlying predicates in the source and target domains are ad hocly constructed; a natural source of these predicates may be the sets internal to T* (kinds, attributes, relations, causal mechanisms); similarity between domains may be determined by the structural properties of the UT metalanguage and G. If T* incorporates the common causal mechanisms behind ideas and light transmission, for example, then one may strive for a shorter lexicon where the vocabulary item illuminate happens to be used in both domains with “one” core entry.",
