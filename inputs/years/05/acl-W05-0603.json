        "In order to make these semantic distinctions accurately, it can be useful to begin with the correct grouping of terms, since choosing a particular syntactic structure limits the options left for semantics.",
        "Although equivalent at the part of speech (POS) level, these two noun compounds have different syntactic trees.",
        "The distinction can be represented as a binary tree or, equivalently, as a binary bracketing:",
        "In this paper, we describe a highly accurate unsupervised method for making bracketing decisions for noun compounds (NCs).",
        "We improve on the current standard approach of using bigram estimates to compute adjacency and dependency scores by introducing the use of the x2 measure for this problem.",
        "We also introduce a new set of surface features for querying Web search engines which prove highly effective.",
        "Finally, we experiment with paraphrases for improving prediction statistics.",
        "We have evaluated the application of combinations of these features to predict NC bracketing on two distinct collections, one consisting of terms drawn from encyclopedia text, and another drawn from bioscience text.",

        "Overall, the surface features were very good at predicting left bracketing, but unreliable for right-bracketed examples.",

        "Future work will include testing on NCs consisting of more than 3 nouns, recognizing the ambiguous cases, and bracketing NPs that include determiners and modifiers.",
        "We plan to test this approach on other important NLP problems.",
        "As mentioned above, NC bracketing should be helpful for semantic interpretation.",
        "Another possible application is the refinement of parser output.",
        "Currently, NPs in the Penn TreeBank are flat, without internal structure.",
        "Absent any other information, probabilistic parsers typically assume right bracketing, which is incorrect about 2/3rds of the time for 3-noun NCs.",
        "It may be useful to augment the Penn TreeBank with dependencies inside the currently flat NPs, which may improve their performance overall.",
