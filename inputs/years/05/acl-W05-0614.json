        "As information technologies move off of our desktops and into the world, the need for Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems that exploit information about the environment becomes increasingly apparent.",
        "Whether in physical environments (for cars and cell phones) or in virtual ones (for videogames and training simulators), applications are beginning to demand language interfaces that can understand unconstrained speech about constrained domains.",
        "Unlike most text-based NLP research, which focuses on open-domain problems, work we refer to as situated NLP focuses on improving language processing by exploiting domain-specific information about the non-linguistic situational context of users’ interactions.",
        "For applications where agents interact in shared environments, such information is critical for successful communication.",
        "Previous work in situated NLP has focused on methods for grounding the meaning of words in physical and virtual environments.",
        "The motivation for this work comes from the inability of text-based NLP technologies to offer viable models of semantics for human computer interaction in shared environments.",
        "For example, imagine a situation in which a human user is interacting with a robotic arm around a table of different colored objects.",
        "If the human were to issue the command “give me the blue one,” both the manually-coded (Lenat, 1995; Fellbaum, 1998) and statistical models (Manning and Schütze, 2000) of meaning employed in text-based NLP are inadequate; for, in both models, the meaning of a word is based only on its relations to other words.",
        "However, in order for the robot to successfully “give me the blue one,” it must be able to link the meaning of the words in the utterance to its perception of the environment (Roy, Hsiao, & Mavridis, 2004).",
        "Thus, recent work on grounding meaning has focused on how words and utterances map onto physical descriptions of the environment: either in the form of perceptual representations (Roy, in press, Siskind, 2001, Regier, 1996) or control schemas (Bailey, 1997 Narayanan, 1999).1 While such physical descriptions are useful representations for some classes of words (e.g., colors, shapes, physical movements), they are insufficient for more abstract language, such as that which denotes intentional action.",
        "This insufficiency stems from the fact that intentional actions (i.e. actions performed with the purpose of achieving a goal) are highly ambiguous when described only in terms of their physically observable characteristics.",
        "For example, imagine a situation in which one person moves a cup towards another person and utters the unknown word",
        "“blicket.” Now, based only on the physical description of this action, one might come to think of “blicket” as meaning anything from “give cup”, to “offer drink”, to “ask for change.” This ambiguity stems from the lack of contextual information that strictly perceptual descriptions of action provide.",
        "This research presents a methodology for modeling the intentional context of utterances and describes how such representations can be used in a language learning task.",
        "We decompose language learning into two phases: intention recognition and linguistic mapping.",
        "In the first phase, we model intentional action using a probabilistic context free grammar.",
        "We use this model to parse sequences of observed physical actions, thereby inferring a hierarchical tree representation of a user’s intentions.",
        "In the second phase, we use a noisy channel model to learn a mapping between utterances and nodes in that tree representation.",
        "We present pilot situated language acquisition experiments using a dataset of paired spontaneous speech and action collected from human subjects interacting in a shared virtual environment.",
        "We evaluate the acquired model on a situated language understanding task."

        "The ability to infer the purpose of others’ actions has been proposed in the psychological literature as essential for language learning in children (Tommasello, 2003, Regier, 2003).",
        "In order to understand how such intention recognition might be modeled in a computational framework, it is useful to specify the types of ambiguities that make intentional actions difficult to model.",
        "Using as an example the situation involving the cup described above, we propose that this interaction demonstrates two distinct types of ambiguity.",
        "The first type, which we refer to as a vertical ambiguity describes the ambiguity between the “move cup” vs. “offer drink” meanings of “blicket.” Here the ambiguity is based on the level of description that the speaker intended to convey.",
        "Thus, while both meanings are correct (i.e., both meanings accurately describe the action), only one corresponds to the word “blicket.” The second type of ambiguity, referred to as horizontal ambiguity describes the ambiguity between the “offer drink” vs. “ask for change” interpretations of “blicket.” Here there is an ambiguity based on what actually is the intention behind the physical action.",
        "Thus, it is the case that only one of these meaning corresponds to “blicket” and the other meaning is not an accurate description of the intended action.",
        "Figure 1 shows a graphical representation of these ambiguities.",
        "Here the leaf nodes represent a basic physical description of the action, while the root nodes represent the highest-level actions for which the leaf actions were performed2.",
        "Such a tree representation is useful in that it shows both the horizontal ambiguity that exists between the nodes labeled “ask for change” and “offer drink,” as well as the vertical ambiguity that exits between the nodes labeled “offer drink” and “move cup.”",
        "In order to exploit the intuitive value of such a tree representation, we model intention recognition using probabilistic context free grammars (PCFG)3.",
        "We develop a small set of production rules in which the left hand side represents a higher order intentional action (e.g., “offer drink”), and the right hand side represents a sequence of lower level actions that accomplish it (e.g. “grasp cup”, “move cup”, “release cup”).",
        "Each individual action (i.e. letter in the alphabet of the PCFG) is further modeled as a simple semantic frame that contains roles for an agent, an object, an action, and multiple optional modifier roles (see inset figure 1).",
        "While in this initial work productions are created by hand (a task made feasible by the",
        "constrained nature of situated domains) learning such rules automatically is discussed in section 4.2.",
        "Just as in the plan recognition work of Pynadath, (1999), we cast the problem of intention recognition as a probabilistic parsing problem in which sequences of physical actions are used to infer an abstract tree representation.",
        "Resolving horizontal ambiguities thus becomes equivalent to determining which parse tree is most likely given a sequence of events.",
        "Further, resolving vertical ambiguities corresponds to determining which level node in the inferred tree is the correct level of description that the speaker had in mind."

        "To model this mapping procedure, we employ a noisy channel model in which the probability of inferring the correct meaning given an utterance is approximated by the (channel) probability of generating that utterance given that meaning, times the (source) prior probability of the meaning itself (see Equation 1).",

        "As expected, the understanding performance goes down for both frames and roles when the correct utterance-to-level alignment is unknown.",
        "Interestingly, while the frame performance declines by 14.3%, the performance on roles only declines 6.4%.",
        "This difference is due primarily to the fact that, while the mapping from words to action role fillers is hindered by the need to examine all alignments, the mapping from words to object role fillers remains relatively robust.",
        "This is due to the fact that while each level of intention carries a different action term, often the objects described at different levels remain the same.",
        "For example, in figure 4, the action fillers “TAKE”, “MOVE”, “OPEN”, and “PULL” occur only once along the path.",
        "However, the object filler “DOOR” occurs multiple times.",
        "Thus, the chance that the role filler “DOOR” correctly maps to the word “door” is relatively high compared to the role filler “OPEN” mapping to the word “open.”8",
        "Experiment 2: Figure 6 shows the average frame accuracy of the system trained without knowing the correct utterance-to-level alignment, as a function of varying the a values from Equation 1.",
        "The graph shows that including intentional context does improve system performance when it is not given too much weight (i.e., at relatively high alpha values).",
        "This suggests that the benefit of intentional context is somewhat outweighed by the power of the learned role to word mappings.",
        "Looking closer, we find a strong negative correlation (r=-0.81) between the understanding performance using only channel probabilities (a=1) and the improvement obtained by including the intentional context.",
        "In other words, the better one does without context, the less context improves performance.",
        "Thus, we expect that in noisier environments (such as when speech recognition is employed) where channel probabilities are less reliable, employing intentional context will be even more advantageous.",

        "Baselines are calculated by choosing the most frequent frame from training.9",
        "It is clear from the figure that understanding performance is higher when the intentional tree is used in training.",

        "For example, after opening a door, experts often say: “go through the door,” for which the observed action is a simple movement (e.g., “MOVE ROOMx”).",

        "More important than these preliminary results, however, is the general lesson that this work suggests about the importance of knowledge representations for situated language acquisition.",

        "These difficulties cannot be handled by merely increasing the amount of data used, or switching to a more sophisticated learning algorithm.",

        "In parallel investigations, we will explore our method as a cognitive model of human language learning.",
        "Finally, as was mentioned previously, the task model for this domain was hand annotated and, while the constrained nature of the domain simplified this process, further work is required to learn such models jointly with language.",
        "In summary, we have presented first steps toward tackling problems of ambiguity inherent in grounding the semantics of situated language.",
