      "heading": "1 Goals and System Architecture",
      "text": [
        "The goal of our work is twofold.",
        "On the one hand, we want to test whether it is possible to implement a competitive SRL system by reducing the task to a sequential tagging.",
        "On the other hand, we want to investigate the effect of replacing partial parsing information by full parsing.",
        "For that, we built two different individual systems with a shared sequential strategy but using UPC chunks-clauses, and Char-niak’s parses, respectively.",
        "We will refer to those systems as PPUPC and FPCHA, hereinafter.",
        "Both partial and full parsing annotations provided as input information are of hierarchical nature.",
        "Our system navigates through these syntactic structures in order to select a subset of constituents organized sequentially (i.e., non embedding).",
        "Propositions are treated independently, that is, each target verb generates a sequence of tokens to be annotated.",
        "We call this preprocessing step sequentialization.",
        "The sequential tokens are selected by exploring the sentence spans or regions defined by the clause boundaries1.",
        "The topmost syntactic constituents falling inside these regions are selected as tokens.",
        "Note that this strategy is independent of the input syntactic annotation explored, provided it contains clause boundaries.",
        "It happens that, in the case of full parses, this node selection strategy is equivalent to the pruning process defined by Xue and Palmer (2004), which selects sibling nodes along the path of ancestors from the verb predicate to the root of the tree 2.",
        "Due to this pruning stage, the upper-bound recall figures are 95.67% for PPUPC and 90.32% for FPCHA.",
        "These values give F1 performance upper bounds of 97.79 and 94.91, respectively, assuming perfect predictors (100% precision).",
        "The nodes selected are labeled with B-I-O tags depending if they are at the beginning, inside, or outside of a verb argument.",
        "There is a total of 37 argument types, which amount to 37*2+1=75 labels.",
        "Regarding the learning algorithm, we used generalized AdaBoost with real-valued weak classifiers, which constructs an ensemble of decision trees of fixed depth (Schapire and Singer, 1999).",
        "We considered a one-vs-all decomposition into binary prob",
        "lems to address multi-class classification.",
        "AdaBoost binary classifiers are used for labeling test sequences in a left-to-right tagging scheme using a recurrent sliding window approach with information about the tag assigned to the preceding token.",
        "This tagging module ensures some basic constraints, e.g., BIO correct structure, arguments do not cross clause boundaries nor base chunk boundaries, A0-A5 arguments not present in PropBank frames for a certain verb are not allowed, etc.",
        "We also tried beam search on top of the classifiers’ predictions to find the sequence of labels with highest sentence-level probability (as a summation of individual predictions).",
        "But the results did not improve the basic greedy tagging.",
        "Regarding feature representation, we used all input information sources, with the exception of verb senses and Collins’ parser.",
        "We did not contribute with significantly original features.",
        "Instead, we borrowed most of them from the existing literature (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Carreras et al., 2004; Xue and Palmer, 2004).",
        "Broadly speaking, we considered features belonging to four categories 3:",
        "(1) On the verb predicate: • Form; Lemma; POS tag; Chunk type and Type of verb phrase in which verb is included: single-word or multi-word; Verb voice: active, passive, copulative, infinitive, or progressive; Binary flag indicating if the verb is a start/end of a clause.",
        "• Subcategorization, i.e., the phrase structure rule expanding the verb parent node.",
        "(2) On the focus constituent: • Type; Head: extracted using common headword rules; if the first element is a PP chunk, then the head of the first NP is extracted; • First and last words and POS tags of the constituent.",
        "• POS sequence: if it is less than 5 tags long; 2/3/4-grams of the POS sequence.",
        "• Bag-of-words of nouns, adjectives, and adverbs in the constituent.",
        "• TOP sequence: sequence of types of the topmost syntactic elements in the constituent (if it is less than 5 elements long); in the case of full parsing this corresponds to the right-hand side of the rule expanding the constituent node; 2/3/4-grams of the TOP sequence.",
        "• Governing category as described in (Gildea and Juraf-sky, 2002).",
        "3Features extracted from partial parsing and Named Entities are common to PPUPC and FPCHA models, while features coming from Charniak parse trees are implemented exclusively in the FPCHA model.",
        "• NamedEnt, indicating if the constituent embeds or strictly-matches a named entity along with its type.",
        "• TMP, indicating if the constituent embeds or strictly matches a temporal keyword (extracted from AM-TMP arguments of the training set).",
        "(3) Context of the focus constituent: • Previous and following words and POS tags ofthe constituent.",
        "• The same features characterizing focus constituents are extracted for the two previous and following tokens, provided they are inside the clause boundaries of the codified region.",
        "(4) Relation between predicate and constituent: • Relative position; Distance in words and chunks; Level of embedding with respect to the constituent: in number of clauses.",
        "• Constituent path as described in (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002); All 3/4/5-grams of path constituents beginning at the verb predicate or ending at the constituent.",
        "• Partial parsing path as described in (Carreras et al., 2004); All 3/4/5-grams of path elements beginning at the verb predicate or ending at the constituent.",
        "• Syntactic frame as described by Xue and Palmer (2004)"

      "text": [
        "We trained the classification models using the complete training set (sections from 02 to 21).",
        "Once converted into one sequence per target predicate, the resulting set amounts 1,049,049 training examples in the PPUPC model and 828,811 training examples in the FPCHA model.",
        "The average number of labels per argument is 2.071 and 1.068, respectively.",
        "This fact makes “I” labels very rare in the FPCHA model.",
        "When running AdaBoost, we selected as weak rules decision trees of fixed depth 4 (i.e., each branch may represent a conjunction of at most 4 basic features) and trained a classification model per label for up to 2,000 rounds.",
        "We applied some simplifications to keep training times and memory requirements inside admissible bounds.",
        "First, we discarded all the argument labels that occur very infrequently and trained only the 41 most frequent labels in the case of PPUPC and the 35 most frequent in the case of FPCHA.",
        "The remaining labels where joined in a new label “other” in training and converted into “O” whenever the SRL system assigns a “other” label during testing.",
        "Second, we performed a simple frequency filtering by discarding those features occurring less than 15 times in the training set.",
        "As an",
        "exception, the frequency threshold for the features referring to the verb predicate was set to 3.",
        "The final number of features we worked with is 105,175 in the case of PPUPC and 80,742 in the case of FPCHA.",
        "Training with these very large data and feature sets becomes an issue.",
        "Fortunately, we could split the computation among six machines in a Linux cluster.",
        "Using our current implementation combining Perl and C++ we could train the complete models in about 2 days using memory requirements between 1.5GB and 2GB.",
        "Testing with the ensembles of 2,000 decision trees per label is also not very efficient, though the resulting speed is admissible, e.g., the development set is tagged in about 30 minutes using a standard PC.",
        "The overall results obtained by our individual PPUPC and FPCHA SRL systems are presented in table 1, with the best results in boldface.",
        "As expected, the FPCHA system significantly outperformed the PPUPC system, though the results of the later can be considered competitive.",
        "This fact is against the belief, expressed as one of the conclusions of the CoNLL-2004 shared task, that full-parsing systems are about 10 F1 points over partial-parsing systems.",
        "In this case, we obtain a performance difference of 2.18 points in favor of FPCHA.",
        "Apart from resulting performance, there are additional advantages when using the FPCHA approach.",
        "Due to the coarser granularity of sequence tokens, FPCHA sequences are shorter.",
        "There are 21% less training examples and a much lower quantity of “I” tags to predict (the mapping between syntactic constituents and arguments is mostly one-to-one).",
        "As a consequence, FPCHA classifiers train faster with less memory requirements, and achieve competitive results (near the optimal) with much less rounds of boosting.",
        "See figure 1.",
        "Also related to the token granularity, the number of completely correct outputs is 4.13 points higher in FPCHA, showing that the resulting labelings are structurally better than those of PPUPC.",
        "Interestingly, the PPUPC and FPCHA systems make quite different argument predictions.",
        "For instance, FPCHA is better at recognizing A0 and A1 arguments since parse constituents corresponding to these arguments tend to be mostly correct.",
        "Comparatively, PPUPC is better at recognizing A2-A4 arguments since they are further from the verb predicate",
        "and tend to accumulate more parsing errors, while the fine granularity of the PPUPC sequences still allow to capture them4.",
        "Another interesting observation is that the precision of both systems is much higher than the recall.",
        "The previous two facts suggest that combining the outputs of the two systems may lead to a significant improvement.",
        "We experimented with a greedy combination scheme for joining the maximum number of arguments from both solutions in order to increase coverage and, hopefully, recall.",
        "It proceeds departing from an empty solution by: First, adding all the arguments from FPCHA in which this method performs best; Second, adding all the arguments from PPUPC in which this method performs best; and Third, making another loop through the two methods adding the arguments not considered in the first loop.",
        "At each step, we require that the added arguments do not overlap/embed with arguments in the current solution and also that they do not introduce repetitions of A0-A5 arguments.",
        "The results on the",
        "well to corpora with other genres.",
        "The study of the sources of this lower performance deserves further investigation, though we do not believe that it is attributable to the greedy combination scheme.",
        "Table 2: Overall results (top) and detailed results on the WSJ test (bottom).",
        "development set (presented in table 1) confirm our expectations, since a performance increase of 1.18 points over the best individual system was observed, mainly caused by recall improvement.",
        "The final system we presented at the shared task performs exactly this solution merging procedure.",
        "When applied on the WSJ test set, the combination scheme seems to generalize well, since an improvement is observed with respect to the development set.",
        "See the official results of our system, which are presented in table 2.",
        "Also from that table, it is worth noting that the F1 performance drops by more than 9 points when tested on the Brown test set, indicating that the results obtained on the WSJ corpora do not generalize We have presented a simple SRL system submitted to the CoNLL-2005 shared task, which treats the SRL problem as a sequence tagging task (using a BIO tagging scheme).",
        "Given the simplicity of the approach, we believe that the results are very good and competitive compared to the state-of-the-art.",
        "We also provided a comparison between two SRL systems sharing the same architecture, but build on partial vs. full parsing, respectively.",
        "Although the full parsing approach obtains better results and has some implementation advantages, the partial parsing system shows also a quite competitive performance.",
        "The results on the development set differ in 2.18 points, but the outputs generated by the two systems are significantly different.",
        "The final system, which scored F1=76.59 in the official test set, is a combination of both individual systems aiming at increasing coverage and recall.",
