        "Alignment of words and multiword units plays an important role in many natural language processing (NLP) applications, such as example-based machine translation (EBMT) (Somers, 1999) and statistical machine translation (SMT) (Ayan et al., 2004; Och and Ney, 2000), transfer rule learning (Carl, 2001; Menezes and Richardson, 2001), bilingual lexicography (G´omez Guinovart and Sacau Fontenla, 2004), and word sense disambiguation (Gale et al., 1992), among others.",
        "Aligning two (or more) texts means finding correspondences (translation equivalences) between segments (paragraphs, sentences, words, etc.)",
        "of the source text and segments of its translation (the target text).",
        "Following the same idea of many recently proposed approaches on lexical alignment (e.g., Wu and Wang (2004) and Ayan et al.",
        "(2004)), the method described in this paper, LIHLA (Language-Independent Heuristics Lexical Aligner) starts from statistical alignments between single words (defined in bilingual lexicons) and applies language-independent heuristics to them, aiming at finding the best alignments between words or multiword units.",
        "Although the most frequent alignment category is 1 : 1(in which one source word is translated exactly as one target word), other categories such as omissions (1 : 0 or 0 : 1) or those involving multiword units (n : m, with n and/or m > 1) are also possible.",
        "This paper is organized as follows: section 2 explains how LIHLA works; section 3 describes some experiments carried out with LIHLA together with their results and, in section 4, some concluding remarks are presented."

    {
      "heading": "2 How LIHLA works",
      "text": [
        "As the first step, LIHLA uses alignments between single words defined in two bilingual lexicons (source–target and target–source) generated from sentence-aligned parallel texts using NATools.1 Given two sentence-aligned corpus files, the NATools word aligner – based on the Twenty-One system (Hiemstra, 1998) – counts the co-occurrences of words in all aligned sentence pairs and builds a sparse matrix of word-to-word probabilities (Model A) using an iterative expectation-maximization algorithm (5 iterations by default).",
        "Finally, the elements with higher values in the matrix are chosen to compose two probabilistic bilingual lexicons (source–target and target–source) (Sim˜oes and Almeida, 2003).",
        "For each word in the corpus, each",
        "bilingual lexicon gives: the number of occurrences of that word in the corpus (its absolute frequency) and its most likely translations together with their probabilities.",
        "The construction of the bilingual lexicons is an independent prior step for the alignment performed by LIHLA and the same bilingual lexicons can be used several times to align parallel sentences.",
        "So, using the two bilingual lexicons generated by NATools and some language-independent heuristics, LIHLA tries to find the best alignment between source and target tokens (words, numbers, special characters, etc.)",
        "in a pair of parallel sentences.",
        "For each source token sj in source sentence 5, LIHLA will look for the best token ti in the target parallel sentence T applying these heuristics in sequence:"
      ]
    },
    {
      "heading": "1. Exact match",
      "text": [
        "LIHLA creates a 1 : 1 alignment between sj and ti if they are identical.",
        "This heuristic stays for exact matches, for instance, between proper names and numbers.",
        "2.",
        "Best candidate according to the bilingual lexicon",
        "LIHLA looks for possible translations of sj in the source–target bilingual lexicon (BS) and makes an intersection between them and the words in T. In this intersection, if no candidate word identical to those in BS is found, then LIHLA tries to look for cognates for those words using the longest common subsequence ratio (LCSR).2 By doing this, LIHLA can deal with small changes in possible translations such as different forms of the same verb, changes in gender and/or number of nouns, adjectives, and so on.",
        "Then, LIHLA selects the best target candidate word ti for sj – the best candidate word according to BS among those in a position which is favorably situated in relation to sj – and looks for multiword units involving sj and ti – those words that occur immediately before and/or after sj (for source multiword units) or 2 The LCSR of two words is computed by dividing the length of their longest common subsequence by the length of the longer word.",
        "For example, the LCSR of Portuguese word alin-hamento and Spanish word alineamiento is 12 – 0.83 as their longest common subsequence is a-l-i-n-a-m-e-n-t-o.",
        "ti (for target multiword units) and are not possible translations for other words in T and 5, respectively.",
        "According to the multiword units that have (or not) been found, a 1 : 1, 1 : n, m : 1 or m : n alignment is established.",
        "An omission alignment for sj (1 : 0) can also be established if no target candidate word ti that satisfies this heuristic is available.",
        "3.",
        "Cognates",
        "If no possible translation for sj is found in the bilingual lexicon and the target sentence (T) at the same time, LIHLA uses the LCSR to look for cognates for sj in T and sets a 1 : 1 alignment between sj and its best cognate or a 1 : 0 alignment if there is no cognate available.",
        "These heuristics are applied while alignments can still be produced and a maximum number of iterations is not reached (see section 3 for the number of iterations performed in the experiments described in this paper).",
        "Furthermore, at the first iteration, all words with a frequency higher than a set threshold are ignored to avoid erroneous alignments since all subsequent alignments are based on the previous ones.",
        "In its last step (which is optional and has not been performed in the experiments described in this paper), LIHLA aligns the remaining unaligned source and target tokens between two pairs of already aligned tokens establishing several 1 : 1 alignments when there are the same number of source and target tokens, or just one alignment involving all source and target tokens if they exist in different quantities.",
        "The decision of creating n 1 : 1 alignments in spite ofjust one n : n alignment when there is the same number of source and target tokens is due to the fact that a 1 : 1 alignment is more likely to be found than a n : n one."

      "heading": "3 Experiments",
      "text": [
        "In this section we present the experiments carried out with LIHLA for the “Shared task on word alignment” in the Workshop on Building and Using Parallel Texts during ACL2005.",
        "Systems participating in this shared task were provided with training data (consisting of sentence-aligned parallel texts) for three pairs of languages: English–Inuktitut,",
        "Romanian–English and English–Hindi.",
        "Furthermore, the systems would choose to participate in one or both subtasks of “limited resources” (where systems were allowed to use only the resources provided) and ”unlimited resources” (where systems were allowed to use any resources in addition to those provided).",
        "The system described in this paper, LIHLA, participated in the subtask of limited resources aligning English–Inuktitut and Romanian– English test sets.",
        "The training sets – composed of 338,343 English–Inuktitut aligned sentences (omission cases were excluded from the whole set of 340,526 pairs) and 48,478 Romanian–English aligned ones – were used to build the bilingual lexicons.",
        "Then, without changing any default parameter (threshold for LCSR, maximum number of iterations, etc.",
        "), LIHLA aligned the 75 English–Inuktitut and the 203 Romanian–English parallel sentences on test sets.",
        "The whole alignment process (bilingual lexicon generation and alignment itself) did not take more than 17 minutes for English–Inuktitut (3 iterations per sentence, on average) and 7 minutes for Romanian– English (4 iterations per sentence, on average).",
        "The evaluation was run with respect to precision, recall, F-measure, and alignment error rate (AER) considering sure and probable alignments but not NULL ones (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003).",
        "Tables 1 and 2 present metric values for English–Inuktitut and Romanian –English alignments, respectively, as provided by the organization of the shared task.",
        "The results obtained in these experiments were not so good as those achieved by LIHLA on the language pairs for which it was developed, that is, 92.48% of precision and 88.32% of recall on Portuguese–Spanish parallel texts and 84.35% of precision and 76.39% of recall on Portuguese– English ones.",
        "The poor performance in the English–Inuktikut task may be partly due to the fact that Inuktikut is a polysynthetic language, that is, one in which, unlike in English, words are formed by long strings of concatenated morphemes.",
        "This makes it difficult for NATools to build reasonable dictionaries and lead to a predominance of n : 1 alignments, which are harder to determine – this fact can be confirmed by the better precision of LIHLA when probable alignments were considered (see table 1).",
        "The performance in the English–Romanian task, not very far from the English–Portuguese task used to tune up the parameters of the algorithm, is harder to explain without further analysis.",
        "The difference in precision and recall between the two language pairs is due to the fact that on the English–Inuktitut reference corpus in addition to sure alignments the probable ones were also annotated while in Romanian –English only sure alignments are found.",
        "This indicates that evaluating alignment systems is not a simple task since their performance depends not only on the language pairs and the quality of parallel corpora (constant criteria in this shared task) but also the way the reference corpus is built.",
        "So, at this moment, it would be unfair to blame the worse performance of LIHLA on its alignment methodology since it has been applied to the new language pairs without changing any of its default parameters.",
        "Maybe a simple optimization of parameters for each pair of languages could bring better results and also the impact of size and quality of training and reference corpora used in these experiments should be investigated.",
        "Then, the only conclusion that can be taken at this moment is that LIHLA, with its heuristics and/or default parameters, can not be indistinctly applied to any pair of languages.",
        "Despite of its performance, LIHLA has some",
        "advantages when compared to other lexical alignment methods found in the literature, such as: it does not need to be trained for a new pair of languages (as in Och and Ney (2000)) and neither does it require preprocessing steps to handle texts (as in G´omez Guinovart and Sacau Fontenla (2004)).",
        "Furthermore, the whole alignment process (bilingual lexical generation and alignment itself) has proved to be very fast as mentioned previously."
