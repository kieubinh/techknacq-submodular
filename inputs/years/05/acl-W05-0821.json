        "Usually, a standard word trigram model of the form",
        "is used, where e� = e1, ..., el.",
        "Each word is predicted based on a history of two preceding words.",
        "Most work in SMT has concentrated on developing better translation models, decoding algorithms, or minimum error rate training for SMT.",
        "Comparatively little effort has been spent on language modeling for machine translation.",
        "In other fields, particularly in automatic speech recognition (ASR), there exists a large body of work on statistical language modeling, addressing e.g. the use of word classes, language model adaptation, or alternative probability estimation techniques.",
        "The goal of this study was to use some of the language modeling techniques that have proved beneficial for ASR in the past and to investigate whether they transfer to statistical machine translation.",
        "In particular, this includes language models that make use of morphological and part-of-speech information, so-called factored language models."

        "A factored language model (FLM) (Bilmes and Kirchhoff, 2003) is based on a representation of words as feature vectors and can utilize a variety of additional information sources in addition to words, such as part-of-speech (POS) information, morphological information, or semantic features, in a unified and principled framework.",
        "Assuming that each",
        "word w can be decomposed into k features, i.e. w � f 1X, a trigram model can be defined as",
        "Each word is dependent not only on a single stream of temporally preceding words, but also on additional parallel streams of features.",
        "This representation can be used to provide more robust probability estimates when a particular word n-gram has not been observed in the training data but its corresponding feature combinations (e.g. stem or tag trigrams) has been observed.",
        "FLMs are therefore designed to exploit sparse training data more effectively.",
        "However, even when a sufficient amount of training data is available, a language model utilizing morphological and POS information may bias the system towards selecting more fluent translations, by boosting the score of hypotheses with e.g. frequent POS combinations.",
        "In FLMs, word feature information is integrated via a new generalized parallel back-off technique.",
        "In standard Katz-style backoff, the maximum-likelihood estimate of an n-gram with too few observations in the training data is replaced with a probability derived from the lower-order (n − 1)- gram and a backoff weight as follows:",
        "is also possible to choose multiple paths and combine their probability estimates.",
        "This is achieved by replacing the backed-off probability pBO in Equation 2 by a general function g, which can be any non-negative function applied to the counts of the lower-order n-gram.",
        "Several different g functions can be chosen, e.g. the mean, weighted mean, product, minimum or maximum of the smoothed probability distributions over all subsets of conditioning factors.",
        "In addition to different choices for g, different discounting parameters can be selected at different levels in the backoff graph.",
        "One difficulty in training FLMs is the choice of the best combination of conditioning factors, backoff path(s) and smoothing options.",
        "Since the space of different combinations is too large to be searched exhaustively, we use a guided search procedure based on Genetic Algorithms (Duh and Kirchhoff, 2004), which optimizes the FLM structure with respect to the desired criterion.",
        "In ASR, this is usually the perplexity of the language model on a held-out dataset; here, we use the BLEU scores of the oracle 1-best hypotheses on the development set, as described below.",
        "FLMs have previously shown significant improvements in perplexity and word error rate on several ASR tasks (e.g. (Vergyri et al., 2004)).",
        "erwise where c is the count of (wt, wt-1, wt-2), pML denotes the maximum-likelihood estimate, T is a count threshold, dc is a discounting factor and a(wt-1, wt-2) is a normalization factor.",
        "During standard backoff, the most distant conditioning variable (in this case wt-2) is dropped first, followed by the second most distant variable etc., until the unigram is reached.",
        "This can be visualized as a backoff path (Figure 1(a)).",
        "If additional conditioning variables are used which do not form a temporal sequence, it is not immediately obvious in which order they should be eliminated.",
        "In this case, several backoff paths are possible, which can be summarized in a backoff graph (Figure 1(b)).",
        "Paths in this graph can be chosen in advance based on linguistic knowledge, or at runtime based on statistical criteria such as counts in the training set.",

        "was that provided on the ACL05 Shared MT task website for 4 different language pairs (translation from Finnish, Spanish, French into English); no additional data was used.",
        "Preprocessing consisted of lowercasing the data and filtering out sentences with a length ratio greater than 9.",
        "The total number of training sentences and words per language pair ranged between 11.3M words (Finnish-English) and 15.7M words (Spanish-English).",

        "The 4-gram model uses modified KneserNey smoothing and interpolation of higher-order and lower-order n-gram probabilities.",
        "The potential advantage of this model is that it models n-grams up to length 4; since the BLEU score is a combination of n-gram precision scores up to length 4, the integration of a 4-gram language model might yield better results.",
        "Note that this can only be done in a rescoring framework since the first-pass decoder can only use a trigram language model.",
        "For the factored language models, a feature-based word representation was obtained by tagging the text with Rathnaparki’s maximum-entropy tagger (Rat-naparkhi, 1996) and by stemming words using the Porter stemmer (Porter, 1980).",
        "Thus, the factored language models use two additional features per word.",
        "A word history of up to 2 was considered (3- gram FLMs).",
        "Rather than optimizing the FLMs on the development set references, they were optimized to achieve a low perplexity on the oracle 1-best hypotheses (the hypotheses with the best individual BLEU scores) from the first decoding pass.",
        "This is done to avoid optimizing the model on word combinations that might never be hypothesized by the first-pass decoder, and to bias the model towards achieving a high BLEU score.",
        "Since N-best lists differ for different language pairs, a separate FLM was trained for each language pair.",
        "While both the 4-gram language model and the FLMs achieved a 8-10% reduction in perplexity on the dev set references compared to the baseline language model, their perplexities on the oracle 1-best hypotheses were not significantly different from that of the baseline model."

        "The weights assigned to the second-pass language models during weight optimization were larger than those assigned to the first-pass language model, suggesting that both the word-based model and the FLM provide more useful scores than the baseline language model.",
        "Finally, we observed that the overall improvement represents only a small portion of the possible increase in BLEU score as indicated by the oracle results, suggesting that better language models do not have a significant effect on the overall system performance unless the translation model is improved as well."
