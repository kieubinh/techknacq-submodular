        "Subjectivity plays an important role when removing the unwanted or redundant information for summarising a document.",
        "Human beings tend to disagree on what should be a ‘one good summary’ (Mani, 2001).",
        "This is probably because every individual, whilst arriving at a summary, looks at things from a different perspective.",
        "Guided by various factors such as educational background, profession, personal interests and experience, an individual decides whether a certain aspect is worth being included in a summary.",
        "What might seem relevant to one person could be deemed redundant by another when reading the same story, thus accounting for more than one ‘correct’ summary.",
        "The issue of subjectivity gains prominence as the compression ratio increases, i. e., the shorter the summary, the larger the number of ‘correct’ summaries (Lin and Hovy, 2003b).",
        "This is due to the fact that assimilation of seemingly important contents takes priority while discarding the redundant information.",
        "This is a highly subjective aspect.",
        "Although the subjectivity reflects individual’s thoughts, there will also be some information commonly observed in different summaries of the same story.",
        "Stated otherwise, words in a summary may vary, phrases may vary, and often the grammatical structure may not be the same, but a certain degree of information may be common across summaries.",
        "To what degree is information uniform across different summaries?",
        "How much subjectivity is there?",
        "How do we account for similar information stated using different words, expressions, or grammatical structure when comparing summaries?",
        "How does this help when gauging the informativeness?",
        "Does the subjectivity cause any adverse effects when evaluating summaries?",
        "It is these questions that we aim to address in this paper.",
        "Let us assume that the atomic facts of a summary account for its relevance.",
        "Then, a simple question that elicits any one of these atomic facts represents a benchmark for assessing its informativeness.",
        "We wish to evaluate the quality of a summary in terms of atomic facts commonly observed in-, or subjectively discarded from, assorted human authored short summaries.",
        "In our quest to quantify the subjectivity, we devise a cross comprehension test along the lines of (Hirschmann et al., 1999) for extracting atomic contents.",
        "The comprehension test is modelled on a question-answer style framework.",
        "‘Crossing’ the model turns out to be an effective scheme for measuring the divergence among multiple summaries.",
        "Questions are prepared by the subject who wrote the original summary (Section 3).",
        "Their answers",
        "should be derived by reading the summary alone.",
        "Summary-questionnaire pairs are then swapped in such a way that any summary is paired with questions written by other subjects (Section 4).",
        "The number of questions that cannot be answered by reading the summary accounts for the subjectiveness of the author (Section 5).",
        "Finally, we address how the cross comprehension test can be used for evaluating machine generated summaries (Section 6)."

        "Increasing stability of pyramid scores was observed as the pyramid grew larger.",
        "The authors concluded, however, that the initial creation of the pyramid was a tedious task because a large number of SCUs had to be hand annotated.",
        "In (Van Halteren and Teufel, 2003), the co-occurrence of atomic information elements, called factoids, was examined whilst analysing 50 different summaries of two stories.",
        "A candidate summary was compared with the reference using factoids in order to measure the informativeness.",
        "The authors observed that from a wide selection of factoids only a small number were included in all summaries.",
        "From a pool of factoids, approximately 30% were taken to build a consensus summary that could be used as a ‘gold standard’.",
        "Summary evaluation has been recognised as a sensitive, non-trivial task.",
        "In (Radev and Tam, 2003) the relative utility was calculated based on a significance ranking assigned to each sentence.",
        "A word network based summary evaluation scheme was proposed in (Hori et al., 2003), where the accuracy was weighted by the posterior probability of the manual summaries in the network.",
        "Significantly, they surmised the independence of their criterion from the variations in hand summaries.",
        "A regression analysis was performed in (Hiro-hata et al., 2005) and concluded that objective evaluations were more effective than subjective approaches.",
        "Although their experiments were concerned with presentation speech, the results do have a universal appeal.",
        "Another notable development in the field is the gram co-occurrence matching technique as proposed in (Lin and Hovy, 2003a).",
        "Their tool, ROUGE, compares the number of gram matches between a reference and a machine generated summary.",
        "Recently, ROUGE was piloted for evaluation of summaries from newspaper/newswire articles (Over and Yen, 2004).",
        "ROUGE simulated the manual evaluation well for that task, although it is still unclear how closely it well to other tasks.",
        "To some extent, the work described in this paper is close to that of (Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004) and (Van Halteren and Teufel, 2003).",

        "In this paper, we have presented the issue of human subjectivity when authoring summaries, with regard to producing a simple, robust evaluation of machine generated summaries.",
        "Applying the cross comprehension test on human authored ‘one line’ summaries from broadcast news stories, we gauged the level of subjectivity among four authors.",
        "The instruction set was simple, thus there was enough room for subjectivity.",
        "However the approach was robust because the test did not use the absolute score, instead relying on relative comparison, effectively alleviating the subjectivity.",
        "We also showed the approach to evaluating machine generated summaries.",
        "The experiment using this scheme is currently underway.",

        "When men and women begin to fall in love do they do it differently.",
        "Men tend to fall in love faster.",
