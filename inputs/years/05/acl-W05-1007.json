        "The intuition that semantic analysis can make a positive contribution to language-based applications has motivated the development of a number of lexical-semantic resources.",
        "Prominent among them are WordNet,1 PropBank,2 and FrameNet.",
        "The potential contribution of these resources is constrained by the information they contain and the level of effort involved in their development.",
        "For example, semantic annotation tasks (Baker et al., 2004) typically assign semantic roles to the arguments of predicates.",
        "The benefit of the semantic annotation is constrained by the presence and quality of semantic roles in the lexical-semantic resource(s) used.",
        "Gildea and Jurafsky (2002) suggest that the availability of semantic annotation of this sort is useful for information extraction, word sense disambiguation, machine translation, text summarization, text mining, and speech recognition.",
        "Other tasks rely on the identification of semantic relationships to recognize lexical chains (sets of semantically related words that enable a text to be cohesive) (Morris and Hirst, 1991).",
        "The success of this work is constrained by the set of semantic relationship types and instantiations underlying the recognition of lexical chains.",
        "As Stokes’s dissertation (2004) notes, lexical cohesion has been used in discourse analysis, text segmentation, word sense disambiguation, text summarization, topic detection and tracking, and question answering.",
        "Unfortunately, most lexical-semantic resources, including those previously mentioned, are the product of considerable ongoing human effort.",
        "Given the high development costs associated with these resources, the possibility of enhancing them on the basis of complementary resources that are produced automatically is welcome.",

        "Some SemFrame frames correspond to FrameNet frames.",
        "When SemFrame identifies additional lexical units that evoke the frame, it bolsters the use of semantic frames for identifying lexical chains.",
        "3.",
        "Some SemFrame frames cover semantic space not yet investigated in FrameNet, which, be",
        "cause of the labor-intensive nature of its development, is incomplete.",
        "The identification of new frames thus helps fill in gaps in FrameNet.",
        "4.",
        "In addition to complementing FrameNet, SemFrame could be used as a more systematic source of semantic roles for PropBank or could serve as the basis for adding frame semantic relationships to WordNet.",

        "SemFrame’s output can be used to enhance lexical-semantic resources in various ways.",
        "For example, WordNet has recently incorporated new relationship types, some of which touch on frame semantic relationships.",
        "But frame semantic relationships are as yet only implicit in WordNet; not all morphological derivation relationships, for example, operate within a frame.",
        "Should WordNet choose to reflect frame semantic relationships, SemFrame would provide a useful point of departure, since the verb framesets, frame names, and frame slots are all already expressed as WordNet synsets.",
        "SemFrame can also add to FrameNet.",
        "The extensive human effort that has gone into FrameNet is overwhelmingly evident in the quality of its frame structures (and attendant annotations).",
        "SemFrame is unlikely ever to compete with FrameNet on this score.",
        "However, SemFrame has identified frames not recognized in FrameNet, e.g., Sem-Frame’s SOILING frame.",
        "SemFrame has likewise identified lexical units appropriate to FrameNet frames that have not yet been incorporated into FrameNet, e.g., stick to, stick with, and abide by in the COMPLIANCE / CONFORMITY frame.",
        "These contributions would add as well to the semantic representations in PropBank.",
        "Since identifying frames and their evoking lexical units from scratch requires more effort than assessing the general quality of proposed frames and lexical units – indeed, since there is currently no other systematic way in which to identify either a universal set of semantic frames or the set of lexical items that evoke a frame – SemFrame’s ability to propose new frames and new evoking lexical units constitutes a major contribution to the development of lexical-semantic resources.",
        "SemFrame’s current results might themselves be enhanced by considering data from other parts of speech.",
        "For instance, at present SemFrame bases all its frames on verb framesets, but some FrameNet frames list only adjectives as evoking lexical units.",
        "At the same time, potentially more can be done in associating verb synsets with frames: Only one-third of WordNet’s verb synsets are now included in Sem-Frame’s output.",
        "Some of those not now included evoke none of SemFrame’s current frames, but some do and have not yet been recognized.",
        "Ways of establishing hierarchical and compositional relationships among frames should also be investigated.",
        "The above suggestions for enhancing SemFrame notwithstanding, major progress in improving SemFrame awaits incorporation of corpus data.",
        "Relying on data from lexical resources has contributed to SemFrame’s precision, but the data sparseness bottleneck that SemFrame faces is nonetheless real.",
        "On the basis of the lexical resource data used, verb synsets are related on average to only 5 nouns, many of which closely reflect the participant structure of the corresponding frame.",
        "However, it is not uncommon for specific elements of the participant structure to go unrepresented, and any nouns in the dataset that are not particularly reflective of the participant structure carry far too much weight amidst such a paucity of data.",
        "In contrast, the number of nouns that co-occur with a verb in a corpus may be orders of magnitude greater.",
        "13 But the nouns in a corpus are less likely to reflect closely the participant structure of the corresponding frame; many more nouns are thus likely to be needed.",
        "Furthermore, word sense disambiguation will be required to assign to a frame only those nouns corresponding to an appropriate sense of the verb.14 We are optimistic, however, that the presence of additional corpus data will help fill in frame element gaps arising from the sparseness of lexical resource data and can also be used to help reduce the impact of nouns from lexical resource data that are not representative of a frame’s participant structure.",
        "Coupled with subject-specific resources, the analysis of corpus data may then lead to the development 13 We are investigating two levels of noun-verb co-occurrence.",
        "The first counts co-occurrences of all nouns and verbs appearing within the same paragraph of newswire texts.",
        "The second counts only those nouns related to verbs as their subjects, direct objects, indirect objects, or as objects ofprepo-sitional phrases that modify the verb.",
        "14 We make the simplifying assumption that if a noun occurs with some reasonable percentage of the verbs within a frameset, the desired verb sense is in play.",
        "of subject-specific frame inventories.",
        "Such inventories can in turn inform such knowledge-intensive applications as information retrieval, information extraction, and question answering."
