        "The availability of large-scale syntactically-annotated corpora in general, and the Penn Treebank1(PTB; Marcus et al.,1994) in particular, has enabled the field of stochastic parsing to advance rapidly over the course of the last 10-15 years.",
        "However, the newspaper English which makes up the bulk of the PTB is only one of many distinct genres of writing in the Anglophone world, and certainly not the only domain where potential natural-language processing (NLP) applications exist that would benefit from robust and reliable syntactic analysis.",
        "Due to the massive glut of published literature, the biomedical sciences in general, and molecular biology in particular, constitute one such domain, and indeed much attention has been focused recently on NLP in this area (Shatkay and Feldman, 2003; Cohen and Hunter, 2004).",
        "Unfortunately, annotated corpora of a large enough size to retrain stochastic parsers on do not exist in this domain, and are unlikely to for some time.",
        "This is partially due to the same differences of vocabulary and usage that set biomedical English apart from the Wall Street Journal in the first place; these differences necessitate the input of both biological and linguistic knowledge on biological corpus annotation projects (Kulick et al., 2004), and thus require a wider variety of annotator skills than general-English projects.",
        "For example, 5 (pronounced \"five-prime\") is an adjective in molecular biology, but p53 is a noun; amino acid is an adjective-noun sequence2but cadmium chloride is a pair of nouns.",
        "These tagging decisions would be hard to make correctly without biological background knowledge, as would the prepositional phrase attachment decisions in Figure 1.",
        "Although it is intuitively apparent that there are differences between newspaper English and biomedical English, and that these differences are quantifiable enough for biomedical writing to be characterised as a sublanguage of English (Friedman et al., 2002), the performance of conventionally-trained parsers on data from this domain is to a large extent an open question.",
        "Nonetheless, papers have begun to appear which employ treebank parsers on biomedical text, essentially untested (Xiao et al., 2005).",
        "Recently, however, the GENIA project (Kim et al., 2003) and the Mining the Bibliome project (Kulick et al., 2004) have begun producing small draft corpora of biomedical journal paper abstracts with PTB-style syntactic bracketing, as well as named-entity and part-of-speech (POS) tags.",
        "These are not currently on a scale appropriate for retraining parsers (compare the ~50,000 words in the GENIA Treebank to the -1,000,000 in the PTB; but see also Section 7.2) but can provide a sound basis for empirical performance evaluation and analysis.",
        "A collection of methods for performing such an analysis, along with several interesting results and an investigation into techniques for narrowing the performance gap, is presented here.",
        "We undertook this project with the intention of addressing several questions.",
        "Firstly, in order to deploy existing parsing technologies in a bioin-formatics setting, the biomedical NLP community needs a comprehensive assessment of performance - which parser(s) to choose, what accuracy each should be expected to achieve etc., along with information about the different situations in which each parser can be expected to perform well or poorly.",
        "Secondly, assuming there is a performance deficit, can any simple steps be taken to mitigate it?",
        "Thirdly, what engineering issues arise from the idiosyncracies of biomedical text?",
        "The differences discovered in the behaviour of each parser, either between domains or between different software versions on the same domain, will also be of interest to those in the computational linguistics community who are involved in parser design.",
        "These values will give a comparative index of the flexibility of each parsing model on being presented with out-of-domain data, and may help parser developers to detect signs of overtraining or, analogously, 'over-design' for one narrow genre of English.",
        "It is hoped that our findings can assist those better equipped than ourselves in properly investigating these phenomena, and that our analysis of the problems encountered can shed new light on the thorny problem of parser evaluation.",
        "Finally, several questions arise from the use of multiple parsers on the same corpus that are of both theoretical and practical interest.",
        "Does agreement between several parsers indicate that a sentence has been parsed correctly, or do they tend to make the same mistakes?",
        "How best can the output of an ensemble of parsers be integrated, in order to boost performance above that of the best single member?",
        "And what additional information can be gleaned from comparing the opinions of several parsers that can help make sense of unfamiliar"

      "heading": "2. Evaluation methodologies",
      "text": [
        "We initially chose to rate the parsers in our assessment by several different means which can be grouped into two broad classes: constituent-and lineage-based.",
        "While Sampson and Babarczy(2003) showed that there is a limited degree of correlation between the per-sentence scores assigned by the two methods, they are independent enough that a fuller picture of parser competence can be built up by combining them and thus sidestepping the drawbacks of either approach.",
        "However, overall performance scores designed for competitively evaluating parsers do not provide much insight into the aetiology of errors and anomalies, so we developed a third approach based on production rules that enabled us to mine the megabytes of syntactic data for enlightening results more ef-",
        "Figure 1: These two sentences are biologically clear but syntactically ambiguous.",
        "Only the knowledge that the C-terminal domain is part of a protein, whereas the TATA box and minor groove are parts of DNA, allows a human to interpret them correctly, by attaching the prepositional phrases 1 and 2 at the right level.",
        "fectively.",
        "All the Perl scoring routines we wrote are available from our website.",
        "Most evaluations of parser performance are based upon three primary measures: labelled constituent precision and recall, and number of crossing brackets per sentence.",
        "Calculation of these scores for each sentence is straightforward.",
        "Each constituent in a candidate parse is treated as a tuple (Ibound,LABEL, rbound), where Ibound and rbound are the indices of the first and last words covered by the constituent.",
        "Precision is the proportion of candidate constituents that are correct and is calculated as follows:",
        "p # true positives # true positives + # false positives",
        "Recall is the proportion of constituents from the gold standard that are in the candidate parse:",
        "r # true positives # true positives + # false negatives",
        "The crossing brackets score is reached by counting the number of constituents in the candidate parse that overlap with at least one constituent in the gold standard, in such a way that one is not a subsequence of the other.",
        "Although this scoring system is in wide use, it is not without its drawbacks.",
        "Most obviously, it gives no credit for partial matches, for example when a constituent in one parse covers most of the same words as the other but is truncated or extended at one or both ends.",
        "Indeed, one can imagine situations where a long constituent is truncated at one end and extended at the other compared to the gold standard; this would incur a penalty under each of the above metrics even though some or even most of the words in the constituent were correctly categorised.",
        "One can of course suggest modifications for these measures designed to account for particular situations like these, although not without losing some of their elegance.",
        "The same is true for label mismatches, where a constituent's boundaries are correct but its category is wrong.",
        "More fundamentally, it could be argued that by taking as it were horizontal slices through the syntax tree, these measures lose important information about the ability of a parser to recreate the gross grammatical structure of a sentence.",
        "The height of a given constituent in the tree, and the details of its ancestors and descendants, are not directly taken into account, and it is surely the case that these broader phenomena are at least as important as the extents of individual constituents in affecting meaning.",
        "However, constituent-based measures are not without specific advantages too.",
        "These include the ease with which they can be broken down into scores per label to give an impression of a parser's performance on particular kinds of constituent, and the straightforward message they deliver about whether a badly-performing parser is tending to over-generate (low precision), under-generate (low recall) or mis-generate (high crossing brackets).",
        "In contrast to this horizontal-slice philosophy, Sampson and Babarczy (2003) advocate a vertical view of the syntax tree.",
        "By walking up the tree structure from the immediate parent ofa given word until the top node is reached, and adding each label encountered to the end of a list, a 'lineage' representing the word's ancestry can be retrieved.",
        "Boundary symbols are inserted into this lineage before the highest constituent that begins on the word, and after the highest constituent that ends on the word, if such conditions apply; this allows potential ambiguities to be avoided, so that the tree as a whole has one and only one corresponding set of 'lineage strings' (see Figure 2).",
        "Using dynamic programming, a Levenshtein edit distance can be calculated between each word's lineage strings in the candidate parse and the gold standard, by determining the smallest number of symbol insertions, deletions and substitutions required to transform one ofthe strings into the other.",
        "The leaf-ancestor (LA) metric, a similarity score ranging between 0 (total parse failure) and 1 (exact match), is then calculated by taking into account the lengths of the two lineages:",
        "LA 1 dist (lineage1, lineage2) len(lineage1) + len(lineage2)",
        "The per-word score can then be averaged over a sentence or a whole corpus in order to arrive at an overall performance indicator.",
        "Besides avoiding some of the limitations of constituent-based evaluation discussed above, one major advantage of this approach is that it can provide a word-by-word measure of parser performance, and thus draw attention easily to those regions ofa sentence which have proved problematic (see Section 6.2 for an example).",
        "The algorithm can be made more sensitive to near-matches between phrasal categories by tuning the cost incurred for a substitution between similar labels, e.g. those for 'singular noun' and 'proper noun', rather than adhering to the uniform edit cost dictated by the standard Levenshtein scheme.",
        "In order to avoid overcomplicating this study, however, we chose to keep the standard penalty of 1 for each insertion, deletion or substitution.",
        "One drawback to leaf-ancestor evaluation is that although it scores each word (sentence, corpus) between 0 and 1, and these scores are presented here as percentages for readability, it is misleading to think of them as percentages of correctness in the same way that one would regard constituent precision and recall.",
        "Indeed, the very fact that it results in a single score means that it reveals less at first glance about the broad classes of errors that a parser is making than precision, recall and crossing brackets do.",
        "Another possible objection is that since an error high in the tree will affect many words, the system implicitly gives most weight to the correct determination of those features of a sentence which are furthest from being directly observable.",
        "One might argue, however, that since a high-level attachment error can grossly perturb the structure of the tree and thus the interpretation ofthe sentence, this is a perfectly valid approach; it is certainly complementary to the uniform scoring scheme described in the previous section, where every mistake is weighted identically.",
        "In order to properly characterise the kinds oferrors that occurred in each parse, and to help elucidate the differences between multiple corpora and between each parser's behaviour on each corpus, we developed an additional scoring process based on production rules.",
        "A production rule is a syntactic operation that maps from a parent constituent in a syntax tree to a list of daughter constituents and/or POS tags, of the general form:",
        "LABELp – LABELx...LABELn",
        "For example, the rule that maps from the topmost constituent inFigure 2to its daughters would be S - NP VP.",
        "A production is the application of a production rule at a particular location in the sentence, and can be expressed as:",
        "LABELp(lbound,rbound) – LABEL 1...LABELn",
        "Production precision and recall can be calculated as in a normal labelled constituent-based assessment, except that a proposed production is a true positive if and only if there exists a production in the gold standard with the same parent label and boundaries, and the same daughter labels in the same order.",
        "(The respective widths ofthe daughter constituents, where applicable, are not taken into account, only their labels and order; any errors of width in the daughters are detected when they are tested as parents themselves.)",
        "Furthermore, as an aid to the detection and analysis of systematic errors, we developed a heuristic",
        "I I TCF-1 mRNA",
        "expressed",
        "i RB uniquely",
        "lymphocytes",
        "Figure 2: Skipping the POS tag, the lineage string for uniquely is: [ ADVP ] VP VP S .",
        "The left and right boundary markers record the fact that the ADVP constituent both starts and ends with this word.",
        "for finding the closest-matching candidate productions PRODc1...PRODcm in a parse, in each case where a production PRODg in the gold standard is not exactly matched in the parse.",
        "1.",
        "First, the heuristic looks for productions with correct boundaries and parent labels, but incorrect daughters.",
        "The corresponding production rules are returned.",
        "2.",
        "Failing that, it looks for productions with correct boundaries and daughters, preserving the order of the daughters, but with incorrect parent labels.",
        "The corresponding production rules are returned.",
        "3.",
        "Failing that, it looks for productions with correct boundaries but incorrect parent labels and daughters.",
        "The corresponding production rules are returned.",
        "4.",
        "Failing that, it looks for all extensions and truncations of the production (boundary modifications such that there is at least one word from PRODg still covered) with correct parent and daughter labels and daughter order, keeping only those that are closest in width to PRODg (minimum number of extensions and truncations).",
        "The meta-rules EXT_ALLMATCH and/or TRUNC_ALLMATCH as appropriate are returned.",
        "5.",
        "Failing that, it looks for all extensions and truncations of the production where the parent label is correct but the daughters are incorrect, keeping only those that are closest in width to PRODg.",
        "The meta-rules EXT_PARENTMATCH and/or TRUNC_PARENTMATCH are returned.",
        "6.",
        "If no matches are found in any of these classes, a null result is returned.",
        "Note that in some cases, m production rules of the same class may be returned, for example when the closest matches in the parse are two productions with the correct parent label, one of which is one word longer than PRODg, and one of which is one word shorter.",
        "It is also conceivable that multiple productions with the same parent or same daughters could occupy the same location in the sentence without branching, although it seems unlikely that this would occur apart from in pathologically bad parses.",
        "In any ambiguous cases, no attempt is made to decided which is the 'real' closest match; all m matches are returned, but they are downweighted so that each counts as 1/m of an error when error frequencies are calculated.",
        "In no circumstances are matches from different classes returned.",
        "The design of this procedure reflects our requirements for a tool to facilitate the diagnosis and summarisation of parse errors.",
        "We wanted to be able to answer questions like \"given that parser A has a low recall for NP – NN NN productions, what syntactic structures is it generating in their place?",
        "Why might this be so?",
        "And what effect might these errors have on the interpretation of the sentence?\"",
        "Accordingly, as the heuristic casts the net further and further to find the closest match for a production PRODg, the classes to which it assigns errors become broader and broader.",
        "Any match at stages 1-3 is not simply recorded as a substitution error, but a substitution for a particular incorrect production rule.",
        "However, matches at stages 4 and 5 do not make a distinction between different magnitudes of truncation and extension, and at stage 5 the information about the daughters of incorrect productions is discarded.",
        "This allowed us to identify broad trends in the data even where the correspondences between the gold standard and the parses were weak, yet nonetheless recover detailed substitution information akin to confusion matrices where possible.",
        "Similar principles guided the decision not to consider extensions and truncations with different parent labels as potential loose matches, in order to avoid uninformative matches to productions elsewhere in the syntax tree.",
        "In practice, the matches returned by the heuristic accounted for almost all of the significant systematic errors suffered by the parsers (see Section 6) - null matches were infrequent enough in general that their presence in larger numbers on certain production rules was itself useful from an explanatory point of view.",
        "Several other proposed solutions to the evaluation problem exist, and it is an ongoing and continually challenging field of research.",
        "Suggested protocols based on grammatical or dependency relations (Crouch et al., 2002), head projection (Ringger et al., 2004), alternative edit distance metrics (Roark, 2002) and various other schemes have been suggested.",
        "Many of these alternative methodologies, however, suffer from one or more disadvantages, such as specificity to one particular grammatical formalism (e.g. head-driven phrase structure grammar) or one class of parser (e.g. partial parsers), or a requirement for a specific manually-prepared evaluation corpus in a non-treebank format.",
        "In addition, none of them deliver the richness of information supplied by production-based assessment, particularly in combination with the other methods outlined above."

      "text": [
        "The gold standard data for our experiments was drawn from the GENIA Treebank3, a beta-stage corpus of 200 abstracts drawn randomly from the MEDLINE database4 with the search terms \"human\", \"blood cell\" and \"transcription factor\".",
        "These abstracts have been annotated with POS tags, named entity classes and boundaries5, and syntax trees which broadly follow the conventions of the PTB.",
        "Some manual editing was required to correct annotation errors and remove sentences with uncorrectable errors, leaving 1757 sentences (45406 tokens) in the gold standard.",
        "All errors were reported to the GENIA group.",
        "For comparison purposes, we used the standard set-aside test set from the PTB, section 23.",
        "This consists of 56684 words in 2416 sentences.",
        "To gain insight into the differences between the two corpora, we ran several tests ofthe grammatical composition of each.",
        "For consistency with the parser evaluation results, we stripped the following punctuation tokens from the corpora before gathering these statistics: period, comma, semicolon, colon, and double-quotes (whether they were expressed as a single double-quotes character, or pairs of opening or closing single-quotes).",
        "We also removed any super-syntactic information such as grammatical function suffixes, pruned any tree branches that did not contain textual terminals (e.g. traces), and deleted any duplicated constituents - that is, constituents with only one daughter that has the same label.",
        "Having performed these preprocessing steps, we counted the distributions of sentence lengths (in words) and sentence complexities, using the number of constituents, not counting POS tags, as a simple measure of complexity - although of course one can imagine various other ways to gauge complexity (mean tree depth, maximum tree depth, constituents per word etc.).",
        "The results are shown in Figure 3, and reveal an unexpected level of correlation.",
        "Apart from a few sparse instances at the right-hand tails of the two GENIA distributions, and a single-constituent spike on the PTB complexity distribution (due to one-phrase headings like STOCK REPORT.",
        "), the two corpora have broadly similar distributions of word count and constituent count.",
        "The PTB has slightly more mass on the short end of the length scale, but GENIA does not have a corresponding number of longer sentences.",
        "This ran contrary to our initial intuition that newspaper English would tend to be composed predominantly of shorter and simpler sentences than biological English.",
        "Next, we counted the frequency with which each constituent label appears in each corpus.",
        "The results are shown in Figure 4.",
        "The distributions are reasonably similar between the two corpora, with the most obvious difference being that GENIA uses noun phrases more often, by just over six percentage points.",
        "This may reflect the fact that much of the text in GENIA describes interactions between multiple biological entities at the molecular and cellular levels; conjunction phrases are three times as frequent in GENIA too, although this is not obvious from the chart as the numbers are so low in each corpus.",
        "One surprising result is revealed by looking at Table 1 which shows production rule usage across the corpora.",
        "Although GENIA uses slightly more productions per sentence on average, it uses marginally fewer distinct production rules per sentence, and considerably fewer overall - 62% of the number of rules used in the PTB, despite being 73% of the size in sentences.",
        "These figures, along with the significantly different rankings and frequencies of the actual rules themselves (Table 2), demonstrate that there are important syntactic differences between the corpora, despite the similarities in length, complexity and constituent usage.",
        "Such differences are invisible to conventional constituent-based analysis.",
        "The comparative lack of syntactic diversity in GENIA may seem counter-intuitive, since biological language seems at first glance dense and difficult.",
        "However, it must be remembered that the text in GENIA consists only of abstracts, which are tailored to the purpose of communicating a few salient points in a short passage, and tend to be composed in a somewhat formulaic manner.",
        "They are written in a very restricted register, compared to the range of registers that may be present in one issue of a newspaper - news articles, lifestyle features, opinion pieces, financial reports and letters will be delivered in very different voices.",
        "Also, some of the apparent complexity of biomedical texts is illusory, stemming from the unfamiliar vocabulary, and furthermore, a distinction must be made between syntactic and semantic complexity.",
        "Consider a phrase like iron-sulphur cluster assembly transcription factor, the name of a family of DNA-binding proteins, which is a semantically-complex concept expressed in a syntactically-simple form - essentially just a series of nouns."

        "Simple fallback cascades rely on their individual members failing on different sentences, but the more sophisticated methods in Section 5.2 and Section 5.3 are all ultimately based on the principle that agreement between parsers indicates convergence on the true parse.",
        "Although the performance gains we achieved with such methods are statistically significant, they are nonetheless somewhat unimpressive compared to the 30% reduction of recall errors and 6% reduction of precision errors reported for the best ensemble techniques in Henderson and Brill (1999) on the PTB.",
        "This led us to suspect that the parsers in the ensembles were making similar kinds of errors on GENIA, perhaps not across the board, but certainly often enough that consensus methods pick incorrect constituents, and centroid methods converge on incorrect parses, with a significant frequency.",
        "To investigate this phenomenon, and more generally to tease apart the reasons for each parser's performance drop on GENIA, we measured the precision and recall for each parser on each production rule over GENIA and the PTB.",

        "The knock-on syntactic effects of this disability can be traced in the leaf-ancestor metrics, where the parser scores an impressive mean of 91.50 for correctly-tagged words, compared to just 80.71 for incorrectly-tagged words.",
        "A similar effect can be seen in the statistics for productions with NN tags on the right hand side.",

        "that can be tagged independently by a dedicated named-entity recognizer.",
        "The story is different for mislabelled NP – NN NN productions, where 29% are mistaken for NP – JJ NN productions, a substitution that one can imagine causing greater semantic confusion.",
        "On the other hand, the Char-niak parser goes from being the worst at identifying ADVP – RB productions (single-word adverb phrases) on the PTB (F = 87.68) to being the best at this task on GENIA (F = 87.06).",
        "Accuracy issues notwithstanding, Charniak's is still the most robust of all the parsers, failing on none of the supplied sentences in either corpus.",
        "This may reflect a strategy of 'making-do' when an exact parse cannot be derived; it deployed more general-purposes FRAG (fragment) and X (unknown/unparseable) constituents combined than any other parser, and even a handful of INTJ (interjection) phrases that no other parser used in GENIA.",
        "Of course, such productions are not always correct - there are actually no interjections in GENIA - but from an information extraction point of view, a rough parse may be better than no parse at all, especially if the inclusion of such inexact labels can be reflected in a reduced level of confidence or trustworthiness for the sentence.",

        "In addition to these parser-specific observations, there are various phenomena that are common to all or most of the parsers.",
        "Due to slight differences in the annotation of coordinated structures between the GENIA and PTB guidelines, the correct generation of noun-phrase conjunctions (NP",
        " – NP CC NP) proved much harder on GENIA,",
        "with all parsers having problems with identification of the boundaries of the conjunction in the text, and often with correct labelling of the constituents involved too.",
        "Cases where each NP is a single word were handled relatively well, with the essentially equivalent NN CC NN construction often being proposed instead, but more complex cases caused widespread difficulty.",
        "More surprisingly, the labelling of single-word noun and adjective phrases (NP – NN and AJDP – JJ), both of which are significantly more frequent in GENIA, seemed challenging across the board.",
        "The most commonly-occurring error involved subsumption by a wider constituent with the same label, apart from the errors ofvocabulary for the Charniak parser as described above.",
        "However, for correctly-tagged adjectives and nouns, there are many situations where this will not make any difference to the sense of a sentence.",
        "For example, in a production like NP – DT JJ NN, the adjective still has its modificatory effect on the noun without needing to be placed within an ADJP phrase of its own, and the noun is entirely capable of acting as the head of the phrase without being nested within an NP sub-phrase.",
        "Similar effects occurred frequently with longer phrases containing nouns, such as NP – DT NN or NP – NN NN, where the most common errors were also subsumptions by wider noun phrases.",
        "Although the GENIA annotators warn that \"when noun phrase consists with sequence ofnouns [sic], the internal structure is not neccessarily shown,\"6which must account for some of the noun handling problems, such subsumptions suggest that the opposite may be occurring too - that there are cases where the parsers are failing to generate internal structure within noun phrases.",
        "Prepositions were involved in many ofthe problematic cases, both on the left-hand and right-hand sides of productions, and understandably so.",
        "The disambiguation of prepositional attachment is a continuing problem in parser design, and methods that take into account lexical dependencies between head words will be less effective when the words in question are out-of-domain and thus unseen in training.",
        "The production NP – NP PP PP is a good example.",
        "The most common error for all parsers was to produce NP – NP PP at the same span of words in the sentence, indicating that one of the prepositional phrases is frequently attached at the wrong level.",
        "The second most common error was to substitute a shorter NP, suggesting that one or both of the PPs were excluded.",

        "Although the performance gains achieved by our parser integration methods are statistically significant, and illustrative of some important points about parser behaviour and syntactic evaluation methodologies, it is doubtful that the results are good enough to justify deploying these techniques on large amounts of text, at least in their current form.",
        "The small increases in accuracy are probably outweighed by the additional computational costs.",
        "The fallback cascades provided the same protection from parse failure, with better performance than the widest-coverage parser alone, and in a production system most sentences would only need to be parsed by the first parser in the cascade.",
        "However, the parser integration idea as a whole is not without its merits; we determined that an oracle picking the best sentences on GENIA would achieve an LA score of 93.56, so there is still room for improvement if the algorithms can be made smarter.",
        "Although our analysis of the parsers' mistakes on GENIA indicated that the ideal of independently-distributed errors which underpins these integration methods does not hold true, the very fact that we can analyse their behaviour patterns in such detail suggests that a sufficiently well-designed ensemble could in principle learn the circumstances under which each parser could be trusted on a given corpus.",
        "Furthermore, there are additional ways in which an ensemble might assist with practical NLP issues.",
        "While analysing the data from the parse selection algorithms, we discovered that the centroid distances for the winning parses, scaled by sentence size where necessary, correlate fairly well (|r| œ 0.5) with those parses' true LA scores and F-measures (see Section 7.2).",
        "We developed a similar measurement for constituent voting based on the level of consensus among the ensemble members - the number of constituents winning a majority vote divided by the number of distinct candidate constituents - which showed a comparable degree of correlation.",
        "This provides an answer to our initial question about the extent to which parser agreement signals parse correctness.",
        "Presumably the major limiting factor on these correlations is the presence of widespread systematic errors like those described inSection 6.4.",
        "As noted previously, the Charniak parser takes raw text and performs tokenisation and POS tagging internally.",
        "While this may seem like an advantageous convenience, in practice it is the source of considerable extra work, besides being the cause of avoidable parse errors.",
        "The tokenisation standards encoded by Charniak did not match those assumed by either the GENIA corpus, or indeed the PTB extract, although problems were much more widespread in the GENIA.",
        "Words containing embedded punctuation were frequently split into multiple tokens, so these word-internal symbols had to be converted into textual placeholders before parsing and converted back afterwards.",
        "The somewhat idiosyncratic conventions of the GENIA corpus did not help (differentiation/activation being tagged as one token for example) but the fact that similar issues occurred on the newspaper corpus (e.g. with US$ or 81-year-old) suggests that making assumptions about the 'correct' way to tokenise text is a bad policy in any domain.",
        "Even when working on in-domain data, it seems like a bad design decision to assume the parser will be able to match the performance ofa state-of-the-art POS tagger on unseen text.",
        "The Bikel parser can operate in either mode, which is a much more flexible policy.",
        "In all fairness, however, it would probably be fairly trivial for an interested C++ developer to bypass the Charniak parser's tokeniser and tagger and recompile it.",
        "A different kind of engineering issue is that of computation time.",
        "Parsing is a slow process in any case, and ensemble methods compound this problem.",
        "However, parsing is a canonically easy task to perform in parallel, since (at this level of understanding at least) each sentence has no dependencies on the previous, so even the parse integration step can be split across multiple pipelines.",
        "We intend to run pilot studies on the scalability of parallel distributed parsing techniques, both on an IBM Blade Center cluster running Beowulf Linux, and a heterogeneous network of Windows PCs in their spare hours, in order to determine the feasibility and comparative attractiveness of each approach.",
        "Wementioned above that there is a significant correlation between the distance of a winning parse from the centroid and its accuracy compared to the gold standard.",
        "In an IE or other text mining scenario, one could use these values as estimators of trustworthiness for each parse - empirical measures indicating how reliable to consider it.",
        "We would like to explore this idea further, as it can provide an extra level of understanding which is missing from many IE techniques, and could be easily employed in the ranking of extracted 'facts' or the resolution of contradictions.",
        "Since LA scores can be calculated per word or per any arbitrary region of the sentence, the potential even for rating the trustworthiness of different clauses or relationships individually cannot be ignored.",
        "We have been experimenting with training a neural network to pick the best parse for a sentence based only on the pairwise Levenshtein distances between the candidate parses, in the hope that it can learn what decision to make based on patterns of agreement between the parsers, rather than just picking the parse which is most similar to all the others as the current methods do.",
        "So far, however, it has been unable to exceed the performance of the unsupervised methods, which suggests that additional features may need to be considered.",
        "A complementary approach to parse integration would be to merge the PTB with an annotated biomedical corpus and retrain a parser from scratch.",
        "This proposition appears more attractive in the light of the production rule frequency differences between GENIA and the PTB, and will become more effective as the GENIA treebank grows and the Mining the Bibliome project begins posting official releases.",
        "In the meantime, we have begun investigating the potential for using biological named-entity and ontological-class information to help rule out unlikely parses, for example in cases where an entity name is bisected by a constituent boundary."
