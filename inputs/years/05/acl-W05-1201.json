        "Results indicate that humans can perform this task well, with an F-score of .98 on alignment and an F-score of .95 on semantic relations (after correction).",
        "We then describe and evaluate a combined alignment and classification algorithm, which achieves an F-score on alignment of .85 (using EuroWordNet) and an F-score of .80 on semantic relation classification."

        "An automatic method that can determine how two sentences relate to each other in terms of semantic overlap or textual entailment (e.g., (Dagan and Glickman, 2004)) would be a very useful thing to have for robust natural language applications.",
        "A summarizer, for instance, could use it to extract the most informative sentences, while a question-answering system – to give a second example – could use it to select potential answer string (Pun-yakanok et al., 2004), perhaps preferring more specific answers over more general ones.",
        "In general, it",
        "is very useful to know whether some sentence S is more specific (entails) or more general than (is entailed by) an alternative sentence S', or whether the two sentences express essentially the same information albeit in a different way (paraphrasing).",
        "Research on automatic methods for recognizing semantic relations between sentences is still relatively new, and many basic issues need to be resolved.",
        "In this paper we address two such related issues: (1) to what extent can human annotators label semantic overlap relations between words, phrases and sentences, and (2) what is the added value of linguistically informed analyses.",
        "It is generally assumed that pure string overlap is not sufficient for recognizing semantic relations; and that using some form of syntactic analysis may be beneficial (e.g., (Herrera et al., 2005), (Vander-wende et al., 2005)).",
        "Our working hypothesis is that semantic overlap at the word and phrase levels may provide a good basis for deciding the semantic relation between sentences.",
        "Recognising semantic relations between sentences then becomes a two-step procedure: first, the words and phrases in the respective sentences need to be aligned, after which the relations between the pairs of aligned words and phrases should be labeled in terms of semantic relations.",
        "Various alignment algorithms have been developed for data-driven approaches to machine translation (e.g. (Och and Ney, 2000)).",
        "Initially work focused on word-based alignment, but more and more work is also addressing alignment at the higher levels (substrings, syntactic phrases or trees), e.g., (Meyers et al., 1996), (Gildea, 2003).",
        "For our purposes, an additional advantage of aligning syntactic structures is that it keeps the alignment feasible (as the number of arbitrary substrings that may be aligned grows exponentially to the number of words",
        "in the sentence).",
        "Here, following (Herrera et al., 2005) and (Barzilay, 2003), we will align sentences at the level of dependency structures.",
        "In addition, we will label the alignments in terms of five basic semantic relations to be defined below.",
        "We will perform this task both manually and automatically, so that we can address both of the issues raised above.",
        "Section 2 describes a monolingual parallel corpus consisting of two Dutch translations, and formalizes the alignment-classification task to be performed.",
        "In section 3 we report the results on alignment, first describing interannotator agreement on this task and then the results on automatic alignment.",
        "In section 4, then, we address the semantic relation classification; again, first describing interannotator results, followed by results obtained using memory-based machine learning techniques.",
        "We end with a general discussion."

        "For our purposes, this proved to be a good way to quickly find a large enough set of related sentence pairs, which differ semantically in interesting and subtle ways.",

        "Corresponding sentences from both translations were manually aligned; in most cases this was a one-to-one mapping, but occasionally a single sentence in one translation mapped onto two or more sentences in the other: this occurred 23 times in all five chapters.",
        "Next, the Alpino parser for Dutch (e.g., (Bouma et al., 2001)) was used for part-of-speech tagging and lemmatizing all words, and for assigning a dependency analysis to all sentences.",

        "The task to be performed can be described informally as follows: given two dependency analyses, align those nodes that are semantically related.",
        "More precisely: For each node v in the dependency structure for a sentence 5, we define STR(v) as the substring of all tokens under v (i.e., the composition of the tokens of all nodes reachable from v).",

        "Aligning node v from the dependency graph D of sentence 5 with node v' from the graph D' of 5' indicates that there is a semantic relation between STR(v) and STR(v'), that is, between the respective substrings associated with v and v'.",
        "We distinguish five potential, mutually exclusive, relations between nodes (with illustrative examples):",
        "1. v equals v' iff STR(v) and STR(v') are literally",
        "identical (abstracting from case).",
        "Example: “a small and a large boa-constrictor” equals “a large and a small boa-constrictor”;",
        "2. v restates v' iff STR(v) is a paraphrase of STR(v') (same information content but different wording).",
        "Example: “a drawing of a boa-constrictor snake” restates “a drawing of a boa-constrictor”; 3. v specifies v' iff STR(v) is more specific than STR(v').",
        "Example: “the planet B 612” specifies “the planet”; 4. v generalizes v' iff STR(v') is more specific than STR(v).",
        "Example: “the planet” generalizes “the planet B 612”; 5. v intersects v' iff STR(v) and STR(v') share",
        "some informational content, but also each express some piece of information not expressed in the other.",
        "Example: “Jupiter and Mars” intersects “Mars and Venus” Figure 1 shows an example alignment with semantic relations between the dependency structures of",
        "two sentences.",
        "Note that there is an intuitive relation with entailment here: both equals and restates can be understood as mutual entailment (i.e., if the root nodes of the analyses corresponding 5 and 5' stand in an equal or restate relation, 5 entails 5' and 5' entails 5), if 5 species 5' then 5 also entails 5' and if 5 generalizes 5' then 5 is entailed by 5'.",
        "In remainder of this paper, we will distinguish two aspects of this task: alignment is the subtask of pairing related nodes – or more precise, pairing the token strings corresponding to these nodes; classification of semantic relations is the subtask of labeling these alignments in terms of the five types of semantic relations."
