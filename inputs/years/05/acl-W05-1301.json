        "A primary set of tasks facing biomedical text processing systems is that of categorizing, identifying and classifying entities within the literature.",
        "A key step in this process involves grouping mentions of entities together into equivalence classes that denote some underlying entity.",
        "In the biomedical domain, however, we are fortunate to have structured data resources such as databases and ontologies with entries denoting these equivalence classes.",
        "In biomedical text mining, then, this process involves associating mentions of entities with known, existing unique identifiers for those entities in databases or ontologies – a process referred to as normalization.",
        "This ability is required for text processing systems to associate descriptions of concepts in free text with a grounded, organized system of knowledge more readily amenable to machine processing.",
        "The recent BioCreAtIvE Task 1B evaluation challenged a number of systems to identify genes associated with abstracts for three different organisms: mouse, fly and yeast.",
        "The participants were provided with a large set of noisy training data and a smaller set of higher quality development test data.",
        "They were also provided with a lexicon containing all the potential gene identifiers that might occur and a list of known, though incomplete, names and synonyms that refer to each of them.",
        "To prepare the training data, the list of unique gene identifiers associated with each full text article was obtained from the appropriate model organism database.",
        "However, the list had to be pruned to correspond to the genes mentioned in the abstract.",
        "This was done by searching the abstract for each gene on the list or its synonyms, using exact string matching.",
        "This process has the potential to miss genes that were referred to in the abstract using a phrase that does not appear in the synonym list.",
        "Additionally, the list may be incomplete, because not all genes mentioned in the article were curated, so there are mentions of genes in an abstract that did not have a corresponding identifier on the gene list.",
        "This paper explores a series of methods for attempting to recover some of these missing gene",
        "identifiers from the Task 1B training data abstracts.",
        "We start with a robust, machine learning-based baseline system: a reimplementation of the system in [1].",
        "Briefly, this system utilizes a classifier to select or filter matches made against the synonym list with a loose matching criterion.",
        "From this baseline, we explore various methods for re-labeling the noisy training data, resulting in improved scores on the overall Task 1B development test and evaluation data.",
        "Our methods are based on weakly supervised learning techniques such as co-training [2] and self-training [3, 4] for learning with both labeled and unlabeled data.",
        "The setting here is different than the typical setting for weakly supervised learning, however, in that we have a large amount of noisily labeled data, as opposed to completely unlabeled data.",
        "The main contribution of this work is a framework for applying weakly supervised methods to this problem of re-labeling noisy training data.",
        "Our approach is based on partitioning the training data into two sets and viewing the problem as two mutually supporting weakly supervised learning problems.",

        "In certain situations (see [2]) the improvement can be substantial.",
        "Situations with small amounts of labeled data and large amounts of unlabeled data are very common in real-world applications where labeling large quantities of data is prohibitively expensive.",

        "Two classifiers are trained on the training data with different “views” of the data.",

        "Each classifier then selects the most confidently classified instances from the unlabeled data (or some random subset thereof) and adds them to the training set.",
        "The process is repeated until all data has been labeled or some other stopping criterion is met.",

        "Our solution to this problem was to impose a constraint on instances to be re-labeled: The phrase in the abstract associated with the instance is required to have been tagged as a gene name by a gene name tagger in addition to the instance receiving a high probability by the re-labeling classifier.",
