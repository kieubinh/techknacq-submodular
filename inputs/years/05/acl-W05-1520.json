        "Natural language understanding is an essential module in any dialogue system.",
        "To obtain satisfactory performance levels, a dialogue system needs a semantic parser/natural language understanding system (NLU) that produces accurate and detailed dialogue oriented semantic output.",
        "Recently, a number of semantic parsers trained using either the FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) or the Prop-Bank (Kingsbury et al., 2002) have been reported.",
        "Despite their reasonable performances on general tasks, these parsers do not work so well in specific domains.",
        "Also, where these general purpose parsers tend to provide case-frame structures, that include the standard core case roles (Agent, Patient, Instrument, etc.",
        "), dialogue oriented domains tend to require additional information about addressees, modality, speech acts, etc.",
        "Where general-purpose resources such as PropBank and Framenet provide invaluable training data for general case, it tends to be a problem to obtain enough training data in a specific dialogue oriented domain.",
        "We in this paper propose and compare a number of approaches for building a statistically trained domain specific parser/NLU for a dialogue system.",
        "Our NLU is a part of Mission Rehearsal Exercise (MRE) project (Swartout et al., 2001).",
        "MRE is a large system that is being built to train experts, in which a trainee interacts with a Virtual Human using voice input.",
        "The purpose of our NLU is to convert the sentence strings produced by the speech recognizer into internal shallow semantic frames composed of slot-value pairs, for the dialogue module."

        "Our two-stage procedure for generating a frame for a given input sentence is: (1) Find a set of all slot-value that correspond with each word/ngram (2) Select the top portion of these candidates to form the final frame (Bhagat et al., 2005; Feng and Hovy, 2003)."

        "Table 1 shows the average Precision, Recall and F-scores of the different systems for the 50 test sentences: Voting based (Voting), Maximum Entropy based (ME), Support Vector Machine based (SVM), Language Model based with unigrams (LM 1) and Language Model based with trigrams (LM2).",
        "The F-scores show that the LM2 system performs the best though the system scores in general for all the systems are very close.",
        "To test the statistical significance of these scores, we conduct a two-tailed paired Studentâ€™s t test (Manning and Schtze, 1999) on the F-scores of these systems for the 50 test cases.",

        "This work illustrates that one can achieve fair success in building a statistical NLU engine for a restricted domain using relatively little training data and surprisingly using a rather simple voting model.",

        "Having successfully met the initial challenge of building a statistical NLU with limited training data, we have identified multiple avenues for further exploration.",

        "Secondly, we wish to see the effect that ASR output has on each of the systems.",
        "We want to test the robustness of systems against an increase in the ASR word error rate.",
        "Thirdly, we want to build a multi-clause utterance chunker to integrate with our systems.",
        "We have identified that complex multi-clause utterances have consistently hurt the system performances.",
        "To handle this, we are making efforts along with our colleagues in the speech community to build a real-time speech utterance-chunker.",
        "We are eager to discover any performance benefits.",
        "Finally, since we already have a corpus containing sentence and their corresponding semantic-frames, we want to explore the possibility of building a Statistical Generator using the same corpus that would take a frame as input and produce a sentence as output.",
        "This would take us a step closer to the idea of building a Reversible System that can act as a parser when used in one direction and as a generator when used in the other."
