        "Producing detailed syntactic and semantic representations of natural language is essential for practical dialog systems such as plan-based assistants and tutorial systems.",
        "Development of such systems is time-consuming and costly as they are typically hand-crafted for each application, and dialog corpus data is more difficult to obtain than text.",
        "The TRIPS parser and grammar addresses these issues by providing broad coverage of common constructions in practical dialog and producing semantic representations suitable for dialog processing across domains.",
        "Our system bootstraps dialog system development in new domains and helps build parsed corpora.1 Evaluating deep parsers is a challenge (e.g., (Kaplan et al., 2004)).",
        "Although common bracketing accuracy metrics may provide a baseline, they are insufficient for applications such as ours that require complete and correct semantic representations produced by the parser.",
        "We evaluate our parser on bracketing accuracy against a statistical parser as a baseline, then on a word sense disambiguation task, and finally on full sentence syntactic and semantic accuracy in multiple domains as a realistic measure of system performance and portability."

        "The TRIPS LF provides the necessary information for reference resolution, surface speech act analysis, and interpretations for a wide variety of fragmentary utterances and conventional phrases typical in dialog.",
        "The LF content comes from a domain-independent ontology adapted from FrameNet (Johnson and Fillmore, 2000; Dzikovska et al., 2004) and linked to a domain-independent lexicon (Dzikovska, 2004).",
        "The parser uses a bottom-up chart algorithm with beam search.",
        "Alternative parses are scored with factors assigned to grammar rules and lexical entries by hand, because due to the limited amount of corpus data we have not yet been able to train a statistical model that outperforms our hand-tuned factors."

        "For test utterances for which TRIPS failed to produce a correct parse, gold standard trees were manually constructed independently by two linguists and reconciled.",
        "Table 1 shows results for the 100 test utterances and for the subset for which TRIPS finds a spanning parse (74).",
        "Bikel-M performs somewhat better on the bracketing task for the entire test set, which includes utterances for which TRIPS failed to find a parse, but it is lower on complete matches, which are crucial for semantic interpretation.",

        "Word senses are an important part of the LF representation, so we also evaluated TRIPS on word sense tagging against a baseline of the most common word senses in Monroe.",
        "There were 546 instances of ambiguous words in the 100 test utterances.",
        "TRIPS tagged 90.3% (493) of these correctly, compared to the baseline model of 75.3% (411) correct.",
        "To evaluate portability to new domains, we compared TRIPS full sentence accuracy on a subset of Monroe that underwent a fair amount of development (Tetreault et al., 2004) to corpora of keyboard tutorial session transcripts from new domains in basic electronics (BEETLE) and differentiation (LAM) (Table 2).",
        "The only development for these domains was addition of missing lexical items and two grammar rules.",
