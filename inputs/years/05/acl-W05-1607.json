        "Our discussion is grounded at the geometric level of representation and processing.",
        "Focusing on static prepositions, it is reasonable to propose that topological prepositions have a lower perceptual load than projective prepositions, due to the relative ease of perceiving two objects that are close to each other and the complex processing required to handle frame of reference ambiguity [Carlson-Radvansky and Irwin, 1994; Carlson-Radvansky and Logan, 1997].",
        "Figure 4 lists these preferences, with further distinctions among features: objects type is the easiest to process, before absolute gradable predicates (e.g. color), which is still easier than relative gradable predicates (e.g. size) [Dale and Reiter, 1995].",
        "This topological versus projective preference can be further refined if we consider the contrastive and relative uses of these relations noted in ยง2.",

        "However, the construction of such a model is prone to the issue of combinatorial explosion both in terms of the number of objects in the context (the location of each object in the scene must be checked against all the other objects in the scene) and number of inter-object spatial relations (as a greater number of spatial relations will require a greater number of comparisons between each pair of objects.",
        "We have presented a framework that address this issue by: (a) contextually defining the set of objects in the context that may function as a landmark, and (b) sequencing the order in which spatial relations are considered using a cognitively motivated hierarchy of relations.",
        "Defining the set of objects in the scene that may function as a landmark reduces the number of object pairs that a spatial relation must be computed over.",
        "Sequencing the consideration of spatial relations means that in each context model only one relation needs to be checked and in some instances the agent need not compute some of the spatial relations, as it may have succeeded in generating a distinguishing locative using a relation earlier in the sequence.",
        "A further advantage of our approach stems from the partitioning of the context into those objects that may function as a landmark and those that may not.",
        "As a result of this partitioning the algorithm avoids the issue of infinite recursion, as the partitioning of the context stops the algorithm from distinguishing a landmark using its trajector."
