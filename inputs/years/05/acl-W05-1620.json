        "Given the complexity of all the changes that are possible to a text, at the levels of syntax, semantics, discourse structure and pragmatics, it seemed impractical to tackle them all at once.",

        "Aggregation involves deciding how compact the presentation of information should be in a given text.",
        "It operates at several linguistic levels, but we only consider it here with respect to concepts and their attributes.",
        "For instance, the system must decide between generating “The princess is blonde.",
        "She sleeps.” and generating “The blonde princess sleeps.”.",
        "Aggregation is generally desirable, but may result in adjective-heavy texts when the information to impart becomes dense in terms of attributes, as in “The pretty blonde princess lived in a strong fancy castle with her stern rich parents.”.",
        "It is necessary to find the balance between the use of compound or single sentences, or in the case of the modifiers of a concept between the description of the attributes of the concept using only a phrase or various.",
        "We analysed the features of a human generated text from the point of view of the referring expressions, and we found five different features of simple texts that might be susceptible of easy treatment by means of evolutionary techniques.",

        "Two occurrences of the same concept in a paragraph can be far apart, and this may confuse the reader.",
        "Knowledge intensive approaches modelled on the way humans do it require a certain measure of content understanding that is resource hungry.",
        "As shown in [Reiter and Dale, 1992], a referring expression must communicate enough information to be able to uniquely identify the intended referent in the current discourse context, but avoiding the presence of redundant or otherwise unnecessary modifiers.",
        "Therefore, it is essential to choose a reference which matches these constraints.",
        "Taking into account these features, Reiter and Dale proposed an algorithm to generate definite noun phrases to identify objects in the current focus of attention of the reader or the hearer.",

        "In both cases, the main difficulty lay in the choice of a fitness function to guide the process.",
        "Although Levy only addressed a simple model concerned with syllabic information, his overall description of the architecture in terms of a population of poem drafts that evolve, with priority given to those drafts that are evaluated more highly, is an important insight.",
        "Levy uses a neural network, trained with examples of valid verse, to evaluate these drafts.",
