        "The de-facto web search paradigm defines the result to a user’s query as roughly a set of links to the best-matching documents selected out of billions of items available.",
        "Whenever the queries search for pinpointed, factual information, the burden of filling the gap between the output granularity (whole documents) and the targeted information (a set of sentences or relevant phrases) stays with the users, by browsing the returned documents in order to find the actually relevant bits of information.",
        "A frequent case are queries about named entities, which constitute a significant fraction of popular web queries according to search engine logs.",
        "When submitting queries such as John Williams or Python, search engine users could also be presented with a compilation of facts and specific attributes about those named entities, rather than a set of best-matching web pages.",
        "One of the challenges in creating such an alternative search result page is the inherent ambiguity of the queries, as several instances of the same class (e.g., different people) or different classes (e.g., a type of snake, a programming language, or a movie) may share the same name in the query.",
        "As an example, the *Work done during a summer internship at Google.",
        "contexts below are part of web documents referring to different people who share the same name John Williams:",
        "1.",
        "“John Williams and the Boston Pops conducted a summer Star Wars concert at Tan-glewood.” 2.",
        "“John Williams lost a Taipei death match against his brother, Axl Rotten.” 3.",
        "“John Williams won a Victoria Cross for his actions at the battle of Rorke‘s Drift.”",
        "The effectiveness of the search could be greatly improved if the search results were grouped together according to the corresponding sense, rather than presented as a flat, sense-mixed list of items (whether links to full-length documents, or extracted facts).",
        "As an added benefit, users would have easier access to a wider variety of results, whenever the top 10 or so results returned by the largest search engines happen to refer to only one particular (arguably the most popular) sense of the query (e.g., the programming language in the case of Python), thus submerging or “hiding” documents that refer to other senses of the query.",
        "In various natural language applications, significant performance gains are achieved as a function of data size rather than algorithm complexity, as illustrated by the increasingly popular use of the web as a (very large) corpus (Dale, 2003).",
        "It seems therefore natural to try to exploit the web in order to also improve the performance of relation extraction, i.e. the discovery of useful relationships between named entities mentioned in text documents.",
        "However, if one wants to combine evidence from multiple web pages, then one needs again to solve the name disambiguation problem.",
        "Without solving it, a relation extraction system analyzing the sentences in the above example could mistakenly consider the third as evidence that John Williams the composer fought at Rorke’s Drift."

        "Concretely, it takes advantage of some of the human knowledge available in Wikipedia, a free online encyclopedia created through decentralized, collective efforts of thousands of users (Remy, 2002).",
        "We show that the structure of Wikipedia lends itself to a set of useful features for the detection and disambiguation of named entities.",

        "The high number of support vectors – half the number of query-answer pairs in training data – suggests that all scenarios can benefit from more training data.",
        "One method for making this feasible is to use the weight vector w explicitely in a linear SVM.",
        "Because much of the computation time is spent on evaluating the decision function, using w explicitely may result in a significant speed-up.",
        "The dimensionality of w (by default I V I x I C 1) can be reduced significantly by considering only word-category pairs whose frequency in the training data is above a predefined threshold.",
        "A complementary way of using the training data is to augment the article of each named entity with the contexts from all queries for which this entity is the true answer.",
        "This method has the potential of improving the accuracy of both methods when the training and testing datasets are not disjoint in terms of the proper names used in their queries.",

        "While creating a separate model for each named entity is not feasible – there are 94,875 titles under People by occupation – named entity disambiguation can nevertheless benefit from correlations between Wikipedia categories and features traditionally used in WSD such as bigrams and trigrams centered on the proper name occurrence, and syntactic information."
