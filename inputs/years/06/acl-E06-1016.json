        "Formally, the degree of dominance of a particular sense of a word (target word) in a given text (target text) may be defined as the ratio of the occurrences of the sense to the total occurrences of the target word.",
        "The sense with the highest dominance in the target text is called the predominant sense of the target word.",
        "Determination of word sense dominance has many uses.",
        "An unsupervised system will benefit by backing off to the predominant sense in case of insufficient evidence.",
        "The dominance values may be used as prior probabilities for the different senses, obviating the need for labeled training data in a sense disambiguation task.",
        "Natural language systems can choose to ignore infrequent senses of words or consider only the most dominant senses (McCarthy et al., 2004).",
        "An unsupervised algorithm that discriminates instances into different usages can use word sense dominance to assign senses to the different clusters generated.",
        "Sense dominance may be determined by simple counting in sense-tagged data.",

        "(2004) separately used 90-, 32.5-, and 9.1-million-word corpora).",
        "By contrast, in this paper we present a method that accurately determines sense dominance even in relatively small amounts of target text (a few hundred sentences); although it does use a corpus, it does not require a similarly-sense-distributed corpus.",
        "Nor does our system (Figure 2) need any part-of-speech-tagged data (although that may improve results further), and it does not need to generate a thesaurus or execute any such time-intensive operation at run time.",
        "Our method stands on the hypothesis that words surrounding the target word are indicative of its intended sense, and that the dominance of a particular sense is proportional to the relative strength of association between it and co-occurring words in the target text.",

        "This is because the errors in determining the true category that a word co-occurs with will be distributed thinly across a number of other categories (details in Section 3.2).",

        "Thus on average 5 sentences correspond to each category other than c. Therefore in the 2000 sentences, words that truly co-occur with c will likely occur a large number of times, while the rest will be spread out thinly over 300 or so other categories.",

        "We proposed a new method for creating a word– category co-occurrence matrix (WCCM) using a published thesaurus and raw text, and applying simple sense disambiguation and bootstrapping techniques.",
        "We presented four methods to determine degree of dominance of a sense of a word using the WCCM.",
        "We automatically generated sentences with a target word annotated with senses from the published thesaurus, which we used to perform an extensive evaluation of the dominance methods.",
        "We achieved near-upper-bound results using all combinations of the the weighted methods (DI,W and DE,W) and three measures of association (odds, pmi, and Yule).",
        "We cannot compare accuracies with McCarthy et al.",
        "(2004) because use of a thesaurus instead of WordNet means that knowledge of exactly how the thesaurus senses map to WordNet is required.",
        "We used a thesaurus as such a resource, unlike WordNet, is available in more languages, provides us with coarse senses, and leads to a smaller WCCM (making computationally intensive operations viable).",
        "Further, unlike the McCarthy et al.",
        "system, we showed that our system gives accurate results without the need for a large similarly-sense-distributed text or retraining.",
        "The target texts used were much smaller (few hundred sentences) than those needed for automatic creation of a thesaurus (few million words).",
        "The WCCM has a number of other applications, as well.",
        "The strength of association between a word and a word sense can be used to determine the (more intuitive) distributional similarity of word senses (as opposed to words).",
        "Conditional probabilities of lexical features can be calculated from the WCCM, which in turn can be used in unsupervised sense disambiguation.",
        "In conclusion, we provided a framework for capturing distributional properties of word senses from raw text and demonstrated one of its uses – determining word sense dominance."
