        "The Web is a very rich source of linguistic data, and in the last few years it has been used intensively by linguists and language technologists for many tasks (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003).",
        "Among other uses, the Web allows fast and inexpensive construction of “general purpose” corpora, i.e., corpora that are not meant to represent a specific sub-language, but a language as a whole.",
        "There are several recent studies on the extent to which Web-derived corpora are comparable, in terms of variety of topics and styles, to traditional “balanced” corpora (Fletcher, 2004; Sharoff, 2006).",
        "Our contribution, in this paper, is to present an automated, quantitative method to evaluate the “variety” or “randomness” (with respect to a number of non-random partitions) of a Web corpus.",
        "The more random/less-biased towards specific partitions a corpus is, the more it should be suitable as a general purpose corpus.",
        "We are not proposing a method to evaluate whether a sample of Web pages is a random sample of the Web, although this is a related issue (Bharat and Broder, 1998; Henzinger et al., 2000).",
        "Instead, we propose a method, based on simple distributional properties, to evaluate if a sample of Web pages in a certain language is reasonably varied in terms of the topics (and, perhaps, textual types) it contains.",
        "This is independent from whether they are actually proportionally representing what is out there on the Web or not.",
        "For example, although computer-related technical language is probably much more common on the Web than, say, the language of literary criticism, one might prefer a biased retrieval method that fetches documents representing these and other sub-languages in comparable amounts, to an unbiased method that leads to a corpus composed mostly of computer jargon.",
        "This is a new area of investigation – with traditional corpora, one knows a priori their composition.",
        "As the Web plays an increasingly central role as data source in NLP, we believe that methods to efficiently characterize the nature of automatically retrieved data are becoming of central importance to the discipline.",
        "In the empirical evaluation of the method, we focus on general purpose corpora built issuing automated queries to a search engine and retrieving the corresponding pages, which has been shown to be an easy and effective way to build Web-based corpora (Ghani et al., 2001; Ueyama and Baroni, 2005; Sharoff, 2006).",
        "It is natural to ask which kinds of query terms, henceforth seeds, are more appropriate to build a corpus comparable, in terms of variety, to traditional balanced corpora such as the British National Corpus, henceforth BNC (Aston and Burnard, 1998).",
        "We test our procedure to assess Web-corpus randomness on corpora built",
        "using seeds chosen following different strategies.",
        "However, the method per se can also be used to assess the randomness of corpora built in other ways; e.g., by crawling the Web.",
        "Our method is based on the comparison of the word frequency distribution of the target corpus to word frequency distributions constructed using queries to a search engine for deliberately biased seeds.",
        "As such, it is nearly resource-free, as it only requires lists of words belonging to specific domains that can be used as biased seeds.",
        "In our experiments we used Google as the search engine of choice, but different search engines could be used as well, or other ways to obtain collections of biased documents, e.g., via a directory of pre-categorized Web-pages."

        "Different criteria are used to select the seeds.",
        "Ghani and colleagues iteratively bootstrapped queries to AltaVista from retrieved documents in the target language and in other languages.",
        "They seeded the bootstrap procedure with manually selected documents, or with small sets of words provided by native speakers of the language.",
        "They showed that the procedure produces a corpus that contains, mostly, pages in the relevant language, but they did not evaluate the results in terms of quality or variety.",
        "Fletcher (2004) constructed a corpus of English by querying AltaVista for the 10 top frequency words from the BNC.",
        "He then conducted a qualitative analysis of frequent n-grams in the Web corpus and in the BNC, highlighting the differences between the two corpora.",
        "Sharoff (2006) built corpora of English, Russian and German via queries to Google seeded with manually cleaned lists of words that are frequent in a reference corpus in the relevant language, excluding function words, while Ueyama and Baroni (2005) built corpora of Japanese using seed words from a basic Japanese vocabulary list.",
        "Both Sharoff and Ueyama and Baroni evaluated the results through a manual classification of the retrieved pages and by qualitative analysis of the words that are most typical of the Web corpora.",
        "We are also interested in evaluating the effect that different seed selection (or, more in general, corpus building) strategies have on the nature of the resulting Web corpus.",
        "However, rather than performing a qualitative investigation, we develop a quantitative measure that could be used to evaluate and compare a large number of different corpus building methods, as it does not require manual intervention.",
        "Moreover, our emphasis is not on the corpus building methodology, nor on classifying the retrieved pages, but on assessing whether they appear to be reasonably unbiased with respect to a range of topics or other criteria.",
        "3 Measuring distributional properties of biased and unbiased collections Our goal is to create a “balanced” corpus of Web pages in a given language; e.g., the portion composed of all Spanish Web pages.",
        "As we observed in the introduction, obtaining a sample of unbiased documents is not the same as obtaining an unbiased sample of documents.",
        "Thus, we will not motivate our method in terms of whether it favors unbiased samples from the Web, but in terms of whether the documents that are sampled appear to be balanced with respect to a set of deliberately biased samples.",
        "We leave it to further research to investigate how the choice of the biased sampling method affects the performance of our procedure and its relations to uniform sampling."

        "We suggest the following hypothesis.",
        "Unigrams sampled from the full set of documents have distances from biased samples which tend to be lower than the distances of biased samples to other samples based on different biases.",
        "Samples from the whole corpus, or Web, should produce lower KL distances because they draw words across the whole vocabulary, while biased samples have mostly access to a single specialized vocabulary.",
        "If this hypothesis is true then, on average, the distance between the unbiased sample and all other samples should be lower than the distance between a biased sample and all other samples.",
        "Figure 1 depicts a geometric interpretation of the intuition behind this hypothesis.",
        "Suppose that the two squares A and B represent two partitions of the space of documents C. Additionally, m pairs of unigram distributions, represented as points, are produced by sampling documents uniformly at random from these partitions; e.g. a1 and b1.",
        "The mean Euclidean distance between (ai, bi) pairs is a value between 0 and h, the length of the diagonal of the rectangle which is the union of A and B.",
        "Instead of drawing pairs we can draw triples of points, one point from A, one from B, and another point from C = A U B.",
        "Approximately half of the points drawn from C will lie in the A square, while the other half will lie in the B square.",

        "Our method is based on the idea that the more a collection is unbiased the closer its distribution of words will be, on average, to reference distributions derived from biased partitions (we showed that this is indeed the case using a fully available balanced collection; i.e., the BNC), and on the idea that biased collections of Web documents can be created by issuing biased queries to a search engine.",
        "The results of our experiments with Google support our hypothesis, and suggest that seeds to build unbiased corpora should be selected among mid-frequency words rather than high or low frequency words.",
        "We realize that our study opens many questions.",
        "The most crucial issue is probably what it means for a corpus to be unbiased.",
        "As we already stressed, we do not necessarily want our corpus to be an unbiased sample of what is out there on the Net – we want it to be composed of content-rich pages, and reasonably balanced in terms of topics and genres, despite the fact that the Web itself is unlikely to be “balanced”.",
        "For our purposes, we implicitly define balance in terms of the set of biased corpora that we compare the target corpus against.",
        "Assuming that our measure is appropriate, what it tells us is that a certain corpus is more/less biased than another corpus with respect to the biased corpora they are compared against.",
        "It remains to be seen how well the results generalize across different typologies of biased corpora.",
        "The method is not limited to the evaluation of corpora built via search engine queries; e.g., it would be interesting to compare the latter to corpora built by Web crawling.",
        "The method could be also applied to the analysis of corpora in general (Web-derived or not), both for the purpose of evaluating biased-ness, and as a general purpose corpus comparison technique (Kilgarriff, 2001)."
