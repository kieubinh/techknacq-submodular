        "Computational psycholinguistics is concerned with modelling human language processing.",
        "Much work has gone into the exploration of sentence comprehension.",
        "Syntactic preferences that unfold during the course of the sentence have been successfully modelled using incremental probabilistic context-free parsing models (e.g., Jurafsky, 1996; Crocker and Brants, 2000).",
        "These models assume that humans prefer the most likely structural alternative at each point in the sentence.",
        "If the preferred structure changes during processing, such models correctly predict processing difficulty for a range of experimentally investigated constructions.",
        "They do not, however, incorporate an explicit notion of semantic processing, while there are many phenomena in human sentence processing that demonstrate a non-trivial interaction of syntactic preferences and semantic plausibility.",
        "Consider, for example, the well-studied case of reduced relative clause constructions.",
        "When incrementally processing the sentence The deer shot by the hunter was used as a trophy, there is a local ambiguity at shot between continuation as a main clause (as in The deer shot the hunter) or as a reduced relative clause modifying deer (equivalent to The deer which was shot ... ).",
        "The main clause continuation is syntactically more likely.",
        "However, there is a second, semantic clue provided by the high plausibility of deer being shot and the low plausibility of them shooting.",
        "This influences readers to choose the syntactically dis-preferred reduced relative reading which interprets the deer as an object of shot (McRae et al., 1998).",
        "Plausibility has overridden the syntactic default.",
        "On the other hand, for a sentence like The hunter shot by the teenager was only 30 years old, semantic plausibility initially reinforces the syntactic main clause preference and readers show difficulty accommodating the subsequent disambiguation towards the reduced relative.",
        "In order to model effects like these, we need to extend existing models of sentence processing by introducing a semantic dimension.",
        "Possible ways of integrating different sources of information have been presented e.g. by McRae et al.",
        "(1998) and Narayanan and Jurafsky (2002).",
        "Our aim is to formulate a model that reliably predicts human plausibility judgements from corpus resources, in parallel to the standard practice of basing the syntax component of psycholinguistic models on corpus probabilities or even probabilistic treebank grammars.",
        "We can then use both the syntactic likelihood and the semantic plausibility score to predict the preferred syntactic alternative, thus accounting for the effects shown e.g. by McRae et al.",
        "(1998).",
        "Independent of a syntactic model, we want any semantic model we define to satisfy two criteria: First, it needs to be able to make predictions in",
        "crementally, in parallel with the syntactic model.",
        "This entails dealing with incomplete or unspecified (syntactic) information.",
        "Second, we want to extend to semantics the assumption made in syntactic models that the most probable alternative is the one preferred by humans.",
        "The model therefore must be probabilistic.",
        "We present such a probabilistic model that can assign roles incrementally as soon as a predicate-argument pair is seen.",
        "It uses the likelihood of thematic role assignments to model human interpretation of verb-argument relations.",
        "Thematic roles are a description of the link between verb and argument at the interface between syntax and semantics.",
        "Thus, they provide a shallow level of sentence semantics which can be learnt from annotated corpora.",
        "We evaluate our model by verifying that it indeed correctly predicts human judgements, and by comparing its performance with that of a standard role labeller in terms of both judgement prediction and role assignment.",
        "Our model has two advantages over the standard labeller: It does not rely on syntactic features (which can be hard to come by in an incremental task) and our smoothing approach allows it to make argument-specific role predictions in spite of extremely sparse training data.",
        "We conclude that (a) our model solves the task we set, and (b) our model is better equipped for our task than a standard role labeller.",
        "The outline of the paper is as follows: After defining the prediction task more concretely (Section 2), we present our simple probabilistic model that is tailoured to the task (Section 3).",
        "We introduce our test and training data in Section 4.",
        "It becomes evident immediately that we face a severe sparse data problem, which we tackle on two levels: By smoothing the distribution and by acquiring additional counts for sparse cases.",
        "The smoothed model succeeds on the prediction task (Section 5).",
        "Finally, in Section 6, we compare our model to a standard role labeller."

        "The need for smoothing is obvious: Coverage is so low that we can only compute correlations in two cases, and even for those, less than 20% of the data are covered.",
        "GT smoothing alone always outperforms the combination of GT and LI smoothing, especially for the FrameNet training set.",
        "Maximising the data likelihood during X estimation does not approximate our final task well enough: The log likelihood of the test data is duly improved from – 797.1 to – 772.2 for the PropBank data and from – 501.9 to – 446.3 for the FrameNet data.",
        "However, especially for the FrameNet training data, performance on the correlation task diminishes as data probability rises.",
        "A better solution might be to use the correlation task directly as a X estimation criterion, but this is much more complex, requiring us to estimate all X terms simultaneously.",
        "Also, the main problem seems to be that the X interpolation smoothes by de-emphasising the most specific (and sparsest) term, so that, on our final task, the all-important argument-specific information is not used efficiently when it is available.",
        "We therefore restrict ourselves to GT smoothing.",
        "Model Performance Both versions of the smoothed model make predictions for all seen verbs; the remaining uncovered data points are those where the correct role is not accounted for in the training data (the verb may be very sparse or only seen in a different FrameNet frame).",
