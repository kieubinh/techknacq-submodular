        "Coordination and coordinative ellipsis are essential tools for the sentence aggregation component of any language generator.",
        "Very often, when the aggregator chooses to combine several clauses into a single coordinate structure, the need arises to eliminate unnatural reduplications of corefer-ential constituents.",
        "In the literature, one often distinguishes four major types of clause-level coordinative ellipsis:",
        "• Gapping (as in (1)), with a special variant called Long-Distance Gapping (LDG).",
        "In LDG, the second conjunct consists of constituents stemming from different clauses – in (2), the main clause and the complement.",
        "• Forward Conjunction Reduction (FCR; cf. (3) and the relative clause in (4)).",
        "• SGF (Subject Gap in clauses with Finite/ Fronted verb; as in (5), and • Backward Conjunction reduction (BCR, also termed Right Node Raising; see (6)).",

        "We will not deal with VP Ellipsis and VP Anaphora because they generate pro-forms rather than elisions and are not restricted to coordination (cf. the title of the paper).",
        "In current sentence generators, the coordinative ellipsis rules are often inextricably intertwined with the rules for generating non-elliptical coordinate structures, so that they cannot easily be ported to other grammar formalisms – e.g., Sarkar & Joshi (1996) for Tree Adjoining Grammar; Steedman (2000) for Combinatory Categorial Grammar; Bateman, Matthiessen & Zeng (1999) for Functional Grammar.",
        "Generators that do include an autonomous component for coordinative ellipsis (Dalianis, 1999; Shaw, 2002; Hielkema, 2005), use incomplete rule sets, thus risking over or undergeneration, and incorrect or unnatural output.",
        "The module (dubbed ELLEIPO, from Greek 'EUsinw ‘I leave out’) we present here, is less",
        "formalism-dependent and, in principle, less liable to over or undergeneration than its competitors.",
        "In Section 2, we sketch the theoretical background.",
        "Section 3 and the Appendix describe our implementation, with examples from German.",
        "Finally, in Section 4, we discuss the prospects of extending the module to additional constructions."

        "ELLEIPO is loosely based on Kempen’s (subm.)",
        "psycholinguistically motivated syntactic theory of clausal coordination and coordinative ellipsis.",
        "It departs from the assumption that the generator’s strategic (conceptual, pragmatic) component is responsible for selecting the concepts and conceptual structures that enable identification of discourse referents (except in case of syntactically conditioned pronominalization).",
        "The strategic component may conjoin two or more clauses into a coordination and deliver as output a non-reduced sequence of conjuncts.",
        "The concepts in these conjuncts are adorned with reference tags, and identical tags express coreferentiality.2 Structures of this kind serve as input to the (syn)tactical component of the generator, where they are grammatically encoded (lexicalized and given syntactic form) without any form of coordinative ellipsis.",
        "The resulting non-elliptical structures are input to ELLEIPO, which computes and executes options for coordinative ellipsis.",
        "ELLEIPO’s functioning is based on the assumption that coordinative ellipsis does not result from the application of declarative grammar rules for clause formation but from a procedural component that interacts with the sentence generator and may block the overt expression of certain constituents.",
        "Due to this feature, ELLEIPO can be combined, at least in principle, with various grammar formalisms.",
        "However, this advantage is not entirely gratis: The module needs a formalism-dependent interface that converts gen-1 The strategic component is also supposed to apply rules of logical inference yielding the conceptual structures that underlie “respectively coordinations.” Hence, the conversion of clausal into NP coordination (such as Anne likes biking and Susi likes skating into Anne and Susi like biking and skating, respectively is supposed to arise in the strategic, not the (syn)tactical component of the generator.",
        "This also applies to simpler cases without respectively, such as John is skating and Peter is skating versus John and Peter are skating.",
        "The module presented here does not handle these conversions (see Reiter & Dale (2000, pp.",
        "133-139) for examples and possible solutions.)",
        "erator output to a (simple) canonical form."

      "heading": "3 A sketch of the algorithm",
      "text": [
        "This sketch presupposes and-coordinations of only n=2 conjuncts.",
        "Actually, ELLEIPO handles and-coordinations with n>2 conjuncts if, in every pair of conjuncts, the major constituents embody the same pattern of coreferences and contrasts.",
        "ELLEIPO takes as input a non-elliptical syntactic structure that should meet the following four canonical form criteria (see Fig. 1 for the input tree corresponding to example (7).",
        "(7) Susi hörte dass Hans einen Unfall hatte Susi heard that Hans an accident had und dassfHansfsterben könnte and that Hans die might ‘Susi heard that Hans had an accident and might die’",
        "• Categorial (phrasal and lexical) nodes – bolded in Fig. 1 – carry reference tags (presumably propagated from the generator’s strategic component).",
        "E.g., the tag “7” is attached to the root and head nodes of both exemplars of NP Hans in Fig. 1, indicating their coreferentiality.",
        "For the sake of computational uniformity, we also attach reference tags to non-referring lexical elements.",
        "In such cases, the tags denote lexical instead of referential identity.",
        "For instance, the fact that the two tokens of subordinating conjunction dass ‘that’ in Fig. 1 carry the same tag, is interpreted by ELLEIPO as indicating lexical identity.",
        "In combination with other properties, this licenses elision of the second dass (see (7)).",
        "• The conjuncts are sister nodes separated by coordinating conjunctions; we call these configurations coordination domains.",
        "The order of the conjuncts and their constituents is defined.",
        "• Every categorial node of the input tree is immediately dominated by a functional node.",
        "• Each clausal conjunct is rooted in an S-node whose daughter nodes (immediate constituents) are grammatical functions.",
        "Within a clausal conjunct, all functions are represented at the same hierarchical level.",
        "Hence, the trees are “flat,” as illustrated in Fig. 1, and similar to the trees in German treebanks (NEGRA-II, TIGER).",
        "ELLEIPO starts by demarcating “superclauses.” Kempen (subm.)",
        "introduced this notion in his treatment of Gapping and LDG.",
        "An S-node dominates a superclause iff it dominates the entire sentence or a clause beginning with a subordinating conjunction (CNJ).",
        "In Fig. 1, the strings dominated by S1, S5 and S12 are super",
        "clauses.",
        "Note that S12 includes clause S13, which is not a superclause.",
        "Then, ELLEIPO checks all coordination domains for elision options, as follows:",
        "• Testing for forward ellipsis: Gapping (including LDG), FCR, or SGF.",
        "This involves inspecting (recursively for every S-node) the set of immediate constituents (grammatical functions) of the two conjuncts, and their reference tags.",
        "Complete constituents of the right-hand conjunct may get marked for elision, depending on the specific conditions listed in the Appendix.",
        "• Testing for BCR.",
        "ELLEIPO checks – word-by-word, going from right to left – the corefer-ence tags of the conjuncts.",
        "As a result, complete or partial constituents in the right-hand periphery of the left conjunct may get marked for elision.",
        "The final step of the module is ReadOut.",
        "After all coordination domains have been processed, a (possibly empty) subset of the terminal leaves of the input tree has been marked for elision.",
        "In the examples below, this is indicated by subscript marks.",
        "E.g., the subscript “g” attached to esst ‘eat’ in (9b) indicates that Gapping is allowed.",
        "ReadOut interprets the elision marks and, in ‘standard mode,’ produces the shortest elliptical string(s) as output (e.g. (9c)).",
        "In ‘demo mode,’ it shows individual and combined elliptical options on user request.",
        "Furthermore, auch ‘too’ is added in case of “Stripping,” i.e. when Gapping leaves only one constituent as remnant.",
        "Example (10) illustrates a combination of Gapping and BCR, with the three licensed elliptical output strings shown in (10c).",
        "In (11), Gapping combines with BCR in the subordinate clauses.",
        "The fact that here, in contrast with (10), the subordinate clauses do not start their own superclauses, now licenses LDG.",
        "However, ReadOut prevents LDG to combine with BCR, which would have yielded the unintended string Anne versucht Bücher und Susi Artikel.",
