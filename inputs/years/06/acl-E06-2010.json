        "In this way, other components of the systems, which use the same ontology, can access this information in a straightforward way.",

        "The extracted information is defined with respect to SWIntO, the underlying SmartWeb Integrated Ontology (Oberle et al., in preparation) in order to be smoothly integrated into the system.",
        "The ability to extract information and describe it ontologically is a basic requirement for more complex processing tasks such as reasoning and discourse analysis (for related work on ontology-based information extraction see e.g. Maedche et al., 2002; Lopez and Motta, 2004; Müller et al., 2004; Nirenburg and Raskin, 2004)."

        "The SOBA system consists of a web crawler, linguistic annotation components and a component for the transformation of linguistic annotations into an ontology-based representation.",
        "The web crawler acts as a monitor on relevant web domains (i.e. the FIFA2 and UEFA3 web sites), automatically downloads relevant documents from them and sends them to a linguistic annotation web service.",
        "Linguistic annotation and information extraction is based on the Heart-of-Gold (HoG) architecture (Callmeier et al.",
        "2004), which provides a uniform and flexible infrastructure for building multilingual applications that use semantics and XML-based natural language processing components.",
        "The linguistically annotated documents are further processed by the transformation component, which generates a knowledge base of soccer-related entities (players, teams, etc.)",
        "and events (matches, goals, etc.)",
        "by mapping annotated entities or events to ontology classes and their properties.",
        "Finally, an automatic hyperlinking component is used for the visualization of extracted entities and events.",
        "This component is based on the VieWs system, which was developed independently of SmartWeb (Buitelaar et al., 2005).",
        "In what follows we describe the different components of the system in detail."
