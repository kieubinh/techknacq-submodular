        "Stochastic Tree Substitution Grammars (henceforth, STSGs) are a simple generalization of Probabilistic Context Free Grammars, where the productive elements are not rewrite rules but elementary trees of arbitrary size.",
        "The increased flexibility allows STSGs to model a variety of syntactic and statistical dependencies, using relatively complex primitives but just a single and extremely simple global rule: substitution.",
        "STSGs can be seen as Stochastic Tree Adjoining Grammars without the adjunction operation.",
        "STSGs are the underlying formalism of most instantiations of an approach to statistical parsing known as “Data-Oriented Parsing” (Scha, 1990; Bod, 1998).",
        "In this approach the subtrees of the trees in a tree bank are used as elementary trees of the grammar.",
        "In most DOP models the grammar used is an STSG with, in principle, all subtrees1 of the trees in the tree bank as elementary trees.",
        "For disambiguation, the best parse tree is taken to be the most probable parse according to the weights of the grammar.",
        "Several methods have been proposed to decide on the weights based on observed tree frequencies",
        "in a tree bank.",
        "The first such method is now known as “DOP1” (Bod, 1993).",
        "In combination with some heuristic constraints on the allowed subtrees, it has been remarkably successful on small tree banks.",
        "Despite this empirical success, (Johnson, 2002) argued that it is inadequate because it is biased and inconsistent.",
        "His criticism spearheaded a number of other methods, including (Bonnema et al., 1999; Bod, 2003; Sima’an and Buratto, 2003; Zollmann and Sima’an, 2005), and will be the starting point of our analysis.",
        "As it turns out, the DOP1 method really is biased and inconsistent, but not for the reasons Johnson gives, and it really is inadequate, but not because it is biased and inconsistent.",
        "In this note, we further show that alternative methods that have been proposed, only partly remedy the problems with DOP1, leaving weight estimation as an important open problem."

        "In Bod’s original DOP implementation (Bod, 1993; Bod, 1998), henceforth DOP1, the weights of an elementary tree t is defined as its relative frequency (relative to other subtrees with the same root label) in the tree bank.",
        "That is, the weight",
        "where fi = f (ti) gives the frequency of subtree ti in a corpus, and r(ti) is the root label of ti.",
        "In his critique of this method, (Johnson, 2002) considers a situation where there is an STSG G (the target grammar) with a specific set of subtrees (t1 ... tN) and specific values of the weights (w1 ... wN) .",
        "He evaluates an estimation procedure which produces a grammar G' (the estimated grammar), by looking at the difference between the weights of G and the expected weights of G'.",
        "Johnson’s test for consistency is thus based on comparing the weight-distributions between target grammar and estimated grammar2.",
        "I will therefore refer to this test as the “weight-distribution test”.",
        "not suitable to distinguish DOP1 from alternative methods, because no possible estimation procedure can recover the true weights in the case considered.",
        "In the example there are only two complete trees that can be observed in the training data, corresponding to the trees t1 and t5.",
        "It is easy to see that when generating examples with the grammar in figure 1, the relative frequencies3 f1 ... f4 of the subtrees t1 ... t4 must all be the same, and equal to the frequency of the complete tree t1 which can be composed in the following ways from the subtrees in the original grammar:",
        "(Johnson, 2002) looks at an example grammar G ∈ STSG with the subtrees as in figure 1.",
        "Johnson considers the case where the weights of all trees of the target grammar G are 0, except for w7, which is necessarily 1, and w4 and w6 which are w4 = p and w6 = 1 − p. He finds that the expected values of the weights w4 and w6 of the estimated grammar G' are:",
        "which are not equal to their target values for all values of p where 0 < p < 1.",
        "This analysis thus shows that DOP1 is unable to recover the true weights of the given STSG, and hence the inconsistency of the estimator with respect to the class of STSGs.",
        "Although usually cited as showing the inadequacy of DOP1, Johnson’s example is in fact 2More precisely, it is based on evaluating the estimator’s behavior for any weight-distribution possible in the STSG model.",
        "(Prescher et al., 2003) give a more formal treatment of bias and consistency in the context of DOP.",
        "From these equations it is immediately clear that, regardless of the amount of training data, the problem is simply underdetermined.",

        "possible estimation method will be able to reliably recover the true weights.",
        "The relevant test is whether for all possible STSGs and in the limit of infinite data, the expected relative frequencies of trees given the estimated grammar, equal the observed relative frequencies.",
        "I will refer to this test as the “frequency-distribution test”.",
        "As it turns out, the DOP1 method also fails this more lenient test.",
        "The easiest way to show this, using again figure 1, is as follows.",
        "The weights w1 ... w'7 of grammar G' will – by definition – be set to the relative frequencies of the corresponding subtrees:",
        "The grammar G' will thus produce the complete trees t1 and t5 with expected frequencies:",
        "Now consider the two possible complete trees t1 and t5, and the fraction of their frequencies f1/ f5.",
        "In the estimated grammar G' this fraction becomes:",
        "That is, in the limit of infinite data, the estimation procedure not only –understandably– fails to find the target grammar amongst the many grammars that could have produced the observed frequencies, it in fact chooses a grammar that could never have produced these observed frequencies at all.",

        "Frequencies f5 ... f11 are again simple combinations of the frequencies f1... f4.",
        "Observations of these frequencies therefore do not add any extra information, and the problem of finding the weights of the target grammar is in general again underdetermined.",
        "But consider the situation where f3= f4=0 and f1>0 and f2>0.",
        "This constrains the possible solutions enormously.",

        "That is, if we observe no occurrences of trees t3 and t4 in the training sample, we know that at least one subtree in each derivation of these strings must have weight zero.",
        "However, any estimation method that uses the (relative) frequencies of subtrees and a (non-zero) correction factor that is based on the size of the subtrees, will give non-zero probabilities to all weights w5 ... w11 if f1 > 0 and f2 > 0, as we assumed.",
