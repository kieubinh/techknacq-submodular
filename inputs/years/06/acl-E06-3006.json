        "How-To questions constitute a large proportion of questions on the Web.",
        "Many how-to questions inquire about the procedure for achieving a specific goal.",
        "For such questions, typical information retrieval (IR) methods, based on key word matching, are better suited to detecting the content of the goal (e.g., installing a Windows XP server) than the general nature of the desired information (i.e., procedural, a series of steps for achieving this goal).",
        "The reasons are given as below.",
        "First, documents that describe a procedure often do not contain the word procedure itself, but we are able to abstract the concept procedure from cues such as first, next and then, all of which indicate sequential relationships between actions.",
        "Secondly, We expect that the word procedure or the phrase how to will occur in a much broader context than the words in the goal.",
        "In other words, a document that contains the words in the goal is more likely to be relevant than a document that contains the word procedure or the phrase how to.",
        "Without noticing this difference, treating the two parts equally in the retrieving process will get many noisy documents.",
        "Many information requests seem to show such a structure, with one part identifying a specific topic and another part constraining the kind of information required about this topic (Yin and Power, 2005).",
        "The second part is often omitted when selecting retrieval terms from the request to construct an effective query for an IR system, such as in Picard (1999).",
        "The first point given above suggests that using cues such as first and next to expand the initial query may help in retrieving more relevant documents.",
        "Expansion terms can be generated automatically by query expansion techniques.",
        "The typical process is: (1) use the initial query to retrieve documents (referred to as the first round of retrieval); (2) consider a few top ranked documents as relevant and the rest irrelevant; (3) compare the relevant set with the irrelevant set to extract a list of most distinctive terms; (4) use the extracted terms to retrieve documents (referred to as the second round of retrieval).",
        "However, query expansion may not constitute a good solution, because its effectiveness largely",
        "depends on the quality of the few top ranked documents retrieved in the first round when the aforementioned two problems are not yet tackled.",
        "Our solution is to divide the process of retrieving answers for such questions into two stages: (1) use typical IR approaches for retrieving documents that are relevant to the specific goal; (2) use a text categorization approach to re-rank the retrieved documents according to the proportion of procedural text they contain.",
        "By procedural text we refer to ordered lists of steps, which are very common in some instructional genres such as online manuals.",
        "In this report, we will briefly introduce the text categorization approach (details are presented in (Yin and Power, 2006) ) and will explain in more concrete terms how it is integrated into the two-stage architecture proposed above.",
        "We will compare the performance of our two-stage architecture with a baseline system that uses only the content of the goal to retrieve relevant documents (equivalent to the first stage in the two-stage architecture).",
        "We will also compare the two-stage approach with systems that applies automatic query expansion techniques.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 introduces some relevant work in IR and question answering (QA).",
        "Section 3 talks about the text categorization approach for ranking procedural documents, covering issues such as the features used, the training corpus, the design of a classification model as well as some experiments for evaluation.",
        "Section 4 talks about integrating the text categorizer into the two-stage architecture and presents some experiments on retrieving relevant documents for how-to questions.",
        "Section 5 provides a short summary and presents some future work."

        "The idea of applying text categorization technology to help information retrieval is not new.",
        "In particular, text categorization techniques are widely adopted to filter a document source according to specific information needs.",
        "For example, Stricker et al.",
        "(2000) experiment on several news resources to find news addressing specific topics.",
        "They present a method for automatically generating discriminant terms (Stricker et al., 2000) for each topic that are then used as features to train a neural network classifier.",
        "Compared to these approaches, the novelty of our study lies in the idea that an information request consists of two different parts that should be retrieved in different ways and the whole retrieval process should adopt a two-stage architecture.",
        "A research area that is closely related to IR is question answering (QA), the differences being a) the input of a QA system is a question rather than a few key words; b) a QA system aims to extract answers to a question rather than retrieving relevant documents only.",
        "Most QA systems do adopt a two-stage architecture (if not consider the initial question analysis stage), i.e., perform IR with a few content words extracted from the query to locate documents likely to contain an answer and then use information extraction (IE) to find the text snippets that match the question type (Hovy et al., 2001; Elworthy, 2000).",
        "However, most question answering systems target factoid questions the research of non-factoid questions started only a few years ago but limited to several kinds, such as definitional questions (Xu et al., 2003) and questions asking for biographies (Tsur et al., 2004).",
        "Only a few studies have addressed procedural questions.",

        "(2002) explore the difference between documents that contain relevant information to the two different types of questions.",
        "They conclude, lists and FAQs occur in more documents judged relevant to task-oriented questions than those judged relevant to fact-oriented questions (Kelly et al., 2002: 645) and suggest, retrieval techniques specific to each type of question should be considered (Kelly et al., 2002: 647).",
        "Schwitter et al.",
        "(2004) present a method to extract answers from technical documentations for How-questions.",
        "To identify answers, they match the logical form of a sentence against that of the question and also explore the typographical conventions in technical domains.",
