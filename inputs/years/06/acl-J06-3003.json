        "Other researchers have proposed different schemes (Vanderwende 1994; Barker and Szpakowicz 1998; Rosario and Hearst 2001; Rosario, Hearst, and Fillmore 2002).",
        "It seems likely that some schemes are easier for machine learning than others.",
        "For some applications, 30 classes may not be necessary; the 5 class scheme may be sufficient.",
        "LRA, like VSM, is a corpus-based approach to measuring relational similarity.",
        "Past work suggests that a hybrid approach, combining multiple modules, some corpus-based, some lexicon-based, will surpass any purebred approach (Turney et al.",

        "We had some interesting results with small matrices (around 2,000 rows by 1,000 columns), but none of these methods seemed substantially better than SVD and none of them scaled up to the matrix sizes we are using here (e.g., 17,232 rows and 8,000 columns; see Section 6.1).",

        "This article has introduced a new method for calculating relational similarity, Latent Relational Analysis.",
        "The experiments demonstrate that LRA performs better than the VSM approach, when evaluated with SAT word analogy questions and with the task of classifying noun-modifier expressions.",
        "The VSM approach represents the relation between a pair of words with a vector, in which the elements are based on the frequencies of 64 hand-built patterns in a large corpus.",
        "LRA extends this approach in three ways: (1) The patterns are generated dynamically from the corpus, (2) SVD is used to smooth the data, and (3) a thesaurus is used to explore variations of the word pairs.",
        "With the WMTS corpus (about 5 x 10 English words), LRA achieves an F of 56.5%, whereas the F of VSM is 40.3%.",
        "We have presented several examples of the many potential applications for measures of relational similarity.",
        "Just as attributional similarity measures have proven to have many practical uses, we expect that relational similarity measures will soon become widely used.",
        "Gentner et al.",
        "(2001) argue that relational similarity is essential to understanding novel metaphors (as opposed to conventional metaphors).",
        "Many researchers have argued that metaphor is the heart of human thinking (Lakoff and Johnson 1980; Hofstadter and the Fluid Analogies Research Group 1995; Gentner et al.",
        "2001; French 2002).",
        "We believe that relational similarity plays a fundamental role in the mind and therefore relational similarity measures could be crucial for artificial intelligence.",
        "In future work, we plan to investigate some potential applications for LRA.",
        "It is possible that the error rate of LRA is still too high for practical applications, but the fact that LRA matches average human performance on SAT analogy questions is encouraging."
