        "Recognizing the semantic equivalence of two fragments of text is a fundamental component of many applications in natural language processing.",
        "Recognizing textual entailment, as formulated in the recent PASCAL Challenge 1, is the problem of determining whether some text sentence T entails some hypothesis sentence H. The motivation for this formulation was to isolate and evaluate the application-independent component of semantic inference shared across many application areas, reflected in the division of the PASCAL RTE dataset into seven distinct tasks: Information Extraction (IE), Comparable Documents (CD), Reading Comprehension (RC), Machine Translation (MT), Information Retrieval (IR), Question Answering (QA), and Paraphrase Acquisition (PP).",
        "The RTE problem as presented in the PASCAL RTE dataset is particularly attractive in that it is a reasonably simple task for human annotators with high inter-annotator agreement (95.1% in one independent labeling (Bos and Markert, 2005)), but an extremely challenging task for automated systems.",
        "The highest accuracy systems on the RTE test set are still much closer in performance to a random baseline accuracy of 50% than to the inter-annotator agreement.",
        "For example, two high-accuracy systems are those described in (Tatu and Moldovan, 2005), achieving 60.4% accuracy with no task-specific information, and (Bos and Markert, 2005), which achieves 61.2% task-dependent accuracy, i.e. when able to use the specific task labels as input.",
        "Previous systems for RTE have attempted a wide variety of strategies.",
        "Many previous approaches have used a logical form representation of the text and hypothesis sentences, focusing on deriving a proof by which one can infer the hypothesis logical form from the text logical form (Bayer et al., 2005; Bos and Markert, 2005; Raina et al., 2005; Tatu and Moldovan, 2005).",
        "These papers often cite that a major obstacle to accurate theorem proving for the task of textual entailment is the lack of world knowledge, which is frequently difficult and costly to obtain and encode.",
        "Attempts have been made to remedy this deficit through various techniques, including model-building (Bos and Markert, 2005) and the addition of semantic axioms (Tatu and Moldovan, 2005).",
        "Our system diverges from previous approaches most strongly by focusing upon false entailments; rather than assuming that a given entailment is false until proven true, we make the opposite assump",
        "tion, and instead focus on applying knowledge-free heuristics that can act locally on a subgraph of syntactic dependencies to determine with high confidence that the entailment is false.",
        "Our approach is inspired by an analysis of the RTE dataset that suggested a syntax-based approach should be approximately twice as effective at predicting false entailment as true entailment (Vanderwende and Dolan, 2006).",
        "The analysis implied that a great deal of syntactic information remained unexploited by existing systems, but gave few explicit suggestions on how syntactic information should be applied; this paper provides a starting point for creating the heuristics capable of obtaining the bound they suggest2."

        "Our logical form representation may be considered equivalently as a set of triples of the form RELATION(nodeZ, node�), or as a graph of syntactic dependencies; we use both terminologies interchangeably.",

        "2.",
        "Attempt an alignment of each content node in the dependency graph of the hypothesis sentence to some node in the graph of the text sentence, using a set of heuristics for alignment (described in Section 3).",

        "Using the alignment, apply a set of syntactic heuristics for recognizing false entailment (described in Section 4); if any match, predict that the entailment is false.",
        "4.",
        "If no syntactic heuristic matches, back off to a lexical similarity model (described in section 5.",
        "1), with an attempt to align detected paraphrases (described in section 5.2).",
        "In addition to the typical syntactic information provided by a dependency parser, the NLPWIN parser provides an extensive number of semantic features obtained from various linguistic resources, creating a rich environment for feature engineering.",
        "For example, Figure 1 (from Dev Ex.",
        "#616) illustrates the dependency graph representation we use, demonstrating the stemming, part-of-speech tagging, syntactic relationship identification, and semantic feature tagging capabilities of NLPWIN.",
        "We define a content node to be any node whose lemma is not on a small stoplist of common stop words.",
        "In addition to content vs. non-content nodes, among content nodes we distinguish between entities and nonentities: an entity node is any node classified by the NLPWIN parser as being a proper noun, quantity, or time.",
        "Each of the features of our system were developed from inspection of sentence pairs from the RTE development data set, and used in the final system only if they improved the system’s accuracy on the development set (or improved F-score if accuracy was unchanged); sentence pairs in the RTE test set were left uninspected and used for testing purposes only."
