        "Dependency parsing is an alternative to constituency analysis with a venerable tradition going back at least two millenia.",
        "The last century has seen attempts to formalize dependency parsing, particularly in the Prague School approach to linguistics (Tesni`ere, 1959; Melˇcuk, 1988).",
        "In a dependency analysis of syntax, words directly modify other words.",
        "Unlike constituency analysis, there are no intervening non-lexical nodes.",
        "We use the terms child and parent to denote the dependent term and the governing term respectively.",
        "Parsing has many potential applications, ranging from question answering and information retrieval to grammar checking.",
        "Our intended application is machine translation in the Microsoft Research Treelet Translation System (Quirk et al., 2005; Menezes and Quirk, 2005).",
        "This system expects an analysis of the source language in which words are related by directed, unlabeled dependencies.",
        "For the purposes of developing machine translation for several language pairs, we are interested in dependency analyses for multiple languages.",
        "The contributions of this paper are two-fold: First, we present a training algorithm called Bayes Point Machines (Herbrich et al., 2001; Harrington et al., 2003), which is as easy to implement as the perceptron, yet competitive with large margin methods.",
        "This algorithm has implications for anyone interested in implementing discriminative training methods for any application.",
        "Second, we develop parsers for English, Chinese, Czech, and Arabic and probe some linguistic questions regarding dependency analyses in different languages.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, the Arabic and Chinese results are the first reported results to date for directed dependencies.",
        "In the following, we first describe the data (Section 2) and the basic parser architecture (Section 3).",
        "Section 4 introduces the Bayes Point Machine while Section 5 describes the features for each language.",
        "We conclude with experimental results and discussions in Sections 6 and 7."

        "We utilize publicly available resources in Arabic, Chinese, Czech, and English for training our dependency parsers.",

        "This is a corpus of approximately 1.6 million words.",
        "We divided the data into the standard splits for training, devel",
        "opment test and blind test.",
        "The Prague Czech Dependency Treebank is provided with human-edited and automatically-assigned morphological information, including part-of-speech labels.",
        "Training and evaluation was performed using the automatically-assigned labels.",
        "For Arabic we used the Prague Arabic Dependency Treebank version 1.0 (LDC2004T23).",
        "Since there is no standard split of the data into training and test sections, we made an approximate 70%/15%/15% split for training/development test/blind test by sampling whole files.",
        "The Arabic Dependency Treebank is considerably smaller than that used for the other languages, with approximately 117,000 tokens annotated for morphological and syntactic relations.",
        "The relatively small size of this corpus, combined with the morphological complexity of Arabic and the heterogeneity of the corpus (it is drawn from five different newspapers across a three-year time period) is reflected in the relatively low dependency accuracy reported below.",
        "As with the Czech data, we trained and evaluated using the automatically-assigned part-of-speech labels provided with the data.",
        "Both the Czech and the Arabic corpora are annotated in terms of syntactic dependencies.",
        "For English and Chinese, however, no corpus is available that is annotated in terms of dependencies.",
        "We therefore applied head-finding rules to treebanks that were annotated in terms of constituency.",
        "For English, we used the Penn Treebank version 3.0 (Marcus et al., 1993) and extracted dependency relations by applying the head-finding rules of (Ya-mada and Matsumoto, 2003).",
        "These rules are a simplification of the head-finding rules of (Collins, 1999).",
        "We trained on sections 02-21, used section 24 for development test and evaluated on section 23.",
        "The English Penn Treebank contains approximately one million tokens.",
        "Training and evaluation against the development test set was performed using human-annotated part-of-speech labels.",
        "Evaluation against the blind test set was performed using part-of-speech labels assigned by the tagger described in (Toutanova et al., 2003).",
        "For Chinese, we used the Chinese Treebank version 5.0 (Xue et al., 2005).",
        "This corpus contains approximately 500,000 tokens.",
        "We made an approximate 70%/15%/15% split for training/development test/blind test by sampling whole files.",
        "As with the English Treebank, training and evaluation against the development test set was performed using human-annotated part-of-speech labels.",
        "For evaluation against the blind test section, we used an implementation of the tagger described in (Toutanova et al., 2003).",
        "Trained on the same training section as that used for training the parser and evaluated on the development test set, this tagger achieved a token accuracy of 92.2% and a sentence accuracy of 63.8%.",
        "The corpora used vary in homogeneity from the extreme case of the English Penn Treebank (a large corpus drawn from a single source, the Wall Street Journal) to the case of Arabic (a relatively small corpus–approximately 2,000 sentences–drawn from multiple sources).",
        "Furthermore, each language presents unique problems for computational analysis.",
        "Direct comparison of the dependency parsing results for one language to the results for another language is therefore difficult, although we do attempt in the discussion below to provide some basis for a more direct comparison.",
        "A common question when considering the deployment of a new language for machine translation is whether the natural language components available are of sufficient quality to warrant the effort to integrate them into the machine translation system.",
        "It is not feasible in every instance to do the integration work first and then to evaluate the output.",

        "We take as our starting point a reimplementation of McDonald’s state-of-the-art dependency parser (McDonald et al., 2005a).",
        "Given a sentence x, the goal of the parser is to find the highest-scoring parse yˆ among all possible parses y E Y:",
        "For a given parse y, its score is the sum of the scores of all its dependency links (i, j) E y: in a sentence.2 Refer to (McDonald et al., 2005b) for a detailed treatment of both algorithms.",
        "where the link (i, j) indicates a head-child dependency between the token at position i and the token at position j.",
        "The score d(i, j) of each dependency link (i, j) is further decomposed as the weighted sum of its features f (i, j ).",
        "This parser architecture naturally consists of three modules: (1) a decoder that enumerates all possible parses y and computes the argmax; (2) a training algorithm for adjusting the weights w given the training data; and (3) a feature representation f (i, j).",
        "Two decoders will be discussed here; the training algorithm and feature representation are discussed in the following sections.",
        "A good decoder should satisfy several properties: ideally, it should be able to search through all valid parses of a sentence and compute the parse scores efficiently.",
        "Efficiency is a significant issue since there are usually an exponential number of parses for any given sentence, and the discriminative training methods we will describe later require repeated decoding at each training iteration.",
        "We reimplemented Eisner’s decoder (Eisner, 1996), which searches among all projective parse trees, and the Chu-Liu-Edmonds’ decoder (Chu and Liu, 1965; Edmonds, 1967), which searches in the space of both projective and non-projective parses.",
        "(A projective tree is a parse with no crossing dependency links.)",
        "For the English and Chinese data, the head-finding rules for converting from Penn Treebank analyses to dependency analyses creates trees that are guaranteed to be projective, so Eisner’s algorithm suffices.",
        "For the Czech and Arabic corpora, a non-projective decoder is necessary.",
        "Both algorithms are O(N3), where N is the number of words In this section, we describe an online learning algorithm for training the weights w. First, we argue why an online learner is more suitable than a batch learner like a Support Vector Machine (SVM) for this task.",

        "Although the training data for our parsing problem exists as a batch (i.e. all input samples are available during training), we can apply online learning by presenting the input samples in some sequential order.",
        "For large training set sizes, a batch learner may face computational difficulties since there already exists an exponential number of parses per input sentence.",
        "Online learning is more tractable since it works with one input at a time.",
        "A popular online learner is the perceptron.",
        "It adjusts w by updating it with the feature vector whenever a misclassification on the current input sample occurs.",
        "It has been shown that such updates converge in a finite number of iterations if the data is linearly separable.",
        "The averaged perceptron (Collins, 2002) is a variant which averages the w across all iterations; it has demonstrated good generalization especially with data that is not linearly separable, as in many natural language processing problems.",
        "mal spanning tree algorithm, can run in O(N2), but our simpler implementation of O (N3) was sufficient.",
        "Recently, the good generalization properties of Support Vector Machines have prompted researchers to develop large margin methods for the online setting.",
        "Examples include the margin perceptron (Duda et al., 2001), ALMA (Gentile, 2001), and MIRA (which is used to train the parser in (McDonald et al., 2005a)).",
        "Conceptually, all these methods attempt to achieve a large margin and approximate the maximum margin solution of SVMs.",
        "4.2 Bayes Point Machines The Bayes Point Machine (BPM) achieves good generalization similar to that of large margin methods, but is motivated by a very different philosophy of Bayesian learning or model averaging.",
        "In the Bayesian learning framework, we assume a prior distribution over w. Observations of the training data revise our belief of w and produce a posterior distribution.",
        "The posterior distribution is used to create the final wBPM for classification:",

        "This solution achieves the so-called Bayes Point, which is the best approximation to the Bayes optimal solution given finite training data.",
        "In practice, the version space may be large, so we approximate it with a finite sample of size I.",
        "Further, assuming a uniform prior over weights, we get the following equation:",
        "Equation 4 can be computed by a very simple algorithm: (1) Train separate perceptrons on different random shuffles of the entire training data, obtaining a set of wi.",
        "(2) Take the average (arithmetic mean) of the weights wi.",
        "It is well-known that perceptron training results in different weight vector solutions",
        "if the data samples are presented sequentially in different orders.",
        "Therefore, random shuffles of the data and training a perceptron on each shuffle is effectively equivalent to sampling different models (wi) in the version space.",
        "Note that this averaging operation should not be confused with ensemble techniques such as Bagging or Boosting–ensemble techniques average the output hypotheses, whereas BPM averages the weights (models).",
        "The BPM pseudocode is given in Figure 1.",
        "The inner loop is simply a perceptron algorithm, so the BPM is very simple and fast to implement.",
        "The outer loop is easily parallelizable, allowing speedups in training the BPM.",
        "In our specific implementation for dependency parsing, the line of the pseudocode corresponding to [ˆyt = wi • xt] is replaced by Eq.",
        "1 and updates are performed for each incorrect dependency link.",
        "Also, we chose to average each individual perceptron (Collins, 2002) prior to Bayesian averaging.",
        "Finally, it is important to note that the definition of the version space can be extended to include weights with non-zero training error, so the BPM can handle data that is not linearly separable.",
        "Also, although we only presented an algorithm for linear classifiers (parameterized by the weights), arbitrary kernels can be applied to BPM to allow non-linear decision boundaries.",

        "Additional features are created by conjoining each of these features with the direction of the dependency (i.e. is the parent to the left or right of the child) and a quantized measure of the distance between the two tokens.",

        "For Chinese, we truncate words longer than a single character to the first character.3 Experimental results on the development test set suggested that an alternative strategy, truncation of words longer than two characters to the first two characters, yielded slightly worse results.",
        "The Arabic data is annotated with gold-standard morphological information, including information about stems.",
        "It is also annotated with the output of an automatic morphological analyzer, so that researchers can experiment with Arabic without first needing to build these components.",

        "For example, for English we have 8,684,328 whereas they report 6,998,447 features.",
        "We suspect that this is mostly due to differences in implementation of the features that backoff to stems.",

        "A convention appears to have arisen when reporting dependency accuracy to give results for English excluding punctuation (i.e., ignoring punctuation tokens in the output of the parser) and to report results for Czech including punctuation.",
        "In order to facilitate comparison of the present results with previously published results, we present measures including and excluding punctuation for all four languages.",

        "Although the Prague Czech Dependency Treebank is much larger than the English Penn Treebank, all measurements are lower than the corresponding measurements for English.",

        "This difference is perhaps partly attributable to the use of oracle part-of-speech tags.",
        "However, we suspect that the major contributor to this difference is the part-of-speech tag set.",
        "The tags used in the English Penn Treebank encode traditional lexical categories such as noun, preposition, and verb.",
        "They also encode morphological information such as person (the VBZ tag for example is used for verbs that are third person, present tense–typically with the suffix -s), tense, number and degree of comparison.",
        "The part-of-speech tag sets used for the other languages encode lexical categories, but do not encode morphological information.5 With small amounts of data, the perceptrons do not encounter sufficient instances of each lexical item to calculate reliable weights.",
