        "In recent years the development of spoken dialogue tutoring systems has become more prevalent, in an attempt to close the performance gap between human and computer tutors (Mostow and Aist, 2001; Pon-Barry et al., 2004; Litman et al., 2006).",
        "Student learning is a primary metric for evaluating the performance of these systems; it can be measured, e.g., by comparing student pretests taken prior to system use with posttests taken after system use.",
        "In other types of spoken dialogue systems, the user’s subjective judgments about using the system are often considered a primary system performance metric; e.g., user satisfaction has been measured via surveys which ask users to rate systems during use along dimensions such as task ease, speech input/output quality, user expectations and expertise, and user future use (M¨oller, 2005b; Walker et al., 2002; Bonneau-Maynard et al., 2000; Walker et al., 2000; Shriberg et al., 1992).",
        "However, it is expensive to run experiments over large numbers of users to obtain reliable system performance measures.",
        "The PARADISE model (Walker et al., 1997) proposes instead to predict system performance, using parameters representing interaction costs and benefits between system and user, including task success, dialogue efficiency, and dialogue quality.",
        "More formally, a set of interaction parameters are measured in a spoken dialogue system corpus, then used in a multivariate linear regression to predict the target performance variable.",
        "The resulting model is described by the formula below, where there are n interaction parameters, pi, each weighted by the analysis with a coefficient, wi, which will be negative or positive, depending on whether the model treats pi as a cost or benefit, respectively.",
        "The model can then be used to estimate performance during system design, with the design goals of minimizing costs and maximizing benefits."

        "We train and test predictive models of these metrics on multiple system corpora.",
        "To predict user satisfaction, we use 2 types of interaction parameters: 1) system-generic parameters such as used in other PARADISE applications, e.g. speech recognition performance, and 2) tutoring-specific parameters, e.g. student correctness.",
