        "Document clustering is one of the oldest and most studied problems of information retrieval (van Rij sbergen, 1979).",
        "Almost all document clustering approaches to date have represented documents as vectors in a bag-of-words vector space model, where each dimension of a document vector corresponds to a term in the corpus (Salton and McGill, 1983).",
        "General clustering algorithms are then applied to these vectors to cluster the given corpus.",
        "There have been attempts to use bigrams or even higher-order n-grams to represent documents in text categorization, the supervised counterpart of document clustering, with little success (Caropreso et al., 2001; Tan et al., 2002).",
        "Clustering can be viewed as partitioning a set of data objects into groups such that the similarities between the objects in a same group is high while intergroup similarities are weaker.",
        "The fundamental assumption in this work is that the documents that are likely to have been generated from similar language models are likely to be in the same cluster.",
        "Under this assumption, we propose a new representation for document vectors specifically designed for clustering purposes.",
        "Given a corpus, we are interested in the generation probabilities of a document based on the language models induced by other documents in the corpus.",
        "Using these probabilities, we propose a vector representation where each dimension of a document vector corresponds to a document in the corpus instead of a term in the classical representation.",
        "In other words, our document vectors are -dimensional, where is the number of documents in the corpus to be clustered.",
        "For the vector of document , the th element of is closely related to the generation probability of based on the language model induced by document .",
        "The main steps of our method are as follows: For each ordered document pair in a given corpus, we compute the generation probability of from the language model induced by making use of language-model approaches in information retrieval (Ponte and Croft, 1998).",
        "We represent each document by a vector of its generation probabilities based on other documents’ language models.",
        "At this point, these vectors can be used in any clustering algorithm instead of the traditional term-based document vectors.",
        "Following (Kurland and Lee, 2005), our new document vectors are used to construct the underlying generation graph; the directed graph where documents are the nodes and link weights are proportional to the generation probabilities.",
        "We use restricted random walk probabilities to reinforce the generation probabilities and discover hidden relationships in the graph that are not obvious by the generation links.",
        "Our random walk model is similar to the one proposed by Harel and Kohen We propose a new document vector representation specifically designed for the document clustering task.",
        "Instead of the traditional term-based vectors, a document is represented as an dimensional vector, where is the number of documents in the cluster.",
        "The value at each dimension of the vector is closely related to the generation probability based on the language model of the corresponding document.",
        "Inspired by the recent graph-based NLP methods, we reinforce the generation probabilities by iterating random walks on the underlying graph representation.",

        "This is similar to the smoothing effect in NLP problems such as parsing.",
        "Second, smoothing has an - like effect that accounts for the generation probabilities of the common terms in the corpus.",

        "If we use Equation 1, we end up having unnatural probabilities which are irrepresentably small and cause floating point underflow.",
        "More importantly, longer documents tend to have much smaller generation probabilities no matter how closely related they are to the generating language model.",
        "However, as we are interested in the generation probabilities between all pairs of documents, we want to be able to compare two different generation probabilities from a fixed language model regardless of the target document sizes.",
        "This is not a problem in the classical document retrieval setting since the given query is fixed, and generation probabilities for different queries are not compared against each other.",
        "To address these problems, following (Lavrenko et al., 2002; Kurland and Lee, 2005), we “flatten” the probabilities by normalizing them with respect to the document size: flat (2) where is the number of terms in .",

        "Second, graph-based inference techniques to discover “hidden” textual relationships like the one we explored in our random walk model have been successfully applied to other NLP problems such as summarization (Erkan and Radev, 2004; Mihalcea and Ta-rau, 2004; Zha, 2002), prepositional phrase attachment (Toutanova et al., 2004), and word sense disambiguation (Mihalcea, 2005).",

        "Their link weight function is based on cosine similarity.",
        "Our graph construction based on generation probabilities is inherited from (Kurland and Lee, 2005), where authors used a similar generation graph to rerank the documents returned by a retrieval system based on the stationary distribution of the graph.",

        "Our step random walk approach is similar to the one proposed by Harel and Koren (2001).",

        "Our contribution in this paper is to use their approach on textual data by using generation links, and extend the method to directed graphs.",
        "There is an extensive amount of research on document clustering or clustering algorithms in general that we can not possibly review here.",

        "We explain some popular clustering algorithms and evaluate our representation using them in Section 4.",

        "The information-theoretic clustering algorithms are relevant to our framework in the sense that they involve probability distributions over words just like the language models.",
