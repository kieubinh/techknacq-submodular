        "Use of topic-based models of dialogue has played a role in information retrieval (Oard et al., 2004), information extraction (Baufaden, 2001), and summarization (Zechner, 2001).",

      "heading": "2 Previous Work",
      "text": [
        "Existing topic segmentation approaches can be loosely classified into two types: (1) lexical cohesion models, and (2) content-oriented models.",
        "The underlying assumption in lexical cohesion models is that a shift in term distribution signals a shift in topic (Halliday and Hassan, 1976).",
        "The best known algorithm based on this idea is TextTiling (Hearst, 1997).",
        "In TextTiling, a sliding window is passed over the vector-space representation of the text.",
        "At each position, the cosine correlation between the upper and lower region of the sliding window is compared with that of the peak cosine correlation values to the left and right of the window.",
        "A segment boundary is predicted when the magnitude of the difference exceeds a threshold.",
        "One drawback to relying on term co-occurrence to signal topic continuity is that synonyms or related terms are treated as thematically-unrelated.",
        "One solution to this problem is using a dimensionality reduction technique such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer and Dumais, 1997).",
        "Two such algorithms for segmentation are described in (Foltz, 1998) and (Olney and Cai, 2005).",
        "Both TextTiling and Foltz’s approach measure coherence as a function of the repetition of thematically-related terms.",
        "TextTiling looks for co-occurrences of terms or term-stems and Foltz uses LSA to measure semantic relatedness between terms.",
        "Olney and Cai’s orthonormal basis approach also uses LSA, but allows a richer representation of discourse coherence, which is that coherence is a function of how much new information a discourse unit (e.g. a dialogue contribution) adds (informativity) and how relevant it is to the local context (relevance) (Olney and Cai, 2005).",
        "Content-oriented models, such as (Barzilay and Lee, 2004), rely on the re-occurrence of patterns of topics over multiple realizations of thematically similar discourses, such as a series of newspaper articles about similar events.",
        "Their approach utilizes a hidden Markov model where states correspond to topics, and state transition probabilities correspond to topic shifts.",
        "To obtain the desired",
        "number of topics (states), text spans of uniform length (individual contributions, in our case) are clustered.",
        "Then, state emission probabilities are induced using smoothed cluster-specific language models.",
        "Transition probabilities are induced by considering the proportion of documents in which a contribution assigned to the source cluster (state) immediately precedes a contribution assigned to the target cluster (state).",
        "Using an EM-like Viterbi approach, each contribution is reassigned to the state most likely to have generated it."

      "text": [
        "We will demonstrate that lexical cohesion alone does not adequately mark topic boundaries in dialogue.",
        "Nevertheless, it can provide one meaningful source of evidence towards segmenting dialogue.",
        "In our hybrid Museli approach, we combined lexical cohesion with features that have the potential to capture something about the linguistic style that marks shifts in topic: word-unigrams, word-bigrams, and POS-bigrams for the current and previous contributions; the inclusion of at least one non-stopword term (contribution of content); time difference between contributions; contribution length; and the agent role of the previous and current contribution.",
        "We cast the segmentation problem as a binary classification problem where each contribution is classified as NEW_TOPIC if the contribution introduces a new topic and SAME _TOPIC otherwise.",
        "We found that using a Naïve Bayes classifier (John & Langley, 1995) with an attribute selection wrapper using the chi-square test for ranking attributes performed better than other state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, perhaps because of the evidence integration oriented nature of the problem.",
        "We conducted our evaluation using 10- fold cross-validation, being careful not to include instances from the same dialogue in both the training and test sets on any fold so that the results we report would not be biased by idiosyncratic communicative patterns associated with individual conversational participants picked up by the trained model.",
        "Using the complete set of features enumerated above, we perform feature selection on the training data for each fold of the cross-validation separately, training a model with the top 1000 features, and applying that trained model to the test data.",
        "Examples of high ranking features confirm our intuition that contributions that begin new topic segments are syntactically marked.",
        "For example, many typical selected word bigrams were indicative of imperatives, such as lets-do, do-the, ok-lets, ok-try, lets-see, etc.",
        "Others included time oriented discourse markers such as now, then, next, etc.",
        "To capitalize on differences in conversational behavior between participants assigned to different roles in the conversation (i.e., student and tutor in our evaluation corpora), we learn separate models for each role in the conversation1.",
        "This decision is based on the observation that participants with different agent-roles introduce topics with a different frequency, introduce different types of topics, and may introduce topics in a different style that displays their status in the conversation.",
        "For instance, a tutor may introduce new topics with a contribution that ends with an imperative.",
        "A student may introduce new topics with a contribution that ends with a wh-question."

        "The second corpus is a locally collected corpus of thermodynamics tutoring dialogues, which we refer to as the Thermo corpus.",
        "This corpus is particularly appropriate for addressing the research question of how to automatically segment dialogue for two reasons: First, the exploratory task that students and tutors engaged in together is more loosely structured than many task oriented domains typically investigated in the dialogue community, such as flight reservation or meeting scheduling.",
        "Second, because the tutor and student play asymmetric roles in the interaction, this corpus allows us to explore",
        "how conversational role affects how speakers mark topic shifts.",
        "Table 1 presents statistics describing characteristics of these two corpora.",
        "Similar to (Passonneau and Litman, 1993), we adopt a flat model of topic-segmentation for our gold standard based on discourse segment purpose, where a shift in topic corresponds to a shift in purpose that is acknowledged and acted upon by both conversational agents.",
        "We evaluated inter-coder reliability over 10% of the Thermo corpus mentioned above.",
        "3 annotators were given a 10 page coding manual with explanation of our informal definition of shared discourse segment purpose as well as examples of segmented dialogues.",

        "Barzilay and Lee’s approach is the state of the art in modeling topic shifts in monologue text.",
        "Our application of B&L to dialogue attempts to harness any existing and recognizable redundancy in topic-flow across our dialogues for the purpose of topic segmentation.",
        "We chose TextTiling for its seminal contribution to monologue segmentation.",
        "TextTiling and Foltz consider lexical cohesion as their only evidence of topic shifts.",
        "Applying these approaches to dialogue segmentation sheds light on how term distribution in dialogue differs from that of expository monologue text (e.g. news articles).",
        "The Foltz and Ortho approaches require a trained LSA space, which we prepared as described in (Olney and Cai, 2005).",
        "Any parameter tuning for approaches other than our hybrid approach was computed over the entire test set, giving competing algorithms the maximum advantage.",
        "In addition to these approaches, we include segmentation results from three degenerate approaches: (1) classifying all contributions as NEW _TOPIC (ALL), (2) classifying no contributions as NEW_TOPIC (NONE), and (3) classifying contributions as NEW_TOPIC at uniform intervals (EVEN), corresponding to the average reference topic length (see Table 1).",
        "As a means for comparison, we adopt two evaluation metrics: Pk and f-measure.",
        "An extensive argument of Pk’s robustness (if k is set to 1/2 the average reference topic length) is present in (Beeferman, et al.",
        "1999).",
        "Pk measures the probability of misclassifying two contributions a distance of k contributions apart, where the classification question is are the two contributions part of the same topic segment or not?",
        "Lower Pk values are preferred over higher ones.",
        "It equally captures the effect of false-negatives and false-positives and it favors near misses.",

        "each dialogue contribution contains an average of 28 words.",
        "Thus, the vector space representation of the dialogue contributions is much more sparse in the Thermo corpus, which makes shifts in lexical coherence less reliable as topic shift indicators.",
