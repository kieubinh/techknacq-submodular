        "It is well known that utterances convey information about the speaker in addition to their semantic content.",
        "One such type of information consists of cues to the speaker’s personality traits, typically assessed along five dimensions known as the Big Five (Norman, 1963):",
        ".",
        "Extraversion (sociability, assertiveness) .",
        "Emotional stability (vs. neuroticism) .",
        "Agreeableness to other people (friendliness) .",
        "Conscientiousness (discipline) .",
        "Intellect (openness to experience)",
        "Findings include that extraverts talk more, louder, and faster, with fewer pauses and hesitations, and more informal language (Scherer, 1979; Furnham, 1990; Heylighen and Dewaele, 2002; Gill and Ober-lander, 2002).",
        "Neurotics use more 1st person singular pronouns and negative emotion words, while conscientious people avoid negations and negative emotion words (Pennebaker and King, 1999).",
        "The use of words related to insight and the avoidance of",
        "past tense indicate intellect, and swearing and negative emotion words mark disagreeableness.",
        "Correlations are higher in spoken language, possibly especially in informal conversation (Mehl et al., in press).",
        "Previous work has modeled emotion and personality in virtual agents, and classified emotions from actor’s speech (Andr´e et al., 1999; Liscombe et al., 2003).",
        "However, to our knowledge no one has tested whether it is possible to automatically recognize personality from conversation extracts of unseen subjects.",
        "Our hypothesis is that automatic analysis of conversation to detect personality has application in a wide range of language processing domains.",
        "Identification of leaders using personality dimensions could be useful in analyzing meetings and the conversations of suspected terrorists (Hogan et al., 1994; Tucker and Whittaker, 2004; Nunn, 2005).",
        "Dating websites could analyze text messages to try to match personalities and increase the chances of a successful relationship (Donnellan et al., 2004).",
        "Dialogue systems could adapt to the user’s personality, like humans do (Reeves and Nass, 1996; Funder and Sneed, 1993).",
        "This work is a first step toward individual adaptation in dialogue systems.",
        "We present non-linear statistical models for ranking utterances based on the Big Five personality traits.",
        "Results show that the models perform significantly better than a random baseline, and that prosodic features are good indicators of extraver-sion.",

        "To preserve the participants’ privacy, random bits of conversation were recorded, and only the participants’ utterances were transcribed, making it impossible to reconstruct whole conversations.",

        "In an attempt to capture initiative-taking in conversation (Walker and Whittaker, 1990; Furnham, 1990), we introduce utterance type features using heuristics on the parse tree to tag each utterance as a command, prompt, question or assertion.",
        "Overall tagging accuracy over 100 randomly selected utterances is 88%.",

        "To evaluate how each feature set contributes to the final result, we trained models with the full feature set and with each set individually.",
        "Results are summarized in Table 3.",
        "The baseline is a model ranking extracts randomly, producing a ranking error of 0.5 on average.",
        "Results are averaged over a 10 fold cross-validation.",
        "Paired t-tests show that models of extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness and intellect using all features are better than the random ordering baseline (two-tailed, p < 0.05)1.",
        "Emotional stability is the most difficult trait to model, while agreeableness",
        "and conscientiousness produce the best results, with ranking errors of 0.31 and 0.33 respectively.",
        "Table 3 shows that LIWC features perform significantly better than the baseline for all dimensions but emotional stability, while emotional stability is best predicted by MRC features.",

        "The feature labels are in Table 2.",
        "For example, the model of extraversion confirms previous findings by associating this trait with a high speech rate (Rules 1 and 4) and longer conversations (Rule 5).",
        "But many new markers emerge: extraverts speak with a high pitch (Rules 2, 6 and 7), while introverts’ pitch varies a lot (Rules 15, 18 and 20).",
        "Agreeable people use longer words but shorter sentences (Rule 1 and 20), while swear words reduce the agreeableness score (Rules 12, 18 and 19).",

      "text": [
        "We showed that personality can be recognized automatically in conversation.",
        "To our knowledge, this is the first report of experiments testing trained models on unseen subjects.",
        "There are models for each dimension that perform significantly better than the baseline.",
        "Combinations of these models may be useful to identify important personality types in different NLP applications, e.g. a combination of extraversion, emotional stability and intellect indicates leadership, while low intellect, extraversion and agreeableness are correlated with perceptions of trustworthiness.",
        "One limitation for applications involving speech recognition is that recognition errors will introduce noise in all features except prosodic features, and prosodic features on their own are only effective in the extraversion model.",
        "However, our data set is relatively small (96 subjects) so we expect that more",
        "training data would improve model accuracies and might also make additional features useful.",
        "In future work, we plan to integrate these models in a dialogue system to adapt the system’s language generation; we will then be able to test whether the accuracies we achieve are sufficient and explore methods for improving them."
