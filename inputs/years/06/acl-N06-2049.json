        "The character-based “IOB” tagging approach has been widely used in Chinese word segmentation recently (Xue and Shen, 2003; Peng and McCallum, 2004; Tseng et al., 2005).",
        "Under the scheme, each character of a word is labeled as ‘B’ if it is the first character of a multiple-character word, or ‘O’ if the character functions as an independent word, or ‘I’ otherwise.” For example, ” (whole) (Beijing city)” is labeled as ” (whole)/O (north)/B (capital)/I (city)/I”.",
        "We found that so far all the existing implementations were using character-based IOB tagging.",
        "In this work we propose a subword-based IOB tagging, which assigns tags to a predefined lexicon subset consisting of the most frequent multiple-character words in addition to single Chinese characters.",
        "If only Chinese characters are used, the subword-based IOB tagging is downgraded into a character-based one.",
        "Taking the same example mentioned above, “ (whole) (Beijing city)” is labeled as” (whole)/O (Beijing)/B (city)/I” in the subword-based tagging, where ” (Beijing)/B” is labeled as one unit.",
        "We will give a detailed description of this approach in Section 2.",
        "* Now the second author is affiliated with NTT.",
        "In addition, we found a clear weakness with the IOB tagging approach: It yields a very low in-vocabulary (IV) rate (R-iv) in return for a higher out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rate (R-oov).",
        "In the results of the closed test in Bakeoff 2005 (Emerson, 2005), the work of (Tseng et al., 2005), using conditional random fields (CRF) for the IOB tagging, yielded very high R-oovs in all of the four corpora used, but the R-iv rates were lower.",
        "While OOV recognition is very important in word segmentation, a higher IV rate is also desired.",
        "In this work we propose a confidence measure approach to lessen the weakness.",
        "By this approach we can change R-oovs and R-ivs and find an optimal tradeoff.",
        "This approach will be described in Section 2.2.",
        "In the followings, we illustrate our word segmentation process in Section 2, where the subword-based tagging is implemented by the CRFs method.",
        "Section 3 presents our experimental results.",
        "Section 4 describes current state-of-the-art methods for Chinese word segmentation, with which our results were compared.",
