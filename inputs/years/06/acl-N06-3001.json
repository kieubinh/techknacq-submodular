        "In human communication, ideas tend to unfold in a structured way.",
        "For example, for an individual speaker, he/she organizes his/her utterances into sentences.",
        "When a speaker makes errors in the dynamic speech production process, he/she may correct these errors using a speech repair scheme.",
        "A group of speakers in a meeting organize their utterances by following a floor control scheme.",
        "All these structures are helpful for building better models of human communication but are not explicit in the spontaneous speech or the corresponding transcription word string.",
        "In order to utilize these structures, it is necessary to first detect them, and to do so as efficiently as possible.",
        "Utilization of various kinds of knowledge is important; For example, lexical and prosodic knowledge (Liu, 2004; Liu et al., 2005) have been used to detect structural events.",
        "Human communication tends to utilize not only speech but also visual cues such as gesture, gaze, and so on.",
        "Some studies (McNeill, 1992; Cassell and Stone, 1999) suggest that gesture and speech stem from a single underlying mental process, and they are related both temporally and semantically.",
        "Gestures play an important role in human communication but use quite different expressive mechanisms than spoken language.",
        "Gaze has been found to be widely used in coordinating multi-party conversations (Argyle and Cook, 1976; Novick, 2005).",
        "Given the close relationship between non-verbal cues and speech and the special expressive capacity of non-verbal cues, we believe that these cues are likely to provide additional important information that can be exploited when modeling structural events.",
        "Hence, in my Ph.D thesis, I have been investigating the combination of lexical, prosodic, and non-verbal cues for detection of the following structural events: sentence units, speech repairs, and meeting floor control.",

        "To improve the speed of producing a corpus while maintaining its quality, we have investigated factors impacting the accuracy of the forced alignment of transcriptions to audio files (Chen et al., 2004a).",
        "Meetings, in which several participants communicate with each other, play an important role in our daily life but increase the challenges to current information processing techniques.",
        "Understanding human multimodal communicative behavior, and how witting and unwitting visual displays (e.g., gesture, head orientation, gaze) relate to spoken content is critical to the analysis of meetings.",
        "These multimodal behaviors may reveal static and dynamic social structure of the meeting participants, the flow of topics being discussed, the control of floor of the meeting, and so on.",
        "For this purpose, we have been collecting a multimodal meeting corpus under the sponsorship of ARDA VACE II (Chen et al., 2005).",
        "In a room equipped with synchronized multichannel audio,video and motion-tracking recording devices, participants (from 5 to 8 civilian, military, or mixed) engage in planning exercises, such as managing rocket launch emergency, exploring a foreign weapon component, and collaborating to select awardees for fellowships.",
        "we have collected and continued to do multichannel time synchronized audio and video recordings.",
        "Using a series of audio and video processing techniques, we obtain the word transcriptions and prosodic features, as well as head, torso and hand 3D tracking traces from visual trackers and Vicon motion capture device.",

        "In the dynamic speech production process, speakers may make errors or totally change the content of what is being expressed.",
        "In either of these cases, speakers need refocus or revise what they are saying",
        "and therefore speech repairs appear in overt speech.",
        "A typical speech repair contains a reparandum, an optional editing phrase, and a correction.",
        "Based on the relationship between the reparandum and the correction, speech repairs can be classified into three types: repetitions, content replacements, and false starts.",
        "Since utterance content has been modified in last two repair types, we call them content modification (CM) repairs.",
        "We carried out a measurement study (Chen et al., 2002) to identify patterns of gestures that co-occur with speech repairs that can be exploited by a multimodal processing system to more effectively process spontaneous speech.",
        "We observed that modification gestures (MGs), which exhibit a change in gesture state during speech repair, have a high correlation with content modification (CM) speech repairs, but rarely occur with content repetitions.",
        "This study does not only provide evidence that gesture and speech are tightly linked in production, but also provides evidence that gestures provide an important additional cue for identifying speech repairs and their types."

        "It can be either a complete sentence or a semantically complete smaller unit.",
        "We have conducted an experiment that integrates lexical, prosodic and gestural cues in order to more effectively detect sentence unit boundaries in conversational dialog (Chen et al., 2004b).",
        "As can be seen in Figure 2, our multimodal model combines lexical, prosodic, and gestural knowledge sources, with each knowledge source implemented as a separate model.",
        "A hidden event language model (LM) was trained to serve as lexical model (P (W, E)).",
        "Using a direct modeling approach (Shriberg and Stolcke, 2004), prosodic features were extracted using the SRI prosodic feature extraction tool1 by collaborators at ICSI and then were used to train a CART decision tree as the prosodic model (P(EIF)).",
        "Similarly to the prosodic model, we computed gesture features directly from visual tracking measurements (Quek et al., 1999; Bryll et al., 2001): 3D hand position, Hold (a state when there is no hand motion beyond some adaptive",
        "threshold results), and Effort (analogous to the kinetic energy of hand movement).",
        "Using gestural features, we trained a CART tree to serve as the gestural model (P(EIG)).",
        "Finally, an HMM based model combination scheme was used to integrate predictions from individual models to obtain an overall SU prediction (argmax(EIW, F, G)).",
        "In our investigations, we found that gesture features complement the prosodic and lexical knowledge sources; by using all of the knowledge sources, the model is able to achieve the lowest overall detection error rate."
