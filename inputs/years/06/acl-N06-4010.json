        "The approach to factoid question answering (QA) that we adopt was first described in (Whittaker et al., 2005b) where the details of the mathematical model and how it was trained for English were given.",
        "The approach has been successfully evaluated in the 2005 text retrieval conference (TREC) question answering track evaluations (Voorhees and Trang Dang, 2005) where our group placed eleventh out of thirty participants (Whittaker et al., 2005a).",
        "Although the TREC QA task is substantially different to web-based QA this evaluation showed that our approach works and provides an objective assessment of its quality.",
        "Similarly, for our Japanese language system we have evaluated the performance of our approach on the NTCIR-3 QAC-1 task (Whittaker et al., 2005c).",
        "Although our Japanese experiments were applied retrospectively, the results would have placed us in the midrange of participating systems.",
        "In (Whittaker et al., 2006b) we described how our approach could be used for the rapid development of web-based QA systems in five very different languages.",
        "It was shown that a developer proficient with the tools, and with access to suitable training data, could build a system in a new language in around 10 hours.",
        "In (Whittaker et al., 2006a) we evaluated the performance of the systems for four of our five languages.",
        "We give a brief summary of our approach to QA in Section 2.",

        "In this paper we describe the web and mobile-phone interfaces to our multi-language factoid question answering (QA) system together with a prototype speech interface to our English-language QA system.",
        "Using a statistical, data-driven approach to factoid question answering has allowed us to develop QA systems in five languages in a matter of months.",
        "In the web-based system, which is accessible at http: //asked.",
        "jp, we have combined the QA system output with standard search-engine-like results by integrating it with an open-source web search engine.",
        "The prototype speech interface is based around a VoiceXML application running on the Voxeo developer platform.",
        "Recognition of the user’s question is performed on a separate speech recognition server dedicated to recognizing questions.",
        "An adapted version of the Sphinx-4 recognizer is used for this purpose.",
        "Once the question has been recognized correctly it is passed to the QA system and the resulting answers read back to the user by speech synthesis.",
        "Our approach is modular and makes extensive use of open-source software.",
        "Consequently, each component can be easily and independently improved and easily extended to other languages."

        "This is discussed in Section 4.",
        "There are several other QA systems on the web including Brainboost (Brainboost, 2005) and Lexxe (Lexxe, 2005) but they only try to answer questions in English and do not have convenient mobile interfaces.",
        "Entering whole questions rather than just keywords is tedious especially on a mobile-phone so we have also begun to look at speech interfaces.",
        "In this paper we describe a prototype speech interface to our English-language QA system.",
        "This prototype is currently intended primarily as a platform for further research into speech recognition and answering of questions from an acoustic modelling point-of-view (e.g. low-bandwidth, low-quality VoIP channel), from a language modelling perspective (e.g. irregular word order in questions vs. text, and very large out-of-vocabulary problem) and also in terms of dialog modelling.",
        "There have been several attempts at speech interfaces to QA systems in the literature e.g. (Schofield and Zheng, 2003) but as far as we know ours is the only system that is publicly accessible.",

        "The answer to a question depends primarily on the question itself but also on many other factors such as the person asking the question, the location of the person, what questions the person has asked before, and so on.",
        "For simplicity, we choose to consider only the dependence of an answer on the question .",
        "In particular, we hypothesize that the answer depends on two sets of features extracted from : and as follows:",
        "where can be thought of as a set of features describing the “question-type” part of such as who, when, where, which, etc.",
        "and is a set of features comprising the “information-bearing” part of i.e. what the question is actually about and what it refers to.",
        "For example, in the questions, Where is Mount Everest?",
        "and How high is Mount Everest?",
        "the information-bearing component is identical in both cases whereas the question-type component is different.",
        "Finding the best answer involves a search over all for the one which maximizes the probability of the above model: This is guaranteed to give us the optimal answer in a maximum likelihood sense if the probability distribution is the correct one.",
        "Making various conditional independence assumptions to simplify modelling we obtain the final optimisation criterion: The model is essentially a language model which models the probability of an answer sequence given a set of information-bearing features .",
        "It models the proximity of to features in .",
        "This model is referred to as the retrieval model.",
        "The model matches an answer with features in the question-type set .",
        "Roughly speaking this model relates ways of asking a question with classes of valid answers.",
        "For example, it associates names of people or companies with who-type questions.",
        "In general, there are many valid and equiprobable for a given so this component can only re-rank candidate answers retrieved by the retrieval model.",

        "In Figure 1 we show the results page for the question “How high is Mount Everest?”.",
        "As can be seen",
        "the left-hand side of the page contains the familiar title, link and summaries of pages relevant to the query that is common to most of today’s web search engines.",

        "Each answer can also be clicked on whereupon the user is redirected to the page from which the answer was taken.",
        "This redirection is effected through a redirect via our own web-server so that for a given question we can see which answers were clicked on.",

        "The only requirement for being able to use the mobile phone interface is that the phone must contain an HTML browser.",
        "In countries like Japan this has been fairly standard for many years but it is expected that this will become more common worldwide in the near future with the continued roll-out of 3G mobile phone services.",
        "For the mobile-phone interface the standard web-search results section has been removed entirely from the results section and instead only the top 20 short answers are displayed without pop-up boxes or corresponding context.",
        "Such a strategy minimizes the number of bytes transmitted and ensures that most answers are adequately displayed on most mobile-phone interfaces with a minimum amount of scrolling.",
        "Although not yet implemented we aim to allow users to click on an answer and be taken to the part of the page that contains the answer rather than loading a whole page which could sometimes be several megabytes in size."

        "The speech recognizer we use is the open-source Sphinx-4 recognizer (Walker et al., 2004) which runs in a server mode and has been adapted to use more complex LMs than those permitted by the default ARPA format word gram LMs.",
        "Currently we use a linear interpolation of a word and class-based trigram LM each of which were trained on a large corpus of English-language questions (Hallmarks, 2002) – the same data used to train the English-language QA system (Whittaker et al., 2005b)."
