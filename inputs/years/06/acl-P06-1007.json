        "The main purpose of the current study is to investigate the extent to which a probabilistic part-of-speech (POS) tagger can correctly model human sentence processing data.",
        "Syntactically ambiguous sentences have been studied in great depth in psycholinguistics because the pattern of ambiguity resolution provides a window onto the human sentence processing mechanism (HSPM).",
        "Prima facie it seems unlikely that such a tagger will be adequate, because almost all previous researchers have assumed, following standard linguistic theory, that a formally adequate account of recursive syntactic structure is an essential component of any model of the behaviour.",
        "In this study, we tested a bigram POS tagger on different types of structural ambiguities and (as a sanity check) to the well-known asymmetry of subject and object relative clause processing.",
        "Theoretically, the garden-path effect is defined as processing difficulty caused by reanalysis.",
        "Empirically, it is attested as comparatively slower reading time or longer eye fixation at a disambiguating region in an ambiguous sentence compared to its control sentences (Frazier and Rayner, 1982; Trueswell, 1996).",
        "That is, the garden-path effect detected in many human studies, in fact, is measured through a “comparative” method.",
        "This characteristic of the sentence processing research design is reconstructed in the current study using a probabilistic POS tagging system.",
        "Under the assumption that larger probability decrease indicates slower reading time, the test results suggest that the probabilistic POS tagging system can predict reading time penalties at the disambiguating region of garden-path sentences compared to that of non-garden-path sentences (i.e. control sentences)."

        "The statistical POS tagger was surprisingly effective in modeling sentence processing data, given the locality of the probability distribution.",
        "The findings in this study provide an alternative account for the garden-path effect observed in empirical studies, specifically, that the slower processing times associated with garden-path sentences are due in part to their relatively unlikely POS sequences in comparison with those of non-garden-path sentences and in part to differences in the emission probabilities that the tagger learns.",
        "One attractive future direction is to carry out simulations that compare the evolution of probabilities in the tagger with that in a theoretically more powerful model trained on the same data, such as an incremental statistical parser (Kim et al., 2002; Roark, 2001).",
        "In so doing we can find the places where the prediction problem faced both by the HSPM and the machines that aspire to emulate it actually warrants the greater power of structurally sensitive models, using this knowledge to mine large corpora for future experiments with human subjects.",
        "We have not necessarily cast doubt on the hypothesis that the HSPM makes crucial use of structural information, but we have demonstrated that much of the relevant behavior can be captured in a simple model.",
        "The ’structural’ regularities that we observe are reasonably well encoded into this model.",
        "For purposes of initial real-time processing it could be that the HSPM is using a similar encoding of structural regularities into convenient probabilistic or neural form.",
        "It is as yet unclear what the final form of a cognitively accurate model along these lines would be, but it is clear from our study that it is worthwhile, for the sake of clarity and explicit testability, to consider models that are simpler and more precisely specified than those assumed by dominant theories of human sentence processing."
