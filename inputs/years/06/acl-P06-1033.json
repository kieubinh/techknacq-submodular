        "It has become increasingly clear that the choice of suitable internal representations can be a very important factor in data-driven approaches to syntactic parsing, and that accuracy can often be improved by internal transformations of a given kind of representation.",
        "This is well illustrated by the Collins parser (Collins, 1997; Collins, 1999), scrutinized by Bikel (2004), where several transformations are applied in order to improve the analysis of noun phrases, coordination and punctuation.",
        "Other examples can be found in the work of Johnson (1998) and Klein and Manning (2003), which show that well-chosen transformations of syntactic representations can greatly improve the parsing accuracy obtained with probabilistic context-free grammars.",
        "In this paper, we apply essentially the same techniques to data-driven dependency parsing, specifically targeting the analysis of coordination and verb groups, two very common constructions that pose special problems for dependency-based approaches.",
        "The basic idea is that we can facilitate learning by transforming the training data for the parser and that we can subsequently recover the original representations by applying an inverse transformation to the parser’s output.",
        "The data used in the experiments come from the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) (Hajiˇc, 1998; Hajiˇc et al., 2001), the largest available dependency treebank, annotated according to the theory of Functional Generative Description (FGD) (Sgall et al., 1986).",
        "The parser used is MaltParser (Nivre and Hall, 2005; Nivre et al., 2006), a freely available system that combines a deterministic parsing strategy with discriminative classifiers for predicting the next parser action.",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 provides the necessary background, including a definition of dependency graphs, a discussion of different approaches to the analysis of coordination and verb groups in dependency grammar, as well as brief descriptions of PDT, MaltParser and some related work.",
        "Section 3 introduces a set of dependency graph transformations, specifically defined to deal with the dependency annotation found in PDT, which are experimentally evaluated in section 4.",
        "While the experiments reported in section 4.1 deal with pure treebank transformations, in order to establish an upper bound on what can be achieved in parsing, the experiments presented in section 4.2 examine the effects of different transformations on parsing accuracy.",
        "Finally, in section 4.3, we combine these transformations with previously proposed techniques in order to optimize overall parsing accuracy.",
        "We conclude in section 5."

The remaining dependents of the base conjunction need to be divided into conjuncts (C) and other dependents (D).",

Since there are no other dependents of a, the coordination contains no instances of the category Given this classification of the words involved in a coordination, the transformation 7-,(0) is straightforward and basically connects all the arcs in a chain.",
