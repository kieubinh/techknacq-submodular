        "Even though consistency is rated highly by human subjects, this may actually be a judgement of whether the polarity of the learned mapping is correctly placed on the 1 to 5 rating scale.",
        "Thus, alternate ways of expressing, for example foodquality=5, shown in Table 7, cannot be guaranteed to be synonymous, which may be required for use in spoken language generation.",
        "Rather, an examination of the adjectival phrases in Table 7 shows that different aspects of the food are discussed.",
        "For example ample and plentiful refer to the portion size, fancy may refer to the presentation, and delicious describes the flavors.",
        "This suggests that perhaps the ontology would benefit from representing these sub-attributes of the food attribute, and sub-attributes in general.",
        "Another problem with consistency is that the same AP, e.g. very good in Table 7 may appear with multiple ratings.",
        "For example, very good is used for every foodquality rating from 2 to 5.",
        "Thus some further automatic or by-hand analysis is required to refine what is learned before actual use in spoken language generation.",
        "Still, our method could reduce the amount of time a system designer spends developing the spoken language generator, and increase the naturalness of spoken language generation.",
        "Another issue is that the recall appears to be quite low given that all of the sentences concern the same domain: only 2.4% of the sentences could be used to create the mappings.",
        "One way to increase recall might be to automatically augment the list of distinguished attribute lexicalizations, using WordNet or work on automatic identification of synonyms, such as (Lin and Pantel, 2001).",
        "However, the method here has high precision, and automatic techniques may introduce noise.",
        "A related issue is that the filters are in some cases too strict.",
        "For example the contextual filter is based on POS-tags, so that sentences that do not require the prior context for their interpretation are eliminated, such as sentences containing subordinating conjunctions like because, when, if, whose arguments are both given in the same sentence (Prasad et al., 2005).",
        "In addition, recall is affected by the domain ontology, and the automatically constructed domain ontology from the review webpages may not cover all of the domain.",
        "In some review domains, the attributes that get individual ratings are a limited subset of the domain ontology.",
        "Techniques for automatic feature identification (Hu and Liu, 2005; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005) could possibly help here, although these techniques currently have the limitation that they do not automatically identify different lexicalizations of the same feature.",
        "A different type of limitation is that dialogue systems need to generate utterances for information gathering whereas the mappings we obtained",
        "can only be used for information presentation.",
        "Thus these would have to be constructed by hand, as in current practice, or perhaps other types of corpora or resources could be utilized.",
        "In addition, the utility of syntactic structures in the mappings should be further examined, especially given the failures in DSyntS conversion.",
        "An alternative would be to leave some sentences unparsed and use them as templates with hybrid generation techniques (White and Caldwell, 1998).",
        "Finally, while we believe that this technique will apply across domains, it would be useful to test it on domains such as movie reviews or product reviews, which have more complex domain ontologies."
