        "Recently, there has been burgeoning interest in the computational construction of genetic language taxonomies (Dyen et al., 1992; Nerbonne and Heeringa, 1997; Kondrak, 2002; Ringe et al., 2002; Benedetto et al., 2002; McMahon and McMahon, 2003; Gray and Atkinson, 2003; Nakleh et al., 2005).",
        "One common approach to building language taxonomies is to ascribe language-language distances, and then use a generic algorithm to construct a tree which explains these distances as much as possible.",
        "Two questions arise with this approach.",
        "The first asks what aspects of languages are important in measuring inter-language distance.",
        "The second asks how to measure distance given these aspects.",
        "A more traditional approach to building language taxonomies (Dyen et al., 1992) answers these questions in terms of cognates.",
        "A word in language A is said to be cognate with word in language B if the forms shared a common ancestor in the parent language of A and B.",
        "In the cognate-counting method, inter-language distance depends on the lexical forms of the languages.",
        "The distance between two languages is a function of the number or fraction of these forms which are cognate between the two languages1.",
        "This approach to building language taxonomies is hard to implement in toto because constructing ancestor forms is not easily automatable.",
        "More recent approaches, such as Kondrak’s (2002) and Heggarty et al’s (2005) work on dialect comparison, take the synchronic word forms themselves as the language aspect to be compared.",
        "Variations on edit distance (see Kessler (2005) for a survey) are then used to evaluate differences between languages for each word, and these differences are aggregated to give a distance between languages or dialects as a whole.",
        "This approach is largely automatable, although some methods do require human intervention.",
        "In this paper, we present novel answers to the two questions.",
        "The features of language we will compare are not sets of words or phonological forms.",
        "Instead we compare the similarities between forms, expressed as confusion probabilities.",
        "The distribution of confusion probabilities in one language is called a lexical metric.",
        "Section 2 presents the definition of lexical metrics and some arguments for their being good language representatives for the purposes of comparison.",

        "The first question posed by the distance-based approach to genetic language taxonomy is: what should we compare?",
        "In some approaches (Kondrak, 2002; McMahon et al., 2005; Heggarty et al., 2005; Nerbonne and Heeringa, 1997), the answer to this question is that we should compare the phonetic or phonological realisations of a particular set of meanings across the range of languages being studied.",
        "There are a number of problems with using lexical forms in this way.",
        "Firstly, in order to compare forms from different languages, we need to embed them in common phonetic space.",
        "This phonetic space provides granularity, marking two phones as identical or distinct, and where there is a graded measure of phonetic distinction it measures this.",
        "There is growing doubt in the field of phonology and phonetics about the meaningfulness of assuming of a common phonetic space.",
        "Port and Leary (2005) argue convincingly that this assumption, while having played a fundamental role in much recent linguistic theorising, is nevertheless unfounded.",
        "The degree of difference between sounds, and consequently, the degree of phonetic difference between words can only be ascertained within the context of a single language.",
        "It may be argued that a common phonetic space can be found in either acoustics or degrees of freedom in the speech articulators.",
        "Language-specific categorisation of sound, however, often restructures this space, sometimes with distinct sounds being treated as homophones.",
        "One example of this is the realisation of orthographic rr in European Portuguese: it is indifferently realised with an apical or a uvular trill, different sounds made at distinct points of articulation.",
        "If there is no language-independent, common phonetic space with an equally common similarity measure, there can be no principled approach to comparing forms in one language with those of another.",
        "In contrast, language-specific word-similarity is well-founded.",
        "A number of psycholinguistic models of spoken word recognition (Luce et al., 1990) are based on the idea of lexical neighbourhoods.",
        "When a word is accessed during processing, the other words that are phonemically or orthographically similar are also activated.",
        "This effect can be detected using experimental paradigms such as priming.",

        "For example, Levenstein distance between interested and rest is six, the same as the distance between rest and by, even though the latter two have nothing in common.",
        "As a consequence, close phonetic transcriptions, which by their very nature are likely to involve more symbols per word, will result in larger edit distances than broad phonemic transcriptions of the same data.",
