        "In order to facilitate the exploitation of forms and form bigrams detected by the model, and in particular to identify causes of errors, we have developed a visualization environment.",

        "The simplest application of this idea is to look for forms, called suspicious forms, that are found more frequently in sentences that could not be parsed.",
        "This is what van Noord (2004) does, without trying to identify a suspicious form in any sentence whose parsing failed, and thus without taking into account the fact that there is (at least) one cause of error in each unparsable sentence.1 On the contrary, we will look, in each sentence on which parsing failed, for the form that has the highest probability of being the cause of this failure: it is the main suspect of the sentence.",
        "This form may be incorrectly or only partially described in the lexicon, it may take part in constructions that are not described in the grammar, or it may exemplify imperfections of the pre-syntactic processing chain.",

        "The results we present in section 4 includes this extension, as well as the previous one.",
        "Another possible generalization would be to take into account facts about the sentence that are not simultaneous (such as form unigrams and form bigrams) but mutually exclusive, and that must therefore be probabilized as well.",
