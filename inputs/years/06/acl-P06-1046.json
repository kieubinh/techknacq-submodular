        "While much slower, LSH10,000 is also much more accurate than LSH3,000, while still being much faster than NAIVE.",
        "Introducing the PLEB data structure does not improve the efficiency while incurring a small cost on accuracy.",
        "We are not using large enough datasets to show the improved time complexity using PLEB.",
        "VPT is only slightly faster slightly faster than NAIVE.",
        "This is not surprising in light of the original design of the data structure: decreasing radius search does not guarantee search efficiency.",
        "A significant influence in the speed of the randomised techniques, RI and LSH, is the fixed dimensionality.",
        "The randomised techniques use a fixed length vector which is not influenced by the size of m. The drawback of this is that the size of the vector needs to be tuned to the dataset.",
        "It would seem at first glance that HEURISTIC and SASH provide very similar results, with HEURISTIC slightly slower, but more accurate.",
        "This misses the difference in time complexity between the methods: HEURISTIC is n2 and SASH n log n. The improvement in execution time over NAIVE decreases as corpus size increases and this would be expected to continue.",
        "Further tuning of SASH parameters may improve its accuracy.",
        "RIMI produces similar result using LARGE to SASH using BNC.",
        "This does not include the cost of extracting context relations from the raw text, so the true comparison is much worse.",
        "SASH allows the free use of weight and measure functions, but RI is constrained by having to transform any context space into a RI space.",
        "This is important when",
        "considering that different tasks may require different weights and measures (Weeds and Weir, 2005).",
        "RI also suffers n2 complexity, where as SASH is n log n. Taking these into account, and that the improvements are barely significant, SASH is a better choice.",
        "The results for LSH are disappointing.",
        "It performs consistently worse than the other methods except VPT.",
        "This could be improved by using larger bit vectors, but there is a limit to the size of these as they represent a significant memory overhead, particularly as the vocabulary increases.",
        "Table 4 presents the theoretical analysis of attribute indexing.",
        "The average number of comparisons made for various cut-offs of LARGE are shown.",
        "NAIVE and INDEX are the actual values for those techniques.",
        "The values for SASH are worst case, where the maximum number of terms are compared at each level.",
        "The actual number of comparisons made will be much less.",
        "The efficiency of INDEX is sensitive to the density of attributes and increasing the cut-off increases the density.",
        "This is seen in the dramatic drop in performance as the cut-off increases.",
        "This problem of density will increase as volume of raw input data increases, further reducing its effectiveness.",
        "SASH is only dependent on the number of terms, not the density.",
        "Where the need for computationally efficiency outweighs the need for accuracy, RIMI provides better results.",
        "SASH is the most balanced of the techniques tested and provides the most scalable, high quality results."
