        "Although English terms and their equivalences in a local language refer to the same concept, they are erroneously treated as independent index units in traditional MIR.",
        "Such separation of semantically identical words in different languages may limit retrieval performance.",
        "For instance, as shown in Figure 1, there are three kinds of Chinese Web pages containing information related with “Viterbi Algorithm (韦特比算法)”.",
        "The first case contains “Viterbi Algorithm” but not its Chinese equivalence “ 韦特比算法”.",
        "The second",
        "contains “ 韦特比算法” but not “Viterbi Algorithm”.",
        "The third has both of them.",
        "A user would expect that a query with either “Viterbi Algorithm” or “韦特比算法 ” would retrieve all of these three groups of Chinese Web pages.",
        "Otherwise some potentially useful information will be ignored.",
        "Furthermore, one English term may have several corresponding terms in a different language.",
        "For instance, Korean words “디 ”, “디 ”, and “디” are found in local Web pages, which all correspond to the English word “digital” but are in different forms because of different phonetic interpretations.",
        "Establishing an equivalence class among the three Korean words and the English counterpart is indispensable.",
        "By doing so, although the query is “디 ”, the Web pages containing “디 ” , “디 ” or “digital” can be all retrieved.",
        "The same goes to Chinese terms.",
        "For example, two same semantic Chinese terms “维特比 ” and “韦特比 ” correspond to one English term “Viterbi”.",
        "There should be a semantic equivalence relation between them.",
        "Although tracing the original English term from a term in a native language by back transliteration (Jeong et al., 1999) is a good way to build such mapping, it is only applicable to the words that are amenable for transliteration based on the phoneme.",
        "It is difficult to expand the method to abbreviations and compound words.",
        "Since English abbreviations frequently appear in Korean and Chinese texts, such as “세 계 무역기 구 (WTO)” in Korean, “世界贸易 组织 (WTO)” in Chinese, it is essential in IR to have a mapping between these English abbreviations and the corresponding words.",
        "The same applies to the compound words like “서울대 (Seoul National University)” in Korean, “ 疯牛病 (mad cow disease)” in Chinese.",

        "Different from previous work on query term translation that aims at finding relevant terms in another language for the target term in source language, conceptual unification requires a high translation precision.",
        "Although the fuzzy Chinese translations (e.g. “ 病 毒 (virus), 陈 盈 豪 (designer’s name), 电脑病 毒 (computer virus)) of English term “CIH” can enhance the CLIR performance by the “query expansion” gain (Cheng et al., 2004), it does not work in the conceptual unification of terms in different languages for IR.",
        "While there are lots of additional sources to be utilized for phrase translation (e.g., anchor text, parallel or comparable corpus), we resort to the mixed language Web pages which are the local Web pages with some English words, because they are easily obtainable and frequently self-refresh.",
        "Observing the fact that English words sometimes appear together with their equivalence in a local language in Web texts as shown in Figure 1, it is possible to mine the mixed language search-result pages obtained from Web search engines and extract proper translations for these English words that are treated as queries.",

        "It should be also noted that this result was obtained even with the errors made by the unification of semantically identical terms in different languages."
