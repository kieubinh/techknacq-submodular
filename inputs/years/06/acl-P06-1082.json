        "In this work we studied the performance of two very popular recency-vector based approaches, proposed in (Fung and McKeown, 1994) and (Somers, 1998), respectively, for word alignment in English-Hindi parallel corpus.",
        "But performance of the above algorithms was not found to be satisfactory.",
        "However, subsequent addition of some new constraints improved the performance of the recency-vector based alignment technique significantly for the said corpus.",

        "Several approaches including statistical techniques (Gale and Church, 1991; Brown et al., 1993), lexical techniques (Huang and Choi, 2000; Tiedemann, 2003) and hybrid techniques (Ahren-berg et al., 2000), have been pursued to design schemes for word alignment which aims at establishing links between words of a source language and a target language in a parallel corpus.",
        "All these schemes rely heavily on rich linguistic resources, either in the form of huge data of parallel texts or various language/grammar related tools, such as parser, tagger, morphological analyser etc.",
        "Recency vector based approach has been proposed as an alternative strategy for word alignment.",
        "Approaches based on recency vectors typically consider the positions of the word in the corresponding texts rather than sentence boundaries.",

        "The algorithms first compute the position vector U„ for the word w in the text.",
        "Typically, V,,, is of the form (pipe ... Pk), where the pis indicate the positions of the word w in a text T. A new vector R,,,, called the recency vector, is computed using the position vector V,,,, and is defined as",
        "pute the alignment of a given word in the source language text, the recency vector of the word is compared with the recency vector of each target language word and the similarity between them is measured by computing a matching cost associated with the recency vectors using dynamic programming.",
        "The target language word having the least cost is selected as the aligned word.",
        "The results given in the above references show that the algorithms worked quite well in aligning words in parallel corpora of language pairs consisting of various European languages and Chinese, Japanese, taken pairwise.",
        "Precision of about 70% could be achieved using these algorithms.",
        "The major advantage of this approach is that it can work even on a relatively small dataset and it does not rely on rich language resources.",
        "The above advantage motivated us to study the effectiveness of these algorithms for aligning words in English-Hindi parallel texts.",

        "Note that for all the three corpora a variety of frequency ranges have been considered, and we have observed that the results obtained are slightly better when the MAS filter has been used.",
        "The best F-score is obtained when frequency range is high i.e. 100-150, 100-200.",
        "But here the words are very few in number and are primarily pronoun, determiner or conjunction which are not significant from alignment perspective.",
        "Also, it was observed that when medium frequency ranges, such as 30-50, are used the best result, in terms of precision, is around 20-28% for the three corpora.",
        "However, since the corpus size is small, here too the available and proposed aligned word pairs are very few (below 25).",
        "Lower frequency ranges (viz. 2-20 and its sub-ranges) result in the highest number of aligned pairs.",
        "We noticd that these aligned word pairs are typically verb, adjective, noun and adverb.",
        "But here too the performance of the algorithm may be considered to be unsatisfactory.",
        "Although Somers has recommended words in the frequency ranges 10- 30 to be considered for alignment, we have considered lower frequency words too in our experiments.",
        "This is because the corpus size being small we would otherwise have effectively overlooked many small-frequency words (e.g. noun, verb, adjective) that are significant from the alignment point of view.",

        "This can happen primarily due to three reasons:",
        "Declension of Adjective: Declensions of adjectives are not present in English grammar.",
        "No morphological variation in adjectives takes place along with the number and gender of the noun.",
        "But, in Hindi, adjectives may have such declensions.",
        "For example, the Hindi for “black” is kaalaa when the noun is masculine singular number (e.g. black horse – kaalaa ghodaa).",
        "But the Hindi translation of “black horses” is kaale ghode; whereas “black mare” is translated as kaalii ghodii.",
        "Thus the same English word “black” may have three Hindi equivalents kaalaa, kaalii, and kale which are to be used judiciously by considering the number and gender of the noun concerned.",
        "pronouns may also have different declensions depending upon the case endings and/or the gender and number of the object.",
        "For example, the same English word “my” may have different forms (e.g. meraa, merii, mere) when translated in Hindi.",
        "For illustration, while “my book” is translated as – merii kitaab, the translation of “my name” is meraa naam.",
        "This happens because naam is masculine in Hindi, while kitaab is feminine.",
        "(Note that in Hindi there is no concept of Neuter gender).",
        "Similar declensions may be found with respect to nouns too.",
        "For example, the Hindi equivalent of the word “hour” is ghantaa.",
        "In plural form it becomes ghante (e.g. “two hours” – do ghante).",
        "But when used in a prepositional phrase, it becomes ghanto.",
        "Thus the Hindi translation for “in two hours” is do ghanto mein.",
        "Verb Morphology: Morphology of verbs in Hindi depends upon the gender, number and person of the subject.",
        "There are 11 possible suffixes (e.g taa, te, tii, egaa) in Hindi that may be attached to the root Verb to render morphological variations.",

        " – * tum padte ho (Masculine) or tum padtii ho (Feminine) He will read.",
        " – * wah padegaa.",
        "Due to the presence of multiple Hindi equivalents, the frequencies of word occurrences differ significantly, and thereby jeopardize the calculations.",

        "Table 4 gives the details about the root word corpus used to improve the result of word alignment.",
        "Here the total number of words for the three types of corpora is greater than the total number of words in the original corpus (Table 1).",
        "This is because of the presence of words like “I’ll” in the English corpus which have been taken as “I shall” in the root word corpus.",
        "Also words like Unkaa have been taken as Un kaa in the Hindi root word corpus, leading to an increase in the corpus size.",
        "Since we observed (see Section 2.2) that Euclidean distance constraint does not add significantly to the performance, we propose not to use this constraint for English-Hindi word alignment.",
        "However, we propose to impose both frequency range constraint and length constraint (see Section 2.1 and Section 2.3).",
        "Instead of the starting point constraint, we have introduced a new constraint, viz. segment constraint, to localise the search for the matching words.",

        "However, it has been observed (see section 2.2) that the optimum value of the range varies with the nature of text.",
        "Hence no value for range may be identified that applies uniformly on different corpora.",
        "Also for noisy corpora the segment constraint is expected to yield better results as the search here is localised better.",
        "The proposed segment constraint expresses range in terms of segments.",
        "In order to impose this constraint, first the parallel texts are aligned at sentence level.",
        "The search for a target language word is then restricted to few segments above and below the current one.",
        "Use of sententially aligned corpora for word alignment has already been recommended in (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "However, the requirement there is quite stringent – all the sentences are to be correctly aligned.",
        "The segment constraint proposed herein works well even if the text alignment is not perfect.",
        "Use of roughly aligned corpora has also been proposed in (Dagan and Gale, 1993) for word alignment in bilingual corpora, where statistical techniques have been used as the underlying alignment scheme.",
        "In this work, the sentence level alignment algorithm given in (Gale and Church, 1991) has been used for applying segment constraint.",
        "As shown in Table 5, the alignment obtained using this algorithm is not very good (only 70% precision for Storybook corpus).",
        "The three aligned root word corpora are then subjected to segment constraint in our experiments.",
        "Next important decision we need to take which dynamic programming algorithm should be used.",
        "Results shown in Section 2.2 and 2.3 demonstrate that the performance of DK-vec algorithm and Somers’ algorithm are almost at par.",
        "Hence keeping in view the improved computational complexity, we choose to use Levenshtein distance as used in Somers’ algorithm for comparing recency vectors.",

        "Evidently, the value of i depends on the accuracy of sentence alignment.",
        "Table 5 suggests that the quality of alignment is different for the three corpora that we considered.",

        "However, since the results are not so good for the Storybook and Advertisement corpora we found after experimenting that the best results were obtained when i was 1.",
        "During the experiments it was observed that as the number of segments was lowered or increased from the optimum segment the accuracy of alignment decreased continuously by around 10% for low frequency ranges for the three corpora and remained almost same for high frequency ranges.",
        "Table 3 shows the results obtained when segment constraint is applied on the three corpora at optimum segment range for various frequency ranges.",
        "A comparison between the F-score given by algorithm in (Somers, 1998) (the column F-score old in the table) and the F-score obtained by applying the improved scheme (the column F-score new in the table) indicate that the results have improved significantly for low frequency ranges.",
        "It is observed that the accuracy of alignment for almost 95% of the available words has increased significantly.",
        "This accounts for words within low frequency range of 2–40 for Sentence corpus, 2– 30 for Storybook corpus, and 2–20 for Advertisement corpus.",
        "Also, most of the correct word pairs given by the modified approach are verbs, adjectives or nouns.",
        "Also it was observed that as the noise in the corpus increased the results became poorer.",
        "This accounts for the lowest F-score values for advertisement corpus.",
        "The Sentence corpus, however, has been found to be the least noisy, and highest precision and recall values were obtained with this corpus.",
        "Using Somers’ second filter on each corpus for the optimum segment we found that the results at low scores were better as shown in Figure 1.",
        "The word pairs obtained after applying the modified approach can be used as anchor points for further alignment as well as for vocabulary extraction.",
        "In case of the Sentence corpus, best result for anchor points for further alignment lies at the score cut off 1000 where precision and recall are 86.88% and 80.35% respectively.",

        "This approach can be used for word alignment in language pairs like English-Hindi.",
