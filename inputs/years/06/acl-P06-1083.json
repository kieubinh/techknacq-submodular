        "Reflecting the rapid growth in science and technology, new words and technical terms are being progressively created, and these words and terms are often transliterated when imported as loanwords in another language.",
        "Loanwords are often not included in dictionaries, and decrease the quality of natural language processing, information retrieval, machine translation, and speech recognition.",
        "At the same time, compiling dictionaries is expensive, because it relies on human introspection and supervision.",
        "Thus, a number of automatic methods have been proposed to extract loanwords and their translations from corpora, targeting various languages.",
        "In this paper, we focus on extracting loanwords in Mongolian.",
        "The Mongolian language is divided into Traditional Mongolian, written using the Mongolian alphabet, and Modern Mongolian, written using the Cyrillic alphabet.",
        "We focused solely on Modern Mongolian, and use the word “Mongolian” to refer to Modern Mongolian in this paper.",
        "There are two major problems in extracting loanwords from Mongolian corpora.",
        "The first problem is that Mongolian uses the Cyrillic alphabet to represent both conventional words and loanwords, and so the automatic extraction of loanwords is difficult.",
        "This feature provides a salient contrast to Japanese, where the Katakana alphabet is mainly used for loanwords and proper nouns, but not used for conventional words.",
        "The second problem is that content words, such as nouns and verbs, are inflected in sentences in Mongolian.",
        "Each sentence in Mongolian is segmented on a phrase-by-phase basis.",
        "A phrase consists of a content word and one or more suffixes, such as postpositional particles.",
        "Because loanwords are content words, then to extract loanwords correctly, we have to identify the original form using stemming.",
        "In this paper, we propose methods for extracting loanwords from Cyrillic Mongolian and producing a Japanese–Mongolian bilingual dictionary.",
        "We also propose a stemming method to identify the original forms of content words in Mongolian phrases.",

        "Existing methods that are used to extract loanwords from Korean corpora (Myaeng and Jeong, 1999; Oh and Choi, 2001) use the phonetic differences between conventional Korean words and loanwords.",
        "However, these methods require manually tagged training corpora, and are expensive.",
        "A number of corpus-based methods are used to extract bilingual lexicons (Fung and McKeown, 1996; Smadja, 1996).",
        "These methods use statistics obtained from a parallel or comparable bilingual corpus, and extract word or phrase pairs that are strongly associated with each other.",
        "However, these methods cannot be applied to a language pair where a large parallel or comparable corpus is not available, such as Mongolian and Japanese.",
        "Fujii et al.",

        "They assumed that loanwords in multiple countries corresponding to the same source word are phonetically similar.",
        "For example, the English word “system” has been imported into Korean, Mongolian, and Japanese.",
        "In these languages, the romanized words are “siseutem”, “sistem”, and “shisutemu”, respectively.",
        "It is often the case that new terms have been imported into multiple languages simultaneously, because the source words are usually influential across cultures.",
        "It is feasible that a large number of loanwords in Korean can also be loanwords in Japanese.",
        "Additionally, Katakana words can be extracted from Japanese corpora with a high accuracy.",
        "Thus, Fujii et al.",
        "(2004) extracted the loanwords in Korean corpora that were phonetically similar to Japanese Katakana words.",
        "Because each of the extracted loanwords also corresponded to a Japanese word during the extraction process, a Japanese–Korean bilingual dictionary was produced in a single framework.",
        "However, a number of open questions remain from Fujii et al.’s research.",
        "First, their stemming method can only be used for Korean.",
        "Second, their accuracy in extracting loanwords was low, and thus, an additional extraction method was required.",
        "Third, they did not report on the accuracy of extracting translations, and finally, because they used Dynamic Programming (DP) matching for computing the phonetic similarities between Korean and Japanese words, the computational cost was prohibitive.",
        "In an attempt to extract Chinese–English translations from corpora, Lam et al.",
        "(2004) proposed a similar method to Fujii et al.",
        "(2004).",
        "However, they searched the Web for Chinese–English bilingual comparable corpora, and matched named entities in each language corpus if they were similar to each other.",
        "Thus, Lam et al.’s method cannot be used for a language pair where comparable corpora do not exist.",
        "In contrast, using Fujii et al.’s (2004) method, the Katakana dictionary and a Korean corpus can be independent.",
        "In addition, Lam et al.’s method requires Chinese–English named entity pairs to train the similarity computation.",
        "Because the accuracy of extracting named entities was not reported, it is not clear to what extent this method is effective in extracting loanwords from corpora."

        "(2004), “Stemming”, “Extracting loanwords based on rules”, and “N-gram retrieval” are introduced in this paper.",
        "First, we perform stemming on a Mongolian corpus to segment phrases into a content word and one or more suffixes.",
        "Fig ure 1: Overview of our extraction method.",
        "Second, we discard segmented content words if they are in an existing dictionary, and extract the remaining words as candidate loanwords.",
        "Third, we use our own handcrafted rules to extract loanwords from the candidate loanwords.",
        "While the rule-based method can extract loanwords with a high accuracy, a number of loanwords cannot be extracted using predefined rules.",
        "Fourth, as performed by Fujii et al.",
        "(2004), we use a Japanese Katakana dictionary and extract a candidate loanword that is phonetically similar to a Katakana word as a loanword.",
        "We romanize the candidate loanwords that were not extracted using the rules.",
        "We also romanize all words in the Katakana dictionary.",
        "However, unlike Fujii et al.",
        "(2004), we use N-gram retrieval to limit the number of Katakana words that are similar to the candidate loanwords.",
        "Then, we compute the phonetic similarities between each candidate loanword and each retrieved Katakana word using DP matching, and select a pair whose score is above a predefined threshold.",
        "As a result, we can extract loanwords in Mongolian and their translations in Japanese simultaneously.",
        "Finally, to identify Japanese translations for the loanwords extracted using the rules defined in the third step above, we perform N-gram retrieval and DP matching.",

        "Our research is the first serious effort in producing dictionaries of loanwords and their translations targeting Mongolian.",
        "We devised our own rules to extract loanwords from Mongolian corpora.",
        "We also extracted words in Mongolian corpora that are phonetically similar to Japanese Katakana words as loanwords.",
        "We also corresponded the extracted loanwords to Japanese words, and produced a Japanese–Mongolian bilingual dictionary.",
        "A noun stemming method that does not require noun dictionaries was also proposed.",
        "Finally, we evaluated the effectiveness of the components experimentally."
