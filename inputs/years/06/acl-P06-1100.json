        "NLP researchers have developed many algorithms for mining knowledge from text and the Web, including facts (Etzioni et al.",
        "2005), semantic lexicons (Riloff and Shepherd 1997), concept lists (Lin and Pantel 2002), and word similarity lists (Hindle 1990).",
        "Many recent efforts have also focused on extracting binary semantic relations between entities, such as entailments (Szpektor et al.",
        "2004), is-a (Ravi-chandran and Hovy 2002), part-of (Girju et al.",
        "2003), and other relations.",
        "The output of most of these systems is flat lists of lexical semantic knowledge such as “Italy is-a country” and “orange similar-to blue”.",
        "However, using this knowledge beyond simple keyword matching, for example in inferences, requires it to be linked into formal semantic repositories such as ontologies or term banks like WordNet (Fellbaum 1998).",
        "Pantel (2005) defined the task of ontologizing a lexical semantic resource as linking its terms to the concepts in a WordNet-like hierarchy.",

        "In his framework,",
        "Pantel proposed a method of inducing ontological co-occurrence vectors1 which are subsequently used to ontologize unknown terms into WordNet with 74% accuracy.",
        "In this paper, we take the next step and explore two algorithms for ontologizing binary semantic relations into WordNet and we present empirical results on the task of attaching part-of and causation relations.",
        "Formally, given an instance (x, r, y) of a binary relation r between terms x and y, the ontologizing task is to identify the WordNet senses of x and y where r holds.",
        "For example, the instance (proton, PART-OF, element) ontologizes into WordNet as (proton#1, PART-OF, element#2).",
        "The first algorithm that we explore, called the anchoring approach, was suggested as a promising avenue of future work in (Pantel 2005).",
        "This bottom up algorithm is based on the intuition that x can be disambiguated by retrieving the set of terms that occur in the same relation r with y and then finding the senses of x that are most similar to this set.",
        "The assumption is that terms occurring in the same relation will tend to have similar meaning.",
        "In this paper, we propose a measure of similarity to capture this intuition.",
        "In contrast to anchoring, our second algorithm, called the clustering approach, takes a top-down view.",
        "Given a relation r, suppose that we are given every conceptual instance of r, i.e., instances of r in the upper ontology like (particles#1, PART-OF, substances#1).",
        "An instance (x, r, y) can then be ontologized easily by finding the senses of x and y that are subsumed by ancestors linked by a conceptual instance of r. For example, the instance (proton, PART-OF, element) ontologizes to (proton#1, PART-OF, element#2) since proton#1 is subsumed by particles and element#2 is subsumed by substances.",

        "Incorrect conceptual instances such as [attribute#2, CAUSE, state#4], discovered by our system, can impede WSD and extraction tools where precise selectional restrictions are needed; and • the accuracy of the conceptual instances.",
        "Sometimes, an instance is incorrectly attached to a correct conceptual instance.",
        "For example, the instance (air mass, PART-OF, cold front) is incorrectly clustered in [group#1, PART-OF, multitude#3] since mass and front both have a sense that is descendant of group#1 and multitude#3.",
        "However, these are not the correct senses of mass and front for which the part-of relation holds.",
        "For evaluating correctness, we manually verify how many correct conceptual instances are produced by Phase 2 of the clustering approach described in Section 3.2.",
        "The claim is that a correct conceptual instance is one for which the relation holds for all possible subsumed senses.",
        "For example, the conceptual instance [group#1, PART-OF, multitude#3] is correct, as the relation holds for every semantic subsumption of the two senses.",
        "An example of an incorrect conceptual instance is [state#4, CAUSE, abstraction#6] since it subsumes the incorrect instance (audience, CAUSE, new context).",
        "A manual evaluation of the highest scoring 200 conceptual instances, generated on our test sets described in Section 4.1, showed 82% correctness for the part-of relation and 86% for causation.",
        "For estimating the overall clustering accuracy, we evaluated the number of correctly clustered instances in each conceptual instance.",
        "For example, the instance (business people, PART-OF, committee) is correctly clustered in [multitude#3, PART-OF, group#1 ] and the instance (law, PART-OF, constitutional pitfalls) is incorrectly clustered in [group#1, PART-OF, artifact#1].",
        "We estimated the overall accuracy by manually judging the instances attached to 10 randomly sampled conceptual instances.",
        "The accuracy for part-of is 84% and for causation it is 76.6%."

        "In this paper, we proposed two algorithms for automatically ontologizing binary semantic relations into WordNet: an anchoring approach and a clustering approach.",
        "Experiments on the part-of and causation relations showed promising results.",
        "Both algorithms outperformed the baseline on F-score.",
        "Our best results were on the part-of relation where the clustering approach achieved 13.6% higher F-score than the baseline.",
        "The induction of conceptual instances has opened the way for many avenues of future work.",
        "We intend to pursue the ideas presented in Section 5 for using conceptual instances to: i) support knowledge acquisition tools by learning semantic constraints on extracting patterns; ii) support ontology learning from text; and iii) improve word sense disambiguation through selectional restrictions.",
        "Also, we will try different similarity score functions for both the clustering and the anchor approaches, as those surveyed in Corley and Mihalcea (2005).",
        "The algorithms described in this paper may be applied to ontologize many lexical resources of semantic relations, no matter the harvesting algorithm used to mine them.",
        "In doing so, we have the potential to quickly enrich our ontologies, like WordNet, thus reducing the knowledge acquisition bottleneck.",
        "It is our hope that we will be able to leverage these enriched resources, albeit with some noisy additions, to improve performance on knowledge-rich problems such as question answering and textual entailment."
