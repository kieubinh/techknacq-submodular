        "Complex information needs can rarely be addressed by single documents, but rather require the integration of knowledge from multiple sources.",

        "Current question answering systems aspire to address this shortcoming by gathering relevant “facts” from multiple documents in response to information needs.",
        "The so-called “definition” or “other” questions at recent TREC evaluations (Voorhees, 2005) serve as good examples: “good answers” to these questions include interesting “nuggets” about a particular person, organization, entity, or event.",

        "The last few years have seen a convergence between the question answering and summarization communities (Amig´o et al., 2004), as highlighted by the shift from generic to query-focused summaries in the 2005 DUC evaluation (Dang, 2005).",
        "Despite a focus on document ranking, different techniques for organizing search results have been explored by information retrieval researchers, as exemplified by techniques based on clustering (Hearst and Pedersen, 1996; Dumais et al., 2001; Lawrie and Croft, 2003).",
        "Our work, which is situated in the domain of clinical medicine, lies at the intersection of question answering, information retrieval, and summarization.",
        "We employ answer extraction to identify short answers, semantic clustering to group similar results, and extractive summarization to produce supporting evidence.",
        "This paper describes how each of these capabilities contributes to an information system tailored to the requirements of physicians.",
        "Two separate evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach."

        "Furthermore, term-based approaches suffer from the cluster labeling problem: it is difficult to automatically generate a short heading that describes cluster content.",
        "Nevertheless, there are a number of assumptions behind our work that are worth pointing out.",
        "First, we assume a high quality initial result set.",
        "Since the class of questions we examine translates naturally into accurate PubMed queries that can make full use of human-assigned MeSH terms, the overall quality of the initial citations can be assured.",
        "Related work in retrieval algorithms (Demner-Fushman and Lin, 2006 in press) shows that accurate relevance scoring of MEDLINE citations in response to more general clinical questions is possible.",
        "Second, our system does not actually perform semantic processing to determine the efficacy of a drug: it only recognizes “topics” and outcome sentences that state clinical findings.",
        "Since the system by default orders the clusters based on size, it implicitly equates “most popular drug” with “best drug”.",
        "Although this assumption is false, we have observed in practice that more-studied drugs are more likely to be beneficial.",
        "In contrast with the genomics domain, which has received much attention from both the IR and NLP communities, retrieval systems for the clinical domain represent an underexplored area of research.",
        "Although individual components that attempt to operationalize principles of evidence-based medicine do exist (Mendonc¸a and Cimino, 2001; Niu and Hirst, 2004), complete end–to– end clinical question answering systems are dif",
        "ficult to find.",
        "Within the context of the PERSI-VAL project (McKeown et al., 2003), researchers at Columbia have developed a system that leverages patient records to rerank search results.",
        "Since the focus is on personalized summaries, this work can be viewed as complementary to our own.",
        "8 Conclusion The primary contribution of this work is the development of a clinical question answering system that caters to the unique requirements of physicians, who demand both conciseness and completeness.",
        "These competing factors can be balanced in a system’s response by providing multiple levels of drill-down that allow the information space to be viewed at different levels of granularity.",
        "We have chosen to implement these capabilities through answer extraction, semantic clustering, and extractive summarization.",
        "Two separate evaluations demonstrate that our system outperforms the PubMed baseline, illustrating the effectiveness of a hybrid approach that leverages semantic resources."
