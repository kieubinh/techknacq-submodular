        "F-1 measure values produced by SCM and XSCM in this experiment are present in Table 4.",
        "Three observations are conducted on our results.",
        "First, according to Table 4, f-1 measure of SCM with same training chat language corpora drops on time-varying test sets, but XSCM produces much better f-1 measure consistently using CNGIGA and same training chat language corpora (see Figure 3).",
        "This proves that phonetic mapping models are helpful in XSCM method.",
        "The phonetic mapping models contribute in two aspects.",
        "On the one hand, they improve quality of chat term normalization on individual test sets.",
        "On the other hand, satisfactory robustness is achieved consistently.",
        "The second observation is conducted on phonetic mapping models constructed with CNGIGA.",
        "We find that 4,056,766 phonetic mapping models are constructed in this experiment, while only 1,303,227 models are constructed with NIL corpus in Experiment I.",
        "This reveals that coverage of standard Chinese corpus is crucial to phonetic mapping modeling.",
        "We then compare two character lists constructed with two corpora.",
        "The 100 characters most frequently used in NIL corpus are rather different from those extracted from CNGIGA.",
        "We can conclude that phonetic mapping models should be constructed with a sound corpus that can represent standard language.",
        "The last observation is conducted on f-1 measure achieved by same methods on same test sets using size-varying training chat language corpora.",
        "Both methods produce best f-1 measure with biggest training chat language corpus C#6 on same test sets.",
        "This again proves that bigger training chat language corpus could be helpful to improve quality of chat language term normalization.",
        "One question might be asked whether quality of XSCM converges on size of the training chat language corpus.",
        "This question remains open due to limited chat language corpus available to us."

        "Typical errors in our experiments belong mainly to the following two types.",

        "Error illustrated in Example-1 occurs when chat terms “8(eight, ba1)” and “米(meter, mi3)” appear in a chat sentence together.",
        "In chat language, “米” in some cases is used to replace “ 明 (understand, ming2)”, while in other cases, it is used to represent a unit for length, i.e. meter.",
        "When number “8” appears before “米”, it is difficult to tell whether they are chat terms within sentential context.",
        "In our experiments, 93 similar errors occurred.",
        "We believe this type of errors can be addressed within discoursal context.",
        "Err.2 Chat terms created in manners other than phonetic mapping Example-2: 忧虑 ing In this example, XSCM does not recognize “ing” while the correct answer is “(正在)忧虑 (I’m worrying)”.",
        "This is because chat terms created in manners other than phonetic mapping are excluded by the phonetic assumption in XSCM method.",
        "Around 1% chat terms fall out of phonetic mapping types.",
        "Besides chat terms holding same form as showed in Example-2, we find that emoticon is another major exception type.",
        "Fortunately, dictionary-based method is powerful enough to handle the exceptions.",
        "So, in a real system, the exceptions are handled by an extra component."
