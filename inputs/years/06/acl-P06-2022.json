        "The goal of information extraction is to generate a set of abstract information objects that represent the entities, events, and relations of particular types mentioned in unstructured text.",
        "For example, in a judicial domain, relevant event types might be ARREST, CHARGING, TRIAL, etc.",
        "Although event extraction techniques usually focus on extracting mentions textually anchored by verb phrases or clauses, e.g. (Aone and Ramos",
        "Santacruz, 2000), many event mentions, especially subsequent mentions of events that are the primary topic of a document, are referred to with nominals.",
        "Because of this, detecting nominal event mentions, like those in (1), can increase the recall of event extraction systems, in particular for the most important events in a document.1 (1) The slain journalist was a main organizer of the massive demonstrations that forced Syria to withdraw its troops from Lebanon last April, after Assad was widely accused of planning Hariri’s assassination in a February car bombing that was similar to today’s blast.",
        "Detecting event nominals is also an important step in detecting relations between event mentions, as in the causal relation between the demonstrations and the withdrawal and the similarity relation between the bombing and the blast in (1).",
        "Finally, detecting nominal events can improve detection and coreference of non-named mentions of non-event entities (e.g. persons, locations, and organizations) by removing event nominals from consideration as mentions of entities.",
        "Current extraction techniques for verbally-anchored events rest on the assumption that most verb phrases denote eventualities.",
        "A system to extract untyped event mentions can output all constituents headed by a non-auxiliary verb with a filter to remove instances of to be, to seem, etc.",
        "A statistical or rule-based classifier designed to detect event mentions of specific types can then be applied to filter these remaining instances.",
        "Noun phrases, in contrast, can be used to denote anything – eventualities, entities, abstractions, and only some are suitable for event-type filtering."

        "Creating a general purpose lexicon of all potentially event-denoting terms in a language is a labor-intensive task.",
        "On top of this, even utilizing an existing lexical resource like WordNet requires sense disambiguation at runtime because event nominals display the full spectrum of sense distinction behaviors (Copestake and Briscoe, 1995), including idiosyncratic polysemy, as in (2); constructional polysemy, as in (3); coactivation, (4); and copredication, as in (5).",

        "(5) The construction lasted 30 years and was inaugurated in the presence of the king in June 1684.",
        "Given the breadth of lexical sense phenomena possible with event nominals, no existing approach can address all aspects.",
        "Lexical lookup, whether using a manually or automatically-constructed resource, does not take context into consideration and so does not allow for vagueness or unknown words.",
        "Purely word-cooccurrencebased approaches (e.g. (Sch¨utze, 1998)) are unsuitable for cases like (3) where both senses are possible in a single discourse.",
        "Furthermore, most WSD techniques, whether supervised or unsupervised, must be retrained for each individual lexical item, a computationally expensive procedure both at training and run time.",
        "To address these limitations, we have developed a technique which combines automatic lexical acquisition and sense disambiguation into a single-pass weakly-supervised algorithm for detecting event nominals.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes our probabilistic classifier.",
        "Section 3 presents experimental results of this model, assesses its performance when bootstrapped to increase its coverage, and compares it to a lexical lookup technique.",
        "We describe related work in Section 4 and present conclusions and implications for future work in Section 5.",
        "2 Weakly-supervised, simultaneous lexical acquisition and disambiguation In this section we present a computational method that learns the distribution of context patterns that correlate with event vs. non-event mentions based on unambiguous seeds.",
        "Using these seeds we build two Bayesian probabilistic generative models of the data, one for non-event nominals and the other for event nominals.",
        "A classifier is then constructed by comparing the probability of a candidate instance under each model, with the winning model determining the classification.",
        "In Section 3 we show that this classifier’s coverage can be increased beyond the initial labeled seed set by automatically selecting additional seeds from a very large unlabeled, parsed corpus.",
        "The technique proceeds as follows.",
        "First, two lexicons of seed terms are created by hand.",
        "One lexicon includes nominal terms that are highly likely to unambiguously denote events; the other includes nominal terms that are highly likely to unambiguously denote anything other than events.",
        "Then, a very large corpus (> 150K documents) is parsed using a broad-coverage dependency parser to extract all instantiations of a core set of semantic dependency relations, including verb-logical subject, verb-logical object, subject-nominal predicate, noun phrase-appositive-modifier, etc.",
        "Format of data: Each instantiation is in the form of a dependency triple, (wa, R, wb), where R is the relation type and where each argument is represented just by its syntactic head, wn.",
        "Each partial instantiation of the relation – i.e.",
        "either wa or wb is treated as a wild card * that can be filled by any term – becomes a feature in the model.",
        "For every common noun term in the corpus that appears with at least one feature (including each entry in the seed lexicons), the times it appears with each feature are tabulated and stored in a matrix of counts.",
        "Each column of the matrix represents a feature, e.g. (occur,Verb-Subj, *); each row represents an individual term,2 e.g. murder; and each entry is the number of times a term appeared with the feature in the corpus, i.e. as the instantiation of *.",
        "For each row, if the corresponding term appears in a lexicon it is given that designation, i.e.",
        "EVENT or NONEVENT, or if it does not appear in either lexicon, it is left unlabeled.",
        "Probabilistic model: Here we present the details of the EVENT model – the computations for the NONEVENT model are identical.",
        "The probability model is built using a set of seed words labeled as EVENTs and is designed to address two desiderata: (I) the EVENT model should assign high probability to an unlabeled vector, v, if its features (as recorded in the count matrix) are similar to the vectors of the EVENT seeds; (II) each seed term s should contribute to the model in proportion to its prevalence in the training data.",
        "These desiderata can be incorporated naturally into a mixture model formalism, where there are as many components in the mixture model as there are EVENT seed terms.",
        "Desideratum (I) is addressed by having each component of the mixture model assigning a multinomial probability to the vector, v. For the ith mixture component built around the ith seed, s(i), the probability is",
        "where sf ) is defined as the proportion of the times the seed was seen with feature f compared to the number of times the seed was seen with any feature f� E F. Thus sf ) is simply the (i, f )th entry in a row-sum normalized count matrix,",
        "Desideratum (II) is realized using a mixture density by forming a weighted mixture of the above multinomial distributions from all the provided seeds i E £.",
        "The weighting of the ith component is fixed to be the ratio of the number of occurrences of the ith EVENT seed, denoted Is(i)I, to the total number of all occurrences of event seed words.",
        "This gives more weight to more prevalent seed words: The EVENT generative probability is then:",
        "event seeds as well, and a corresponding probability p(vINONEVENT) is computed.",
        "The following difference (log odds-ratio)",
        "is then calculated.",
        "An instance v encoded as the vector v is labeled as EVENT or NONEVENT by examining the sign of d(v).",
        "A positive difference d(v) classifies v as EVENT; a negative value of d(v) classifies v as NONEVENT.",
        "Should d_0 the classifier is considered undecided and abstains.",
        "Each test instance is composed of a term and the dependency triples it appears with in context in the test document.",
        "Therefore, an instance can be classified by (i: word): Find the unlabeled feature vector in the training data corresponding to the term and apply the classifier to that vector, i.e. classify the instance based on the term’s behavior summed across many occurrences in the training corpus; (ii: context): Classify the instance based only on its immediate test context vector; or (iii: word+context): For each model, multiply the probability information from the word vector (=i) and the context vector (=ii).",
        "In our experiments, all terms in the test corpus appeared at least once (80% appearing at least 500 times) in the training corpus, so there were no cases of unseen terms – not suprising with a training set 1,800 times larger than the test set.",
        "However, the ability to label an instance based only on its immediate context means that there is a backoff method in the case of unseen terms."

        "These were annotated by hand to mark event nominals.",
        "Specifically, every referential noun phrase headed by a non-proper noun was considered for whether it denoted an achievement, accomplishment, activity, or process (Parsons, 1990).",
        "Noun heads denoting any of these were marked as EVENT, and all others were left unmarked.",
        "All documents were first marked by a junior annotator, and then a non-blind second pass was performed by a senior annotator (first author).",
        "Several semantic classes were difficult to annotate because they are particularly prone to coactivation, including terms denoting financial acts, legal acts, speech acts, and economic processes.",
        "In addition, for terms like mission, plan, duty, tactic, policy, it can be unclear whether they are hyponyms of EVENT or another abstract concept.",
        "In every case, however, the mention was labeled as an event or non-event depending on whether its use in that context appeared to be more or less event-like, respectively.",
        "Tests for the “event-y”ness of the context included whether an unambiguous word would be an acceptable substitute there (e.g. funds [=only non-event] for expenditure [either]).",
        "To create the test data, the annotated documents were also parsed to automatically extract all common noun-headed NPs and the dependency triples they instantiate.",
        "Those with heads that aligned with the offsets of an event annotation were labeled as events; the remainder were labeled as non-events.",
        "Because of parsing errors, about 10% of annotated event instances were lost, that is remained unlabeled or were labeled as non-events.",
        "So, our results are based on the set of recoverable event nominals as a subset of all common-noun headed NPs that were extracted.",

        "The AVERAGE score assumes that performance on non-events and events is equally important to us.",
        "¿From EXP1, we see that the behavior of a term across an entire corpus is a better source of information about whether a particular instance of that term refers to an event than its immediate context.",
        "We can further infer that this is because the immediate context only provides definitive evidence for the models in 63.0% of cases; when the context model is not penalized for indecision, its accuracy improves considerably.",
        "Nonetheless, in combination with the word model, immediate context does not appear to provide much additional information over only the word.",
        "In other words, based only on a term’s distribution in the past, one can make a reasonable prediction about how it will be used when it is seen again.",
        "Consequently, it seems that a well-constructed, i.e. domain customized, lexicon can classify nearly as well as a method that also takes context into account.",

        "The fact that our method performs somewhat better on the ACE data than on our own data, while the lexicon approach is worse (7 points higher vs. 3 points lower, respectively) can likely be explained by the fact that in creating our introspective seed set for events, we consulted the annotation manual for ACE event types and attempted to include in our list any unambiguous seed terms that fit those types.",
        "EXP3: Increasing seed set via Bootstrapping There are over 2,300 unlabeled vectors in the training data that correspond to the words that appear as lexical heads in the test data.",
        "These unlabeled training vectors can be powerfully leveraged using a simple bootstrapping algorithm to improve the individual models for non-events and events, as follows: Step 1: For each vector v in the unlabeled portion of training data, row-sum normalize",
        "it to produce v and compute a normalized measure of confidence of the algorithm’s prediction, given by the magnitude of d(v).",
        "Step 2: Add those vectors most confidently classified as either non-events or events to the seed set for non-events or events, according to the sign of d(v).",
        "Step 3: Recalculate the model based on the new seed lists.",
        "Step 4: Repeat Steps 1–3 until either no more unlabeled vectors remain or the validation accuracy no longer increases.",
        "In our experiments we added vectors to each model such that the ratio of the size of the seed sets remained constant, i.e. 50 non-events and 16 events were added at each iteration.",
        "Using our validation set, we determined that the bootstrapping should stop after 15 iterations (despite continuing for 21 iterations), at which point the average accuracy leveled out and then began to drop.",
        "After 15 iterations the seed set is of size",
        "shows the change in the accuracy of the model as it is bootstrapped through 15 iterations.",
        "TOTAL accuracy improves with bootstrapping, despite EVENT accuracy decreasing, because the test data is heavily populated with non-events, whose accuracy increases substantially.",
        "The AVERAGE accuracy also increases, which proves that bootstrapping is doing more than simply shifting the bias of the classifier to the majority class.",
        "The figure also shows that the final bootstrapped classifier comfortably outperforms Lexicon 1, impressive because the lexicon contains at least 13 times more terms than the seed lists.",
        "EXP4: Bootstrapping with a reduced number of seeds The size of the original seed lists were chosen somewhat arbitrarily.",
        "In order to determine whether similar performance could be obtained using fewer seeds, i.e. less human effort, we experimented with reducing the size of the seed lexicons used to initialize the bootstrapping.",
        "To do this, we randomly selected a fixed fraction, f %, of the (295, 95) available event and nonevent seeds, and built a classifier from this subset of seeds (and discarded the remaining seeds).",
        "We then bootstrapped the classifier’s models using the 4-step procedure described above, using candidate seed vectors from the unlabeled training corpus, and incrementing the number of seeds until the classifier consisted of (295, 95) seeds.",
        "We then performed 15 additional bootstrapping iterations, each adding (50,16) seeds.",
        "Since the seeds making up the initial classifier are chosen stochastically, we repeated this entire process 10 times and report in Figures 3(a) and 3(b) the mean of the total and average accuracies for these 10 folds, respectively.",
        "Both plots have five traces, with each trace corresponding the fraction f = (20,40,60,80, 100)% of labeled seeds used to build the initial models.",
        "As a point of reference, note that initializing with 100% of the seed lexicon corresponds to the first point of the traces in Figure 2 (where the x-axis is marked with f =100%).",
        "Interestingly, there is no discernible difference in accuracy (total or average) for fractions f greater than 20%.",
        "However, upon bootstrapping we note the following trends.",
        "First, Figure 3(b) shows that using a larger initial seed set increases the maximum achievable accuracy, but this maximum occurs after a greater number bootstrapping iterations; indeed the maximum for 100% is achieved at 15 (or greater) iterations.",
        "This reflects the difference in rigidity of the initial models, with smaller initial models more easily misled by the seeds added by bootstrapping.",
        "Second, the final accuracies (total and average) are correlated with the initial seed set size, which is intuitively satisfying.",
        "Third, it appears from Figure 3(a) that the total accuracy at the model size (295,95) (or 100%) is in fact anti-correlated with the size of the initial seed set, with 20% performing best.",
        "This is correct, but highlights the sometimes misleading interpretation of the total accuracy: in this case the model is defaulting to classifying anything as a non-event (the majority class), and has a considerably impoverished event model.",
        "If one wants to do as well as Lexicon 1 after 15 iterations of bootstrapping then one needs at least",
        "an initial seed set of size 60%.",
        "An alternative is to perform fewer iterations, but here we see that using 100% of the seeds comfortably achieves the highest total and average accuracies anyway."
