        "With the exponential growth of information on the Internet, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find and organize relevant materials.",
        "Topic Tracking defined by the TDT project is a research area to attack the problem.",
        "It starts from a few sample stories and finds all subsequent stories that discuss the target topic.",
        "Here, a topic in the TDT context is something that happens at a specific place and time associated with some specific actions.",
        "A wide range of statistical and ML techniques have been applied to topic tracking(Carbonell et.",
        "al, 1999; Oard, 1999; Franz, 2001; Larkey, 2004).",
        "The main task of these techniques is to tune the parameters or the threshold to produce optimal results.",
        "However, parameter tuning is a tricky issue for tracking(Yang, 2000) because the number of initial positive training stories is very small (one to four), and topics are localized in space and time.",
        "For example, ‘Taipei Mayoral Elections’ and ‘U.S.",
        "Midterm Elections’ are topics, but ‘Elections’ is not a topic.",
        "Therefore, the system needs to estimate whether or not the test stories are the same topic with few information about the topic.",
        "Moreover, the training data is skewed data, i.e. there is a large number of labelled negative stories compared to positive ones.",
        "The system thus needs to balance the amount of positive and negative training stories not to hamper the accuracy of estimation.",
        "In this paper, we propose a method for estimating efficient training stories for topic tracking.",
        "For a small number of labelled positive stories, we use bilingual comparable corpora (TDT 1 3 English and Japanese newspapers, Mainichi and Yomiuri Shimbun).",
        "Our hypothesis using bilingual corpora is that many of the broadcasting station from one country report local events more frequently and in more detail than overseas’ broadcasting stations, even if it is a worldwide famous ones.",
        "Let us take a look at some topic from the TDT corpora.",
        "A topic, ‘Kobe Japan quake’ from the TDT1 is a worldwide famous one, and 89 stories are included in the TDT1.",
        "However, Mainichi and Yomiuri Japanese newspapers have much more stories from the same period of time, i.e. 5,029 and 4,883 stories for each.",
        "These observations show that it is crucial to investigate the use of bilingual comparable corpora based on the NL techniques in terms of collecting more information about some specific topics.",
        "We extract Japanese stories which are relevant to the positive English stories using English-Japanese bilingual corpora, together with the EDR bilingual dictionary.",
        "The associated story is the result of alignment of a Japanese term association with an English term association.",
        "For a large number of labelled negative stories, we classify them into some clusters using labelled positive stories.",
        "We used a semi-supervised clustering technique which combines",
        "labeled and unlabeled stories during clustering.",
        "Our goal for semi-supervised clustering is to classify negative stories into clusters where each cluster is meaningful in terms of class distribution provided by one cluster of positive training stories.",
        "We introduce k-means clustering that can be viewed as instances of the EM algorithm, and classify negative stories into clusters.",
        "In general, the number of clusters k for the k-means algorithm is not given beforehand.",
        "We thus use the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) as the splitting criterion, and select the proper number for k."

        "al, 1998).",
        "The basic idea behind their work is that stories closer together in the stream are more likely to discuss related topics than stories further apart.",
        "The method is based on unsupervised learning techniques except for its incremental nature.",
        "When a tracking query is first created from the Nt training stories, it is also given a threshold.",
        "During the tracking phase, if a story S scores over that threshold, S is regarded to be relevant and the query is regenerated as if S were among the Nt training stories.",
        "This method was tested using the TDT1 corpus and it was found that the adaptive approach is highly successful.",
        "But adding more than four training stories provided only little help, although in their approach, 12 training stories were added.",
        "The method proposed in this paper is similar to Allan’s method, however our method for collecting relevant stories is based on story pairs which are extracted from bilingual comparable corpora.",
        "The methods for finding bilingual story pairs are well studied in the cross-language IR task, or MT systems/bilingual lexicons(Dagan, 1997).",
        "Much of the previous work uses cosine similarity between story term vectors with some weighting techniques(Allan et.",
        "al, 1998) such as TF-IDF, or cross-language similarities of terms.",
        "However, most of them rely on only two stories in question to estimate whether or not they are about the same topic.",
        "We use multiple-links among stories to produce optimal results.",
        "In the TDT tracking task, classifying negative stories into meaningful groups is also an important issue to track topics, since a large number of labelled negative stories are available in the TDT context.",
        "Basu et.",
        "al.",
        "proposed a method using k-means clustering with the EM algorithm, where labeled data provides prior information about the conditional distribution of hidden category labels(Basu, 2002).",
        "They reported that the method outperformed the standard random seeding and COP-k-means(Wagstaff, 2001).",
        "Our method shares the basic idea with Basu et.",
        "al.",
        "An important difference with their method is that our method does not require the number of clusters k in advance, since it is determined during clustering.",
        "We use the BIC as the splitting criterion, and estimate the proper number for k. It is an important feature because in the tracking task, no knowledge of the number of topics in the negative training stories is available."

        "In this paper, we addressed the issue of the difference in sizes between positive and negative training stories for the tracking task, and investigated the use of bilingual comparable corpora and semi-supervised clustering.",
        "The empirical results were encouraging.",
        "Future work includes (i) extending the method to an incremental approach for extracting story pairs, (ii) comparing our clustering method with the other existing methods such as X-means(Pelleg, 2000), and (iii) applying the method to the TDT4 for quantitative evaluation."
