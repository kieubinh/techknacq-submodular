        "In particular, Hwa et al.",

        "Through pDCA the syntactic knowledge can be transferred even if not all syntactic relations may be projected directly from the source language to the target language in toto.",
        "Further, the proposed algorithm projects the relations between phrases instead of projecting relations between words.",
        "Keeping in line with (Hwa et al., 2005), we call this algorithm as pseudo Direct Projection Algorithm (pDPA).",
        "The present work discusses the proposed parsing scheme for a new (target) language with the help of a parser that is already available for a language (source) and using word-aligned parallel corpus of the two languages under consideration.",
        "We propose that the syntactic relationships between the chunks of the input sentence T (of the target language) are given depending upon the relationships of the corresponding chunks in the translation S of T. Along with the parsed structure of the input, the system also outputs the constituent structure (phrases) of the given input sentence.",

        "The projection algorithm needs to take care of the following three categories of links: Category 1: Relationship between two chunks in the source language can be projected to the target language with minor or no changes (for example, subject-verb, object-verb relationships in the above illustration).",
        "It may be noted that since except for some suffix differences (due to morphological variations), the relation is same in the source and the target language.",
        "Category 2: Relationship between two chunks in the source language can be projected to the target language with major changes.",

        "If the distinction between the types of nominal modifiers is not maintained, the parsing will be very shallow.",
        "Hence the modification in the link is necessary.",
        "Category 3: Relationship between two chunks in the target language is either entirely different or can not be captured from the relationship between the corresponding chunk(s) in the source language.",
        "For example, the relationship between the main verb and the auxiliary verb of the Hindi sentence in Figure 2(a) can not be defined using the English parsing.",
