        "Consider, for example, the following statement made by a student in an experiment with a simulated tutoring system for proving theorems in elementary set theory (Benzm¨uller et al., 2003):",
        "“If all A are contained in K(B) and this also holds",
        "the other way round, these must be identical sets” (K stands for set complement).",
        "The interpretation of the the other way round operator is ambiguous here in that it may operate on immediate dependents (“all K(B) are contained in A”) or on the embedded dependents (“all B are contained in K(A)”) of the verb “contain”.",
        "The fact that the Containment relation is asymmetric and the context of the task – proving that “If A C_ K(B), then B C_ K(A)” holds – suggest that the second interpretation is meant.",
        "Assuming this more plausible reading enables a more goal-oriented dialog: the tutorial system can focus on a response to the false conclusion made by the student about the identity of the sets in question, rather than starting a boring clarification subdialog.",
        "The above example and several similar others motivated us to look more systematically at lexical devices that create specifications of this kind.",

        "terance is ambiguous since, from a purely structural point of view, it could also be categorized as an Argument swap, however, given world knowledge, this interpretation is rather infelicitous.",

        "If a deeper structure of the sentence’s meaning is built, this would amount to an implication expressing the fact that a triangle with two sides of equal length is a triangle that has two equal angles.",
        "For such a structure, the reconstruction would fall into the next category, exchange of the order of two propositions: here, reversing the implication.",
        "In (10), the lexeme “Saxophonist” needs to be expanded into “Saxophone” and “Spieler” (“player”), prior to performing the exchange.",
        "The fourth category involves a swap of entire Propositions; in the domain of mathematics, this may pertain to formulas.",
        "In (11), swapping applies to the sides of the equation descriptively referred to by the distributivity law.",
        "In (12), this applies to the arguments of the set inclusion relation, when the arguments are interpreted as propositions.",
        "The last example, (13), requires a structural recasting in order to apply the appropriate swapping operation.",
