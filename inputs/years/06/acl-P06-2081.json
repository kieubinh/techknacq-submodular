        "There is now considerable interest in affective language processing.",
        "Work focusses on analysing subjective features of text or speech, such as sentiment, opinion, emotion or point of view (Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002; Dave et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2003; Pang and Lee, 2005; Shanahan et al., 2005).",
        "Discussing affective computing in general, Picard (1997) notes that phenomena vary in duration, ranging from short-lived feelings, through emotions, to moods, and ultimately to long-lived, slowly-changing personality characteristics.",
        "Within computational linguistics, most work has focussed on sentiment and opinion concerning specific entities or events, and on binary classifications of these.",
        "For instance, both Pang and Lee (2002) and Turney (2002) consider the thumbs up/thumbs down decision: is a film review positive or negative?",
        "However, Pang and Lee (2005) point out that ranking items or comparing reviews will benefit from finer-grained classifications, over multiple ordered classes: is a film review two or three or four-star?",
        "And at the same time, some work now considers longer-term affective states.",
        "For example, Mishne (2005) aims to classify the primary mood of weblog postings; the study encompasses both fine-grained (but non-ordered) multiple classification (frustrated/loved/etc.)",
        "and coarse-grained binary classification (active/passive, positive/negative).",
        "This paper is about the move to finer-grained multiple classifications; and also about weblogs.",
        "But it is also about even more persistent affective states; in particular, it focusses on classifying author personality.",
        "We would argue that ongoing work on sentiment analysis or opinion-mining stands to benefit from progress on personality-classification.",
        "The reason is that people vary in personality, and they vary in how they appraise events – and hence, in how strongly they phrase their praise or condemnation.",
        "Reiter and Sripada (2004) suggest that lexical choice may sometimes be determined by a writer’s idiolect – their personal language preferences.",
        "We suggest that while idiolect can be a matter of accident or experience, it may also reflect systematic, personality-based differences.",
        "This can help explain why, as Pang and Lee (2005) note, one person’s four star review is another’s two-star.",
        "To put it more bluntly, if you’re not a very outgoing sort of person, then your thumbs up might be mistaken for someone else’s thumbs down.",
        "But how do we distinguish such people?",
        "Or, if we spot a thumbs-up review, how can we tell whose thumb it is, anyway?",
        "The paper is structured as follows.",
        "It introduces trait theories of personality, notes work to date on personality classification, and raises some questions.",
        "It then outlines the weblog corpus and the experiments, which compare classification accuracies for four personality dimensions, seven tasks, and five feature selection policies.",
        "We discuss the implications of the results, and related work, and end with suggestions for next steps.",
        "Cattell’s pioneering work led to the isolation of 16 primary personality factors, and later work on secondary factors led to Costa and McCrae’s five-factor model, closely related to the ‘Big Five’ models emerging from lexical research (Costa and McCrae, 1992).",
        "Each factor gives a continuous dimension for personality scoring.",
        "These are: Extraversion; Neuroticism; Openness; Agreeableness; and Conscientiousness (Matthews et al., 2003).",
        "Work has also investigated whether scores on these dimensions correlate with language use (Scherer, 1979; Dewaele and Furnham, 1999).",
        "Building on the earlier work of Gottschalk and Gleser, Pennebaker and colleagues secured significant results using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count text analysis program (Pennebaker et al., 2001).",
        "This primarily counts relative frequencies of word-stems in predefined semantic and syntactic categories.",
        "It shows, for instance, that high Neuroticism scorers use: more first person singular and negative emotion words; and fewer articles and positive emotion words (Pennebaker and King, 1999).",
        "So, can a text classifier trained on such features predict the author personality?",
        "We know of only one published study: Argamon et al.",
        "(2005) focussed on Extraversion and Neuroticism, dividing Pennebaker and King’s (1999) population into the top and bottom-third scorers on a dimension, and discarding the middle third.",
        "For both dimensions, using a restricted feature set, they report binary classification accuracy of around 58%: an 8% absolute improvement over their baseline.",
        "Although mood is more malleable, work on it is also relevant (Mishne, 2005).",
        "Using a more typical feature set (including n-grams of words and parts-of-speech), the best mood classification accuracy was 66%, for ‘confused’.",
        "At a coarser grain, moods could be classified with accuracies of 57% (active vs. passive), and 60% (positive vs. negative).",
        "So, Argamon et al.",
        "used a restricted feature set for binary classification on two dimensions: Extraversion and Neuroticism.",
        "Given this, we now pursue three questions.",
        "(1) Can we improve performance on a similar binary classification task?",
        "(2) How accurate can classification be on the other dimensions?",
        "(3) How accurate can multiple – three-way or five-way – classification be?"

        "To enter the Level-III set, an n-gram meeting the Level-II criteria must also be used by at least 50%1 of the individuals within the subgroup for which it is reported to be distinctive.",
        "IV While Level-III guards against excessive individual influence, it may abstract too far from the fine-grained variation within a personality trait.",
        "The final manual set therefore includes only those n-grams that meet the Level-II criteria with p < .001, meet the Level-III criteria, and also correlate significantly (p < .05) with individual personality trait scores.",
        "V Finally, it is possible to allow the n-gram feature set to be selected automatically during training.",
        "The set to be selected from is the broadest of the manually filtered sets, those n-grams that meet the Level-II criteria.",
        "The approach adopted is to use the defaults within the WEKA toolkit: Best First search with the CfsSubsetEval evaluator (Witten and Frank, 1999).",
        "Thus, a key question is when – if ever – a ‘manual’ feature selection policy outperforms the automatic selection carried out under Level-V. Levels-II and III are of particular interest, since they contain features derived from a subset of the corpus.",

        "This paper has reported the first stages of our investigations into classification of author personality from weblog text.",
        "Results are quite promising, and comparable across all four personality traits.",
        "It seems that even a small selection of features found to exhibit an empirical relationship with personality traits can be used to generate reasonably accurate classification results.",
        "Naturally, there are still many paths to explore.",
        "Simple regression analyses are reported in Nowson (2006); however, for classification, a more thorough comparison of different machine learning methodologies is required.",
        "A richer set of features besides n-grams should be checked, and we should not ignore the potential effectiveness of unigrams in this task (Pang et al., 2002).",
        "A completely new test set can be gathered, so as to further guard against overfitting, and to explore systematically the effects of the amount of training data available for each author.",
        "And as just discussed, comparison with human personality classification accuracy is potentially very interesting.",
        "However, it does seem that we are making progress towards being able to deal with a realistic task: if we spot a thumbs-up review in a weblog, we should be able to check other text in that weblog, and tell whose thumb it is; or more accurately, what kind of person’s thumb it is, anyway.",
        "And that in turn should help tell us how high the thumb is really being held."
