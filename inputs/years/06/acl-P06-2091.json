        "Robust parsing technology is one result of the recent fusion between symbolic and statistical approaches in natural language processing and has been applied to tasks such as information extraction, information retrieval and machine translation (Hockenmaier and Steedman, 2002; Miyao et al., 2005).",
        "However, reflecting the field boundary and unestablished interfaces between syntax and semantics in formal theory of grammar, this fusion has achieved less in semantics than in syntax.",
        "For example, a system that translates the output of a robust CCG parser into semantic representations has been developed (Bos et al., 2004).",
        "While its corpus-oriented parser attained high coverage with respect to real text, the expressive power of the resulting semantic representations is confined to first-order predicate logic.",
        "The more elaborate tasks tied to discourse information and plurality, such as resolution of anaphora antecedent, scope ambiguity, presupposition, topic and focus, are required to refer to ‘deeper’ semantic structures, such as dynamic semantics (Groenendijk and Stokhof, 1991).",
        "However, most dynamic semantic theories are not equipped with large-scale syntax that covers more than a small fragment of target languages.",
        "One of a few exceptions is Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS) (Copestake et al., 1999), which is compatible with large-scale HPSG syntax (Pollard and Sag, 1994) and has affinities with UDRS (Reyle, 1993).",
        "For real text, however, its implementation, as in the case of the ERG parser (Copestake and Flickinger, 2000), restricts its target to the static fragment of MRS and yet has a lower coverage than corpus-oriented parsers (Baldwin, to appear).",
        "The lack of transparency between syntax and discourse semantics appears to have created a tension between the robustness of syntax and the descriptive adequacy of semantics.",
        "In the present paper, we will introduce a robust method to obtain dynamic semantic representations based on Typed Dynamic Logic (TDL) (Bekki, 2000) from real text by translating the outputs of a robust HPSG parser (Miyao et al., 2005).",
        "Typed Dynamic Logic is a dynamic plural semantics that formalizes the structure underlying the semantic interactions between quantification, plurality, bound variable/E-type anaphora",
        "discourse/plurality-related information is encapsulated within higher-order structures in TDL, and the analysis remains strictly lexical and compositional, which makes its interface with syntax transparent and straightforward.",
        "This is a significant advantage for achieving robustness in natural language processing."

        "Figure 1 shows a number of propositions defined in (Bekki, 2005), including atomic predicate, negation, conjunction, and anaphoric expression.",
        "Typed Dynamic Logic is described in typed lambda calculus (Gödel’s System T) with four ground types: e(entity), i(index), n(natural number), and t(truth).",
        "While assignment functions in static logic are functions in metalanguage from type e variables (in the case of first-order logic) to objects in the domain De, assignment functions in TDL are functions in object-language from indices to entities.",
        "Typed Dynamic Logic defines the notion context as a set of assignment functions (an object of type (i �-+ e) �-+ t) and a proposition as a function from context to context (an object of type ((i �-+ e) �-+ t) �-+ (i �-+ e) �-+ t).",
        "The conjunctions of two propositions are then defined as composite functions thereof.",
        "This setting conforms to the view of “propositions as information flow”, which is widely accepted in dynamic semantics.",
        "Since all of these higher-order notions are described in lambda terms, the path for compositional type-theoretic semantics based on functional application, functional composition and type raising is clarified.",
        "The derivations of TDL semantic representations for the sentences “A boy ran.",
        "He tumbled.” are exemplified in Figure 2 and Figure 3.",
        "With some instantiation of variables, the semantic representations of these two sentences are simply conjoined and yield a single representation, as shown in (1).",
        "The propositions boy'x1s1, run'e1s1 and agent'e1x1 roughly mean “the entity referred to by x1 is a boy in the situation s1”, “the event referred to by e1 is a running event in the situation s1 ”, and “the agent of event e1 is x1”, respectively.",
        "The former part of (1) that corresponds to the first sentence, filtering and testing the input context, returns the updated context schema-tized in (2).",
        "The updated context is then passed to the latter part, which corresponds to the second sentence as its input.",

        "situation2 .",
        "This mechanism makes anaphoric expressions, such as “He” in “He tumbles”, accessible to its preceding context; namely, the descriptions of their presuppositions can refer to the preceding context compositionally.",
        "Moreover, the referents of the anaphoric expressions are correctly calculated as a result of previous filtering and testing.",
        "Although the antecedent for x2 is not determined in this structure, the possible candidates can be enumerated: x1, s1 and e1, which precede x2.",
        "Since TDL seamlessly represents linguistic notions such as “entity”, “event” and “situation”, by indices, the anaphoric expressions, such as “the event” and “that case”, can be treated in the same manner."
