        "The ability to visualize procedures or instructions is important for understanding documents that guide or instruct us, such as computer manuals or cooking recipes.",
        "We can understand such documents more easily by seeing corresponding figures or animations.",
        "Several researchers have studied the visualization of documents (Coyne and Sproat, 2001), including the generation of animation (Andre and Rist, 1996; Towns et al., 1998).",
        "Such animation systems help people to understand instructions in documents.",
        "Among the various types of documents, this research focuses on the visualization of cooking recipes.",
        "Many studies related to the analysis or generation of cooking recipes have been done (Adachi, 1997; Webber and Eugenio, 1990; Hayashi et al., 2003; Shibata et al., 2003).",
        "Especially, several researchers have proposed animation generation systems in the cooking domain.",
        "Karlin, for example, developed SEAFACT (Semantic Analysis For the Animation of Cooking Tasks), which analyzed verbal modifiers to determine several features of an action, such as the aspectual category of an event, the number of repetitions, duration, speed, and so on (Karlin, 1988).",
        "Uematsu developed “Captain Cook,” which generated animations from cooking recipes written in Japanese (Uematsu et al., 2001).",
        "However, these previous works did not mention the scalability of the systems.",
        "There are many linguistic expressions in the cooking domain, but it is uncertain to what extent these systems can convert them to animations.",
        "This paper also aims at developing a system to generate animations from cooking recipes written in Japanese.",
        "We especially focused on increasing the variety of recipes that could be accepted.",
        "After presenting an overview of our proposed system in Subsections 2.1 and 2.2, the more concrete goals of this paper will be described in Subsection 2.3."

        "When a user does not understand a certain cooking action, he/she can click the highlighted sentence/phrase.",
        "Then the system will show the corresponding animation to help the user understand the cooking instruction.",
        "Note that the system does not show all procedures in a recipe like a movie, but generates an animation of a single action on demand.",
        "Furthermore, we do not aim at the reproduction of recipe sentences in detail.",
        "Especially, we will not prepare object data for many different kinds of ingredients.",
        "For example, suppose that the system has object data for a mackerel, but not for a sardine.",
        "When a user clicks the sentence “fillet a sardine” to see the animation, the system will show how to fillet a “mackerel” instead of “sardine”, with a note indicating that the ingredient is different.",

        "These books explain the fundamental cooking operations with pictures, e.g., how to cut, roast, or remove skins/seeds for various kinds of ingredients.",

        "The definition of basic actions does not depend on the module Animation Generator.",
        "One of the standards for the definition of basic actions is animations generated by the system.",
        "That is, we can define basic cooking actions so that each cooking action corresponds to an unique animation.",
        "This approach seems to be reasonable for an animation generation system; however, it depends on the module Animation Generator in Figure 1.",
        "Many kinds of rendering engines are now available to generate animations.",
        "Therefore, Animation Generator can be implemented in various ways.",
        "When changing the rendering engine used in Animation Generator, the lexicon of cooking actions must also be changed.",
        "So we decided that it would not be desirable to define the set of basic actions according to their corresponding animations.",
        "In our framework, the definition of basic actions in the lexicon does not depend on Animation Generator.",

        "In this case, we can regard both as representing the same action: to sprinkle a kind of condiment.",
        "In this case, the lexicon of ingredients (see 4.2.2) would be helpful for matching.",
        "That is, if both ౜ਏࢠ (chili) and tk (salt) have the same feature “kind=condiment” in the lexicon of ingredients, we can judge that the phrase “౜ਏࢠ/Λ/;6 (sprinkle chili)” corresponds to the basic action “tk/Λ/;6 (sprinkle salt)”.",
        "• Inconsistency in verbs",
        "Disagreement between verbs in a recipe and the lexicon is one of the major causes of inconsistency.",
        "See Figure 5 (c), for instance.",
        "These two phrases represent the same action 5, but the linguistic expressions are totally different.",
        "In this case, the matching between them is rather difficult.",
        "One solution would be to describe all equivalent expressions for each action in the lexicon.",
        "Since it is not realistic to list equivalent expressions exhaustively, however, we want to automatically collect pairs of equivalent expressions from a large recipe corpus."

        "In this paper, we have described the basic idea for a system to generate animations for cooking actions in recipes.",

        "First, we designed a lexicon of cooking actions including information about action plans and ingredient requirements, which are needed to generate the appropriate cooking animations.",
        "We also showed that our lexicon covers most of the cooking actions appearing in recipes.",
        "Furthermore, we analyzed the recipe corpus and investigated how to match actions in a recipe to the corresponding basic action in the lexicon, even when they have different linguistic expressions.",
        "Such a flexible matching method would also increase the scalability of the system."
