        "The creation of the Arabic Treebank (ATB) and Arabic Gigaword (AG) facilitates corpus based studies of many interesting linguistic phenomena in Modern Standard Arabic (MSA).1 The ATB comprises manually annotated morphological and syntactic analyses of newswire text from different Arabic sources, while the AG is simply a huge collection of raw Arabic newswire text.",
        "In our ongoing project, we exploit the ATB and AG to determine the best features for the novel task of automatically creating lexical semantic verb classes",
        "for MSA.",
        "We are interested in the problem of classifying verbs in MSA into groups that share semantic elements of meaning as they exhibit similar syntactic behavior.",
        "This manner of classifying verbs in a language is mainly advocated by Levin (1993).",
        "The Levin Hypothesis (LH) contends that verbs that exhibit similar syntactic behavior share element(s) of meaning.",
        "There exists a relatively extensive classification of English verbs according to different syntactic alternations.",
        "Numerous linguistic studies of other languages illustrate that LH holds cross linguistically, in spite of variations in the verb class assignment.",
        "For example, in a wide cross-linguistic study, Guerssel et al. (1985) found that the Conative Alternation exists in the Austronesian language Warlpiri.",
        "As in English, the alternation is found with hit and cut-type verbs, but not with touch and break-type verbs.",
        "A strong version of the LH claims that comparable syntactic alternations hold cross-linguistically.",
        "Evidence against this strong version of LH is presented by Jones et al. (1994).",
        "For the purposes of this paper, we maintain that although the syntactic alternations will differ across languages, the semantic similarities that they signal will hold cross linguistically.",
        "For Arabic, a significant test of LH has been the work of Fareh and Hamdan (2000), who argue the existence of the Locative Alternation in Jordanian Arabic.",
        "However, to date no general study of MSA verbs and alternations exists.",
        "We address this problem by automatically inducing such classes, exploiting explicit syntactic and morphological information in the ATB using unsupervised clustering techniques.",
        "This paper is an extension of our previous work in Snider and Diab (2006), which found a preliminary effect of syntactic frames on the precision of MSA verb clustering.",
        "In this work, we find",
        "Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics effects of three more features, and report results using both precision and recall.",
        "This project is inspired by previous approaches to automatically induce lexical semantic classes for English verbs, which have met with success (Merlo and Stevenson, 2001; Schulte im Walde, 2000) , comparing their results with manually created Levin verb classes.",
        "However, Arabic morphology has well known correlations with the kind of event structure that forms the basis of the Levin classification.",
        "(Fassi-Fehri, 2003).",
        "This characteristic of the language makes this a particularly interesting task to perform in MSA.",
        "Thus, the scientific goal of this project is to determine the features that best aid verb clustering, particularly the language-specific features that are unique to MSA and related languages.",
        "Inducing such classes automatically allows for a large-scale study of different linguistic phenomena within the MSA verb system, as well as cross-linguistic comparison with their English counterparts.",
        "Moreover, drawing on generalizations yielded by such a classification could potentially be useful in several NLP problems such as Information Extraction, Event Detection, Information Retrieval and Word Sense Disambiguation, not to mention the facilitation of lexical resource creation such as MSA WordNets and ontologies.",
        "Unfortunately, a gold standard resource comparable to Levin’s English classification for evaluation does not exist in MSA.",
        "Therefore, in this paper, as before, we evaluate the quality of the automatically induced MSA verb classes both qualitatively and quantitatively against a noisy MSA translation of Levin classes in an attempt to create such classes for MSA verbs.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes Levin classes for English; Section 3 describes some relevant previous work; In Section 4 we discuss relevant phenomena of MSA morphology and syntax; In Section 5, we briefly describe the clustering algorithm; Section 6 gives a detailed account of the features we use to induce the verb clusters; Then, Section 7, describes our evaluation data, metric, gold standard and results; In Section 8, we discuss the results and draw on some quantitative and qualitative observations of the data; Finally, we conclude this paper in Section 9 with concluding remarks and a look into future directions."

        "Many verbs are in multiple classes both due to the inherent polysemy of the verbs as well as other aspectual variations such as argument structure preferences.",
        "As an example of the latter, a verb such as eat occurs in two different classes; one defined by the Unspecified Object Alternation where it can appear both with and without an explicit direct object, and another defined by the Connative Alternation where its second argument appears either as a direct object or the object of the preposition at.",
        "It is important to note that the Levin classes aim to group verbs based on their event structure, reflecting aspectual and manner similarities rather than similarity due to their describing the same or similar events.",
        "Therefore, the semantic class similarity in Levin classes is coarser grained than what one would expect resulting from a semantic classification based on distributional similarity such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) algorithms.",
        "For illustration, one would expect an LSA algorithm to group skate, rollerblade in one class and bicycle, motorbike, scooter in another; yet Levin puts them all in the same class based on their syntactic behavior, which reflects their common event structure: an activity with a possible causative participant.",

        "Pro-drop is a common phenomenon in Romance languages, as well as Semitic languages, where the subject is implicit and the only indicator of a subject is incorporated in the conjugation of the verb.",
        "According to work on information structure in discourse (Vallduvi, 1992), pro-drop tends to occur with more given and animate subjects.",
        "To capture this generalization, we add a feature for the frequency with which a given verb occurs without an explicit subject.",

        "If only syntactic alternation features are taken into account, the different pattern forms of the same root could still be clustered together; however, our design of the pattern feature does not allow for variation in the lemma form, therefore, we are in effect preventing the useful exploitation of the pattern information.",
        "Further evidence comes from the positive effect of the LSA feature, which effectively clusters together these productive patterns hence yielding the significant impact on the clustering.",
        "Overall, the scores that we report use the evaluation metric that equally weights precision and recall.",
        "This metric disfavors clusters that are too large or too small.",
        "Models perform better when the average size of HYP is the same as that of GOLD.",
        "It is worth noting that comparing our current results to those obtained in Snider & Diab (2006), we show a significant improvement given the same precision oriented metric.",
        "In the same condition settings, our previous results are an F0 score of 0.51 and in this study, a precision oriented metric yields a significant improvement of 17 absolute points, at an F,a score of 0.68.",
        "Even though we do not report this number as the main result of our study, we tend to have more confidence in it due to the noise associated with the GOLD set.",
        "The score of the best parameter settings with respect to the baseline is considerable given the novelty of the task and lack of good quality resources for evaluation.",
        "Moreover, there is no reason to expect that there would be perfect alignment between the Arabic clusters and the corresponding translated Levin clusters, primarily because of the quality of the translation, but also because there is unlikely to be an isomorphism between English and Arabic lexical semantics, as assumed here as a means of approximating the problem.",
        "In fact, it would be quite noteworthy if we did find a high level of agreement.",
        "In an attempt at a qualitative analysis of the resulting clusters, we manually examine four HYP clusters.",
        "• The first cluster includes the verbs >alogaY [meet], $ahid [view], >ajoraY [run an interview], {isotagobal [receive a guest], Eaqad [hold a conference], >aSodar [issue].",
        "We note that they all share the concept of convening, or formal meetings.",
        "The verbs are clearly related in terms of their event structure (they are all activities, without an associated change of state) yet are not semantically similar.",
        "Therefore, our clustering approach yields a classification that is on par with the Levin classes in the coarseness of the cluster membership granularity.",
        "• The second consists of *akar [mention], >afAd [report] which is evaluated against the GOLD cluster class comprising the verbs >aEolan [announce], >a$Ar [indicate], *akar [mention], >afAd [report], Sar – aH [report/confirm], $ahid [relay/witness], ka$af [uncover] corresponding to the Say Verb Levin class.",
        "The HYP cluster, though correct, loses significantly on recall.",
        "This is due to the low frequency of some of the verbs in the GOLD set, which in turn affects the overall score of this HYP cluster.",
        "• Finally, the HYP cluster comprising Eamil [work continuously on], jA’ [occur], {isotamar [continue], zAl [remain], bagiy [remain], jaraY [occur] corresponds to the Occurrence Verb Levin class.",
        "The corresponding GOLD class comprises jA’ [occur], HaSal [happen], jaraY[occur].",
        "The HYP cluster contains most of the relevant verbs and adds others that would fall in that same class such as {isotamar [continue], zAl [remain], bagiy [remain], since they have similar syntactic diagnostics where they do not appear in the transitive uses and with locative inversions.",
        "However they are not found in the Levin English class since it is not a comprehensive listing of all English verbs.",
        "In summary, we observe very interesting clusters of verbs which indeed require more in depth lexical semantic study as MSA verbs in their own right.",
        "We found new features that help us successfully perform the novel task of applying clustering techniques to verbs acquired from the ATB and AG to induce lexical semantic classes for MSA verbs.",
        "In doing this, we find that the quality of the clusters is sensitive to the inclusion of information about the syntactic frames, word co-occurence (LSA), and animacy of the subject, as well as parameters of the clustering algorithm such as the number of clusters, and number of verbs clustered.",
        "Our classification performs well with respect to a gold standard clusters produced by noisy translations of English verbs in the Levin classes.",
        "Our best clustering condition when we use all frame information and the most frequent verbs in the ATB and a high number of clusters outperforms a random baseline by F0=1 difference of 0.251.",
        "This analysis leads us to conclude that the clusters are induced from the structure in the data Our results are reported with a caveat on the gold standard data.",
        "We are in the process of manually cleaning the English translations corresponding to the MSA verbs.",
        "Moreover, we are exploring the possibility of improving the gold standard clusters by examining the lexical semantic attributes of the MSA verbs.",
        "We also plan to add semantic word co-occurrence information via other sources besides LSA, to determine if having semantic components in addition to the argument structure component improves the quality of the clusters.",
        "Further semantic information will be acquired from a WordNet similarity of the cleaned translated English verbs.",
        "In the long term, we envision a series of psycholinguistic experiments with native speakers to determine which Arabic verbs group together based on their argument structure.",
        "Acknowledgements We would like to thank three anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments.",
        "We would like to acknowledge Nizar Habash for supplying us with a pattern and root list for MSA verb lemmas.",
