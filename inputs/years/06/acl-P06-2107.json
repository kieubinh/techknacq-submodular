        "The accepted prefix and the new corrected character can be used by the system to propose a new suggestion to complete the prefix.",

        "This assumption does not correspond to the characteristics of natural language; in some cases, we need to know a word group in order to obtain a correct translation.",
        "One initiative for overcoming the above-mentioned restriction of single-word models is known as the template-based approach (Och, 2002).",
        "In this approach, an entire group of adjacent words in the source sentence may be aligned with an entire group of adjacent target words.",
        "As a result, the context of words has a greater influence and the changes in word order from source to target language can be learned explicitly.",
        "A template establishes the reordering between two sequences of word classes.",
        "However, the lexical model continues to be based on word-to-word correspondence.",
        "A simple alternative to these models has been proposed, the phrase-based (PB) approach (Tom´as and Casacuberta, 2001; Marcu and Wong, 2002; Zens et al., 2002).",
        "The principal innovation of the phrase-based alignment model is that it attempts to calculate the translation probabilities of word sequences (phrases) rather than of only single words.",
        "These methods explicitly learn the probability of a",
        "sequence of words in a source sentence (�s) being translated as another sequence of words in the target sentence (�t).",
        "To define the PB model, we segment the source sentence s�1 into K phrases (�sK1) and the target sentence t�1 into K phrases (�tK1).",
        "A uniform probability distribution over all possible segmentations is assumed.",
        "If we assume a monotone alignment, that is, the target phrase in position k is produced only by the source phrase in the same position (Tom´as and Casacuberta, 2001) we get:",

        "A phrase can be comprised of a single word (but empty phrases are not allowed).",
        "Thus, the conventional word to word statistical dictionary is included.",
        "If we permit the reordering of the target phrases, a hidden phrase level alignment variable, aK1, is introduced.",

        "(4) where the distortion model p(ak I ak-1) (the probability of aligning the target segment k with the source segment ak) depends only on the previous alignment ak-1 (first order model).",
        "For the distortion model, it is also assumed that an alignment depends only on the distance of the two phrases (Och and Ney, 2000):",
        "There are different approaches to the parameter estimation.",
        "The first one corresponds to a direct learning of the parameters of equations 3 or 4 from a sentence-aligned corpus using a maximum likelihood approach (Tom´as and Casacuberta, 2001; Marcu and Wong, 2002).",
        "The second one is heuristic and tries to use a word-aligned corpus (Zens et al., 2002; Koehn et al., 2003).",
