        "The text analysis process is responsible for converting the non-textual content into text.",
        "This process also involves tokenization and normalization of the text.",
        "The identification of words or chunks of text is called text-tokenization.",
        "Text normalization establishes the correct interpretation of the input text by expanding the abbreviations and acronyms.",
        "This is done by replacing the non-alphabetic characters, numbers, and punctuation with appropriate text strings depending on the context.",
        "The linguistic analysis process involves finding the correct pronunciation of words, and assigning prosodic features (eg.",
        "phrasing, intonation, stress) to the phonemic string to be spoken.",
        "The final process of a TTS system is waveform generation which involves the production of an acoustic digital signal using a particular synthesis approach such as formant synthesis, articulatory synthesis or waveform concatenation (Lemmetty, 1999).",
        "The text analysis and linguistic analysis processes together are known as the Natural Language Processing (NLP) component, while the waveform generation process is known as the Digital Signal Processing (DSP) component of a TTS System (Dutoit, 1997).",
        "Finding correct pronunciation for a given word is one of the first and most significant tasks in the linguistic analysis process.",
        "The component which is responsible for this task in a TTS system is often named the Grapheme-To-Phoneme (G2P), Text-to-Phone or Letter-To-Sound (LTS) conversion module.",
        "This module accepts a word and generates the corresponding phonemic transcription.",
        "Further, this phonemic transcription can be annotated with appropriate prosodic markers (Syllables, Accents, Stress etc) as well.",
        "In this paper, we describe the implementation and evaluation of a G2P conversion model for a Sinhala TTS system.",
        "A Sinhala TTS system is being developed based on Festival, the open source speech synthesis framework.",
        "Letter to sound conversion for Sinhala usually has simple one to one mapping between orthography and phonemic transcription for most Sinhala letters.",

        "One of the easiest ways of G2P conversion is the use of a lexicon or pronunciation dictionary.",
        "A lexicon consists of a large list of words together with their pronunciation.",
        "There are several limitations to the use of lexicons.",
        "It is practically impossible to construct such to cover the whole vocabulary of a language owing to Zipfian phenomena.",
        "Though a large lexicon is constructed, one would face other limitations such as efficient access, memory storage etc.",
        "Most lexicons often do not include many proper names, and only very few provide pronunciations for abbreviations and acronyms.",
        "Only a few lexicons provide distinct entries for morphological productions of words.",
        "In addition, pronunciations of some words differ based on the context and their parts-of-speech.",
        "Further, an enormous effort has to be made to develop a comprehensive lexicon.",
        "In practical scenarios, speech synthesizers as well as speech recognizers need to be able to produce the pronunciation of words that are not in the lexicon.",
        "Names, morphological productivity and numbers are the three most important cases that cause the use of lexica to be impractical (Juraf-sky and Martin, 2000).",
        "To overcome these difficulties, rules can be specified on how letters can be mapped to phonemes.",
        "In this way, the size of the lexicon can be reduced as only to contain exceptions to the rules.",
        "In contrast to the above fact, some systems rely on using very large lexicons, together with a set of letter-to-sound conversion rules to deal with words which are not found in the lexicon (Black and Lenzo, 2003).",
        "These language and context dependent rules are formulated using phonetic and linguistic knowledge of a particular language.",
        "The complexity of devising a set of rules for a particular language is dependent on the degree of correspondence between graphemes and phonemes.",
        "For some languages such as English and French, the relationship is complex and require large numbers of rules (El-Imam and Don, 2005; Damper et al., 1998), while some languages such as Urdu (Hussain, 2004), and Hindi (Ramakish-nan et al., 2004; Choudhury, 2003) show regular behavior and thus pronunciation can be modeled by defining fairly regular simple rules.",

        "In this paper, the problem of Sinhala grapheme-to-phoneme conversion is addressed with a special focus on dealing with the schwa epenthesis.",

        "There are no other approaches available for the transcription of Sinhala text that provides a platform for comparison of the proposed rule-based method.",
        "The empirical evidence from a wide spectrum Sinhala corpus indicates that the proposed model can account for nearly 98% of cases accurately.",
