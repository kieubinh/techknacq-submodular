        "Owing to the limitation of vital capacity and contextual information, breaks or pauses are always an important ingredient of human speech.",
        "They play a great role in signaling structural boundaries.",
        "Similarly, in the area of text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, assigning breaks is very crucial to naturalness and intelligibility, particularly in long sentences.",
        "The challenge in achieving naturalness mainly results from prosody generation in TTS synthesis.",
        "Generally speaking, prosody deals with phrasing, loudness, duration and speech intonation.",
        "Among these prosodic features, phrasing divides utterances into meaningful chunks of information, called hierarchic breaks.",
        "However, there is no unique solution to prosodic phrasing in most cases.",
        "Different solution in phrasing can result in different meaning that a listener could perceive.",
        "Considering its importance, recent TTS research has focused on automatic prediction of prosodic phrase based on the part-of-speech (POS) feature or syntactic structure(Black and Taylor, 1994; Klatt, 1987; Wightman, 1992; Hirschberg 1996; Wang, 1995; Taylor and Black, 1998).",
        "To our understanding, POS is a grammar-based structure that can be extracted from text.",
        "There is no explicit relationship between POS and the prosodic structure.",
        "At least, in Mandarin speech synthesis, we cannot derive the prosodic structure from POS sequence directly.",
        "By contrast, a word carries rich information related to phonetic feature.",
        "For example, in Mandarin, a word can reveal many phonetic features such as pronunciation, syllable number, stress pattern, tone, light tone (if available) and retroflexion (if available) etc.",
        "So we begin to explore the role of word in predicting prosodic phrase and propose a word-based statistical method for prosodic-phrase grouping.",
        "This method chooses Hidden Markov Model (HMM) as the training and predicting model."

        "One is that there is no explicit relationship between text and phonetic features.",
        "The other lies in the ambiguity of word segmentation, POS tagging and parsing in the Chinese natural language processing.",
        "As a result, the input information for the prediction of prosodic phrase is quite “noisy”.",
        "We can find that most of published methods, including (Chen et al., 1996; Chen et al., 2000; Chou et al., 1996; Chou et al., 1997; Gu et al., 2000; Hu et al., 2000; Lv et al., 2001; Qian et al., 2001; Ying and Shi, 2001) do not make use of high-level syntactic features due to two reasons.",

        "Proceedings of the COLING/ACL 2006 Main Conference Poster Sessions, pages 977–982, Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics morphologies also causes many problems in parsing.",
        "Secondly, the syntactic structure is not isomorphic to the prosodic phrase structure.",
        "Prosodic phrasing remains an open task in the Chinese speech generation.",
