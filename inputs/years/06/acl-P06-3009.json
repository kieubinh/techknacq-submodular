        "The structure of Semitic languages poses clear challenges to this traditional division of labor.",
        "Specifically, Semitic languages demonstrate strong interaction between morphological and syntactic processing, which limits the applicability of standard tools for, e.g., parsing.",
        "This work focuses on MH and explores the ways morphological and syntactic processing interact.",
        "Using a morphological analyzer, a part-of-speech tagger, and a PCFG-based general-purpose parser, we segment and parse MH sentences based on a small, annotated corpus.",
        "Our integrated model shows that percolating morphological ambiguity to the lowest level of non-terminals in the syntactic parse tree improves parsing accuracy.",
        "1E.g., phonological, morphological, syntactic, semantic and pragmatic.",
        "Moreover, we show that morphological cues facilitate syntactic disambiguation.",
        "A particular contribution of this work is to demonstrate that MH statistical parsing is feasible.",
        "Yet, the results obtained are not comparable to those of, e.g., state-of-the-art models for English, due to remaining syntactic ambiguity and limited morphological treatment.",
        "We conjecture that adequate morphological and syntactic processing of MH should be done in a unified framework, in which both levels can interact and share information in both directions.",
        "Section 2 presents linguistic data that demonstrate the strong interaction between morphology and syntax in MH, thus motivating our choice to treat both in the same framework.",
        "Section 3 surveys previous work and demonstrates again the unavoidable interaction between the two.",
        "Section 4.1 puts forward the formal setting of an integrated probabilistic language model, followed by the evaluation metrics defined for the integrated task in section 4.2.",
        "Sections 4.3 and 4.4 then describe the experimental setup and preliminary results for our baseline implementation, and section 5 discusses more sophisticated models we intend to investigate."

        "Phrases and sentences in MH, as well as Arabic and other Semitic languages, have a relatively free word order.2 In figure 1, for example, two distinct syntactic structures express the same grammatical relations.",
        "It is typically morphological information rather than word order that provides cues for structural dependencies (e.g., agreement on gender and number in figure 1 reveals the subject-predicate dependency).",
        "Furthermore, boundaries of constituents in the syntactic structure of MH sentences need not coincide with word boundaries, as illustrated in figure 2.",
        "A MH word may coincide with a single constituent, as in ‘ica’ 3 (go out), it may overlap with an entire phrase, as in ‘h ild’ (the boy), or it may span across phrases as in ‘w kf m h bit’ (and when from the house).",
        "Therefore, we conclude that in order to perform syntactic analysis (parsing) of MH sentences, we must first identify the morphological constituents that form MH words.",
        "There are (at least) three distinct morphological processes in Semitic languages that play a role in word formation.",
        "Derivational morphology is a non-concatenative process in which verbs, nouns, and adjectives are derived from (tri-)consonantal roots plugged into templates of consonant/vowel skeletons.",
        "The word-forms in table 1, for example, are all derived from the same root, [i] [l] [d] (child, birth), plugged into different templates.",
        "In addition, MH has a rich array of agreement features, such as gender, number and person, expressed in the word’s inflectional morphology.",
        "Verbs, adjectives, determiners and numerals must agree on the inflectional features with the noun they comple",

        "mark templates’ slots for consonantal roots, (..) mark obligatory doubling of roots’ consonants.)",
        "ment or modify.",
        "It can be seen in table 2 that the suffix h alters the noun ‘ild’ (child) as well as its modifier ‘gdwl’ (big) to feminine gender.",
        "Finally, particles that are prefixed to the word may serve different syntactic functions, yet a multiplicity of them may be concatenated together with the stem to form a single word.",
        "The word ‘wkfmhbit’ in figure 2, for instance, is formed from a conjunction w (and), a relativizer kf (when), a preposition m (from), a definite article h (the) and a noun bit (house).",
        "Identifying such particles is crucial for analyzing syntactic structures as they reveal structural dependencies such as subordinate clauses, adjuncts, and prepositional phrase attachments.",
        "At the same time, MH exhibits a large-scale ambiguity already at the word level, which means that there are multiple ways in which a word can be broken down to its constituent morphemes.",
        "This is further complicated by the fact that most vocalization marks (diacritics) are omitted in MH texts.",
        "To illustrate, table 3 lists two segmentation possibilities, four readings, and five meanings of different morphological analyses for the word-form ‘fmnh’ .4 Yet, the morphological analysis of a word-form, and in particular its morphological segmentation, cannot be disambiguated without reference to context, and various morphological features of syntactically related forms provide useful hints for morphological disambiguation.",
        "Figure 3 shows the correct analyses of the form ‘fmnh’ in different syntactic contexts.",
        "Note that the correct analyses maintain agreement on gender and number between the noun and its modifier.",
        "In particular, the analysis ‘that counted’ (b)",
        "is easily disambiguated, as it is the only one maintaining agreement with the modified noun.",
        "In light of the above, we would want to conclude that syntactic processing must precede morphological analysis; however, this would contradict our previous conclusion.",
        "For this reason, independent morphological and syntactic analyzers for MH will not suffice.",
        "We suggest performing morphological and syntactic processing of MH utterances in a single, integrated, framework, thereby allowing shared information to support disambiguation in multiple tasks."

        "(Sima’an et al., 2001) present an attempt to parse MH sentences based on a small, annotated corpus by applying a general-purpose Tree-gram model.",
        "However, their work presupposes correct morphological disambiguation prior to parsing.5 In order to treat morphological phenomena a few standalone morphological analyzers have been developed for MH.6 Most analyzers consider words in isolation, and thus propose multiple analyses for each word.",
