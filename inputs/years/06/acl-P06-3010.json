        "Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is concerned with the identification of the correct sense of an ambiguous word given its context.",
        "Although it can be thought of as an independent task, its importance is more easily realized when it is applied to particular tasks, such as Information Retrieval or Machine Translation (MT).",
        "In MT, the application we are focusing on, a WSD (or translation disambiguation) module should identify the correct translation for a source word when options with different meanings are available.",
        "As shown by Vickrey et al.",
        "(2005), we believe that a WSD module can significantly improve the performance of MT systems, provided that such module is developed following specific requirements of MT, e.g., employing multilingual sense repositories.",
        "Differences between monolingual and multilingual WSD are very significant for MT, since it is concerned only with the ambiguities that appear in the translation (Hutchins and Sommers, 1992).",
        "In this paper we present a novel approach for WSD, designed focusing on MT.",
        "It follows a hybrid strategy, i.e., knowledge and corpus-based, and employs a highly expressive relational formalism to represent both the examples and background knowledge.",
        "This approach allows the exploitation of several knowledge sources, together with evidences provided by examples of disambiguation, both automatically extracted from lexical resources and sense tagged corpora.",
        "This is achieved using Inductive Logic Programming (Muggleton, 1991), which has not been exploited for WSD so far.",
        "In this paper we investigate the disambiguation of 7 highly ambiguous verbs in English-Portuguese MT, using knowledge from 7 syntactic, semantic and pragmatic sources.",
        "In what follows, we first present some related approaches on WSD for MT, focusing oh their limitations (Section 2).",
        "We then give some basic concepts on Inductive Logic Programming and describe our approach (Section 3).",
        "Finally, we present our initial experiments and the results achieved (Section 4)."

        "Many approaches have been proposed for WSD, but only a few are designed for specific applications, such as MT.",
        "Existing multilingual approaches can be classified as (a) knowledge-based approaches, which make use of linguistic knowledge manually codified or extracted from lexical resources (Pedersen, 1997; Dorr and Katsova, 1998); (b) corpus-based approaches, which make use of knowledge automatically acquired from text using machine learning algorithms (Lee, 2002; Vickrey et al., 2005); and (c) hybrid approaches, which employ techniques from the two other approaches (Zinovj eva, 2000).",
        "Proceedings of the COLING/ACL 2006 Student Research Workshop, pages 55–60, Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics Hybrid approaches potentially explore the advantages of both other strategies, yielding accurate and comprehensive systems.",
        "However, they are quite rare, even in monolingual contexts (Stevenson and Wilks, 2001, e.g.), and they are not able to integrate and use knowledge coming from corpus and other resources during the learning process.",
        "In fact, current hybrid approaches usually employ knowledge sources in preprocessing steps, and then use machine learning algorithms to combine disambiguation evidence from those sources.",
        "This strategy is necessary due to the limitations of the formalism used to represent examples in the machine learning process: the propositional formalism, which structures data in attribute-value vectors.",
        "Even though it is known that great part of the knowledge regarding to languages is relational (e.g., syntactic or semantic relations among words in a sentence) (Mooney, 1997), the propositional formalism traditionally employed makes unfeasible the representation of substantial relational knowledge and the use of this knowledge during the learning process.",
        "According to the attribute-value representation, one attribute has to be created for every feature, and the same structure has to be used to characterize all the examples.",
        "In order to represent the syntactic relations between every pair of words in a sentence, e.g., it will be necessary to create at least one attribute for each possible relation (Figure 1).",
        "This would result in an enormous number of attributes, since the possibilities can be many in distinct sentences.",
        "Also, there could be more than one pair with the same relation.",
        "Sentence: John gave to Mary a big cake.",
        "verb1-subj1 verb 1-obj1 mod1-obj1 ... givejohn give-cake big-cake ...",
        "Given that some types of information are not available for certain instances, many attributes will have null values.",
        "Consequently, the representation of the sample data set tends to become highly sparse.",
        "It is well-known that sparseness on data ensue serious problems to the machine learning process in general (Brown and Kros, 2003).",
        "Certainly, data will become sparser as more knowledge about the examples is considered, and the problem will be even more critical if relational knowledge is used.",
        "Therefore, at least three relevant problems arise from the use of a propositional representation in corpus-based and hybrid approaches: (a) the limitation on its expressiveness power, making it difficult to represent relational and other more complex knowledge; (b) the sparseness in data; and (c) the lack of integration of the evidences provided by examples and linguistic knowledge."

        "It allows the efficient representation of substantial knowledge about the problem, and allows this knowledge to be used during the learning process.",
