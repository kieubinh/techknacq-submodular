        "Since the seminal work of Bolt (Bolt, 1980), the methods applied to multimodal interaction (MMI) have diverged towards unreconcilable approaches retrofitted to models not specifically amenable to the problem.",
        "For example, the representational differences between neural networks, decision trees, and finite-state machines (Johnston and Bangalore, 2000) have limited the adoption of the results using these models, and the typical reliance on the use of whole unimodal sentences defeats one of the main advantages of MMI - the ability to constrain the search using cross-modal information as early as possible.",
        "CLAVIUS is the result of an effort to combine sensing technologies for several modality types, speech and video-tracked gestures chief among them, within the immersive virtual environment (Boussemart, 2004) shown in Figure 1.",
        "Its purpose is to comprehend multimodal phrases such as “put this \\ here \\ .”, for pointing gestures \\, in either command-based or dialogue interaction.",
        "CLAVIUS provides a flexible, and trainable new bidirectional parsing algorithm on multidimensional input spaces, and produces modality-independent semantic interpretation with a low computational cost."

        "Unification grammars on typed directed acyclic graphs have been explored previously in MMI, but typically extend existing mechanisms not designed for multidimensional input.",
        "For example, both (Holzapfel et al., 2004) and (Johnston, 1998) essentially adapt Earley’s chart parser by representing edges as sets of references to terminal input elements - unifying these as new edges are added to the agenda.",
        "In practice this has led to systems that analyze every possible subset of the input resulting in a combinatorial explosion that balloons further when considering the complexities of cross-sentential phenomena such as anaphora, and the effects of noise and uncertainty on speech and gesture tracking.",
        "We will later show the extent to which CLAVIUS reduces the size of the search space.",
        "Proceedings of the COLING/ACL 2006 Student Research Workshop, pages 85–90, Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics Directed graphs conveniently represent both syntactic and semantic structure, and all partial parses in CLAVIUS , including terminal-level input, are represented graphically.",

        "Our parsing strategy combines bottom-up and top-down approaches, but differs from other approaches to bidirectional chart parsing (Rocio, 1998) in several key respects, discussed below.",
        "A defining characteristic of our approach is that edges are selected asynchronously by two concurrent processing threads, rather than serially in a two-stage process.",
        "In this way, we can distribute processing across multiple machines, or dynamically alter the priorities given to each thread.",
        "Generally, this allows for a more dynamic process where no thread can dominate the other.",
        "In typical bidirectional chart parsing the top-down component is only activated when the bottom-up component has no more legal expansions (Ageno, 2000).",
        "Alhough evidence suggests that deictic gestures overlap or follow corresponding spoken pronomials 85-93% of the time (Kettebekov et al.,",
        "2002), we must allow for all possible permutations of multidimensional input - as in “put \\ this \\ here.” vs. “put this \\ here \\ .”, for example.",
        "We therefore take the unconvential approach of placing no mandatory ordering constraints on constituents, hence the rule F abc : A ) BC parses the input “ C B”.",
        "We show how we can easily maintain regular temporal ordering in §3.5.",
        "Whereas existing bidirectional chart parsers maintain fully-qualified edges by incrementally adding adjacent input words to the agenda, CLAVIUS has the ability to construct parses that instantiate only a subset of their constituents, so F abc also parses the input “B”, for example.",

        "Naturally, if rule Fi has more than one constituent (c > 1) of type CATEGORY('Pg), then c new parses are created, each with one of these being instantiated.",
        "Since the GENERALISER is activated as soon as input is added to °[G], the process is interactive (Tomita, 1985), and therefore incorporates the associated benefits of efficiency.",
