        "Language testing, aimed to assess learners’ language ability, is an essential part of language teaching and learning.",
        "Among all kinds of tests, grammar test is commonly used in every educational assessment and is included in well-established standardized tests like TOEFL (Test of English as Foreign Language).",
        "Larsen-Freeman (1997) defines grammar is made of three dimensions: form, meaning, and use (See Figure 1).",
        "Hence, the goal of a grammar test is to test learners to use grammar accurately, meaningfully, and appropriately.",
        "Consider the possessive case of the personal noun in English.",
        "The possessive form comprises an apostrophe and the letter “s”.",
        "For example, the possessive form of the personal noun “Mary” is “Mary’s”.",
        "The grammatical meaning of the possessive case can be (1) showing the ownership: “Mary’s book is on the table.” (= a book that belongs to Mary); (2) indicating the relationship: “Mary’s sister is a student.” (=the sister that Mary has).Therefore, a comprehensive grammar question needs to examine learners’ grammatical knowledge from all three aspects (morphosyntax, semantics and pragmatics).",
        "The most common way of testing grammar is the multiple-choice test (Kathleen and Kenji, 1996).",
        "Multiple-choice test format on grammaticality consists of two kinds: one is the traditional multiple-choice test and the other is the error detection test.",
        "Figure 2 shows a typical example of traditional multiple-choice item.",
        "As for Figure 3, it shows a sample of error detection question.",
        "Traditional multiple-choice is composed of three components, where we define the sentence with a gap as the stem, the correct choice to the gap as the key and the other incorrect choices as the distractors.",
        "For instance, in Figure 2, the",
        "Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics partially blanked sentence acts as the stem and the key “more than” is accompanied by three distractors of “as much as”, “up as”, and “as many to”.",
        "On the other hand, error detection item consists of a partially underlined sentence (stem) where one choice of the underlined part represents the error (key) and the other underlined parts act as distractors to distract test takers.",
        "In Figure 3, the stem is “Although maple trees are among the most colorful varieties in the fall, they lose its leaves sooner than oak trees.” and “its” is the key with distractors “among”, “in the fall”, and “sooner than.” In the Great Smoky Mountains, one can see _____ 150 different kinds of tress.",
        "Grammar tests are widely used to assess learners’ grammatical competence, however, it is costly to manually design these questions.",
        "In recent years, some attempts (Coniam, 1997; Mitkov and Ha, 2003; Liu et al., 2005) have been made on the automatic generation of language testing.",
        "Nevertheless, no attempt has been made to generate English grammar tests.",
        "Additionally, previous research merely focuses on generating questions of traditional multiple-choice task, no attempt has been made for the generation of error detection test types.",
        "In this paper, we present a novel approach to generate grammar tests of traditional multiple-choice and error detection types.",
        "First, by analyzing syntactic structure of English sentences, we constitute a number of patterns for the development of structural tests.",
        "For example, a verb-related pattern requiring an infinitive as the complement (e.g., the verb “tend”) can be formed from the sentence “The weather tends to improve in May.” For each pattern, distractors are created for the completion of each grammar question.",
        "As in the case of foregoing sentence, wrong alternatives are constructed by changing the verb “improve” into different forms: “to improving”, “improve”, and “improving.” Then, we collect authentic sentences from the Web as the source of the tests.",
        "Finally, by applying different generation strategies, grammar tests in two test formats are produced.",
        "A complete grammar question is generated as shown in Figure 4.",
        "Intuitively, based on certain surface pattern (See Figure 5), computer is able to compose a grammar question presented in Figure 4.",
        "We have implemented a prototype system FAST and the experiment results have shown that about 70 test patterns can be successfully written to convert authentic Web-based texts into grammar tests."

        "Grammar tests usually include a set of patterns covering different grammatical categories.",
        "These patterns are easily to conceptualize and to write down.",
        "In the first step of the creation process, we design test patterns.",
        "A construct pattern can be observed through analyzing sentences of similar structural features.",
        "Sentences “My friends enjoy traveling by plane.” and “I enjoy surfing on the Internet.” are analyzed as an illustration.",
        "Two sentences share identical syntactic structure {* enjoy X/Gerund *}, indicating the grammatical rule for the verb “enjoy” needing a gerund as the complement.",
        "Similar surface patterns can be found when replacing “enjoy” by verbs such as “admit” and “finish” (e.g., {* admit X/Gerund *} and {* finish X/Gerund *} ).",
        "These two generalize these surface patterns, we write a construct pattern {* VB VBG *} in terms of POS tags produced by a POS tagger.",
        "Thus, a construct pattern characterizing that some verbs require a gerund in the complement is contrived.",
        "Distractor generation pattern is dependent on each designed construct pattern and therefore needs to design separately.",
        "Distractors are usually composed of words in the construct pattern with some modifications: changing part of speech, adding, deleting, replacing, or reordering of words.",
        "By way of example, in the sentence “Strauss finished writing two of his published compositions before his tenth birthday.”, “writing” is the pivot word according to the construct pattern {* VBD VBG * } .",
        "Distractors for this question are: “write”, “written”, and “wrote”.",
        "Similar to the way for the construct pattern devise, we use POS tags to represent distractor generation pattern: {VB}, {VBN}, and {VBD}.",
        "We define a notation scheme for the distractor designing.",
        "The symbol $0 designates the changing of the pivot word in the construct pattern while $9 and $1 are the words proceeding and following the pivot word, respectively.",
