        "The use of natural language processing technology is expected to reduce their burden, and various attempts of information extraction using NLP has been being made (Blaschke and Valencia, 2002; Hao et al., 2005; Chun et al., 2006).",
        "However, the framework of traditional information retrieval (IR) has difficulty with the accurate retrieval of such relational concepts.",
        "This is because relational concepts are essentially determined by semantic relations of words, and keyword-based IR techniques are insufficient to describe such relations precisely.",
