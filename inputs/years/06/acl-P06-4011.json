        "In recent years, with the rapid development of globalization, English for Academic Purposes has drawn researchers' attention and become the mainstream of English for Specific Purposes, particularly in the field of English of Academic Writing (EAW).",
        "EAW deals mainly with genres, including research articles (RAs), reviews, experimental reports, and other types of academic writing.",
        "RAs play the most important role of offering researchers the access to actively participating in the academic and discourse community and sharing academic research information with one another.",
        "Abstracts are constantly regarded as the first part of RAs and few scholarly RAs go without an abstract.",
        "“A well-prepared abstract enables readers to identify the basic content of a document quickly and accurately.” (American National Standards Institute, 1979) Therefore, RAs' abstracts are equally important to writers and readers.",
        "Recent research on abstract requires manually analysis, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive.",
        "Moreover, with the rapid development of science and technology, learners are increasingly engaged in self-paced learning in a digital environment.",
        "Our study, therefore, attempts to investigate ways of automatically analyzing the move structure of English RAs’ abstracts and develops an online learning system, CARE (Concordancer for Academic wRiting in English).",
        "It is expected that the automatic analytical tool for move structures will facilitate non-native speakers (NNS) or novice writers to be aware of appropriate move structures and internalize relevant knowledge to improve their writing."

        "Swales (1990) presented a simple and succinct picture of the organizational pattern for a RA – the IMRD structure (Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion).",
        "Additionally Swales (1981, 1990) introduced the theory of genre analysis of a RA and a four-move scheme, which was later refined as the \"Create a Research Space\" (CARS) model for analyzing a RA’s introduction section.",
        "Even though Swales seemed to have overlooked the abstract section, in which he did not propose any move analysis, he himself plainly realized “abstracts continue to remain a neglected field among discourse analysts” (Swales, 1990, p. 181).",
        "Salager-Meyer (1992) also stated, “Abstracts play such a pivotal role in any professional reading” (p. 94).",
        "Seemingly researchers have perceived this view, so research has been expanded to concentrate on the abstract in recent years.",
        "Anthony (2003) further pointed out, “research has shown that the study of rhetorical organization or structure of texts is particularly useful in the technical reading and writing classroom” (p. 185).",
        "Therefore, he utilized computational means to create a system, Mover, which could offer move analysis to assist abstract writing and reading."
