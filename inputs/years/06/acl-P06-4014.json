        "The LOGON projects aims at building an experimental machine translation system from Norwegian to English of texts in the domain of hiking in the wilderness (Oepen et al., 2004).",
        "It is funded within the Norwegian Research Council program for building national infrastructure for language technology (Fenstad et al., 2006).",
        "It is the goal for the program as well as for the project to include various areas of language technology as well as various methods, in particular symbolic and empirical methods.",
        "Besides, the project aims at reusing available resources and, in turn, producing reusable technology.",
        "In spite of significant progress in statistical approaches to machine translation, we doubt the long-term value of pure statistical (or data-driven) approaches, both practically and scientifically.",
        "To ensure grammaticality of outputs as well as felicity of the translation both linguistic grammars and deep semantic analysis are needed.",
        "The architecture of the LOGON system hence consists of a symbolic backbone system combined with various stochastic components for ranking system hypotheses.",
        "In a nutshell, a central research question in LOGON is to what degree state-of-the-art ‘deep’ NLP resources can contribute towards a precision MT system.",
        "We hope to engage the conference audience in some reflection on this question by means of the interactive presentation."

        "Minimal Recursion Semantics The three core phases communicate in a uniform semantic interface language, Minimal Recursion Semantics (MRS; Copestake, Flickinger, Sag, & Pollard, 1999).",
        "Broadly speaking, MRS is a flat, event-based (neo-Davidsonian) framework for computational semantics.",
        "The abstraction from SL and TL surface properties enforced in our semantic transfer approach facilitates a novel combination of diverse grammatical frameworks, viz. LFG for Norwegian analysis and HPSG for English generation.",
        "While an in-depth introduction to MRS (for MT) is beyond the scope of this project note, Figure 1 presents a simplified example semantics.",
        "Norwegian Analysis Syntactic analysis of Norwegian is based on an existing LFG resource grammar, NorGram (Dyvik, 1999), under development on the Xerox Linguistic Environment (XLE) since around 1999.",
        "For use in LOGON, the grammar has been modified and extended, and it has been augmented with a module of Minimal Recursion Semantics representations which are computed from LFG f-structures by co-description.",

        "The project uses its own morphological analyzer, compiled off a comprehesive computational lexicon of Norwegian, prior to syntactic analysis.",
        "One important feature of this processor is that it decomposes compounds in such a way that they can be compositionally translated downstream.",
        "Current analysis coverage (including well-formed MRSs) on the LOGON corpus (see below) is approaching 80 per cent (of which 25 per cent are ‘fragmented’, i.e. approximative analyses).",
        "Semantic Transfer Unlike in parsing and generation, there is less established common wisdom in terms of (semantic) transfer formalisms and algorithms.",
        "LOGON follows many of the main Verbmobil ideas – transfer as a resource-sensitive rewrite process, where rules replace MRS fragments (SL to TL) in a stepwise manner (Wahlster, 2000) – but adds two innovative elements to the transfer component, viz. (i) the use of typing for hierarchical organization of transfer rules and (ii) a chart-like treatment of transfer-level ambiguity.",
        "The general form of MRS transfer rules (MTRs) is as a quadruple:",
        "where each of the four components, in turn, is a partial MRS, i.e. triplet of a top handle, bag of EPs, and handle constraints.",
        "Left-hand side components are unified against an input MRS M and, when successful, trigger the rule application; elements of M matched by INPUT are replaced with the OUTPUT component, respecting all variable bindings established during unification.",
        "The optional CONTEXT and FILTER components serve to condition rule application (on the presence or absence of specific aspects of M), establish bindings for OUTPUT processing, but do not consume elements of M. Although our current focus is on",
        "right, the corpus subdivision by input length, total number of items, and average string length, ambiguity rate, grammatical coverage, and generation time, respectively.",
        "translation into English, MTRs in principle state translational correspondence relations and, modulo context conditioning, can be reversed.",
        "Transfer rules use a multiple-inheritance hierarchy with strong typing and appropriate feature constraints both for elements of MRSs and MTRs themselves.",
        "In close analogy to constraint-based grammar, typing facilitates generalizations over transfer regularities – hierarchies of predicates or common MTR configurations, for example – and aids development and debugging.",
        "An important tool in the constructions of the transfer rules are the semantic interfaces (called SEM-Is, see below) of the respective grammars.",
        "While we believe that hand-crafted lexical transfer is a necessary component in precision-oriented MT, it is also a bottleneck for the development of the LOGON system, with its preexisting source and target language grammars.",
        "We have therefore experimented with the acquistion of transfer rules by analogy from a bilingual dictionary, building on hand-built transfer rules as a seed set of templates (Nordg˚ard, Nygaard, Lønning, & Oepen, 2006).",
        "English Generation Realization of post-transfer MRSs in LOGON builds on the preexisting LinGO English Resource Grammar (ERG; Flickinger, 2000) and LKB generator (Carroll, Copestake, Flickinger, & Poznanski, 1999).",
        "The ERG already produced MRS outputs with good coverage in several domains.",
        "In LOGON, it has been refined, adopted to the new domain, and semantic representations revised in light of cross-linguistic experiences from MT.",
        "Furthermore, chart generation efficiency and integration with stochastic realization have been substantially improved (Carroll & Oepen, 2005).",

        "temp loc temp abstr at p temp in p temp on p temp afternoon n day n • • • year n development corpus: realizations average at a little less than twelve words in length.",
        "After addition of domain-specific vocabulary and a small amount of fine-tuning, the ERG provides adequate analyses for close to ninety per cent of the LOGON reference translations.",
        "For about half the test cases, all outputs can be generated in less than one cpu second.",
        "End-to-End Coverage The current LOGON system will only produce output(s) when all three processing phases succeed.",
        "For the LOGON target corpus (see below), this is presently the case in 35 per cent of cases.",
        "Averaging over actual outputs only, the system achieves a (respectable) BLEU score of 0.61; averaging over the entire corpus, i.e. counting inputs with processing errors as a zero contribution, the BLEU score drops to 0.21."

        "Despite the very limited amount of training so far, the model already appears to pick up on plausible, albeit crude preferences (as regards topicalization, for example).",
        "Furthermore, to reduce fanout in exhaustive processing, we collapse analyses that project equivalent MRSs, i.e. syntactic distinctions made in the grammar but not reflected in the semantics.",
        "Realization Ranking At an average of more than fifty English realizations per input MRS (see Table 1), ranking generator outputs is a vital part of the LOGON pipeline.",
        "Based on a notion of automatically derived symmetric treebanks, we have trained comprehensive discriminative, log-linear models that (within the LOGON domain) achieve up to 75 per cent exact match accuracy in picking the most likely realization among competing outputs (Velldal & Oepen, 2005).",
        "The best-performing models make use of configurational (in terms of tree topology) as well as of string-level properties (including local word order and constituent weight), both with varied domains of locality.",
        "In total, there are around 300,000 features with non-trivial distribution, and we combine the MaxEnt model with a traditional language model trained on a much larger corpus (the BNC).",
        "The latter, more standard approach to realization ranking, when used in isolation only achieves around 50 per cent accuracy, however."
