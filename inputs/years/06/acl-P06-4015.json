        "System output is provided by speech and a graphical display integrated into the car’s dashboard.",
        "An example of the system display is shown in Fig. 2.",
        "The MP3 player application offers a wide range of functions: The user can control the currently playing song, search and browse an MP3 database by looking for any of the fields (song, artist, album, year, etc.",
        "), search and select playlists and even construct and edit playlists.",
        "The user of SAMMIE has complete freedom in interacting with the system.",

        "On the contrary, the user can give new tasks as well as any information relevant to the current task at any time.",
        "This is achieved by modeling the interaction as a collaborative problem solving process, and multi-modal interpretation that fits user input into the context of the current task.",
        "The user is also free in their use of multimodality: SAMMIE handles deictic references (e.g., Play this title while pushing the iDrive button) and also cross-modal references, e.g., Play the third song (on the list).",
