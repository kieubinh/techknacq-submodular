        "Many cities have underground railway systems.",
        "Somehow one takes the tube in London but the subway in New York.",
        "In a more recent edition of the Roget's Thesaurus (Kirkpatrick, 1987), subway, tube, underground railway and metro are found in the same semicolon-separated group under head 624 Way.",
        "Similarly if one looks up WordNet (http://wordnet.princeton.edu; Miller et al., 1990), the synset to which subway belongs also contains the words metro, tube, underground, and subway system; and it is further indicated that \"in Paris the subway system is called the `metro' and in London it is called the `tube' or the `underground''.",
        "Such regional lexical variation is also found in Chinese.",
        "For instance, the subway system in Hong Kong, known as the Mass Transit Railway or MTR, is called +'J0 in Chinese.",
        "The subway systems in Beijing and Shanghai, as well as the one in Singapore, are also known as +'J0, but that in Taipei is known as L – PI.",
        "Their counterpart in Japan is written as +'J__k 4;zP in Kanji.",
        "Such regional variation, as part of lexical knowledge, is important and useful for many natural language applications, including natural language understanding, information retrieval, and machine translation.",
        "Unfortunately, existing Chinese lexical resources often lack such comprehensiveness.",
        "To fill this gap, Tsou and Kwong (2006) proposed a comprehensive Pan-Chinese lexical resource, based on a large and unique synchronous Chinese corpus as an authentic basis for lexical acquisition and analysis across various Chinese speech communities.",
        "For a significant world language like Chinese, a useful lexical resource should have maximum versatility and portability.",
        "It is not sufficient to target at one particular community speaking the language and thus cover only language usage observed from that particular community.",
        "Instead, such a lexical resource should document the core and universal substances of the language on the one hand, and also the more subtle variations found in different communities on the other.",
        "As is evident from the above example on the variation of subway, regional variation should be captured for the lexical resource to be useful in a wide range of applications.",
        "In this study, we investigate and compare the regional variation of lexical items from two spe",

        "In addition, we make use of an existing Chinese synonym dictionary, the Tongyici Cilin (Mei et al., 1984) as leverage, and explore its coverage of such variation and thus the potential for enriching it.",
        "The lexical items under study were obtained from a synchronous Chinese corpus, LIVAC, which will be further introduced in Section 4.",
        "Corpus data from four Chinese speech communities were compared with respect to their commonality and uniqueness, and also against Cilin for their coverage.",
        "Results showed that 20-40% of the words extracted from the corpus are unique to the individual communities, and as much as 70% of such unique items are not yet covered in Cilin.",
        "It therefore suggests that the synchronous corpus is a rich source for mining region-specific lexical items, and there is great potential for building a Pan-Chinese lexical resource for Chinese language processing.",
        "In Section 2, we will briefly review existing resources and related work.",
        "Then in Section 3, we will briefly outline the design and architecture of the Pan-Chinese lexical resource proposed by Tsou and Kwong (2006).",

        "The construction and development of large lexical resources is relying more and more on corpus-based approaches, not only as a result of the increased availability of large corpora, but also for the authoritativeness and authenticity allowed by the approach.",
        "The Collins COBUILD English Dictionary (Sinclair, 1987) is amongst the most well-known lexicographic fruit based on large corpora.",
        "For natural language applications, much of the information in conventional dictionaries targeted at human readers must be made explicit.",
        "Lexical resources for computer use thus need considerable manipulation, customisation, and supplementation (e.g. Calzolari, 1982).",
        "WordNet (Miller et al., 1990), grouping words into synsets and linking them up with relational pointers, is probably the first broad coverage general computational lexical database.",
        "In view of the intensive time and effort required in resource building, some researchers have taken an alternative route by extracting information from existing machine-readable dictionaries and corpora semi-automatically (e.g. Vossen et al., 1989; Riloff and Shepherd, 1999; Lin et al., 2003).",
        "Compared to the development of thesauri and lexical databases, and research into semantic networks for major languages such as English, similar work for the Chinese language is less mature.",
        "This gap was partly due to the lack of authoritative Chinese corpora as a basis for analysis, but has been gradually reduced with the recent availability of large Chinese corpora including the LIVAC synchronous corpus (Tsou and Lai, 2003) used in this work and further described below, the Sinica Corpus (Chen et al., 1996), the Chinese Penn Treebank (Xia et al., 2000), and the like.",
        "An important issue which is seldom addressed in the construction of Chinese lexical databases is the problem of versatility and portability.",
        "For a language such as Chinese which is spoken in many different communities, different linguistic norms have emerged as a result of the individualistic evolution and development of the language within a particular community and culture.",
        "Such variations are seldom adequately reflected in existing lexical resources, which often only draw reference from one particular source.",
        "For instance, Tongyici Cilin(�����) (Mei et al., 1984) is a thesaurus containing some 70,000 Chinese lexical items in the tradition of the Roget's Thesaurus for English, that is, in a hierarchy of broad conceptual categories.",
        "First published in the 1980s, it was based exclusively on Chinese as used in post-1949 Mainland China.",
        "Thus for the subway example above, the closest word group found is ' F 41 , 1741 (train) only, let alone the subway itself and its regional variations.",
        "With the recent availability of large corpora, especially synchronous ones, to construct an authoritative and timely lexical resource for Chinese is less distant than it was in the past.",
        "A large synchronous corpus provides authentic examples of the language as used in a variety of locations.",
        "It thus enables us to attempt a comprehensive and in-depth analysis of the core common language in constructing a lexical resource; and to incorporate useful information relating to location-sensitive linguistic variations."

        "Comparing the candidate sets from various subcorpora, which reflect the use of Chinese in various Chinese speech communities, Tables 4 and 5 show the sizes of the intersection sets among different places for the two domains respectively.",
        "The intersection set for all four places contains slightly more than 1,000 lexical items in the financial domain.",
        "A quick skim through these common lexical items suggests that they contain, on the one hand, the many general concepts in the financial domain (e.g. FlJ company, VA market, �,KLi7 bank, JOV:r invest / investment, � �business, gW develop / development, PRI corporation, J!U f,j stock shares, J!U4 shareholder, V:r�capital, etc.",
        "); and on the other hand, many reportage and cognitive verbs often used in news articles (e.g. i, express, � d reckon, << , ,!",

        "In the sports domain, more than 1,700 lexical items were found in all of the four subcorpora.",

        "tion, r league, \" t coach, W opponent, ice'#i champion, etc.).",
        "The numbers of overlaps in Tables 4 suggest that lexical items used in Mainland China (as evident from BJ data) seem to have the least in common with the rest.",
        "For instance, compared to the overlap amongst all four regions (i.e. 1,039), the overlap has increased most when BJ was not included in the comparison; and when we compare any two regions, the overlap between BJ and TW is smallest.",
        "Nevertheless, such uniqueness of BJ data is less apparent in the sports domain.",
        "In particular, the difference between HK/BJ and BJ/TW is even slightly less than that in the financial domain.",

        "As mentioned earlier, the Tongyici Cilin contains some 70,000 lexical items under 12 broad semantic classes, 94 subclasses, and 1,428 heads.",
        "It was first published in the 1980s and was based on lexical usages mostly of post-1949 Mainland China.",
        "In this section, we discuss the results obtained from comparing the unique lexical items found from individual subcorpora with Cilin, which are shown in Table 7.",
        "On the one hand, Cilin's collection of words may be considerably dated and obviously will not include new concepts and neologisms arising in the last two decades.",
        "On the other hand, the data in LIVAC come from newspaper materials in the 1990s.",
        "So overall speaking, for each of the unique word lists, much less than 50% are covered in Cilin.",
        "1 Upon further analysis, on average about 60% of these \"unique\" items were actually found in one or more of the other regions, but with frequency 5 or below.",
        "Since the difference in frequency is quite large for most items, we can reasonably treat them as unique to a particular community.",
        "Nevertheless, there is still an apparent gap between Cilin's coverage of the unique items from various places.",
        "About 40% of the unique items found in BJ for both domains are covered; but for other places, the coverage is more often less than 30% in either or both domains.",
        "Again, this could be considered a result of Cilin's bias toward lexical usages in Mainland China.",
        "In addition, while almost 40% of the unique items in BJ data are found in Cilin, many of these unique items covered are amongst the most frequent items.",
        "On the contrary, even though about 560 unique items in HK data are also found in Cilin, only 3 out of the 20 most frequent items are amongst them.",
        "In addition, the apparent coverage does not necessarily suggest the correct match of word senses.",
        "For instance, fz is found under head Bnl together with other items like � Y, (�=�', etc., all of which only refer to the general concept of housing, instead of the housing specifically under the Home Ownership Scheme as known in Hong Kong.",
        "Also, coverage of words like V_ ,�1�' and -1 – f in the sports domain does not match their actual usages which refer to team names.",
        "A more interesting example might be 'F `'', which is used in the basketball context in TW data, and in no way refers to the literal \"hot pot\" sense.",
        "Results from the above comparisons thus support that (1) different Chinese speech communities have their distinct usage of Chinese lexical items, in terms of both form and sense; (2) such variation is found in different domains, such as the financial and sports domain; (3) existing lexical resources, the Tongyici Cilin in particular as in our current study, should be enriched and enhanced by capturing lexical usages from a variety of Chinese speech communities, to represent the lexical items from a Pan-Chinese perspective; and (4) lexical items obtained from the synchronous Chinese corpus can supplement the existing content of the Tongyici Cilin, with more contemporarily lexicalised concepts, as well as variant expressions of similar and related concepts from various Chinese speech communities.",
        "Hence it remains for us to further investigate how the related lexical items obtained from the synchronous corpus should be grouped and incorporated into the semantic classification of existing lexical resources; and to further explore how they might be extracted in a large scale by automatic means.",
