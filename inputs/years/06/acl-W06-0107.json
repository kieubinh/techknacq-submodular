        "On the task of determining the tense to use when translating a Chinese verb into English, current systems do not perform as well as human translators.",
        "The main focus of the present paper is to identify features that human translators use, but which are not currently automatically extractable.",
        "The goal is twofold: to test a particular hypothesis about what additional information human translators might be using, and as a pilot to determine where to focus effort on developing automatic extraction methods for features that are somewhat beyond the reach of current feature extraction.",
        "The paper shows that incorporating several latent features into the tense classifier boosts the tense classifier’s performance, and a tense classifier using only the latent features outperforms one using only the surface features.",

        "Language speakers make two types of distinctions about temporal relations: the first type of relation is based on precedence between events and can be expanded into a finer grained taxonomy as proposed by (Allen, 1981).",
        "The second type of relation is based on the relative positioning between the following three time parameters proposed by (Reichenbach, 1947): speech time (S), event time (E) and reference time (R).",
        "In the past couple of decades, the NLP community has seen an emergent interest in the first type of temporal relation.",
        "In the cross-lingual context, while the first type of relationship can be easily projected across a language pair, the second type of relationship is often hard to be projected across a language pair.",
        "In contrast to this challenge, cross-lingual temporal reference distinction has been poorly explored.",
        "Languages vary in the granularity of their tense and aspect representations; some have finer-grained tenses or aspects than others.",
        "Tense generation and tense understanding in natural language texts are highly dynamic and context-dependent processes, since any previously established time point or interval, whether explicitly mentioned in the context or not, could potentially serve as the reference time for the event in question.",
        "(Bruce, 1972) captures this nature of temporal reference organization in discourse through a multiple temporal reference model.",
        "He defines a set (S1, S2, ..., Sn) that is an element of tense.",
        "S1 corresponds to the speech time, S� is the event time, and (Si, i=2, ..., n-1) stand for a sequence of time references from which the reference time of a particular event could come.",
        "Given the elusive nature of reference time shift, it is extremely hard to model the reference time point directly in temporal information processing.",
        "The above reasons motivate classifying temporal reference distinction automatically, using machine learning algorithms such as Conditional Random Fields (CRFs).",
        "Many researchers in Natural Language Processing seem to believe that an automatic system does not have to follow the mechanism of human brain in order to optimize its performance, for example, the feature space for an automatic classification system does not have to replicate the knowledge sources that human beings utilize.",
        "There has been very little research that pursues to testify this faith.",
        "The current work attempts to identify which features are most important for tense generation in Chinese to English translation scenario, which can point to direction of future research effort for automatic tense translation between Chinese and English.",

        "This work, while alerting researchers to the importance of lexical aspectual feature in determination of tense for English verbs in Chinese-to-English machine translation, is subject to the risk of adopting a one-to-one mapping between grammatical aspect markings and tenses hence oversimplifies the temporal reference problem in Chinese text.",

        "One might expect that CRFs would accurately capture sequential dependencies among verbs.",
        "Reflecting upon the similar evaluation results of the CRFs classifier and the Classification Tree classifier, it is unlikely for this to be due to the over-fitting of the Classification Tree because of the pruning we did to the Classification Trees.",
        "Therefore, we speculate that the dependencies between the tense tags of verbs in the texts may not be strong enough for CRFs to outperform Classification Tree.",
        "This might also be contributable to the built-in variable selection procedures of Classification Trees, which makes it more robust to interacting and interdependent features.",
