        "Word segmentation and named entity recognition aim at recognizing the implicit word boundaries and proper nouns, such as names of persons, locations and organizations, respectively in plain Chinese text, and are critical in Chinese information processing.",
        "However, there exist two problems when developing a practical word segmentation or named entity recognition system for large open applications, i.e. the resolution of ambiguous segmentations and the identification of OOV words or OOV entity names.",
        "In order to resolve above problems, we developed a purely statistical Chinese word segmentation system and a named entity recognition system using a three-stage strategy under an unified framework.",
        "The first stage is called known word segmentation, which aims to segment an input sequence of Chinese characters into a sequence of known words (called word atoms in this paper).",
        "In this paper, all Chinese characters are regarded as known words and a word unigram model is applied to perform this task for efficiency.",
        "Also, for convenience, all the English characters are transformed into the Chinese counterparts in preprocessing, which will be recovered just before outputting results.",
        "The second stage is the word and/or named entity identification and classification on the sequence of atomic words in the first step.",
        "Here, a word chunking strategy is applied to detect words and/or entity names by chunking one or more atomic words together according to the word formation patterns of the word atoms and optional entity name formation patterns for named entity recognition.",
        "The problem of word segmentation and/or entity name recognition are recast as chunking one or more word atoms together to form a new word and/or entity name, and a discriminative Markov model, named Mutual Information Independence Model (MIIM), is adopted in chunking.",
        "Besides, a SVM plus sigmoid model is applied to integrate various types of contexts and implement the discriminative modeling in MIIM.",
        "The third step is post processing, which tries to further resolve ambiguous segmentations and unknown word segmentation.",
        "Due to time limit, this is only done in Chinese word segmentation.",
        "No post processing is done on Chinese named entity recognition.",
        "The rest of this paper is as follows: Section 2 describes the context-dependent Mutual Information Independence Model in details while purely statistical post-processing in Chinese word segmentation is presented in Section 3.",
        "Finally, we report the results of our system in Chinese word segmentation and named entity recognition in Section 4 and conclude our work in Section 5.",

        "In this paper, we use a discriminative Markov model, called Mutual Information Independence Model (MIIM) as proposed by Zhou et al. (2002), for Chinese word segmentation and named entity recognition.",
        "MIIM is derived from a conditional probability model.",
        "Given an observation sequence O1n = o1o2 L on ,MIIM finds a stochastic optimal state(tag) sequence S; = S1S2 • • • Sn that maximizes: We call the above model the Mutual Information Independence Model due to its Pairwise Mutual Information (PMI) assumption (Zhou et al. 2002).",
        "The above model consists of two sub-models: the state transition model 1) , which can be computed by applying ngram modeling, and the output model",
        "probability-based classifier, such as a maximum entropy classifier or a SVM plus sigmoid classifier (Zhou et al. 2006).",
        "In this competition, the SVM plus sigmoid classifier is used in Chinese word segmentation while a simple backoff approach as described in Zhou et al. (2002) is used in named entity recognition.",
        "Here, a variant of the Viterbi algorithm (Viterbi 1967) in decoding the standard Hidden Markov Model (HMM) (Rabiner 1989) is implemented to find the most likely state sequence by replacing the state transition model and the output model of the standard HMM with the state transition model and the output model of the MIIM, respectively.",
        "The above MIIM has been successfully applied in many applications, such as text chunking (Zhou 2004), Chinese word segmentation ( Zhou 2005), English named entity recognition in the newswire domain (Zhou et al. 2002) and the biomedical domain (Zhou et al. 2004; Zhou et al. 2006).",
        "For Chinese word segmentation and named entity recognition by chunking, a word or a entity name is regarded as a chunk of one or more word atoms and we have:",

        "Here p; measures the word formation power of the word atom w; and consists of: • The percentage of w; occurring as a whole word (round to 10%) • The percentage of w; occurring at the beginning of other words (round to 10%) • The percentage of w; occurring at the end of other words (round to 10%) • The length of w; • Especially for named entity recognition, the percentages of a word occurring in different entity types (round to 10%).",
        "• s; : the states are used to bracket and",
        "differentiate various types of words and optional entity types for named entity recognition.",
        "In this way, Chinese word segmentation and named entity recognition can be regarded as a bracketing and classification process.",

        "• Boundary category (B): it includes four values: {O, B, M, E}, where O means that current word atom is a whOle word or entity name and B/M/E means that current word atom is at the Beginning/in the Middle/at the End of a word or entity name.",
        "• Unit category (W): It is used to denote the type of the word or entity name.",
        "Because of the limited number of boundary and unit categories, the current word atom formation pattern p; described above is added into the state transition model in MIIM.",
        "This makes the above MIIM context dependent as follows:"
