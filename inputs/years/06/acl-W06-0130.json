        "The training data consist of texts that are segmented into words with names of people, places, and organizations labeled.",
        "And the testing data consist of unsegmented Chinese texts, one sentence per line.",
        "There are many well known models for English named recognition, among which Conditional Random Fields (Lafferty et al.",
        "2001) and maximum entropy models (Berger et al.",
        "2001)",

        "We trained two named entity recognizers based on conditional random field and one based on maximum entropy model.",
        "Both conditional random field and maximum entropy models are capable of modeling arbitrary features of the input, thus are well suit for many language processing tasks.",
        "However, there exist significant differences between these two models.",
        "To apply a maximum entropy model to NER task, we have to first train a maximum entropy classifier to classify each individual word and then build a dynamic programming for sequence decoding.",
        "While in CRFs, these two steps are integrated together.",
        "Thus, in theory, CRFs are superior to maximum entropy models in sequence modeling problem and this will also confirmed in our Chinese NER experiments.",
        "The superiority of CRFs on Chinese information processing was also demonstrated in word segmentation (Peng et al.",
        "2004).",
        "However, the training speed of CRFs is much slower than that of maximum entropy models since training CRFs requires expensive forward-backward algorithm to compute the partition function.",

        "The first CRF recognizer used the features C-2, C1, C0, C-1, C2, C-2C-1, C-1C0, C0C-1, C1C2, and C1C1, where C0 is the current character, C1 the next character, C2 the second character after C0, C-1 the character preceding C0, and C-2 the second character before C0.",
        "The second CRF recognizer used the same set of basic features but the feature C2.",
        "In addition, the first CRF recognizer used the tag bigram feature, and the second CRF recognizer used word and character cluster features, obtained automatically from the training data only with distributional word clustering (Tishby and Lee, 1993).",
        "The maximum entropy recognizer used the following unigram, bigram features, and type features: C-2, C-1, C0, C1, C2, C-4C-3, C-3C-2, C-2C-1, C-1C0, C0C1, C1C2, C2C3, C3C4, and T-2T-1.",
        "When using the first CRF package, we found the labeling scheme OBIE performs better than the OBIE scheme.",
        "In the OBI scheme, the first character of a named entity is labeled as “B”, the remaining characters, including the last character, are all labeled as “I”.",
        "And any character that is not part of a named entity is labeled as “O”.",
        "In the OBIE scheme, the last character of a named entity is labeled as “E”.",
        "The other characters are labeled in the same way as in OBIE scheme.",
        "The first CRF recognizer used the OBIE labeling scheme, and the second CRF recognizer used the OBI scheme.",
        "We tried a window size of seven characters (three characters preceding the current character and three characters following the current character) with almost no difference in performance from using the window size of five characters.",
        "When a named entity occurs frequently in the training data, there is a very good chance that it will be recognized when appearing in the testing data.",
        "However, for entity names of rare occurrence, they are much harder to recognize in the",
        "testing data.",
        "Thus it may be beneficial to examine the testing data to identify the named entities that occur in the training data, and assign them the same label as in the training data.",
        "From the training data, we extracted the person names of at least three characters, the place names of at least four characters, and the organization names of at least four characters.",
        "We removed from the dictionary the named entities that are also common words.",
        "We did not include the short names in the dictionary because they may be part of long names.",
        "We produced a run first using one of the NER recognizers, and then replaced the labels of a named entity assigned by a recognizer with the labels of the same named entity in the training data without considering the contexts."

        "In our post-processing, the correctly tagged organization name is re-tagged incorrectly as three organization names.",
