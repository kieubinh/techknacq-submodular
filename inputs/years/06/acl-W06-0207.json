        "One of the recent trends in (adaptive) IE has been motivated by the empirical argument that annotated corpora, either annotated automatically or annotated manually, can provide sufficient information for creating the knowledge base of an IE system (McLernon and Kushmerick, 2006).",
        "Another equally important trend is to use manually selected seed patterns to initiate learning: In turn, active-training methods use seed patterns to learn new related patterns from unannotated corpora.",
        "Many of the adaptive IE systems rely on the existing part-of-speech (POS) taggers (Debnath and Giles, 2005) and/or syntactic parsers (Stevenson and Greenwood, 2005) for analysing and annotating text corpora.",
        "The use of corpora in IE, especially adaptive IE, should, in principle, alleviate the need for manually creating the rules for information extraction.",
        "The successful use of POS/syntactic taggers is dependent on the availability of the knowledge of (natural) language used by the authors of documents in a given corpus.",
        "There is a wealth of POS taggers and parsers available for English language, as it has been the most widely used language in computational linguistics.",
        "However, this is not the case for strategically important languages like Arabic and Chinese; to start with, in Chinese one does not have the luxury of separating word-tokens by a white space and in Arabic complex rules are required to identify morphemes compared to English.",
        "The development of segmentation programs in these languages has certainly helped (Gao et al., 2005; Habash and Rambow, 2005).",
        "More work is needed in understanding these languages such that the knowledge thus derived can be used to power taggers and parsers.",
        "Typically, IE systems are used to analyse news wire corpora, telephone conversations, and more recently in bio-informatics.",
        "The first two systems deal with language of everyday communications =the general language whereas bio-informatics deals with a specialist domain and has its own ,special language'.",
        "English special languages, for example languages of law, commerce, finance, science & technology, each have a limited vocabulary and idiosyncratic syntactic structures when compared with English used in an everyday context.",
        "The same is true of German, French, Russian, Chinese, Arabic or Hindi.",
        "It appears that few works, if any, take advantage of the properties of special language to build IE systems.",
        "Our objective is to use methods and techniques of IE in the automatic analysis of specialist news that streams in such a way that information extracted at an earlier period of time may be contradicted or reinforced by information extracted at a later time.",
        "The impact of news on financial and commodity markets is of consider",
        "able import and is often called sentiment analysis.",
        "The prefix ,sentiment' is used to distinguish this kind of analysis from the more quantitative analysis of assets (called fundamental analysis) and that of price movements (called technical analysis).",
        "There is a great deal of discussion in financial economics, econometrics, and in the newly emergent discipline of investor psychology about the impact of ,good' and ,bad' news on the behaviour of both investors and brokers.",
        "Three Nobel Prizes have been awarded on the impact of market (trader and investor) sentiment on the value of shares, currencies, derivatives and other financial instruments (Shiller, 2000).",
        "Financial news, in addition to emails and blogs, has contributed to the catastrophic failures of major trading institutions (Mackenzie, 2000; Hardie & Mackenzie, 2005).",
        "One of the key proponents of news impact analysis is the Economics Nobel Laureate Robert Engle who has written about asymmetry of information in a market = the brokers have more knowledge than any given individual, rumours have different impact on different actors in the market.",
        "Engle's statistical analysis suggests that the ,bad' news has longer lasting effect than ,good' news (Engle, 1993).",
        "Usually, sentiment analysis is carried out using news proxies which include dates/times and the names of agencies releasing key items of financial data (Anderson et al., 2002) or data like the age of a firm, its number of initial public offerings, return on investment, etc.",
        "These proxies are then regressed with share, currency or commodity prices.",
        "News impact analysis is moving into its next phase where the text of news is analysed albeit to a limited extent (Cutler et al., 1989; Chan, 2003).",
        "The analysis sometimes looks at the frequency distribution of pre-specified keywords =directional metaphors like rose/fall, up/down, health metaphors like anaemic/healthy and animal metaphors like bullish/bearish.",
        "A system is trained to correlate and to learn the changes in distribution of the prescribed metaphorical keywords, together with names of organisations, to the changes in the value of financial instruments (Seo et al., 2002; Omrane et al., 2005; Koppel and Shtrimberg 2004).",
        "We are attempting to create a language-informed framework for news impact analysis using techniques of corpus linguistics and special language analysis.",
        "The purpose is to automatically extract patterns from a corpus of domain specific texts without prescribing the metaphorical keywords and organisation names.",
        "This, we believe, can be achieved by looking at the lexical signature of a specialist domain and extracting collocational patterns of the individual items of the lexical signature.",
        "The lexical signature includes key vocabulary items of the domain and names of people, places and things in the domain.",
        "There are instances in the part-of-speech tagging literature (Brill, 1993) and in IE where a corpus is used and words within a grammatical category help to extract rules and patterns comprising essential information about a domain or topic (Wilks, 1998; Yangarber, 2003).",
        "Brill, Wilks and Yangarber induce grammars of a universal kind: we focus on inducing a local grammar that deals with the patterning of the items in the signature.",
        "Note that in all these cases of grammar induction the intuition of the grammar builder plays a critical part whether it be in the choice of syntactic transformation rules (Brill 1993), or in choosing sense taggers and implicitly semantic rules (Wilks, 1998; Ciravegna and Wilks, 2003), or in choosing user supplied seed patterns (Yangarber, 2003).",
        "Most of the work in grammar induction is focussed on English or typologically similar languages.",
        "We have deliberately chosen typologically different languages (English and Arabic) to evaluate the extent to which our method of ,grammar induction' is language independent.",
        "We describe a method for building domain specific IE systems: the patterns used to extract domain specific information are the N-gram collocation patterns of domain specific terms.",
        "The patterns are extracted from unannotated domain-specific text corpora.",
        "We show how one can analyse the N-gram patterns and render them as regular expressions.",
        "The thesaurus used to identify domain specific words is itself constructed automatically from a (training) special-language corpus.",
        "The frequency distribution of domain specific terms in a special language corpus shows characteristic differences from the distribution of the same terms in a general language corpus.",
        "There is little or no difference in the distribution of the so-called grammatical or closed class terms in a special and a general language corpus.",
        "Furthermore, amongst the domain specific terms, a few tend to dominate the frequency distribution = the so-called lexical signature of a domain.",
        "These signature terms are used as nucleates for compound terms in a domain.",
        "The occurrence of the signature terms, either on their own or in a compound or a phrase, is equally idiosyncratic in that these dominant single or",
        "compound terms co-occur more frequently with one set of words than with others.",
        "The behaviour of signature terms appears to be governed by a grammar that is local to the specialism and is not elsewhere in the general language (Harris, 1991); local grammar is used in general language for telling times and dates in metaphorical expressions (Gross, 1997), and in the lexicography for describing the language of definitions of lemmas in a lexicon (Barnbrook and Sinclair, 1996; Barnbrook, 2002).",
        "The local grammar approach, rooted in the lexical signature of a given domain can be used to extract ,sentiment' bearing sentences in financial markets (Ahmad el al., 2006) or in the description of work in a scientific laboratory (Ahmad & Al-Sayed, 2005).",
        "We introduce a system that can help in building domain specific IE systems in English and languages that are typologically distinct from English, specifically Arabic.",
        "The development of LoLo was inspired by Engle's pioneering work in econometrics where news impact analysis is regarded as critical to the analysis of market movement: however much of the work in financial economics relates to the correlation of the timings of news announcements rather than the content of the news stream (Ahmad et al., 2006).",
        "LoLo can manage a corpus and extract key terms.",
        "Given the keyword list, the system then identifies collocates and selects significant collocates on well defined statistical criterion (Smadja, 1994).",
        "Finally, local grammar rules are identified and an IE system is created.",
        "LoLo has been used to build a local grammar to extract ,sentiment' or key (changing) market events in English and in Arabic from unseen texts.",
        "The system can help visualise the distribution of extracted patterns synchronised with the movement of financial markets.",
        "IE systems need to be adaptive, as the specialisms in particular and the world in general is changing rapidly and this change is usually reflected in language use.",
        "There is an equally important need to build cross language IE systems as information may be in different languages.",
        "The lexically-motivated approach we describe in this paper responds to the need for an adaptive, cross domain and cross language IE systems."

        "The patterns extracted from the English (and Arabic) corpora confirm to an extent the view of the proponents of local grammar, of a special language, that there are certain words (in our case percent, shares, index) that appear to have a specific grammatical category in the sense that the neighbourhood of these words is occupied by a small number of other words (up, down, fall, rise, <no> for instance).",
        "If we were to apply the grammars typically used in part-of-speech taggers and syntactic parsing in general, the idiosyncratic behaviour of the pivotal keywords in specialist language does not become apparent: the pivotal keywords are regarded as noun phrases and the association of these phrases is with other general categories of verb phrase, adjectival phrase and adverbial phrase.",
        "The patterns we have extracted could have been extracted with the help of a thesaurus.",
        "And, this is the question which is critical to us: how to create and maintain a thesaurus within a domain.",
        "This is illustrated in a small way by our experiment on the Training1 corpus where the term index was not statistically significant for it to appear in the trigrams that populate the local grammar.",
        "However, in Training2, the larger corpus did contain significant frequency of the term index for it to make into a pattern of its own.",
        "Furthermore, many of the patterns in Training1 persisted in Training2.",
        "Smaller N-grams persist as well in the various Training and Test corpora = these patterns in themselves act like units around which other trigrams nucleate.",
        "The evaluation of our Algorithm is still continuing and we are in the process of setting up experiments with human volunteers, especially those with some knowledge of financial matters to evaluate the output of LoLo.",
        "We intend to use information retrieval metrics of recall and the various F measures.",
        "The local grammar movement has made erratic progress since its inception in the 1960's. Now, with the advent of accessible computers with substantive memories, with the advent of the Internet and the concomitant treasure of multilingual text deposits and text streams, one can explore the use of such grammars in addressing the major challenges in information extraction."
