        "At the AAAI Symposium on Attitude and Affect held at Stanford in 2004 (Qu et al., 2005), it was clear that the lexical approach to capturing affect was adequate for broad brush results, but there were no production quality visualizations for presenting those results analytically.",

        "This methodology generally requires a large amount of training data and is domain dependent.",
        "In the lexical approach, documents (Turney & Littman, 2003), phrases (see Wilson et al., 2005), or sentences (Weibe & Riloff, 2005) are categorized as positive or negative, for example, based on the number of words in them that match a lexicon of sentiment bearing terms.",
        "Major drawbacks of this approach include the contextual variability of sentiment (what is positive in one domain may not be in another) and incomplete coverage of the lexicon.",
        "This latter drawback is often circumvented by employing bootstrapping (Turney & Littman, 2003; Weibe & Riloff, 2005) which allows one to create a larger lexicon from a small number of seed words, and potentially one specific to a particular domain."

        "• What is the range of affect for a particular product?",

        "• Can we isolate the affect as it pertains to",
        "different features of the products?",
        "In selecting a base metaphor for affect, we wanted to be able to address these kinds of questions.",
        "We wanted a metaphor that would support viewing affect axes individually as well as in pairs.",
        "In addition to representing the most common axes, negative and positive, we wanted to provide more flexibility by incorporating the ability to portray multiple pairs because we suspect that additional axes will help the user explore nuances of emotion in the data.",
        "For our current metaphor, we drew inspiration from the Rose plot used by Florence Nightingale (Wainer, 1997).",
        "This metaphor is appealing in that it is easily interpreted, that larger scores draw more",
        "attention, and that measures are shown in consistent relative location, making it easier to compare measures across document groups.",
        "We use a modified version of this metaphor in which each axis is represented individually but is also paired with its opposite to aid in direct comparisons.",
        "To this end, we vary the spacing between the rose petals to reinforce the pairing.",
        "We also use color; each pair has a common hue, with the more positive of the pair shown in a lighter shade and the more negative one in a darker shade (see Figure 1).",
        "To address how much the range of affect varies across a set of documents, we adapted the concept of a box plot to the rose petal.",
        "For each axis, we show the median and quartile values as shown in the figure below.",
        "The dark line indicates the median value and the color band portrays the quartiles.",
        "In the plot in Figure 1, for example, the scores vary quite a bit.",
        "Another variation we made on the base metaphor was to address a more subtle set of questions.",
        "It may happen that the affect scores within a dataset are largely driven by document membership in particular groups.",
        "For example, in our customer data, it may be that all documents about Product A are relatively positive while those about Product B are relatively negative.",
        "A user wanting to understand customer complaints may have a subtle need.",
        "It is not sufficient to just look at the most negative documents in the dataset, because none of the Product A documents may pass this threshold.",
        "What may also help is to look at all documents that are more negative than one would expect, given the product they discuss.",
        "To carry out this calculation, we use a statistical technique to calculate the Main (or expected) affect value for each group and the Residual (or deviation) affect value for each document with respect to its group (Scheffe, 1999).",
        "To convey the Residual concept, we needed a representation of deviation from expected value.",
        "We also wanted this portrayal to be similar to the base metaphor.",
        "We use a unit circle to portray the expected value and show deviation by drawing the appropriate rose petals either outside (larger than expected) or inside (smaller than expected) the unit circle, with the color amount showing the amount of deviation from expected.",

        "A user can select one or more of these groups and see a summary of affect and its variation in those groups.",
        "In addition, the group members are clustered by their affect scores and glyphs of the residual, or variation from expected value, are shown for each of these subgroup clusters.",
        "Below each rose we display a small histogram showing the number of documents represented by that glyph (see Figure 3).",
        "These allow comparison of affect to cluster or group size.",
        "For example, we find that extreme affect scores are typically found in the smaller clusters, while larger ones often show more midrange scores.",
