        "The reader is referred to van der Feen (2005) for the complete list of sentences.",
        "The results show that there does not seem to be a clear preference in interpretation for sentences such as (13), leaving the distinction between strict domination and local restricted cumulativity undecided.",
        "For sentences such as (14), on the other hand, there seems to be a clear preference for the reading supported by global restricted cumulativity.",
        "Sentences such as (15), finally, show no effects at all of Keller’s counting cumulativity.",
        "For only one sentence only one subject preferred the interpretation according to which the neighbors promised John to continue, which favors the strict domination hypothesis and goes against Keller’s cumulativity algorithm.",
        "This suggests that constraints on comprehension may be different from the principles governing acceptability judgments.",
        "Boersma (2004) argues that the paralinguistic task of providing acceptability judgments involves comprehension, but under a reverse mapping between meaning and form.",
        "An alternative view is that acceptability judgments involve a mapping from the given form to its optimal meaning (‘what do I think the sentence means?’), followed by a mapping from that meaning to the optimal form for that meaning (‘how would I express that meaning?’), thus involving principles of comprehension as well as production.",
        "To conclude, there seems to be a slight indication of global restricted cumulativity in the comprehension of Gapping, but further study with a larger pool of subjects is required to confirm these initial findings.",
        "However, a few remarks are in place here.",
        "First, note that for hearers to prefer the interpretation that Paul picked a tulip for (13), the hearer has to find some motivation in the linguistic context of the utterance for why the speaker chose to put the object first.",
        "In the absence of such a context supporting a non-canonical word order, the reading that Paul picked a tulip might be dis-preferred anyway.",
        "Also in sentence (14), context seems to play a crucial role.",
        "Although in general pronouns may be used to refer to given material, in certain contexts pronouns can be emphatically stressed.",
        "If the pronoun in (14) is stressed, it is much easier to couple George to him to obtain the reading that John asked George to bring Ringo.",
        "This effect of context and prosody may have been the main reason for the observed preferences."
