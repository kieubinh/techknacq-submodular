        "In the example at hand, Ctatting= tatting#1 (the first and only sense in AAT).",
        "Therefore, if Ct matches the domain restrictions in the regular expression for R, then the domain of the relation is considered to be Ct.",

        "When writing relation checkers, as described in the previous paragraph of this Section, we can add markers of ontological relevance by specifying a predicate r(f, k) for each relevant position k in a fragment f. The purpose of these markers is precisely to identify words in f whose corresponding concepts are in the range of a property.",
        "For instance, the checker (1) cis-composed-of from the previous paragraph is augmented with the conjunction: n r(f, 3).",
        "We added the predicate r(f, 3) because the third parenthesis in the part-of-speech string refers to an ontologically relevant element (i.e. the candidate range of the is-composed-of property).",
        "The second problem is that words that are candidate ranges can be ambiguous, and they often are, especially if they do not belong to the domain glossary G. Considering the previous example of the property depicts, the word fruit is not a term of the AAT glossary, and it has 3 senses in WordNet (the fruit of a plant, the consequence of some action, an amount of product).",

        "The method is unsupervised, in the sense that it does not need manual annotation of a significant fragment of text.",
        "However, it relies on a set of manually written regular expressions, based on lexical, part-of-speech, and semantic constraints.",
        "The structure of regular expressions is rather more complex than in similar works using regular expressions, especially for the use of automatically verified semantic constraints.",
        "This complexity is indeed necessary to identify non-trivial relations in an unconstrained text and without training.",
        "The issue is however how much this method generalizes to other domains: • A first problem is the availability of lexical and semantic resources used by the algorithm.",
        "The most critical requirement of the method is the availability of sound domain core ontologies, which hopefully will be produced by other web communities stimulated by the recent success of CIDOC CRM.",
        "On the other side, in absence of an agreed conceptual reference model, no large scale annotation is possible at all.",
        "As for the other resources used by our algorithm, glossaries, thesaura and gazetteers are widely available in “mature” domains.",
        "If not, we developed a methodology, described in (Navigli and Velardi, 2005b), to automatically create a glossary in novel domains (e.g. enterprise interoperability), extracting definition sentences from domain-relevant documents and authoritative web sites.",
        "• The second problem is about the generality of regular expressions.",
        "Clearly, the relation checkers that we defined are tuned on the CIDOC properties.",
        "This however is consistent with our target: in specific domains users are interested to identify specific relations, not general purpose.",
        "Certain relevant application domains –like cultural heritage, e-commerce, or tourism-are those that dictate specifications for real-world applications of NLP techniques.",
        "However, several CIDOC properties are rather general (especially locative and wrt the AAT hierarchy.",
        "temporal relations) therefore some relation checkers easily apply to other domains, as demonstrated by the experiment on automatic annotation of historical archives in Table 4.",
        "Furthermore, the method used to verify semantic constraints is fully general, since it is based on WordNet and a general-purpose, untrained semantic disambiguation algorithm, SSI.",
        "• Finally, the authors believe with some degree of convincement that automatic pattern-learning methods often require non-trivial human effort just like manual methods (because of the need of annotated data, careful parameter setting, etc.",
        "), and furthermore they are unable to combine in a non-trivial way different types of features (e.g. lexical, syntactic, semantic).",
        "To make an example, a recent work on learning hypernymy patterns (Morin and Jacquemin, 2004) provides the full list of learned patterns.",
        "The complexity of these patterns is certainly lower than the regular expression structures used in this work, and many of them are rather intuitive.",
        "In the literature the tasks on which automatic methods have been tested are rather constrained, and do not convincingly demonstrate the superiority of automatic with respect to manually defined patterns.",
        "For example, in Senseval-3 (automated labeling of semantic roles 12), participating systems are requested to identify semantic roles in a sentence fragment for which the “frame semantics” is given, therefore the possible semantic relations to be identified are quite limited.",
        "However, we believe that our method can be automated to some degree (for example, machine learning methods can be used to bootstrap the syntactic patterns, and to learn semantic constraints), a research line we are currently exploring."
