        "This work reports on three human tense annotation experiments for Chinese verbs in Chinese-to-English translation scenarios.",
        "The results show that inter-annotator agreement increases as the context of the verb under the annotation becomes increasingly specified, i.e. as the context moves from the situation in which the target English sentence is unknown to the situation in which the target lexicon and target syntactic structure are fully specified.",
        "The annotation scheme with a fully specified syntax and lexicon in the target English sentence yields a satisfactorily high agreement rate.",
        "The annotation results were then analyzed via an ANOVA analysis, a logistic regression model and a log-linear model.",
        "The analyses reveal that while both the overt and the latent linguistic factors seem to significantly affect annotation agreement under different scenarios, the latent features are the real driving factors of tense annotation disagreement among multiple annotators.",
        "The analyses also find the verb telicity feature, aspect marker presence and syntactic embedding structure to be strongly associated with tense, suggesting their utility in the automatic tense classification task."

        "Consequently, the investigation and practice of temporal information annotation by human experts have emerged from the corpus annotation research.",
        "To evaluate automatic temporal relation classification systems, annotated corpora must be created and validated, which motivates experiments and research in temporal information annotation.",
        "One important temporal relation distinction that human beings make is the temporal reference distinction based on relative positioning between the following three time parameters, as proposed by (Reichenbach, 1947): speech time (S), event time (E) and reference time (R).",
        "Temporal reference distinction is linguistically realized as tenses.",
        "Languages have various granularities of tense representations; some have finer-grained tenses or aspects than others.",
        "This poses a great challenge to automatic cross-lingual tense mapping.",
        "The same challenge holds for cross-lingual tense annotation, especially for language pairs that have dramatically different tense strategies.",
        "A decent solution for cross-lingual tense mapping will benefit a variety of NLP tasks such as Machine Translation, Cross-lingual Question Answering (CLQA), and Multilingual Information Summarization.",
        "While automatic cross-lingual tense mapping has recently started to receive research attention, such as in (Olsen,et al., 2001) and (Ye, et al., 2005), to the best of our knowledge, human performance on tense and aspect annotation for machine translation between English and Chinese has not received any systematic investigation to date.",
        "Cross-linguistic NLP tasks, especially those requiring a more accurate tense and aspect resolution, await a more focused study of human tense and aspect annotation performance.",
        "Chinese and English are a language pair in which tense and aspect are represented at different levels of units: one being realized at the word level and the other at the morpheme level.",
        "This paper reports on a series of cross-linguistic tense annotation experiments between Chinese and English, and provides statistical inference for different linguistic factors via a series of statistical modeling.",
        "Since tense and aspect are morphologically merged in English, tense annotation",
        "discussed in this paper also includes elements of aspect.",
        "We only deal with tense annotation in Chinese-to-English scenario in the scope of this paper.",
        "The remaining part of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 summarizes the significant related works in temporal information annotation and points out how this study relates to yet differs from them.",
        "Section 3 reports the details of three tense annotation experiments under three scenarios.",
        "Section 4 discusses the interjudge agreement by presenting two measures of agreement: the Kappa Statistic and accuracy-based measurement.",
        "Section 5 investigates and reports on the significance of different linguistic factors in tense annotation via an ANOVA analysis, a logistic regression analysis and a log-linear model analysis.",
        "Finally, section 6 concludes the paper and points out directions for future research."

        "Our analysis of the annotation results from the scenario with a fully specified context show that people tend to fail to agree with each other on tense for verbs associated with interval events.",
        "The disagreement seems not to be driven by the overt linguistic features such as embedding structure and aspect markers.",
        "Lastly, among a set of overt and latent linguistic features, aspect marker presence, embedding structure and",
        "the telicity feature exhibit the strongest association with tense, potentially indicating their high utility in tense classification task.",
        "The current analysis, while suggesting certain interesting patterns in tense annotation, could be more significant if the findings could be replicated by experiments of different scales on different data sets.",
        "Furthermore, the statistical analysis could be more finely geared to capture the more subtle distinctions encoded in the features.",
        "Acknowledgement All of the annotation experiments in this paper are funded by Rackham Graduate School’s Discretionary Funds at the University of Michigan."
