        "The paper illustrates the application of a Maximum Entropy (henceforth MaxEnt) model (Ratnaparkhi 1998) to the processing of subjects and direct objects in Italian and Czech.",
        "The model makes use of richly annotated Treebanks to determine the types of linguistic factors involved in the task and weigh up their relative salience.",
        "In doing so, we set ourselves a twofold goal.",
        "On the one hand, we intend to discuss the use of Treebanks to discover typologically relevant and linguistically motivated factors and assess the relative contribution of the latter to cross-linguistic parsing issues.",
        "On the other hand, we are interested in testing the empirical plausibility of constraint-resolution models of language processing (see infra) when confronted with real language data.",
        "Current research in natural language learning and processing supports the view that grammatical competence consists in mastering and integrating multiple, parallel constraints (Seidenberg and MacDonald 1999, MacWhinney 2004).",
        "Moreover, there is growing consensus on two major properties of grammatical constraints: i.)",
        "they are probabilistic “soft constraints” (Bresnan et al.",
        "2001), and ii.)",
        "they have an inherently functional nature, involving different types of linguistic (and non linguistic) information (syntactic, semantic, etc.).",
        "These features emerge particularly clearly in dealing with one of the core aspects of grammar learning: the ability to identify syntactic relations in text.",
        "Psycholinguistic evidence shows that speakers learn to identify sentence subjects and direct objects by combining various types of probabilistic, functional cues, such as word order, noun animacy, definiteness, agreement, etc.",
        "An important observation is that the relative prominence of each such cue can considerably vary cross-linguistically.",
        "Bates et al.",
        "(1984), for example, argue that while, in English, word order is the most effective cue for Subject-Object Identification (henceforth SOI) both in syntactic processing and during the child’s syntactic development, the same cue plays second fiddle in relatively free phrase-order languages such as Italian or German.",
        "If grammatical constraints are inherently probabilistic (Manning 2003), the path through which adult grammar competence is acquired can be viewed as the process of building a stochastic model out of the linguistic input.",
        "In computational linguistics, MaxEnt models have",
        "proven to be robust statistical learning algorithms that perform well in a number of processing tasks.",
        "Being supervised learning models, they require richly annotated data as training input.",
        "Before we turn to the use of Treebanks for training a MaxEnt model for SOI, we first analyse the range of linguistic factors that are taken to play a significant role in the task."

      "text": [
        "Grammatical relations - such as subject (S) and direct object (O) - are variously encoded in languages, the two most widespread strategies being: i) structural encoding through word order, and ii) morpho-syntactic marking.",
        "In turn, morpho-syntactic marking can apply either on the noun head only, in the form of case inflections, or on both the noun and the verb, in the form of agreement marking (Croft 2003).",
        "Besides formal coding, the distribution of subjects and object is also governed by semantic and pragmatic factors, such as noun animacy, definiteness, topicality, etc.",
        "As a result, there exists a variety of linguistic clues jointly cooperating in making a particular noun phrase the subject or direct object of a sentence.",
        "Crucially for our present purposes, cross-linguistic variation does not only concern the particular strategy used to encode S and O, but also the relative strength that each factor plays in a given language.",
        "For instance, while English word order is by and large the dominant clue to identify S and O, in other languages the presence of a rich morphological system allows word order to have a much looser connection with the coding of grammatical relations, thus playing a secondary role in their identification.",
        "Moreover, there are languages where semantic and pragmatic constraints such as animacy and/or definiteness play a predominant role in the processing of grammatical relations.",
        "A large spectrum of variations exists, ranging from languages where S must have a higher degree of animacy and/or definiteness relative to O, to languages where this constraint only takes the form of a softer statistical preference (cf. Bresnan et al.",
        "2001).",
        "The goal of this paper is to explore the area of this complex space of grammar variation through careful assessment of the distribution of S and O tokens in Italian and Czech.",
        "For our present analysis, we have used a MaxEnt statistical model trained on data extracted from two syntactically annotated corpora: the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT, Bohmova et al.",
        "2003) for Czech, and the Italian Syntactic Semantic Treebank (ISST, Montemagni et al.",
        "2003) for Italian.",
        "These corpora have been chosen not only because they are the largest syntactically annotated resources for the two languages, but also because of their high degree of comparability, since they both adopt a dependency-based annotation scheme.",
        "Czech and Italian provide an interesting vantage point for the cross-lingual analysis of grammatical variation.",
        "They are both Indo-European languages, but they do not belong to the same family: Czech is a West Slavonic language, while Italian is a Romance language.",
        "For our present concerns, they appear to share two crucial features: i) the free order of grammatical relations with respect to the verb; ii) the possible absence of an overt subject.",
        "Nevertheless, they also greatly differ due to: the virtual non-existence of case marking in Italian (with the only marginal exception of personal pronouns), and the degree of phrase-order freedom in the two languages.",
        "Empirical evidence supporting the latter claim is provided in Table 1, which reports data extracted from PDT and ISST.",
        "Notice that although in both languages S and O can occur either pre-verbally or post-verbally, Czech and Italian greatly differ in their propensity to depart from the (unmarked) SVO order.",
        "While in Italian preverbal O is highly infrequent (1.90%), in Czech more than 30% of O tokens occur before the verb.",
        "The situation is similar but somewhat more balanced in the case of S, which occurs post-verbally in 22.21 % of the Italian cases, and in 40% of Czech ones.",
        "For sure, one can argue that, in spoken Italian, the number of pre-verbal objects is actually higher, because of the greater number of left dislocations and topicalizations occurring in informal speech.",
        "However reasonable, the observation does not explain away the distributional differences in the two corpora, since both PDT and ISST contain written language only.",
        "We thus suggest that there is clear empirical evidence in favour of a systematic, higher phrase-order freedom in Czech, arguably related to the well-known correlation of Czech constituent placement with sentence information structure, with the element carrying new information showing a tendency to occur sentence-finally (Stone 1990).",
        "For our present concerns, however, aspects of information structure, albeit central in Czech grammar, were not taken into account, as they happen not to be",
        "marked-up in the Italian corpus.",
        "According to the data reported in Table 1, Czech and Italian show similar correlation patterns between animacy and grammatical relations.",
        "S and O in ISST were automatically annotated for animacy using the SIMPLE Italian computational lexicon (Lenci et al.",
        "2000) as a background semantic resource.",
        "The annotation was then checked manually.",
        "Czech S and O were annotated for animacy using Czech WordNet (Pala and Smrz 2004); it is worth remarking that in Czech animacy annotation was done only automatically, without any manual revision.",
        "Italian shows a prominent asymmetry in the distribution of animate nouns in subject and object roles: over 50% of ISST subjects are animate, while only 10% of the objects are animate.",
        "Such a trend is also confirmed in Czech – although to a lesser extent - with 34.10% of animate subjects vs. 15.42% of objects.1 Such an overwhelming preference for animate subjects in corpus data suggests that animacy may play a very important role for S and O identification in both languages.",
        "Corpus data also provide interesting evidence concerning the actual role of morpho-syntactic constraints in the distribution of grammatical relations.",
        "Prima facie, agreement and case are the strongest and most directly accessible clues for S/O processing, as they are marked both overtly and locally.",
        "This is also confirmed by psycholinguistic evidence, showing that subjects tend to rely on these clues to identify S/O.",
        "However, it should be observed that agreement can be relied upon conclusively in S/O processing only when a nominal constituent and",
        "a verb do not agree in number and/or person (as in leggono il libro ‘(they) read the book’).",
        "Conversely, when N and V share the same person and number, no conclusion can be drawn, as trivially shown by a sentence like il bambino legge il libro ‘the child reads the book’.",
        "In ISST, more than 58% of O tokens agree with their governing V, thus being formally indistinguishable from S on the basis of agreement features.",
        "PDT also exhibits a similar ratio, with 56% of O tokens agreeing with their verb head.",
        "Analogous considerations apply to case marking, whose perceptual reliability is undermined by morphological syncretism, whereby different cases are realized through the same marker.",
        "Czech data reveal the massive extent of this phenomenon and its impact on SOI.",
        "As reported in Table 2, more than 56% of O tokens extracted from PDT are formally indistinguishable from S in case ending.",
        "Similarly, 45% of S tokens are formally indistinguishable from O uses on the same ground.",
        "All in all, this means that in 50% of the cases a Czech noun can not be understood as the S/O of a sentence by relying on overt case marking only.",
        "To sum up, corpus data lend support to the idea that in both Italian and in Czech SOI is governed by a complex interplay of probabilistic constraints of a different nature (morpho-syntactic, semantic, word order, etc.)",
        "as the latter are neither singly necessary nor jointly sufficient to attack the processing task at hand.",
        "It is tempting to hypothesize that the joint distribution of these data can provide a statistically reliable basis upon which relevant probabilistic constraints are bootstrapped and combined consistently.",
        "This should be possible due to i) the different degrees of clue salience in the two languages and ii) the functional need to minimize",
        "processing ambiguity in ordinary communicative exchanges.",
        "With reference to the latter point, for example, we may surmise that a speaker will be more inclined to violate one constraint on S/O distribution (e.g. word order) when another clue is available (e.g. animacy) that strongly supports the intended interpretation only.",

        "The MaxEnt framework offers a mathematically sound way to build a probabilistic model for SOI, which combines different linguistic cues.",
        "Given a linguistic context c and an outcome a∈ A that depends on c, in the MaxEnt framework the conditional probability distribution p(a|c) is estimated on the basis of the assumption that no a priori constraints must be met other than those related to a set of features fj(a,c) of c, whose distribution is derived from the training data.",
        "It can be proven that the probability distribution p satisfying the above assumption is the one with the highest entropy, is unique and has the following exponential form (Berger et al.",
        "1996):",
        "where Z(c) is a normalization factor, fj(a, c) are the values of k features of the pair (a,c) and correspond to the linguistic cues of c that are relevant to predict the outcome a.",

        "In the experiments reported below feature weights have been estimated with the Generative Iterative Scaling (GIS) algorithm implemented in the AMIS software (Miyao and Tsujii 2002).",
        "We model SOI as the task of predicting the correct syntactic function (p ∈ {subject, object} of a noun occurring in a given syntactic context u.",
        "This is equivalent to building the conditional probability distribution p((p|u) of having a syntactic function (p in a syntactic context u.",
        "Adopting the MaxEnt approach, the distribution p can be rewritten in the parametric form of (1), with features corresponding to the linguistic contextual cues relevant to SOI.",
        "The context u is a pair <vu, nu>, where vu is the verbal head and nu its nominal dependent in u.",
        "This notion of u departs from more traditional ways of describing an SOI context as a triple of one verb and two nouns in a certain syntactic configuration (e.g, SOV or VOS, etc.).",
        "In fact, we assume that SOI can be stated in terms of the more local task of establishing the grammatical function of a noun n observed in a verb-noun pair.",
        "This simplifying assumption is consistent with the claim in MacWhinney et al.",
        "(1984) that SVO word order is actually derivative from SV and VO local patterns and downplays the role of the transitive complex construction in sentence processing.",
        "Evidence in favour of this hypothesis also comes from corpus data: for instance, in ISST complete subject-verb-object configurations represent only 26% of the cases, a small percentage if compared to the 74% of verb tokens appearing with either a subject or an object only; a similar situation can be observed in PDT where complete subject-verb-object configurations occur in only 20% of the cases.",
        "Due to the comparative sparseness of canonical SVO constructions in Czech and Italian, it seems more reasonable to assume that children should pay a great deal of attention to both SV and VO units as cues in sentence perception (Matthews et al.",
        "in press).",
        "Reconstruction of the whole lexical SVO pattern can accordingly be seen as the end point of an acquisition process whereby smaller units are reanalyzed as being part of more comprehensive constructions.",
        "This hypothesis is more in line with a distributed view of canonical constructions as derivative of more basic local positional patterns, working together to yield more complex and abstract constructions.",

        "Probabilistic language models, machine language learning algorithms and linguistic theorizing all appear to support a view of language processing as a process of dynamic, on-line resolution of conflicting grammatical constraints.",
        "We begin to gain considerable insights into the complex process of bootstrapping nature and behaviour of these constraints upon observing their actual distribution in perceptually salient contexts.",
        "In our view of things, this trend outlines a promising framework providing fresh support to usage-based models of language acquisition through mathematical and computational simulations.",
        "Moreover, it allows scholars to investigate patterns of cross-linguistic typological variation that crucially depend on the appropriate setting of model parameters.",
        "Finally, it promises to solve, on a principled basis, traditional performance-oriented cruces of grammar theorizing such as degrees of human acceptability of ill-formed grammatical constructions (Hayes 2000) and the inherently graded compositionality of linguistic constructions such as morpheme-based words and word-based phrases (Bybee 2002, Hay and Baayen 2005).",
        "We argue that the current availability of comparable, richly annotated corpora and of mathematical tools and models for corpus exploration make time ripe for probing the space of grammatical variation, both intra and inter-linguistically, on unprecedented levels of sophistication and granularity.",
        "All in all, we anticipate that such a convergence is likely to have a twofold impact: it is bound to shed light on the integration of performance and competence factors in language study; it will make mathematical models of language increasingly able to accommodate richer and richer language evidence, thus putting explanatory theoretical accounts to the test of a usage-based empirical verification.",
        "In the near future, we intend to pursue two parallel lines of development.",
        "First we would like to increase the context-sensitiveness of our processing task by integrating binary grammatical constraints into the broader context of multiply conflicting grammar relations.",
        "This way, we will be in a position to capture the constraint that a (transitive) verb has at most one subject and one object, thus avoiding multiple assignment of subject (object) relations in the same context.",
        "Suppose, for example, that both nouns in a noun-noun-verb triple are amenable to a subject interpretation, but that one of them is a more likely subject than the other.",
        "Then, it is reasonable to expect the model to process the less likely subject candidate as the object of the verb in the triple.",
        "Another promising line of development is based on the observation that the",
        "order in which verb arguments appear in context is also lexically governed: in Italian, for example, report verbs show a strong tendency to select subjects post-verbally.",
