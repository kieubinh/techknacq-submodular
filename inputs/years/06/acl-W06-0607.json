        "Meeting browsers could find instances in meetings where opinions about key topics are expressed.",
        "Summarizers could include strong arguments for and against issues, to make the final outcome of the meeting more understandable.",
        "A preliminary user survey (Lisowska 2003) showed that users would like to be able to query meeting records with subjective questions like “Show me the conflicts of opinions between X and Y” , “Who made the highest number of positive/negative comments” and “Give me all the contributions of participant X in favor of alternative A regarding the issue I.” A QA system with a component to recognize opinions would be able to help find answers to such questions.",

        "(1)2 OCK: Revenues of less than a million and losses of like five million you know that's pathetic",
        "Here, the speaker, OCK, shows his strong negative evaluation by using the expression “That’s pathetic.”",
        "(2) OCK: No it might just be a piece of junk cheap piece of junk that's not a good investment",
        "In (2), the speaker uses the term “just a piece of junk” to express his negative evaluation and uses this to argue for his belief that it is “not a good investment.”",
        "(3) OCK: Yeah I think that's the wrong image for an investment bank he wants stability and s safety and you don't want flashy like zip",
        "' Throughout this paper we take examples from a meeting where a group of people are deciding on a new car for an investment bank.",
        "The management wants to attract younger investors with a sporty car.",
        "ping around the corner kind of thing you know The example above shows that the speaker has a negative judgment towards the suggestion of a sports car (that was made in the previous turn) which is indicated by the words “wrong image.” The speaker then goes on to positively argue for what he wants.",
        "He further argues against the current suggestion by using more negative terms like “flashy” and “zipping around the corner.” The speaker believes that “zipping around the corner” is bad as it would give a wrong impression of the bank to the customers.",
        "In the absence of such analyses, the decision making process and rationale behind the outcomes of meetings, which form an important part of the organization’s memory, might remain unavailable.",
        "In this paper, we perform annotation of a meeting corpus to lay the foundation for research on opinion detection in speech.",
        "We show how categories from an opinion (subjectivity) annotation scheme, which was developed for news articles, can be applied to the genre of multi-party meetings.",
        "The new genre poses challenges as it is significantly different from the text domain, where opinion analysis has traditionally been applied.",
        "Specifically, differences arise because:",
        "1) There are many participants interacting with one another, each expressing his or her own opinion, and eliciting reactions in the process.",
        "2) Social interactions may constrain how openly people express their opinions; i.e., they are often indirect in their negative evaluations.",
        "We also explore the influence of speech on human perception of opinions.",
        "Specifically, we annotated some meeting data with the opinion categories Sentiment and Arguing as defined in Wilson and Wiebe (2005).",
        "In our annotation we first distinguish whether a Sentiment or Arguing is being expressed.",
        "If one is, we then mark the polarity (i.e., positive or negative) and the intensity (i.e., how strong the opinion is).",
        "Annotating the individual opinion expressions is useful in this genre, because we see many utterances that have more than one type of opinion (e.g. (3) above).",
        "To investigate how opinions are expressed in speech, we divide our annotation into two tasks, one in which the annotator only reads the raw text, and the other in which the annotator reads the raw text and also listens to the speech.",
        "We measure inter-annotator agreement for both tasks.",
        "We found that the opinion categories apply well to the multi-party meeting data, although there is some room for improvement: the Kappa values range from 0.32 to 0.69.",
        "As has been found for other types of annotations in speech, agreement is higher when the annotators both read and listen to the data than when they only read the transcripts.",
        "Interestingly, the advantages are more dramatic for some categories than others.",
        "And, in both conditions, agreement is higher for the positive than for the negative categories.",
        "We discuss possible reasons for these disparities.",
        "Prosodic clues have been exploited to perform automatic detection of speaker emotion (Liscombe et al.",
        "2003).",

        "The ISL meeting corpus (Burger and Sloane, 2004) is annotated with dialog acts and discourse moves like initiation and response, which in turn consist of dialog tags such as query, align, and statement.",
        "Their statement dialog category would not only include Sentiment and Arguing tags discussed in this paper, but it would also include objective statements and other types of subjectivity.",
        "“Hot spots” in meetings closely relate to our work because they find sections in the meeting where participants are involved in debates or high arousal activity (Wrede and Shriberg 2003).",
        "While that work distinguishes between high arousal and low arousal, it does not distinguish between opinion or non-opinion or the different types of opinion.",
        "However, Janin et al.",
        "(2004) suggest that there is a relationship between dialog acts and involvement, and that involved utterances contain significantly more evaluative and subjective statements as well as extremely positive or negative answers.",
        "Thus we believe it may be beneficial for such works to make these distinctions.",
        "Another closely related work that finds participants’ positions regarding issues is argument diagramming (Rienks et al.",
        "2005).",
        "This approach, based on the IBIS system (Kunz and Rittel 1970), divides a discourse into issues, and finds lines of deliberated arguments.",
        "However they do not distinguish between subjective and objective contributions towards the meeting."

        "In this paper we performed an annotation study of opinions in meetings, and investigated the effects of speech.",
        "We have shown that it is possible to reliably detect opinions within multiparty conversations.",
        "Our consistently better agreement results with text+speech input over text-only input suggest that speech is a reliable indicator of opinions.",
        "We have also found that Annotator Uncertainty decreased with speech input.",
        "Our results also show that speech is a more informative indicator for negative versus positive categories.",
        "We hypothesize that this is due to the fact the people express their positive attitudes more explicitly.",
        "The speech signal is thus even more important for discerning negative opinions.",
        "This experience has also helped us gain insights to the ambiguities that arise due to sarcasm and humor.",
        "Our promising results open many new avenues for research.",
        "It will be interesting to see how our categories relate to other discourse structures, both at the shallow level (agreement/disagreement) as well as at the deeper level",
        "(intentions/goals).",
        "It will also be interesting to investigate how other forms of subjectivity like speculation and intention are expressed in multiparty discourse.",
        "Finding prosodic correlates of speech as well as lexical clues that help in opinion detection would be useful in building subjectivity detection applications for multiparty meetings."
