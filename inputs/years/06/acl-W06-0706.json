        "Email inquiries sent to help desks often “revolve around a small set of common questions and issues”.1 This means that help-desk operators spend most of their time dealing with problems that have been previously addressed.",
        "Further, a significant proportion of help-desk responses contain a low level of technical content, corresponding, for example, to inquires addressed to the wrong group, or insufficient detail provided by the customer about his or her problem.",
        "Organizations and clients would benefit if the efforts of human operators were focused on difficult, atypical problems, and an automated process was employed to deal with the easier problems.",
        "In this paper, we report on our experiments with corpus-based approaches to the automation of help-desk responses.",
        "Our study is based on a corpus of 30,000 email dialogues between users and help-desk operators at Hewlett-Packard.",
        "These dialogues deal with a variety of user requests, which include requests for technical assistance, inquiries about products, and queries about how to return faulty products or parts.",
        "In order to restrict the scope of our study, we considered two-turn short dialogues, comprising a request followed by an answer, where the answer has at most 15 lines.",
        "This yields a sub-corpus of 6659 dialogues.",
        "As a first step, we have automatically clustered the corpus according to the subject line of the first email.",
        "This process yielded 15 topic-based datasets that contain between 135 and 1200 email dialogues.",
        "Owing to time limitations, the procedures described in this paper were applied to 8 of the datasets, corresponding to approximately 75% of the dialogues.",
        "Analysis of our corpus yields the following observations.",
        "• O1: Requests containing precise information,",
        "such as product names or part specifications, sometimes elicit helpful, precise answers referring to this information, while other times they elicit answers that do not refer to the query terms, but contain generic information (e.g., referring customers to another help group or asking them to call a particular phone number).",

        "We apologize for the inconvenience.",
        "• O2: Operators tend to reuse the same sentences in different responses.",
        "This is partly a result of companies having in-house manuals that prescribe how to generate an answer.",
        "For instance, answers A3 and A4 in Figure 2 share the sentence in italics.",
        "These observations prompt us to consider complementary approaches along two separate dimensions of our problem.",
        "The first dimension pertains to the technique applied to determine the information in an answer, and the second dimension pertains to the granularity of the information.",
        "• Observation O1 leads us to consider two techniques for obtaining information: retrieval and prediction.",
        "Retrieval returns an information item by matching its terms to query terms (Salton and McGill, 1983).",
        "Hence, it is likely to obtain precise information if available.",
        "In contrast, prediction uses features of requests and responses to select an information item.",
        "For example, the absence of a particular term in a request may be a good predictive feature (which cannot be considered in traditional retrieval).",
        "Thus, prediction could yield replies that do not match particular query terms.",
        "• Observation O2 leads us to consider two levels of granularity: document and sentence.",
        "That is, we can obtain a document comprising a complete answer on the basis of a request (i.e., reuse an answer to a previous request), or we can obtain individual sentences and then combine them to compose an answer, as is done in multi-document summarization (Filatova and Hatzivassiloglou, 2004).",

        "Our aim in this paper is to investigate when the different methods are applicable, and whether individual methods are uniquely successful in certain situations.",
        "For this purpose, we decided to assign a level of success not only to complete responses, but also to partial ones (obtained with the sentence-based methods).",
        "The rationale for this is that we believe that a partial high-precision response is better than no response, and better than a complete response that contains incorrect information.",
        "We plan to test these assumptions in future user studies.",

        "The hybrid method applies prediction possibly followed by retrieval to information at the sentence level.",
        "The results show that with the exception of Sentence Retrieval, the different methods can address a significant portion of the requests.",
        "A future avenue of research is thus to characterize situations where different methods are applicable, in order to derive decision procedures that determine the best method automatically.",
        "We have also started to investigate an intermediate level of granularity: paragraphs.",
        "Our results suggest that the automatic evaluation method requires further consideration.",
        "As seen in Section 3, our f-score penalizes the Sentence Prediction and Hybrid methods when they produce good answers that are more informative than the model answer.",
        "As mentioned previously, a user study would provide a more conclusive evaluation of the system, and could be used to determine preferences regarding partial responses.",
        "Finally, we propose the following extensions to our current implementation.",
        "First, we would like to improve the representation used for clustering, prediction and retrieval by using features that incorporate word-based similarity metrics (Pedersen et al., 2004).",
        "Secondly, we intend to investigate a more focused sentence retrieval approach that utilizes syntactic matching of sentences.",
        "For example, if a sentence cluster is strongly predicted by a request, but the cluster is uncohesive because of a low verb agreement, then the retrieval should favour the sentences whose verbs match those in the request."
