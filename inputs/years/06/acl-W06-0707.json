        "The Document Understanding Conference (DUC) is a series of evaluations of automatic text summarization systems.",
        "It is organized by the National Institute of Standards of Technology with the goals of furthering progress in automatic summarization and enabling researchers to participate in large-scale experiments.",
        "In DUC 2001-2004 a growing number of research groups participated in the evaluation of generic and focused summaries of English newspaper and newswire data.",
        "Various target sizes were used (10-400 words) and both single-document summaries and summaries of multiple documents were evaluated (around 10 documents per set).",
        "Summaries were manually judged for both content and readability.",
        "To evaluate content, each peer (human or automatic) summary was compared against a single model (human) summary using SEE (http://www.isi.edu/ cyl/SEE/) to estimate the percentage of information in the model that was covered in the peer.",
        "Additionally, automatic evaluation of content coverage using ROUGE (Lin, 2004) was explored in 2004.",
        "Human summaries vary in both writing style and content.",
        "For example, (Harman and Over, 2004) noted that a human summary can vary in its level of granularity, whether the summary has a very high-level analysis or primarily contains details.",
        "They analyzed the effects of human variaion in the DUC evaluations and concluded that despite large variation in model summaries, the rankings of the systems when compared against a single model for each document set remained stable when averaged over a large number of document sets and human assessors.",
        "The use of a large test set to smooth over natural human variation is not a new technique; it is the approach that has been taken in TREC (Text Retrieval Conference) for many years (Voorhees and Buckley, 2002).",
        "While evaluators can achieve stable overall system rankings by averaging scores over a large number of document sets, system builders are still faced with the challenge of producing a summary for a given document set that is most likely to satisfy any human user (since they cannot know ahead of time which human will be using or judging the summary).",
        "Thus, system developers desire an evaluation methodology that takes into account human variation in summaries for any given document set.",
        "DUC 2005 marked a major change in direction from previous years.",
        "The road mapping committee had strongly recommended that new tasks be undertaken that were strongly tied to a clear user application.",
        "At the same time, the program committee wanted to work on new evaluation methodologies and metrics that would take into",
        "account variation of content in human-authored summaries.",
        "Therefore, DUC 2005 had a single user-oriented system task that allowed the community to put some time and effort into helping with a new evaluation framework.",
        "The system task modeled real-world complex question answering (Amigo et al., 2004).",
        "Systems were to synthesize from a set of 25-50 documents a brief, well-organized, fluent answer to a need for information that could not be met by just stating a name, date, quantity, etc.",
        "Summaries were evaluated for both content and readability.",
        "The task design attempted to constrain two parameters that could produce summaries with widely different content: focus and granularity.",
        "Having a question to focus the summary was intended to improve agreement in content between the model summaries.",
        "Additionally, the assessor who developed each topic specified the desired granularity (level of generalization) of the summary.",
        "Granularity was a way to express one type of user preference; one user might want a general background or overview summary, while another user might want specific details that would allow him to answer questions about specific events or situations.",
        "Because it is both impossible and unnatural to eliminate all human variation, our assessors created as many manual summaries as feasible for each topic, to provide examples of the range of normal human variability in the summarization task.",
        "These multiple models would provide more representative training data to system developers, while enabling additional experiments to investigate the effect of human variability on the evaluation of summarization systems.",
        "As in past DUCs, assessors manually evaluated each summary for readability using a set of linguistic quality questions.",
        "Summary content was manually evaluated using the pseudo-extrinsic measure of responsiveness, which does not attempt pairwise comparison of peers against a model summary but gives a coarse ranking of all the summaries based on responsiveness of the summary to the topic.",
        "In parallel, ISI and Columbia University led the summarization research community in two exploratory efforts at intrinsic evaluation of summary content; these evaluations compared peer summaries against multiple reference summaries, using Basic Elements at ISI and Pyramids at Columbia University.",
        "This paper describes the DUC 2005 task and the results of our evaluations of summary content and readability.",
        "(Hovy et al., 2005) and (Passonneau et al., 2005) provide additional details and results of the evaluations of summary content using Basic Elements and Pyramids."

        "The DUC 2005 task was a complex question-focused summarization task that required summarizers to piece together information from multiple documents to answer a question or set of questions as posed in a topic.",
        "Assessors developed a total of 50 topics to be used as test data.",
        "For each topic, the assessor selected 25-50 related documents from the Los Angeles Times and Financial Times of London and formulated a topic statement, which was a request for information that could be answered using the selected documents.",
        "The topic statement could be in the form of a question or set of related questions and could include background information that the assessor thought would help clarify his/her information need.",
        "The assessor also indicated the “granularity” of the desired response for each topic.",
        "That is, they indicated whether they wanted the answer to their question(s) to name specific events, people, places, etc., or whether they wanted a general, high-level answer.",
        "Only one value of granularity was given for each topic, since the goal was not to measure the effect of different granularities on system performance for a given topic, but to provide additional information about the user’s preferences to both human and automatic summarizers.",
        "An example DUC topic follows: num: D345 title: American Tobacco Companies Overseas narr: In the early 1990’s, American tobacco companies tried to expand their business overseas.",
        "What did these companies do or try to do and where?",
        "How did their parent companies fare?",
        "granularity: specific The summarization task was the same for both human and automatic summarizers: Given a DUC topic with granularity specification and a set of documents relevant to the topic, the summarization task was to create from the documents a brief,",
        "well-organized, fluent summary that answers the need for information expressed in the topic, at the specified level of granularity.",
        "The summary could be no longer than 250 words (whitespace-delimited tokens).",
        "Summaries over the size limit were truncated, and no bonus was given for creating a shorter summary.",
        "No specific formatting other than linear was allowed.",
        "The summary should include (in some form or other) all the information in the documents that contributed to meeting the information need.",
        "Ten assessors produced a total of 9 human summaries for each of 20 topics, and 4 human summaries for each of the remaining 30 topics.",
        "The summarization task was a relatively difficult task, requiring about 5 hours to manually create each summary.",
        "Thus, there would be a real benefit to users if the task could be performed automatically."

        "A significant minority of systems first decomposed the topic narrative into a set of simpler questions, and then extracted sentences to answer each subquestion.",
        "Systems differed in the approach taken to compute relevance and redundancy, using similarity metrics ranging from simple term frequency to semantic graph matching.",
        "In order to include more relevant information in the summary, systems attempted within-sentence compression by removing phrases such as parentheticals and relative clauses.",
        "Many systems simply ignored the granularity specification.",
        "The systems that addressed granularity did so by preferring to extract sentences that contained proper names for topics with a “specific” granularity but not for topics with “general” granularity.",
        "Cross-sentence dependencies had to be handled, including anaphora.",
        "Strategies for dealing with pronouns that occurred in relevant sentences included co-reference resolution, including the previous sentence for additional context, or simply excluding all sentences containing any pronouns.",
        "Most systems made no attempt to reword the extracted sentences to improve the readability of the final summary.",
        "Although some systems grouped related sentences together to improve cohesion, the most common heuristic to improve readability was simply to order the extracted sentences by document date and position in the document.",

        "We therefore changed the scoring of responsiveness in 2006 so that it is based on the same scale as the linguistic quality questions; this may reduce the discriminative power of the responsiveness measure but should produce scores that more accurately reflect the true differences between summaries."
