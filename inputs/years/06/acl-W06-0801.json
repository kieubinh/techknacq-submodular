        "Compared to other translation methods",
        "such as transitive translation using machine translation and direct translation using bilingual dictionary (the source-target dictionary is a poor bilingual dictionary), our transitive translation and the combined translation (direct translation and transitive translation) achieve higher IR scores.",
        "The transitive translation achieves a 41% performance of the monolingual IR and the combined translation achieves a 49% performance of the monolingual IR.",
        "The two important methods in our transitive translation are the borrowed word translation and the keyword selection method.",
        "The borrowed word approach can reduce the number of OOV from 50 words to 5 words using a pivot-target (English-Japanese) bilingual dictionary and target (Japanese) proper name dictionary.",
        "The keyword selection using the combination of mutual information score and TF×IDF score has improved the baseline transitive translation.",
        "The other important method, the combination method between transitive and direct translation using bilingual dictionaries also improves the CLIR performance."
