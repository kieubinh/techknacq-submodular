        "Types of individual instantiations of LMF can include monolingual, bilingual or multilingual lexical resources.",
        "The same specifications are to be used for both small and large lexicons.",
        "The descriptions range from morphology, syntax, semantic to translation information organized as different extensions of an obligatory core package.",

        "Afterwards, the ISO-TC37 National delegations decided to address standards dedicated to NLP.",
        "These standards are currently elaborated as high level specifications and deal with word segmentation (ISO 24614), annotations (ISO 24611, 24612 and 24615), feature structures (ISO 24610), and lexicons (ISO 24613) with this latest one being the focus of the current paper.",
        "These standards are based on low level specifications dedicated to constants, namely data categories (revision of ISO 12620), language codes (ISO 639), script codes (ISO 15924), country codes (ISO 3166), dates (ISO 8601) and Unicode (ISO 10646).",
