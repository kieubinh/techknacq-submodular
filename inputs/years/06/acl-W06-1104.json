        "Linguistic distance plays an important role in many applications like information retrieval, word sense disambiguation, text summarization or spelling correction.",
        "It is defined on different kinds of textual units, e.g. documents, parts of a document (e.g. words and their surrounding context), words or concepts (Lebart and Rajman, 2000).2 Linguistic distance between words is inverse to their semantic similarity or relatedness.",
        "Semantic similarity is typically defined via the lexical relations of synonymy (automobile – car) and hypernymy (vehicle – car), while semantic relatedness (SR) is defined to cover any kind of lexical or functional association that may exist be",
        "tween two words (Gurevych, 2005).3 Dissimilar words can be semantically related, e.g. via functional relationships (night – dark) or when they are antonyms (high – low).",
        "Many NLP applications require knowledge about semantic relatedness rather than just similarity (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006).",
        "A number of competing approaches for computing semantic relatedness of words have been developed (see Section 2).",
        "A commonly accepted method for evaluating these approaches is to compare their results with a gold standard based on human judgments on word pairs.",
        "For that purpose, relatedness scores for each word pair have to be determined experimentally.",
        "Creating test datasets for such experiments has so far been a labor-intensive manual process.",
        "We propose a corpus-based system to automatically create test datasets for semantic relatedness experiments.",
        "Previous datasets were created analytically, preventing their use to gain insights into the nature of SR and also not necessarily reflecting the reality found in a corpus.",
        "They were also limited in size.",
        "We provide a larger annotated test set that is used to better analyze the connections and differences between the approaches for computing semantic relatedness.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: we first focus on the notion of semantic relatedness and how it can be evaluated.",
        "Section 3 reviews related work.",
        "Section 4 describes our system for automatically extracting word pairs from a corpus.",
        "Furthermore, the experimental setup leading to human judgments of semantic relatedness",
        "is presented.",

        "Various approaches for computing semantic relatedness of words or concepts have been proposed, e.g. dictionary-based (Lesk, 1986), ontology-based (Wu and Palmer, 1994; Leacock and Chodorow, 1998), information-based (Resnik, 1995; Jiang and Conrath, 1997) or distributional (Weeds and Weir, 2005).",
        "The knowledge sources used for computing relatedness can be as different as dictionaries, ontologies or large corpora.",
        "According to Budanitsky and Hirst (2006), there are three prevalent approaches for evaluating SR measures: mathematical analysis, application-specific evaluation and comparison with human judgments.",
        "Mathematical analysis can assess a measure with respect to some formal properties, e.g. whether a measure is a metric (Lin, 1998).4 However, mathematical analysis cannot tell us whether a measure closely resembles human judgments or whether it performs best when used in a certain application.",
        "The latter question is tackled by application-specific evaluation, where a measure is tested within the framework of a certain application, e.g. word sense disambiguation (Patwardhan et al., 2003) or malapropism detection (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006).",
        "Lebart and Rajman (2000) argue for application-specific evaluation of similarity measures, because measures are always used for some task.",
        "But they also note that evaluating a measure as part of a usually complex application only indirectly assesses its quality.",
        "A certain measure may work well in one application, but not in another.",
        "Application-based evaluation can only state the fact, but give little explanation about the reasons.",
        "The remaining approach - comparison with human judgments - is best suited for application independent evaluation of relatedness measures.",
        "Human annotators are asked to judge the relatedness of presented word pairs.",
        "Results from these experiments are used as a gold standard for evaluation.",
        "A further advantage of comparison with human judgments is the possibility to gain deeper",

        "This is an important property if semantic relatedness is used in information retrieval where users tend to use specific search terms (Porsche) rather than general ones (car).",
        "Furthermore, manually selected word pairs are often biased towards highly related pairs (Gurevych, 2006), because human annotators tend to select only highly related pairs connected by relations they are aware of.",
        "Automatic corpus-based selection of word pairs is more objective, leading to a balanced dataset with pairs connected by all kinds of lexical-semantic relations.",
        "Morris and Hirst (2004) pointed out that many relations between words in a text are non-classical (i.e. other than typical taxonomic relations like synonymy or hypernymy) and therefore not covered by semantic similarity.",

        "We measured semantic relatedness instead of semantic similarity.",
        "The former is a more complicated task for annotators because its definition includes all kinds of lexical-semantic relations not just synonymy.",

        "concept pairs which have been rated very differently by test subjects depending on their experience.",
        "Future experiments should ensure that domain-specific pairs are judged by domain experts to reduce disagreement between annotators caused by varying degrees of familiarity with the domain.",
        "An analysis of the data shows that test subjects more often agreed on highly related or unrelated concept pairs, while they often disagreed on pairs with a medium relatedness value.",
        "This result raises the question whether human judgments of semantic relatedness with medium scores are reliable and should be used for evaluating semantic relatedness measures.",
        "We plan to investigate the impact of this outcome on the evaluation of semantic relatedness measures.",
        "Additionally, for some applications like information retrieval it may be sufficient to detect highly related pairs rather than accurately rating word pairs with medium values.",
        "There is also a significant difference between the correlation coefficient for different POS combinations.",
        "Further investigations are needed to elucidate whether these differences are caused by the new procedure for corpus-based selection of word pairs proposed in this paper or are due to inherent properties of semantic relations existing between word classes."
