        "The success of applying memory-based learning to problems such as POS tagging, named-entity recognition, partial parsing, or word sense disambiguation (cf. (Daelemans et al., 1996; Daelemans et al., 1999; Mooney, 1996; Tjong Kim Sang, 2002; Veenstra et al., 2000)) shows that the bias of this similarity-based approach is suitable for processing natural language problems.",
        "In (K¨ubler, 2004a; K¨ubler, 2004b), we extended the application of memory-based learning to full scale parsing, a problem which cannot easily be described as a classification problem.",
        "In this approach, the most similar sentence is found in the training data, and the respective syntax tree is then adapted to the input sentence.",
        "The parser was developed for parsing German dialog data, and it is based on the observation that dialogs tend to be repetitive in their structure.",
        "Thus, there is a higher than normal probability of finding the same or a very similar sentence in the training data.",
        "The present paper examines the possibilities of extending the concepts in (K¨ubler, 2004a; K¨ubler, 2004b) to unrestricted newspaper text.",
        "Since in newspaper text, the probability of finding the same sentence or a very similar one is rather low, the parser needs to be extended to a more flexible approach which does not rely as much on identity between sentences as the original parser.",
        "The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 explains the original parser in more detail, and section 3 describes the treebank used in the investigation.",
        "Section 4 investigates whether the chunk sequences used for selecting the most similar sentence in the training data give a reliable estimate of the syntax tree, section 5 investigates properties of tree sets associated with chunk sequences, and section 6 draws conclusions on the architecture of an extended case-based parser."

        "The parser in (K¨ubler, 2004a; K¨ubler, 2004b) approaches parsing as the task of finding a complete syntax tree rather than incrementally building the tree by rule applications, as in standard PCFGs.",
        "Despite this holistic approach to selecting the most similar tree, the parser has a reasonable performance: the first column of Table 1 shows the parser’s evaluation on German spontaneous speech dialog data.",
        "This approach profits from the fact that it has a more global view on parsing than a PCFG parser.",
        "In this respect, the memory-based",
        "parser employs a similar strategy to the one in Data-Oriented Parsing (DOP) (Bod, 1998; Scha et al., 1999).",
        "Both parsers use larger tree fragments than the standard trees.",
        "The two approaches differ mainly in two respects: 1) DOP allows different tree fragments to be extracted from one tree, thus making different combinations of fragments available for the assembly of a specific tree.",
        "Our parser, in contrast, allows only one clearly defined tree fragment for each tree, in which only the phrase-internal structure is variable.",
        "2) Our parser does not use a probabilistic model, but a simple cost function instead.",
        "Both factors in combination result in a nearly deterministic, and thus highly efficient parsing strategy.",
        "Since the complete tree structure in the memory-based parser is produced in two steps (retrieval of the syntax tree belonging to the most similar sentence and adaptation of this tree to the input sentence), the parser must rely on more information than the local information on which a PCFG parser suggests the next constituent.",
        "For this reason, we suggested a backing-off architecture, in which each modules used different types of easily obtainable linguistic information such as the sequence of words, the sequence of POS tags, and the sequence of chunks.",
        "Chunk parsing is a partial parsing approach (Abney, 1991), which is generally implemented as cascade of finite-state transducers.",
        "A chunk parser generally gives an analysis on the clause level and on the phrase level.",
        "However, it does not make any decisions concerning the attachment of locally ambiguous phrases.",
        "Thus, the German sentence in (1a) receives the chunk annotation in (1b).",

        "While for the chunks to the right of the verb chunk, no attachment decision could be made, the genitive noun phrase des Lebens could be grouped with the PC because of German word order regularities, which allow exactly one constituent in front of the finite verb.",
        "It can be hypothesized that the selection of the most similar sentence based on sequences of words or POS tags works best for dialog data because of the repetitive nature of such dialogs.",
        "The strategy with the greatest potential for generalization to newspaper texts is thus the usage of chunk sequences.",
        "In the remainder of this paper, we will therefore concentrate on this approach.",
        "The proposed parser is based on the following architecture: The parser needs a syntactically annotated treebank for training.",
        "In the learning phase, the training data are chunk parsed, the chunk sequences are extracted from the chunk parse and fitted to the syntax trees; then the trees are stored in memory.",
        "In the annotation phase, the new sentence is chunk parsed.",
        "Based on the sequence of chunks, the group of most similar sentences, which all share the same chunk analysis, is retrieved from memory.",
        "In a second step, the best sentence from this group needs to be selected, and the corresponding tree needs to be adapted to the input sentence.",
        "The complexity of such a parser crucially depends on the question whether these chunk se",
        "quences are reliable indicators for the correct syntax trees.",
        "Basically, there exist two extreme possibilities: 1) most chunk sequences are associated with exactly one sentence, and 2) there is only a small number of different chunk sequences, which are each associated with many sentences.",
        "In the first case, the selection of the correct tree based on a chunk sequence is trivial but the coverage of the parser would be rather low.",
        "The parser would encounter many sentences with chunk sequences which are not present in the training data.",
        "In the second case, in contrast, the coverage of chunk sequences would be good, but then such a chunk sequence would correspond to many different trees.",
        "As a consequence, the tree selection process would have to be more elaborate.",
        "Both extremes would be extremely difficult for a parser to handle, so in the optimal case, we should have a good coverage of chunk sequences combined with a reasonable number of trees associated with a chunk sequence.",
        "The investigation on the usefulness of chunk sequences was performed on the data of the German treebank T¨uBa-D/Z (Telljohann et al., 2004) and on output from KaRoPars, a partial parser for German (M¨uller and Ule, 2002).",
        "But in principle, the parsing approach is valid for languages ranging from a fixed to a more flexible word order.",

        "Out of the 22 091 sentences in the treebank, there are 20 340 different trees (types) and 14 894 different chunk sequences.",

        "At a first glance, the result indicates that the chunk sequences are very good indicators for selecting the correct syntax tree.",
        "The negative aspect of this ratio is that many of these chunk sequences will not be part of the training data.",
        "This is corroborated by an experiment in which one tenth of the complete data set of chunk sequences (test set) was tested against the remainder of the data set (training set) to see how many of the test sequences could be found in the training data.",

        "In this case, deletions from the input sequence could be given a much higher weight (i.e. cost) than insertions.",

        "This modification would allow a principled treatment of the relative free word order of German.",

        "In the experiments reported here, we have shown that it is possible to obtain a wide range of levels of generality in the chunk sequences, depending on the types of information extracted from the partial anaylses and on the decision whether to use sentences or clauses as basic segments for the extraction of chunk sequences.",
        "Once a robust method is implemented to split trees into subtrees based on clauses, chunk sequences can be extracted on the clause level rather than from complete sentences.",
        "Consequently, the tree sets will also reach a higher cardinality.",
        "However, a tree selection method based on lexical information will be indispensable even then.",
        "For this tree selection, a method for determining the similarity of tree structures needs to be developed.",
        "The measure used in the experiments reported here, F , is only a very crude approximation, which serves well for an initial investigation, but which is not good enough for a parser depending on such a similarity measure.",
        "The optimal combination of chunk sequences and tree selection methods will have to be determined empirically."
