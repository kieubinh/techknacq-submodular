        "Language contact is a common phenomenon which may even be growing due to the increased mobility of recent years.",
        "It is also linguistically significant, since contact effects are prominent in linguistic structure and well-recognized con-founders in the task of historical reconstruction.",
        "Nonetheless we seem to have no way of assaying the aggregate affects of contacts, as Weinreich famously noted: “No easy way of measuring or characterizing the total impact of one language on another in the speech of bilinguals has been, or probably can be devised.",
        "The only possible procedure is to describe the various forms of interference and to tabulate their frequency.” (Weinreich, 1953, p. 63) This paper proposes a technique for measuring the aggregate degree of syntactic difference between two varieties.",
        "We shall thus attempt to measure the “total impact” in Weinreich’s sense, albeit with respect to a single linguistic level, syntax.",
        "If such a measure could be developed, it would be important not only in the study of language contact, but also in the study of second-language acquisition.",
        "A numerical measure of syntactic difference would enable these fields to look afresh at issues such as the time course of second-language acquisition, the relative importance of factors influencing the degree of difference such as the mother tongue of the speakers, other languages they know, the length and time of their experience in the second language, the role of formal instruction, etc.",
        "It would make the data of such studies amenable to the more powerful statistical analysis reserved for numerical data.",
        "Naturally we want more than a measure which simply assigns a numerical value to the difference between two syntactic varieties: we want to be able to examine the sources of the difference both in order to win confidence in the measure, but also to answer linguistic questions about the relative stability/volatility of syntactic structures."

        "Second, our choice of part-of-speech categories may bias the results, since other research might use other POS categories, and third, that POS trigrams do not reflect syntax completely.",
        "We first develop these last two objections further, and then explain why it is reasonable to proceed this way.",
        "Ideally we should like to have at our disposal the syntactic equivalent of an international phonetic alphabet (IPA, 1949), i.e. an accepted means of noting (an interesting level of) syntactic structure for which there was reasonable scientific consensus.",
        "But no such system exists.",
        "Moreover, the ideal system would necessarily reflect the hierarchical structure of dependency found in all contemporary theories of syntax, whether directly based on dependencies or indirectly reflected in constituent structure.",
        "Since it is unlikely that researchers will take the time to hand-annotate large amounts of data, meaning we shall need automatically annotated data, this leads to a second problem, viz., that our parsers, the automatic data annotators capable of full annotation, are not yet robust enough for this task.",
        "(Even the best score only about 90% per constituent on edited newspaper prose.)",
        "We have no solution to the problem of the missing consensual annotation system, but we wish to press on, since it will be sufficient if we can provide a measure which correlates strongly with syntactic differences.",
        "We note that natural language processing work on tagging has compared different tag sets, noting primarily the obvious, that larger sets result in lower accuracy (Manning and Sch¨utze, 1999, 372ff.).",
        "Since we aim here to contribute to the study of language contact and second-language learning, we shall choose a linguistically sensitive set, that is, a large set designed by linguists.",
        "We have not experimented with different tagsets.",
        "With regard to the second objection, the fact that syntax concerns more than POS trigrams, we wish to deny that this is a genuine problem for the development of a measure of difference.",
        "We note that our situation in measuring syntactic differences is similar to other situations in which effective measures have been established.",
        "For example, even though researchers in first language acquisition are very aware that syntactic development is reflected in the number of categories, and rules and/or constructions used, the degree to which principles of agreement and government are respected, the fidelity to adult word order patterns, etc., still they are in large agreement that the very simple MEAN LENGTH OF UTTERANCE (MLU) is an excellent measure of syntactic maturity (Ritchie and Bhatia, 1998).",
        "Similarly, life expectancy and infant mortality rates are considered reliable indications of health when large populations are compared.",
        "We therefore continue, postulating that the measure we propose will corre",
        "late with syntactic differences as a whole, even if it does not measure them directly.",
        "In fact we can be rather optimistic about using POS trigrams given the consensus in syntactic theory that a great deal of hierarchical structure is predictable given the knowledge of lexical categories, in particular given the lexical HEAD.",
        "Sells (1982, §§ 2.2, 5.3, 4.1) demonstrates that this was common to theories in the 1980’s (Government and Binding theory, Generalized Phrase Structure Grammar, and Lexical Function Grammar), and the situation has changed little in the successor theories (Minimalism and Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar).",
        "There is, on the other hand, consensus that the very strict lexicalism which Sells’s work sketched must be relaxed in favor of “constructionalism” (Fillmore and Kay, 1999), but even in such theories syntactic heads have a privileged, albeit less dominant status.l Let us further note that the focus on POS trigrams is poised to identify not only deviant syntactic uses, such as the one given as an example above, but also overuse and under-use of linguistic structure, whose importance is emphasized by researchers on second-language acquisition (Coseriu, 1970), (de Bot et al., 2005, A3,B3).",
        "According to these experts it is misleading to consider only errors, as second language learners likewise tend to overuse certain possibilities and tend to avoid (and therefore underuse) others.",

        "If we permuted n-grams, we might in part measure the internal coherence of the two initial sub-corpora, i.e., the coherence due to the fact that both sub-corpora use language conforming to the rules of English syntax.",
        "If we permuted n-grams, this coherence would be lost, and the measurement of difference would be affected.",
        "In the terminology of permutation statistics: the elements that are permuted must be reasonably independent.",
        "So we shall permute not n-grams, but rather entire sentences.",

        "While the result of permuting elements in a Monte Carlo fashion always results in two sub-corpora that have the same number of elements as in the base-case, our problem is that the elements we permute are sentences, while what we measure are n-grams.",

        "The N/COM-PREP-ADV pattern (corresponding to the use of in here) is also worth noting, as it falls into the class of expressions which is not absolutely in error (The material is in here), but it is clearly being overused in the example above.",
        "Presumably this is a case of hypercorrection from Finnish, a language without prepositions.",
        "We conclude from this experiment that the procedure is promising.",
        "On the other hand there were also problems, perhaps most seriously with the use of the tags denoting pauses and hesitations, where we found that the tag trigrams most responsible for the deviant measures in the corpora involved disfluencies of one sort or another.",

        "This paper has proposed a way of going beyond counts of individual phenomena to a measure of aggregate syntactic difference.",
        "The technique may be implemented effectively, and its results are subject to statistical analysis using permutation statistics.",
        "The technique proposed follow Aarts and Granger (1998) in using part-of-speech trigrams.",
        "We argue that such lexical categories are likely to reflect a great deal of syntactic structure given the tenets of linguistic theory according to which more abstract structure is, in general, projected from lexical categories.",
        "We go beyond Aarts and Granger in Showing how entire histograms of POS trigrams may be used to characterize aggregate syntactic distance, in particular by showing how this can be analyzed.",
        "We fall short of Weinreich’s goal of assaying “total impact” in that we focus on syntax, but we",
        "trigrams that were typical for the speech of the group of older Finnish emigrants to Australia compared to the speech of those who emigrated before their 17th birthday.",
        "The tag trigrams indicating pauses were removed before comparing the corpora, as these appear to dominate the differences.",
        "The examples illustrating the trigrams were chosen at random, and we note that the examples of the third sort of trigram involved tagging errors in the first and second elements of the trigram, and that other errors are noticeable at the seventh and eight positions in the list (where ‘said’ and ‘glass’ are marked as pronouns).",
        "We reserve the linguistic interpretation of the error patterns for future work, but we note that we will also want to filter interjections before drawing definite conclusions.",
        "take a large step in this direction by showing how to aggregate and test for significance, using the sorts of counts he worked with.",
        "The software implementing the permutation test, including the normalizations, is available freely at http://en.logilogi.org/ HomE/WyboWiersma/FiAuImEnRe.",
        "It is developed to allow easy generalization to more than two sub-corpora and longer n-grams.",
        "Several further steps would be useful.",
        "We should like to repeat the analysis here, eliminating the effect of hesitation tags, etc.",
        "Second, we should like to experiment systematically with the inclusion of n-grams for n > 3; to-date we have experimented with this, but not systematically enough.",
        "Third, we would like to test the analysis on other cases of putative syntactic differences, and in particular in cases where tagging accuracy might be less an issue."
