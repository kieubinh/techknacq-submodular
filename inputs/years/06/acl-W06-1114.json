        "Decision taking processes are common and frequent tasks for most of us in our daily life.",
        "The ideal case would be that when the decisions can be taken deterministically, based on some clear, quantifiable and unambiguous parameters and classifiers.",
        "However, there are many cases when we decide based on subjective or sensor-ial criteria (e.g. perceptions), but which prove to function well.",
        "The domains in which decisions are taken based on perceptions vary a lot: the qualitative evaluation of services, management, financial predictions, sociology, information/intelligent systems, etc (Zadeh and Kacprzyk, 1999).",
        "When people are asked to approximate the height of some individual, they prefer to use terms like: very tall, rather tall, tall enough, short, etc.",
        "We can expect the same linguistic variable to have a different metrical correspondence according to the community to which the individual belongs (i.e. an individual of 170 cm can be considered short by the Australian soldiers and tall by the Eskimos).",
        "Similar situations also arise when people are asked to hierarchically order a list of objects.",
        "For example, we find it easy to make the top of the best five novels that we read, since number one is the novel that we like best and so on, rather than to say that we liked in the proportion of 40% the novel on the first position, 20 % the novel on the second place and so on.",
        "The same thing is happening when we try to talk about the style of a certain author: it is easier to say that the author x is closer to y than z, then to quantify the distance between their styles.",
        "In both cases we operate with a ”hidden variable” and a ”hidden metric”.",
        "Especially when working with perceptions, but not only, we face the situation to operate with strings of objects where the essential information is not given by the numerical value of some parameter of each object, but by the position the object occupies in the strings (according to a natural hierarchical order, in which on the first place we find the most important element, on the second place the next one and on the last position the least important element).",
        "As in the case of perceptions calculus, in most of the natural languages, the most important information is also carried by the first part of the unit (Marcus, 1974).",
        "Cf. M. Dinu (1997), it is advisable that the essential elements of a message to be situated in the first part of the utterance, thus having the best chances to be memorized1 (see Table 1).",

Dinu notices that at the other end, we find the wooden language from the communist period, text that was not meant to inform, but to confuse the receiver with an incantation empty of content, and that used the reversed process: to place the important information at the end of very long phrases that started with irrelevant information",

        "By analogy to computing with words, natural language and genomics, we can say that if the differences between two strings are at the top (i.e., in essential points), the distance has to have a bigger value then when the differences are at the bottom of the strings.",

        "To measure the distance between two strings, we use the following strategy: we scan (from left to right) both strings and for each letter from the first string we count the number of elements between its position in first string and the position of its first occurrence in the second string.",
        "We sum these scores for all elements and obtain the rank distance.",
        "Clearly, the rank distance gives a score zero only to letters which are in the same position in both strings, as Hamming distance does (we recall that Hamming distance is the number of positions where two strings of the same length differ).",
        "On the other hand, the reduced sensitivity of the rank distance w.r.t.",
        "deletions and insertions is of paramount importance, since it allows us to make use of ad hoc extensions to arbitrary strings, such as its low computational complexity is not affected.",
        "This is not the case for the extensions of the Hamming distance, mathematically optimal but computationally heavy, which lead to the edit-distance, or Levenshtein distance, and which are at the base of the standard alignment principle.",
        "So, rank distance sides with Hamming distance rather than Levenshtein distance as far as computational complexity is concerned: the fact that in the Hamming and in the rank case the median string problem is tractable (Dinu and Manea), while in the edit case it is is NP-hard (Higuera and Casacu-berta, 2000), is a very significant indicator.",
        "The rank distance is an ordinal distance tightly related to the so-called Spearman’s footrule (Di-aconis and Graham, 1977) 2, which has long been used in non-parametric statistics.",
        "Unlike other ordinal distances, the Spearman’s footrule is linear in n, and so very easy to compute.",
        "Its average value is at two-thirds of the way to the maximum value (both are quadratics in n); this is because, in a way, the Spearman footrule becomes rather ”undiscriminating” for highly different orderings.",
        "Rank distance has the same drawbacks and the same advantages of Spearman’s foootrule.",
        "As for ”classical” ordinal distances for integers, with averages values, maximal values, etc., the reader is",
        "referred to the basic work (Diaconis and Graham, 1977).",
        "Let us go back to strings.",
        "Let us choose a finite alphabet, say {N, V, A, O} (Noun, Verb, Adjective, Object) and two strings on that alphabet, which for the moment will be constrained to be a permutation of each other.",
        "E.g. take two strings of length 6: NNVAOO and VOANON; put indexes for the occurrences of repeated letters in increasing order to obtain N1 N2V1 A1O1O2 and V1O1A1N1O2N2.",
        "Now, proceed as follows: in the first sequence N1 is in position 1, while it is in position 4 in the second sequence, and so the difference is 3; compute the difference in positions for all letters and sum them.",
        "In this case the differences are 3, 4, 2, 1, 3, 1 and so the distance is 14.",
        "Even if the computation of the rank distance as based directly on its definition may appear to be quadratic, in (Dinu and Sgarro) two algorithms which take it back to linear complexity are exhibit.",
        "In computational linguistics the rank distance for strings without repetitions had been enough.",
        "In a way, indexing converts a sequence with repetitions into a sequence without repetitions, in which the k occurrence of a letter a are replaced by single occurrences of the k indexed letters a1, a2, ..., ak.",
        "Let u = x1x2 ... x� and v = y1y2 ... y,,t be two strings of lengths n and m, respectively.",
        "For an element xi E u we define its order or rank by ord(xi lu) = n+ 1-i: we stress that the rank of xi is its position in the string, counted from the right to the left, after indexing, so that for example the second O in the string VOANON has rank 2.",
        "Note that some (indexed) occurrences appear in both strings, while some other are unmatched, i.e. they appear only in one of the two strings.",
        "In definition (1) the last two summations refer to these unmatched occurrences.",
        "More precisely, the first summation on x E u n v refers to occurrences x which are common to both strings u and v, the second summation on x E u \\ v refers to occurrences x which appear in u but not in v, while the third summation on x E v\\ u refers to occurrences x which appear in v but not in u.",
        "Deletions and insertions are less worrying in the rank case rather than in the Hamming case: if one incorrectly moves a symbol by, say, one position, the Hamming distance loses any track of it, but rank distance does not, and the mistake is quite light.",
        "So, generalizations in the spirit of the edit distance are unavoidable in the Hamming case, even if they are computationally very demanding, while in the rank case we may think of ad hoc ways-out, which are computationally convenient."
