        "The discriminative model makes use of features which represent the compositionality of multi-word expressions.",

        "This class of verb based multi-word expressions include verbal idioms, support-verb constructions, among others.",

        "In the past, various measures have been suggested for measuring the compositionality of multi-word expressions.",
        "Some of these are mutual information (Church and Hanks, 1989), distributed frequency (Tapanainen et al., 1998) and Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) model (Baldwin et al., 2003).",
        "Even though, these measures have been shown to represent compositionality quite well, compositionality itself has not been shown to be useful in any application yet.",
