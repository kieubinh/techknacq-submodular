        "remark that ‘serious description of natural dialogue seems to necessitate that we consider the mental states of the speakers involved’ (1998).2 This is a step that is by no means easy.",
        "It is the aim of this paper to integrate previous work on beliefs in DRT and dialogue theory in order to model the mental states of agents in dialogue.",
        "The connection between beliefs, intentions and speech or dialogue acts has been noted in the literature.",
        "Stalnaker notes, for instance, that [i]f we understand contexts, and the speech acts made in contexts, in terms of the speaker’s beliefs and intentions, we have a better chance of giving simpler and more transparent explanations of linguistic behaviour (Stalnaker 2002: 720).",
        "The kind of agent beliefs we are concerned with here arises in dialogue interaction.",
        "The nature of",
        "interaction dictates that the strength or degree of belief varies depending on contextual factors.",
        "This can be seen from the following example:",
        "(1) A: I want to make a booking for my wife.",
        "B: Yeah.",
        "A: What time is the Thailand flight on Monday?",
        "B: It’s at 2 pm.",
        "In example (1) B does not necessarily need to believe the presupposition (given information) that A has a wife.",
        "For the purposes of the conversation, which is providing A with information, B can simply ‘go along with’ the presupposition and not have it as a member of his beliefs (i.e. his belief set) (Stalnaker 2002).",
        "Similarly, let us consider the following example, (2).",
        "The speaker is a customer in a clothing shop.",
        "(2) S 1: I want to buy a dress for my wife.",
        "H 1: Is it for a formal occasion?",
        "S2: Yes.",
        "H2: What is her favourite colour?",
        "S3: She doesn’t like red anymore.",
        "H3: Does your wife like black?",
        "S4: Yes",
        "As the speaker, S, introduces the presupposition that he has a wife, the hearer, H, can come to the conclusion that S believes S has a wife.",
        "However, when the hearer comes to refer to S’s wife, H does not necessarily have to believe S has a wife.",
        "H can simply go along with the information that the speaker has a wife and use this form of acceptance in H2 without committing to ‘strongly believing’ it.",
        "Indeed, the speaker may be buying a dress for his mistress rather than his wife.",
        "By going along",
        "Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics with it, the hearer does not have to commit himself to believing that the speaker has a wife.",
        "What is more at stake than believing that the speaker indeed has a wife and not a mistress is closing the sale.",
        "Contrast examples (1) and (2) with example (3):",
        "(3) S 1: You have to get Peter’s son a Christening present.",
        "H 1: Peter has a son?",
        "S2: Sorry I forgot to mention that before.",
        "H2: Ok, what sort of present should I get him?",
        "S3: A toy would be nice.",
        "In this context, the hearer, H, is required to commit more strongly to the presupposition of Peter having a son than simply going along with it, since H is being asked to buy a Christening present.",
        "The fact that H2 agrees to buying a present for Peter’s son reflects more commitment to the presupposition than B shows in example (1).",
        "Considerations of this kind lead to the conclusion that different contexts call for varying strengths of beliefs and belief representation.",
        "We shall not attempt to describe all the contextual factors that can cause strength of belief to vary.",
        "The point is, rather, that we clearly need to model strength of belief and no current model of DRT incorporates such a proposal.",
        "This paper, thus, makes an original proposal for including a system for graded beliefs in the belief spaces (or sets) of both the speaker and the hearer.",
        "Bearing this in mind, there is a need in DRT for representing the differing beliefs of agents in dialogue and their beliefs (meta-beliefs) about other agents’ beliefs or mental state.",
        "By focussing on the intentions of speakers and hearers and inferring agents’ intentions in making an utterance, the approach presented in this paper aims at fulfilling this need.",
        "It follows that, to have a ‘full’ theory of beliefs and to have an insight into the mental states of agents in dialogue (the speaker and the hearer), it is necessary to have a representation of agents’ beliefs, degrees of beliefs, and the dialogue acts expressed by their utterances (Asher 1986).",
        "This is also in order to strengthen the link between utterances and agents’ intentions in dialogue.",
        "The dialogue act or function performed by the utterance tells us something about the speaker’s beliefs.",
        "Furthermore, what is also needed is a representation of beliefs that are shared between, or are common to, the two agents.",
        "The question is: how can DRT best model beliefs?",

        "Section 3 presents a graded view of agents’ beliefs in dialogue as a solution to these problems.",

        "According to Heydrich et al.",
        "(1998), paradigms of dynamic semantics (DRT, Situation Semantics and Dynamic Predicate Logic) face three obstacles in modelling dialogue.",
        "First, there is the problem of adapting the paradigm, originally made to model monological discourse, to the description of dialogue with different agents.",
        "The second problem is the description of mental states and the beliefs of the agents.",
        "The third problem is in explaining how the mental states are related to overt linguistic behaviour.",
        "With respect to the first problem, DRT has gradually attempted to address problems of belief representation in dialogue.",
        "For example, in Prolegomena, Kamp introduces a simple model of verbal communication (Kamp 1990: 71), which consists of two agents, A and B, and their mental states K(A) and K(B).",
        "Later work by Kamp et al.",
        "(2005) introduces agent modelling for single-sentence discourse, namely the hearer.",
        "The treatment presented in this paper allows the representation of dialogue with different agents, thus, addressing the first problem identified by Heydrich et al.",
        "(1998).",
        "With regard to the second problem, however, DRT has been primarily concerned with representing utterances containing propositional attitudes such as ‘believe’, rather than the beliefs and meta-beliefs of agents.",
        "Segmented-DRT (SDRT) has mainly focused on belief update and revision (Asher and Lascarides 2003).",
        "The treatment in this paper takes previous work on beliefs in dynamic semantics as a starting point and extends it to reach a richer representation of the interaction between mental states and the linguistic content of utterances.",
        "For example, both speaker and hearer mental states are represented and the beliefs and",
        "meta-beliefs of agents are reviewed after each utterance.",
        "As a semantic theory, DRT tells us which discourse referents are needed in context.",
        "However, DRT does not deal with planning, nor with pragmatic aspects of contexts rendered through relating the current utterance to agents’ intentions.",
        "Kamp et al.’s (2005) expansion of the original, also known as ‘vanilla’, DRT (Poesio and Traum 1997a), deal minimally with intentions.",
        "To deal with the third problem mentioned by Heydrich et al., Al-Raheb (2005) has already outlined a pragmatic extension to DRT that makes it appropriate for linking the current utterance and agents’ intentions.",
        "The present paper aims to show how that link can be strengthened through modelling agents’ intentions and relating them to the dialogue acts communicated via utterances.",

        "Modal expressions, including words such as ‘possibly’ and ‘might’, are evidence that there exist more degrees of belief than the ones discussed in this paper.",
        "The beliefs of an agent are ‘her model of how things are’ (Traum 1994: 15).",
        "The notion of belief (or strong belief) is to be understood in relation to the agent: it is what the agent takes to be true.",
        "There is an important philosophical background to the discussion of ‘belief’ and ‘knowledge’.",

        "Quine (1960), Hintikka (1962), Lewis (1969, 1979), and Davidson (1983) are representative.",
        "The term ‘belief’ is understood in this paper to refer to propositions strongly held by the agent to be true and when making utterances relating to them, the speaker not only commits herself to their truth but also communicates to the hearer that she, the speaker, believes those proposition to be true.",
        "Another degree of belief called acceptance is accounted for in this model.",
        "Acceptance consists of the agent’s weakly believed propositions.",
        "The agent may be going along with what the speaker is saying or has acquired a new proposition based on the speaker’s utterance which has not yet been confirmed into a stronger belief.",

        "A dialogue is ‘a cooperative undertaking of agents engaged in developing and transforming their common situation’, involving verbal and non-verbal action (Heydrich et al.",
        "1998: 21).",

        "‘Inform’ is used to communicate new information to the hearer, whereas ‘change belief’ (or to use Poesio and Traum’s (1997b) dialogue act term ‘assert’) is used to change the hearer’s beliefs about some proposition.",
