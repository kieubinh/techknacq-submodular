        "The goal of our research is to develop methods by which intelligent systems can help lay audiences to understand biomedical and other kinds of scientific arguments.",
        "We have been studying how one type of lay-communication and biomedical-domain expert, the genetic counselor, presents written arguments in patient letters, standard documents summarizing information and services provided to the client (Baker et al., 2002).",
        "Clinical genetics involves causal probabilistic reasoning, e.g., diagnosis of a genetic basis for a health problem or prediction of inheritance risks.",
        "The patient letter is designed to document the experts’ reasoning for medical and legal purposes, as well as to provide an explanation that a lay client can understand.",
        "This paper presents, for the first time, the design of a discourse generator that plans the content and organization of genetic counseling patient letters containing arguments; and an experiment that we performed to evaluate the arguments.",
        "The discourse generation process involves three modules: a qualitative causal probabilistic domain model, a normative argument generator, and a genre-specific discourse grammar.",
        "In (Green, 2005), we reported a corpus study that produced a reliable biomedical coding scheme.",
        "In subsequent workshop papers (Green et al., 2004; 2005), we introduced our use of qualitative probabilistic constraints and provided a brief description of the biomedical domain model.",
        "We have also provided informal descriptions of argument patterns in the corpus (Green, to appear; 2006).",
        "However, we have not previously published the design of the discourse generator, including the discourse grammar and argument generator, and their relationship to the domain model.",
        "The theoretical significance of this work is threefold.",
        "First, it is empirically based, i.e., based on analysis of arguments in a corpus of genetic counseling patient letters, since the goal is to produce the same kinds of normative arguments as are used in expert-lay communication.",
        "Second, the normative argument generator creates an intentional-level representation of the arguments in the text, which provides a foundation for an intelligent system’s ability to engage in follow-up discussion about the arguments that have been presented.",
        "Finally, due to the separation of domain, argument, and genre-specific concerns in the design, and due to the methodology used to acquire a domain model, it should be possible to apply this approach to lay-oriented argument generation in other domains.",
        "The practical significance of this work is that it is major step in the design of a deployable system to generate the first draft of genetic counseling patient letters.",
        "As genetics plays an increasingly important role in medicine, there is a need for tools to aid in dissemination of patient-tailored information.",
        "In the next section, we give an overview of a prototype generation system, whose main components are described in more detail in sections 3-5; an example of the generation process is given in section 6; an experiment to evaluate the generated arguments is presented in section 7; and related work is summarized in section 8."

      "text": [
        "We are developing a prototype system for genetic counselors that will synthesize the first draft of a patient letter.",
        "The deployed system will consist of a graphical user interface for the genetic counselor, a domain model/reasoner, an argument generator, a discourse grammar, and a linguistic realizer.",
        "Prototypes of all components except the linguistic realizer have been implemented.",
        "Although this paper focuses on discourse generation and its relationship to the domain model, as background we now describe the flow of information through the system.",
        "The domain model (section 3) is initialized with generic information on clinical genetics.",
        "Through a user interface providing menus and other non-free-text input devices, the counselor will provide standard clinical information such as a patient’s symptoms and information about his family tree; test results; preliminary diagnosis (before testing); and final diagnosis (after test results are known).",
        "The system uses this information to transform its generic domain model into a specialized domain model of the patient and his family.",
        "In this genre, a patient letter must provide not only the above information, but arguments for the diagnosis and other inferences made by the medical experts.",
        "The discourse generation process works as follows.",
        "A discourse grammar (section 4) encodes the high-level topic structure of letters in this genre.",
        "The discourse grammar rules generate a derivation instantiated from the domain model with information specific to a patient’s case.",
        "For each of the writer’s claims about the case for which a normative argument must be provided according to standard practice, the discourse grammar invokes the argument generator.",
        "The argument generator (section 5) uses non-domain-specific argument strategies that are instantiated with information from the domain model.",
        "The argument generator returns a structured representation of an argument in which the communicative function of information, e.g., as data or warrant, is identified.",
        "As illustrated in section 6, in future interactive systems knowledge of communicative function could be used to support follow-up discussion.",
        "In the current prototype, this knowledge is used to determine presentation order, e.g., that data supporting a claim is to be presented before that claim.",
        "One of the goals of the experiment described in section 7 was to evaluate this ordering.",
        "In the final system, the output of discourse generation will be transformed by a linguistic realizer into the first draft of a letter."

        "In a previous study of the corpus (Green, 2005), we identified a small set of categories (e.g. genotype, test result, symptom) with good inter-rater reliability that can be used to describe the biomedical content of a genetic counseling letter as a causal probabilistic network (Korb and Nicholson, 2004).",
        "A prototype domain model has been manually constructed covering representative genetic disorders using only these categories of variables.",
        "By restricting a domain model to these categories, the result should reflect the simplified conceptual model of genetics used by genetic counselors in communication with their lay clients; this facilitates generation since the generator will not have to distinguish what information in the domain model is appropriate to communicate to a lay audience.",
        "Another benefit of restricting a domain model in this way is that it reduces the knowledge acquisition effort of choosing variables and determining network topology; any genetic disorder in the scope of the coding scheme (over 4500 single-gene autosomal disorders) would be modeled in terms of a small number of variable types and a standard topology.",
        "Thus, it should be straightforward to semi-automatically construct a domain model covering many different genetic disorders.",
        "Figure 1 shows part of a domain model after it has been updated with information about a particular patient’s case.",
        "The nodes labeled GJB2 (mother), GJB2 (father), GJB2 (child) are genotype variables, representing the mother’s, father’s, and child’s GBJ2 genotype, respectively.",
        "(A genotype is a pair of alleles of a gene; one allele is inherited from each parent.",
        "An individual who has two mutated alleles of the GJB2 gene usually experiences hearing loss.)",
        "The nodes labeled hearing loss (child) and non-syndromic (child) are vari",
        "ables representing the child’s symptoms.",
        "The node labeled test result (child) is a variable representing the results of testing the child’s GJB2 genotype.",
        "The most likely states of the variables are shown beside the nodes in Figure 1; T1 and T2 represent the time at which the (experts’) belief is held, before or after the child’s genetic test results are known, respectively.",
        "The information recorded in the network about this particular case is that the child was observed to have hearing loss and no features of a genetic syndrome; the preliminary diagnosis, i.e. before testing, was that the cause of hearing loss is having two mutated alleles of GJB2; the test results were negative, however; thus, the current diagnosis is some other (unspecified) autosomal recessively inherited genetic condition, represented by the genotype variable labeled other genotype (child).",
        "In addition, the parents are hypothesized to be carriers (i.e. to each have one mutated allele) of that genotype, represented by the variables labeled other genotype (mother), other genotype (father).",
        "Although a causal probabilistic network used to perform diagnosis or risk calculation would require specification of numeric probabilities, the role of the network in our system is to qualitatively model the reasoning that the medical experts have performed outside of the system.",
        "Also, we found that in the corpus numeric probabilities were provided only when citing epidemiological statistics or risks calculated according to Mendelian inheritance theory (which does not require Bayesian probability computation).",
        "Thus, instead of using numeric probabilities for domain reasoning, the domain model uses qualitative constraints based upon formal relations of qualitative influence, product synergy, and additive synergy (Druzdzel and Henrion, 1993).",
        "In addition to being adequate for natural language generation, this approach greatly reduces knowledge acquisition effort; it should be straightforward to semi-automatically acquire the qualitative constraints of a full-scale domain model due to regularities in this domain and the use of a restricted set of variable types as described above.",
        "For example, qualitative constraints between genotypes of parents and child would be determined by whether a genotype follows an autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance pattern.",
        "We now describe some of the qualitative domain constraints.",
        "An influence relation holds between a node in a causal graph and its direct descendant.",
        "A has a positive qualitative influence on B, written S+(state(A,VA), state(B,VB)), if the state of A reaching a threshold value VA makes it more likely that the state of B reaches value VB.",
        "For example, if having two mutated alleles of a genotype A normally results in the appearance of a symptom B, this could be described as S+(state(A,2), state(B,yes)).",
        "Each arc in Figure 1 implicitly represents an S+ relation.",
        "Product and additive synergy describe converging connections, i.e., the relation between a set of variables {A, B} and their direct descendant C in a graph.",
        "A and B have negative product synergy with respect to state VC of C, written X-({state(A,VA), state(B,VB)}, state(C,VC)), if either the state of A reaching a threshold VA or the state of B reaching a threshold VB makes it more likely that the state of C reaches VC.",
        "This type of relationship characterizes mutually exclusive alternative diagnoses that could account for the same symptom; it also characterizes autosomal dominant inheritance, an inheritance pattern where inheriting one mutated allele of a genotype (from either parent) is usually sufficient to cause health problems.",
        "In Figure 1, the possible alternative causes of the symptoms are indicated by the X annotations.",
        "On the other hand, autosomal recessive inheritance, an inheritance pattern where inheriting two mutated alleles (one from each parent) is usually necessary to cause health problems, is characterized by zero product synergy (X°); A and B have zero product synergy with respect to state VC of C, X°({state(A,VA), state(B,VB)}, state(C,VC)), if the state of A reaching a threshold VA and the state of B reaching a threshold VB makes it more likely that the state of C reaches VC.",
        "For example, if the mother’s, father’s, and child’s genotype are represented by variables A, B, and C, respectively, then X°({state(A,1), state(B,1)}, state(C,2)) can represent the constraint that if the child’s genotype C has two mutated alleles, then one mutated allele must have come from each parent.",
        "In Figure 1, the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern of GJB2 and the other hypothesized genetic disorder are indicated by the X° annotations.",
        "Other qualitative constraints used in the domain model are based on negative qualitative influence (S-), positive product synergy (X+), and negative additive synergy (Y-).",
        "In addition, the domain model stores epidemiological statistics as probabil",
        "ity statements composed of variables used in the network, e.g., the frequency of hearing loss due to GJB2.",
        "This type of information can be used as backing in an argument (see section 5) but does not play a role in domain reasoning."
