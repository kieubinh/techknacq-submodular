        "The extant literature on the syntax of it-clefts, as in (1), can be classified into two main approaches.",
        "First, the cleft pronoun it is an expletive, and the cleft clause bears a direct syntactic or semantic relation to the clefted constituent, such as one of predication (Jesperson, 1937; Chomsky, 1977; Williams, 1980; Delin, 1989; Delahunty, 1982; Rochemont, 1986; Heggie, 1988; ´E.",
        "Kiss, 1998).",
        "Second, the cleft clause bears a direct syntactic or semantic relation to the cleft pronoun and is spelled-out after the clefted constituent through extraposition or by forming a discontinuous constituent with the cleft pronoun from the base-generated position at the end of the sentence (Jesperson, 1927; Akmajian, 1970; Emonds, 1976; Gundel, 1977; Wirth, 1978; Percus, 1997; Hedberg, 2000).",
        "Under this second approach, the cleft pronoun is not necessarily expletive but rather has a semantic function such as that of a definite article.",
        "In this paper, we argue for a particular version of the second approach, in which the cleft pronoun and the cleft clause form a discontinuous syntactic constituent, and a semantic unit as a definite description.",
        "We propose a syntax of it-clefts using Tree-Local Multi-Component Tree Adjoining Grammar (MCTAG), and a compositional semantics on the proposed syntax using Synchronous Tree Adjoining Grammar (STAG).",
        "In section 2, we present arguments against the expletive approach, and in section 3, we provide arguments supporting the discontinuous constituent analysis.",

        "20) Although the details are different, many expletive analyses advocate for the position that the clefted constituent is syntactically associated with the gap in the cleft clause either directly through movement, or indirectly through co-indexation with an operator in the cleft clause.",
        "One thing that is common in all these analyses is that the cleft clause is not considered to have the internal structure of a restrictive relative clause.",
        "We point out",
        "that the initial element in the cleft clause may be realized either as a wh-word (1) or as that (3a), or it may be absent altogether when the gap is not in the subject position (2, 3b).",

        "The cleft clause, however, does not relate to the clefted constituent in the way that a restrictive relative clause relates to its head noun, as first noted in Jespersen (1927).",
        "This is because the clefted constituent can be a proper noun, unlike a head noun modified by a restrictive relative clause, as illustrated in (4).",
