        "In a Tree Adjoining Grammar, a feature structure is associated with each node in an elementary tree (Vijay-Shanker and Joshi, 1991).",
        "This feature structure contains information about how the node interacts with other nodes in the tree.",
        "It consists of a top part, which generally contains information relating to the super-node, and a bottom part, which generally contains information relating to the sub-node.",
        "In this paper, we present a system which can extract syntactic feature structures from a Treebank to develop a Feature-based Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammars.",
        "Several works have been on extracting grammars, especially using TAG formalism proposed.",
        "Chen (2001) has extracted lexicalized grammars from English Penn Treebank and there are other works based on Chen’s procedure such as Nasr (2004) for French and Habash and Rambow (2004) for Arabic.",
        "Xia et al.",
        "(2000) developed the uniform method of a grammar extraction for English, Chinese and Korean.",
        "Neumann (2003) extracted Lexicalized Tree Grammars from English Penn Treebank for English and from NEGRA Treebank for German.",
        "However, none of these works have tried to extract syntactic features for FB-LTAG.",
        "We use with Sejong Treebank (SJTree) which contains 32 054 eojeols (the unity of segmentation in the Korean sentence), that is, 2 526 sentences.",
        "SJTree uses 43 part-of-speech tags and 55 syntactic tags (Sejong Project 2003)."

        "FB-LTAG grammars eventually use reduced tagset because FB-LTAG grammars contain their syntactic information in features structures.",
        "For example, NP_SBJ syntactic tag in LTAG is changed into NP and a syntactic feature <case=nominative> is added.",
        "Therefore, we use actually a 13 reduced tagset for FB-LTAG grammars compared with a 55 syntactic tagset for an LTAG without features.",
        "From full-scale syntactic tags which end with _SBJ (subject), _OBJ (object) and _CMP (attribute), we extract <case> features which describe argument structures in the sentence.",
        "Alongside <case> features, we also extract <mode> and <tense> from morphological analyses in SJTree.",
        "Since however morphological analyses for verbal and adjectival endings in SJTree are simply divided into EP, EF and EC which mean non-final endings, final endings and conjunctive endings, respectively, <mode> and <tense> features are not extracted directly from SJTree.",
        "In this paper, we analyze 7 non-final endings (EP) and 77 final endings (EF) used in SJTree to extract automatically <mode> and <tense> features.",
        "In general, EF carries <mode> inflections, and EP carries <tense> inflections.",
        "Conjunctive endings (EC) are not concerned with <mode> and <tense> features and we only extract <ec> features with its string value.",
        "<ef> and <ep> features are also extracted with their string values.",
        "Some of non-final endings like si are extracted as <hor> features which have honorary meaning.",
        "In extracted FB-LTAG grammars, we present their lexical heads in a bare infinitive with morphological features such as <ep>, <ef> and <ec> which make correspond with its inflected forms.",
        "Proceedings of the 8th International Workshop on Tree Adjoining Grammar and Related Formalisms, pages 133–136, Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics <det> is another automatically extractable feature in SJTree and it is extracted from both syntactic tag and morphological analysis unlike other extracted features.",
        "For example, while <det=-> is extracted from dependant nouns which always need modifiers (extracted by morphological analyses), <det=+> is extracted from _MOD phrases (extracted by syntactic tags).",
        "From syntactic tag DP which contains MMs (determinative or demonstrative), <det=+> is also extracted.",
        "See Table 1 for all the extractable features from SJTree.",
        "Feature Description Values <case> a case feature nom(inative), assigned by acc(usative), predicate attr(ibut) <det> determiner, +/- modifier <mode> mode ind(icative), imp(erative), int(errogative), exc(lamatory) <temps> tense pre(sent), past, fut(ure) <ep>, <ef>, a feature string values <ec> marked for like eoss, da, different ways go, etc.",

        "While postpositions are separated from eojeol during our grammar extraction procedure, Han et al.",
        "considered them as “one” inflectional morphology of noun phrase eojeol.",
        "<aux-pp> adds semantic meaning of auxiliary postpositions such as only, also etc.",
        "which we can not extract automatically from SJTree or other Korean Treebank corpora because syntactically annotated Treebank corpora generally do not contain such semantic information.",
        "<top> marks the presence or absence of a topic marker in Korean like neun, however topic markers are annotated like a subject in SJTree which means that only <case=nominative> is extracted for topic markers.",
        "<clause-type> indicates the type of the clause which has its values such as main, coord(inative), subordi(native), adnom(inal), nominal, aux-connect.",
        "Since the distinction of the type of the clause is very vague except main clause in Korea, we do not adopt this feature.",

        "In the second phase, we complete feature structure onto nodes of the “spine (path between root and anchor, node in an initial tree and path between root and foot node in an auxiliary tree)”.",

        "However, the number of tree schemata appearing at least twice and three times (threshold = 2 and 3) in Treebank is much stabilized at the end of the extraction process than that of tree schemata appearing only once (threshold = 1).",
        "The coverage of extracted grammars is calculated not only by the frequency of tree schemata but also by the number of tree schemata.",
