        "Frank (2002), elaborating on earlier work (Kroch, 1987) shows that incorporating TAG-Adjoining into a theory of Universal Grammar of the Minimalist kind (Chomsky, 1995; Chomsky, 2000) yields a number of important empirical advantages.",
        "In particular, Adjoining provides a simple and elegant solution for the long-standing and difficult problem in modern syntactic theory concerning a proper formulation of the recursive, or ’successive-cyclic’, character of unbounded long movement in examples such as (1) where the wh-phrase stops by each intermediate CP (’Comp’).",

        "According to Frank (2002), there is no long movement per se in (1); rather, only a local wh-movement takes place within the embedded clause (2-a), and the matrix part (2-b) is later ‘interpolated’ by Adjoining at the C’ node.",

        "Long-distance dependencies (LDD) thus reduce to local dependencies within an elementary tree (in the sense of TAG) coupled with the recursive mechanism of ’interpolating’ additional structural chunk(s) by Adjoining.",
        "It follows that if the recursive engine in the form of Adjoining were rendered inoperative in some language, LDDs that are built with Adjoining will not be possible in that language.",
