        "Semantic processing of text in applications such as question answering or information extraction frequently relies on statistical parsers.",
        "Unfortunately, the efficacy of state-of-the-art parsers can be disappointingly low.",
        "For example, we found that the Collins parser correctly parsed just 42% of the list and factoid questions from TREC 2004 (that is, 42% of the parses had 100% precision and 100% recall on labeled constituents).",
        "Similarly, this parser produced 45% correct parses on a subset of 100 sentences from section 23 of the Penn Treebank.",
        "Although statistical parsers continue to improve their efficacy over time, progress is slow, particularly for Web applications where training the parsers on a “representative” corpus of hand-tagged sentences is not an option.",
        "Because of the heterogeneous nature of text on the Web, such a corpus would be exceedingly difficult to generate.",
        "In response, this paper investigates the possibility of detecting parser errors by using semantic information obtained from the Web.",
        "Our fundamental hypothesis is that incorrect parses often result in wildly implausible semantic interpretations of sentences, which can be detected automatically in certain circumstances.",
        "Consider, for example, the following sentence from the Wall Street Journal: “That compares with per-share earnings from continuing operations of 69 cents.” The Collins parser yields a parse that attaches “of 69 cents” to “operations,” rather than “earnings.” By computing the mutual information between “operations” and “cents” on the Web, we can detect that this attachment is unlikely to be correct.",
        "Our WOODWARD system detects parser errors as follows.",
        "First, it maps the tree produced by a parser to a relational conjunction (RC), a logic-based representation language that we describe in Section 2.1.",
        "Second, WOODWARD employs four distinct methods for analyzing whether a conjunct in the RC is likely to be “reasonable” as described in Section 2.",
        "Our approach makes several assumptions.",
        "First, if the sentence is absurd to begin with, then a correct parse could be deemed incorrect.",
        "Second, we require a corpus whose content overlaps at least in part with the content of the sentences to be parsed.",
        "Otherwise, much of our semantic analysis is impossible.",
        "In applications such as Web-based question answering, these assumptions are quite natural.",
        "The",
        "Sydney, July 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics questions are about topics that are covered extensively on the Web, and we can assume that most questions link verbs to nouns in reasonable combinations.",
        "Likewise, when using parsing for information extraction, we would expect our assumptions to hold as well.",
        "Our contributions are as follows:",
        "1.",
        "We introduce Web-based semanticfiltering – a novel, domain-independent method for detecting and discarding incorrect parses.",
        "2.",

        "However, on our training data PBF narrowly beat TextRunner on preposition errors, and the reverse was true on our test data.",
        "Our QA filter predicts whether a full parse is correct with an accuracy of 0.76 on the 17 TREC 2004 questions that had no prepositions.",
        "The Collins parser achieves the same level of accuracy on these sentences, so the main benefit of the QA filter for WOODWARD is that it never misclassi-fies an incorrect parse as a correct one, as was observed on the training set.",
        "This property allows WOODWARD to correctly predict a parse is correct whenever it passes the QA filter.",
        "Classification accuracy is important for good performance, and we report it to show how effective each of WOODWARD’s components is.",
        "However, it fails to capture the whole story of a filter’s performance.",
        "Consider a filter that simply predicts that every sentence is incorrectly parsed: it would have an overall accuracy of 55% on our WSJ corpus, not too much worse than WOODWARD’s classification accuracy of 66% on this data.",
        "However, such a filter would be useless because it filters out every correctly parsed sentence.",
        "Let the filtered set be the set of sentences that a filter predicts to be correctly parsed.",
        "The performance of a filter is better captured by two quantities related to the filtered set: first, how “pure” the filtered set is, or how many good parses it contains compared to bad parses; and second, how wasteful the filter is in terms of losing good parses from the original set.",
        "We measure these two quantities using metrics we call filter precision and filter recall.",
        "Filter precision is defined as the ratio of correctly parsed sentences in the filtered set to total sentences in the filtered set.",
        "Filter recall is defined as the ratio of correctly parsed sentences in the filtered set to correctly parsed sentences in the unfiltered set.",
        "Note that these metrics are quite different from the labeled constituent precision/recall metrics that are typically used to measure statistical parser performance.",
        "Table 2 shows our overall results for filtering parses using WOODWARD.",
        "We compare against a baseline model that predicts every sentence is parsed correctly.",
        "WOODWARD outperforms this baseline in precision and F 1 measure on both of our data sets.",
        "Collins (2000) reports a decrease in error rate of 13% over his original parsing model (the same model as used in our experiments) by performing a discriminative reranking of parses.",
        "Our WSJ test set is a subset of the set of sentences used in Collins’ experiments, so our results are not directly comparable, but we do achieve a roughly similar decrease in error rate (20%) when we use our filtered precision/recall metrics.",
        "We also measured the labeled constituent precision and recall of both the original test set and the filtered set, and found a decrease in error rate of 37% according to this metric (corresponding to a jump in F1 from 90.1 to 93.8).",
        "Note that in our case, the error is re",
        "duced by throwing out bad parses, rather than trying to fix them.",
        "The 17% difference between the two decreases in error rate is probably due to the fact that WOODWARD is more likely to detect the worse parses in the original set, which contribute a proportionally larger share of error in labeled constituent precision/recall in the original test set.",
        "WOODWARD performs significantly better on the TREC questions than on the Penn Treebank data.",
        "One major reason is that there are far more clause adjuncts in the Treebank data, and adjunct errors are intrinsically harder to detect.",
        "Consider the Treebank sentence: “The S&P pit stayed locked at its 30-point trading limit as the Dow average ground to its final 190.58 point loss Friday.” The parser incorrectly attaches the clause beginning “as the Dow ... ” to “locked”, rather than to “stayed.” Our current methods aim to use key words in the clause to determine if the attachment is correct.",
        "However, with such clauses there is no single key word that can allow us to make that determination.",
        "We anticipate that as the paradigm matures we and others will design filters that can use more of the information in the clause to help make these decisions."

        "Given a parse of a sentence, WOODWARD constructs a representation that identifies the key semantic relationships implicit in the parse.",
        "It then uses a set of Web-based sampling techniques to check whether these relationships are plausible.",
        "If any of the relationships is highly implausible, WOODWARD concludes that the parse is incorrect.",
        "WOODWARD successfully detects common errors in the output of the Collins parser including verb arity errors as well as preposition and verb attachment errors.",
        "While more extensive experiments are clearly necessary, our results suggest that the paradigm of Web-based semantic filtering could substantially improve the performance of statistical parsers.",
        "In future work, we hope to further validate this paradigm by constructing additional semantic filters that detect other types of errors.",
        "We also plan to use semantic filters such as WOODWARD to build a large-scale corpus of automatically-parsed sentences that has higher accuracy than can be achieved today.",
        "Such a corpus could be used to retrain a statistical parser to improve its performance.",
        "Beyond that, we plan to embed semantic filtering into the parser itself.",
        "If semantic filters become sufficiently accurate, they could rule out enough erroneous parses that the parser is left with just the correct one."
