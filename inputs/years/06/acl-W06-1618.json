        "Research in question answering, machine translation and other fields has shown that being able to recognize the important entities in a text is often a critical component of these systems.",
        "Such entity information gives the machine access to a deeper level of semantics than words alone can provide, and thus offers advantages for these complex tasks.",
        "Of course, texts are composed of much more than just sets of entities, and architectures that rely solely on word and entity-based techniques are likely to have difficulty with tasks that depend more heavily on event and temporal relations.",
        "Consider a question answering system that receives the following questions:",
        "• Is Anwar al-Sadat still the president of Egypt?",
        "• How did the linking of the Argentinean",
        "peso to the US dollar in 1991 contribute to economic crisis of Argentina in 2003?",
        "Processing such questions requires not only knowing what the important people, places and other entities are, but also what kind of events they are involved in, the roles they play in those events, and the relations among those events.",
        "Thus, we suggest that identifying such events in a text should play an important role in systems that attempt to address questions like these.",
        "Of course, to identify events in texts, we must define what exactly it is we mean by “event”.",
        "In this work, we adopt a traditional linguistic definition of an event that divides words into two as-pectual types: states and events.",
        "States describe situations that are static or unchanging for their duration, while events describe situations that involve some internal structure.",
        "For example, predicates like know and love would be states because if we know (or love) someone for a period of time, we know (or love) that person at each point during the period.",
        "Predicates like run or deliver a sermon would be events because they are built of smaller dissimilar components: run includes raising and lowering of legs and deliver a sermon includes the various tongue movements required to produce words.",
        "To better explain how we approach the task of identifying such events, we first discuss some past work on related tasks.",
        "Then we briefly discuss the characteristics of the TimeBank, a corpus containing event-annotated data.",
        "Next we present our formulation of event identification as a classification task and introduce the linguistic features that serve as input to the algorithm.",
        "Finally, we show the results of STEP (our “System for Textual Event Parsing”) which applies these techniques to the TimeBank data."

        "Table 4 and Table 5 show the results of our systems on various sub-tasks, with the “%” column indicating what percent of the events in the test data each subtask contained.",
        "Table 4 shows that in both tasks, we do dramatically better on verbs than on nouns, especially as far as recall is concerned.",
        "This is relatively unsurprising – not only is there more data for verbs (59% of event words are verbs, while only 28% are nouns), but our models generally do better on words they have seen before, and there are many more nouns we have not seen than there are verbs.",
        "Table 5 shows how well we did individually on each type of label.",
        "For simple event identification (the top two rows) we can see that we do substantially better on B labels than on I labels, as we would expect since 92% of event words are labeled B.",
        "The label-wise performance for the event and class identification (the bottom seven rows) is more interesting.",
        "Our best performance is actually on Reporting event words, even though the data is mainly Occurrence event words.",
        "One reason for this is that instances of the word said make up about 60% of Reporting event words in the TimeBank.",
        "The word said is relatively easy to get right because it comes with by far the most training data10, and because it is almost always an event: 98% of the time in the TimeBank, and 100% of the time in our test data.",
        "To determine how much each of the feature sets contributed to our models we also performed a pair of ablation studies.",
        "In each ablation study, we trained a series of models on successively fewer feature sets, removing the least important feature set each time.",
        "The least important feature set was determined by finding out which feature set’s removal caused the smallest drop in F-measure.",
        "The result of this process was a list of our feature sets, ordered by importance.",
        "These lists are given for both tasks in Table 6, along with the precision, recall and F-measures of the various corresponding models.",
        "Each row in Table 6 corresponds to a model trained on the feature sets named in that row and all the rows below it.",
        "Thus, on the top row, no feature sets have been removed, and on the bottom row only one feature set remains.",
        "10 The word “said” has over 600 instances in TimeBank.",
        "The word with the next most instances has just over 200",
        "So, for example, in the simple event identification task, we see that the Governing, Negation, Affix and WordNet features are hurting the classifier somewhat – a model trained without these features performs at an F-measure of 0.772, more than 1% better than a model including these features.",
        "In contrast, we can see that for the event and semantic class identification task, the WordNet and Affix features are actually among the most important, with only the Word class features accompanying them in the top three.",
        "These ablation results suggest that word class, textual, morphological and temporal information is most useful for simple event identification, and affix, WordNet and negation information is only really needed when the semantic class of an event must also be identified.",
        "The last thing we investigated was the effect of additional training data.",
        "To do so, we trained the model on increasing fractions of the training data, and measured the classification accuracy on the testing data of each of the models thus trained.",
        "The resulting graph is shown in Figure 1.",
        "The Majority line indicates the classifier accuracy when the classifier always guesses majority class, that is, (O)utside of an event.",
        "We can see from the two learning curves that even with only the small amount of data available in the TimeBank, our models are already reaching the level part of the learning curve at somewhere around 20% of the data.",
        "This suggests that, though additional data may help somewhat in the data sparseness problem, substantial further progress on this task will require new, more descriptive features."

        "In this paper, we showed that statistical machine learning techniques can be successfully applied to the problem of identifying fine-grained events in a text.",
        "We formulated this task as a statistical classification task using a word-chunking paradigm, where words are labeled as beginning, inside or outside of an event.",
        "We introduced a variety of relevant linguistically-motivated features, and showed that models trained in this way could perform quite well on the task, with a precision of 82% and a recall of 71%.",
        "This method extended to the task of identifying the semantic class of an event with a precision of 67% and a recall of 51%.",
        "Our analysis of these models indicates that while the simple event identification task can be approached with mostly simple text and word-class based features, identifying the semantic class of an event requires features that encode more of the semantic context of the words.",
        "Finally, our training curves suggest that future research in this area should focus primarily on identifying more discriminative features."
