        "Synonymy relations between words have been used to inform many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.",
        "While these relations can be extracted from manually created resources such as thesauri (e.g. Roget’s Thesaurus) and lexical databases (e.g. WordNet, Fellbaum, 1998), it is often beneficial to extract these relationships from a corpus representative of the task.",
        "Manually created resources are expensive and time-consuming to create, and tend to suffer from problems of bias, inconsistency, and limited coverage.",
        "These problems may result in an inappropriate vocabulary, where some terms are not present or an unbalanced set of synonyms.",
        "In a medical context it is more likely that administration will refer to the giving of medicine than to paper work, whereas in a business context the converse is more likely.",
        "The most common method for automatically creating these resources uses distributional similarity and is based on the distributional hypothesis that similar words appear in similar contexts.",
        "Terms are described by collating information about their occurrence in a corpus into vectors.",
        "These context vectors are then compared for similarity.",
        "Existing approaches differ primarily in their definition of context, e.g. the surrounding words or the entire document, and their choice of distance metric for calculating similarity between the context vectors representing each term.",
        "In this paper, we analyse the use of Random Indexing (Kanerva et al., 2000) for semantic similarity measurement.",
        "Random Indexing is an approximation technique proposed as an alternative to Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA, Landauer and Du-mais, 1997).",
        "Random Indexing is more scalable and allows for the incremental learning of context information.",
        "Curran and Moens (2002) found that dramatically increasing the volume of raw input data for distributional similarity tasks increases the accuracy of synonyms extracted.",
        "Random Indexing performs poorly on these volumes of data.",
        "Noting that in many NLP tasks, including distributional similarity, statistical weighting is used to improve performance, we modify the Random Indexing algorithm to allow for weighted contexts.",
        "We test the performance of the original and our modified system using existing evaluation metrics.",
        "We further evaluate against bilingual lexicon extraction using distributional similarity (Sahlgren and Karlgren, 2005).",
        "The paper concludes with a more detailed analysis of Random Indexing in terms of both task and corpus composition.",
        "We find that Random Index is robust for small corpora, but larger corpora require that the contexts be weighted to maintain accuracy."

        "Sahlgren (2005) criticise LSA for being both computationally inefficient and requiring the formation of a full co-occurrence matrix and its decomposition before any similarity measurements can be made.",

        "If the context c1 encountered again, no new index vector would be generated and the existing index vector for c1 would be added to the existing context vector to produce a new context vector for t of [2, 1, 0, – 3].",
        "The distance between these context vectors can then be measured using any vector space distance measure.",
        "Sahlgren and Karlgren (2005) use the cosine measure:",

        "This is not feasible with most other word-space models.",
        "The approach used by Grefenstette (1994) and Curran (2004) requires the re-computation of all non-linear weights if new data is added, although some of these weights can be approximated when adding new data incrementally.",

        "We have applied weighting functions to the vector space approximation Random Indexing.",
        "For large data sets we found a significant improvement",
        "when weights were applied.",
        "For smaller data sets we found that Random Indexing was sufficiently robust that weighting had at most a minor effect.",
        "Our weighting schemes removed the possibility of incremental learning of the term space.",
        "An interesting direction would be the development of algorithms that allowed the incremental application of weights, perhaps by re-weighting vectors when a new context is learned.",
        "Other areas left open for investigation are the interaction between Random Indexing, weights and the type of context extracted, the use of large-scale bilingual corpora, the acquisition of lexicons for non-Indo-European languages and across language family boundaries, and the difference in effect term and paragraph/document contexts for thesaurus extraction.",
        "We have demonstrated that the accuracy of Random Indexing can be improved by applying weight functions, increasing accuracy by up to 50% on the BNC and 100% on a 2 billion word corpus."
