        "Over the last years, growing needs in the fields of Corpus Linguistics and NLP have led to an increasing demand for text corpora.",
        "The automation of corpus development has therefore became an important and active field of research.",
        "Until recently, constructing corpora required large teams and important means (as text was rarely available on electronic support and computer had limited capacities).",
        "Today, the situation is quite different as any published text is recorded, at some point of its “life” on digital media.",
        "Also, increasing number of electronic publication (textual databank, CD–ROM, etc.)",
        "and the expansion of the Internet have made text more accessible than ever in our history.",
        "The Internet is obviously a great source of data for corpus development.",
        "It is either considered as a corpus by itself (see the WebCorp Project of Renouf, 2003) or as a huge databank in which to look for specific texts to be selected and",
        "gathered for further treatment.",
        "Examples of projects adopting the latter approach are numerous (among many Sekigushi and Yammoto, 2004; Emirkanian et al.",
        "2004).",
        "It is also the goal of the WaCky Project for instance which aims at developing tools “that will allow linguists to crawl a section of the web, process the data, index them and search them”2.",
        "So we have the Internet: it is immense, free, easily accessible and can be used for all manner of language research (Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003).",
        "But text is so abundant, that it is not so easy to find appropriate textual data for a given task.",
        "For this reason, researchers have been developing softwares that are able to crawl the Web and find sources corresponding to specific criteria.",
        "Using clustering algorithms or similarity measures, it is possible to select texts that are similar to a training set.",
        "These techniques can achieve good results, but they are sometimes limited when it comes to distinguishing between well-written texts vs. poorly written, or other subtle criteria.",
        "In any case, it will require filtering and cleaning of the data (Berland and Grabar, 2002).",
        "One possibility to address the difficulty to find good sources is to avoid “wide crawling” but instead to bind the crawler to manually identified Web domains which are updated on a regular basis and which offer textual data of good quality (this can be seen as “vertical crawling” as opposed to “horizontal” or “wide crawling”).",
        "This is the choice made in the GlossaNet system (Fairon, 1998; 2003).",
        "This Web service gives to the users access to a linguistics based search engine for querying online newspapers (it is based on the Open Source corpus processor Unitex3 Ð Paumier, 2003).",
        "Online newspapers are an interesting source of textual data on the Web because they are continuously updated and they usually publish articles reviewed through a full editorial",
        "process which ensures (a certain) quality of the text.",
        "GlossaNet downloads over 100 newspapers (in 10 languages) on a daily basis and parses them like corpora.",
        "The Web-based interface4 of this service enable the user to select a list of newspapers and to register a query.",
        "Every day, the user’s query is applied on the updated corpus and results are sent by email to the user under the form of a concordance.",
        "The main limitation of GlossaNet is that it works only on a limited set of sources which all are of the same kind (newspapers).",
        "In this paper we will present a new approach which takes advantage of a very popular XML-based format used on the Web for sharing content among websites: RSS (Really Simple Syndication).",
        "We will briefly explain what RSS is and discuss its possibilities of use for building corpora.",
        "We will also present Corporator, an Open Source program we have developed for creating RSS-fed specialized corpora.",
        "This system is not meant to replace broad Web crawling approaches but rather systems like GlossaNet, which collect Web pages from a comparatively small set of homogeneous Web sites."

        "If the classification fits the researcher needs, it can be used for building a specialized corpus.",
        "Paquot and Fairon (Forthcoming), for instance, used this approach for creating corpora of editorials in several languages, which can serve as comparable corpora to the ICLE16 argumentative essays, see section 3.1).",
        "Classification is of course extremely interesting for building specialized corpora, but there are two limitations of this asset:",
        "• The classification is not standardized among content publishers.",
        "So it will require some work to find equivalent news feeds from different publishers.",
        "Figure 2 offers a good illustration of this: the categories proposed by Reuters and the New York Times do not exactly match (even if they both have in common some feeds like sports or science).",
        "• We do not have a clear view on how the",
        "classification is done (manually by the authors, by the system administrators, or even automatically?).",
        "A second asset is that RSS are updated on a regular basis.",
        "As such, an RSS feed provides a continuous flow of data that can be easily collected in a corpus.",
        "We could call this a dynamic corpus (Fairon, 1999) as it will grow over time.",
        "We could also use the term monitor corpus which was proposed by Renouf (1993) and which is widely used in the Anglo-Saxon community of corpus linguistics.",
        "A third asset is that the quality of the language in one feed will be approximately constant.",
        "We know that one of the difficulties when we crawl the Web for finding sources is that we can come across any kind of document of different quality.",
        "By selecting “trusted” RSS sources, we can insure an adequate quality of the retrieved texts.",
        "We can also note that RSS feeds comprise the title, date of publication and the author’s name of",
        "the articles referred to.",
        "This is also an advantage because this information can be difficult to extract from HTML code (as it is rarely well structured).",
        "As soon as we know the date of publication, we can easily download only up to date information, a task that is not always easy with regular crawlers.",
        "On the side of these general assets, it is also easy to imagine the interest of this type of sources for specific applications such as linguistic survey of the news (neologism identification, term extraction, dictionary update, etc.).",
        "All these advantages would not be very significant if the number of sources was limited.",
        "But as we indicated above, the number of news feeds is rapidly and continuously growing, and not only on news portals.",
        "Specialized websites are building index of RSS feeds17 (but we need to remark that for the time being traditional search engines such as Google, MSN, Yahoo, etc.",
