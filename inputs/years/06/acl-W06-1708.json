        "Many fundamental issues about the viability and exploitation of the web as a linguistic corpus have not been tackled yet.",
        "The web is a massive repository of text and multimedia data.",
        "However, there is not a systematic way of classifying and retrieving these documents.",
        "Computational Linguists are of course not the only ones looking at these issues; research on the Semantic Web focuses on providing a semantic description of all the resources on the web, resulting into a mesh of information linked up in such a way as to be easily processable by machines, on a global scale.",
        "You can think of it as being an efficient way of representing data on the World Wide Web, or as a globally linked database.",
        "The way the vision of the Semantic Web will be achieved, is by describing each document using languages such as RDF Schema and OWL, which are capable of explicitly expressing the meaning of terms in vocabularies and the relationships between those terms.",
        "The issue we are focusing on in this paper is that these languages are used to define ontologies as well.",
        "If ultimately a single ontology were used to describe all the documents on the web, systems would be able to exchange information in a transparent way for the end user.",
        "The availability of such a standard ontology would be extremely helpful to NLP as well, e.g., it would make it far easier to retrieve all documents on a certain topic.",
        "However, until this vision becomes a reality, a plurality of ontologies are being used to describe documents and their content.",
        "The task of automatic ontology alignment or matching (Hughes and Ash-pole, 2005) then needs to be addressed.",
        "The task of ontology matching has been typically carried out manually or semi-automatically, for example through the use of graphical user interfaces (Noy and Musen, 2000).",
        "Previous work has been done to provide automated support to this time consuming task (Rahm and Bernstein, 2001; Cruz and Rajendran, 2003; Doan et al., 2003; Cruz et al., 2004; Subba and Masud, 2004).",
        "The various methods can be classified into two main categories: schema based and instance based.",
        "Schema based approaches try to infer the semantic mappings by exploiting information related to the structure of the ontologies to be matched, like their topological properties, the labels or description of their nodes, and structural constraints defined on the schemas of the ontologies.",
        "These methods do not take into account the actual data classified by the ontologies.",
        "On the other hand, instance based approaches look at the information contained in the instances of each element of the schema.",
        "These methods try to infer the relationships between the nodes of the ontologies from the analysis of their instances.",
        "Finally, hybrid approaches combine schema and instance based",
        "methods into integrated systems.",
        "Neither instance level information, nor NLP techniques have been extensively explored in previous work on ontology matching.",
        "For example, (Agirre et al., 2000) exploits documents (instances) on the WWW to enrich WordNet (Miller et al., 1990), i.e., to compute “concept signatures,” collection of words that significantly distinguish one sense from another, however, not directly for ontology matching.",
        "(Liu et al., 2005) uses documents retrieved via queries augmented with, for example, synonyms that WordNet provides to improve the accuracy of the queries themselves, but not for ontology matching.",
        "NLP techniques such as POS tagging, or parsing, have been used for ontology matching, but on the names and definitions in the ontology itself, for example, in (Hovy, 2002), hence with a schema based methodology.",
        "In this paper, we describe the results we obtained when using some simple but effective NLP methods to align web ontologies, using an instance based approach.",
        "As we will see, our results show that more sophisticated methods do not necessarily lead to better results."

        "The instance documents are assumed to be text documents (plain text or HTML).",
        "The matching process starts from a pair of ontologies to be aligned.",
        "The two ontologies are traversed and, for each node having at least one instance, the system computes a signature based on the instance documents.",
        "Then, the signatures associated to the nodes of the two ontologies are compared pairwise, and a similarity score for each pair is generated.",
        "This score could then be used to estimate the likelihood of a match between a pair of nodes, under the assumption that the semantics of a node corresponds to the semantics of the instance documents classified under that node.",
        "Figure 1 shows the architecture of our system.",

        "The cosine similarity formula produces a value in the range [0, 1].",
        "The meaning of that value depends on the algorithm used to build the signature.",

        "HTML tags are first removed from the instance documents.",
        "Then, the texts are tokenized and punctuation is removed.",
        "Everything is then converted to lowercase.",
        "Finally, the tokens are grouped and counted.",
        "The final signature has the form of a mapping table token – * frequency.",
        "The main problem we expected with this method is the presence of a lot of noise.",
        "In fact, many “irrelevant” words, like determiners, prepositions, and so on, are added to the final signature.",
        "To cope with the problem of excessive noise, people in IR often use fixed lists of stop words to be removed from the texts.",
        "Instead, we introduced a syntax based filter in our chain of processing.",
        "The main assuption is that nouns are the words that carry most of the meaning for our kind of document comparison.",
        "Thus, we introduced a part-of-speech tagger right after the tokenization module (Figure 3).",
        "The results of the tagger are used to discard everything but nouns from the input documents.",
        "The part-of-speech tagger we used –QTAG 3.1 (Tufis and Mason, 1998), readily available on the web as a Java library– is a Hidden Markov Model based statistical tagger.",
        "The problems we expected with this approach are related to the high specialization of words in natural language.",
        "Different nouns can bear similar meaning, but our system would treat them as if they were completely unrelated words.",
        "For example, the words “apple” and “orange” are semantically closer than “apple” and “chair,” but a purely syntactic approach would not make any difference between these two pairs.",
        "Also, the current method does not include morphological processing, so different inflections of the same word, such as “apple” and “apples,” are treated as distinct words.",
        "In further experiments, we also considered verbs, another syntactic category of words bearing a lot of semantics in natural language.",
        "We computed signatures with verbs only, and with verbs and nouns together.",
        "In both cases, however, the performance of the system was worse.",

        "In WordNet, words are grouped into synsets, i.e., sets of synonyms.",
        "Each synset can have links to other synsets.",
        "These links represent semantic relationships like hypernymy, hyponymy, and so on.",
        "In our approach, after the extraction of nouns and their grouping, each noun is looked up on WordNet (Figure 4).",
        "The synsets to which the noun belongs are added to the final signature in place of the noun itself.",
        "The signature can also be enriched with the hypernyms of these synsets, up to a specified level.",
        "The final signature has the form of a mapping synset – * value, where value is a weighted sum of all the synsets found.",
        "Two important parameters of this method are related to the hypernym expansion process mentioned above.",
        "The first parameter is the maximum level of hypernyms to be added to the signature (hypernym level).",
        "A hypernym level value of 0 would make the algorithm add only the synsets of a word, without any hypernym, to the signature.",
        "A value of 1 would cause the algorithm to add also their parents in the hypernym hierarchy to the signature.",
        "With higher values, all the ancestors up to the specified level are added.",
        "The second parameter, hypernym factor, specifies the damping of the weight of the hypernyms in the expansion process.",
        "Our algorithm exponentially dampens the hypernyms, i.e., the weigth of a hypernym decreases exponentially as its level increases.",
        "The hypernym factor is the base of the exponential function.",
        "In general, a noun can have more than one sense, e.g., “apple” can be either a fruit or a tree.",
        "This is reflected in WordNet by the fact that a noun can belong to multiple synsets.",
        "With the current approach, the system cannot decide which",
        "sense is the most appropriate, so all the senses of a word are added to the final signature, with a weight inversely proportional to the number of possible senses of that word.",
        "This fact potentially introduces semantic noise in the signature, because many irrelevant senses might be added to the signature itself.",
        "Another limitation is that a portion of the nouns in the source texts cannot be located in WordNet (see Figure 6).",
        "Thus, we also tried a variation (algorithm 3+2) that falls back on to the bare lexical form of a noun if it cannot be found in WordNet.",
        "This variation, however, resulted in a slight decrease of performance.",
        "2.1.4 Algorithm 4: Disambiguated signature The problem of having multiple senses for each word calls for the adoption of word sense disambiguation techniques.",
        "Thus, we implemented a word sense disambiguator algorithm, and we inserted it into the signature generation pipeline (Figure 5).",
        "For each noun in the input documents, the disambiguator takes into account a specified number of context words, i.e., nouns preceding and/or following the target word.",
        "The algorithm computes a measure of the semantic distance between the possible senses of the target word and the senses of each of its context words, pairwise.",
        "A sense for the target word is chosen such that the total distance to its context is minimized.",
        "The semantic distance between two synsets is defined here as the minimum number of hops in the WordNet hypernym hierarchy connecting the two synsets.",
        "This definition allows for a relatively straightforward computation of the semantic distance using WordNet.",
        "Other more sophisticated definitions of semantic distance can be found in (Patwardhan et al., 2003).",
        "The word sense disambiguation algorithm we implemented is certainly simpler than others proposed in the literature, but we used it to see whether a method that is relatively simple to implement could still help.",
        "The overall parameters for this signature creation algorithm are the same as the WordNet signature algorithm, plus two additional parameters for the word sense disambiguator: left context length and right context length.",
        "They represent respectively how many nouns before and after the target should be taken into account by the disambiguator.",
        "If those two parameters are both set to zero, then no context is provided, and the first possible sense is chosen.",
        "Notice that even in this case the behaviour of this signature generation algorithm is different from the previous one.",
