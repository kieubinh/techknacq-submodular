        "Many works have focused on the study of approaches that improve parsing in real-world applications.",
        "Several of these approaches propose new mechanisms to practical parsing speed-ups (Boullier, 2003), while others propose the use of semantic information to improve the parsing results (Mohanty and Balabantaray, 2003).",
        "This paper describes how the performance of a left-corner parser used in a practical dialogue system is improved by using knowledge from domain ontologies and context dialogue.",
        "The Principle of Compositionality states that the meaning of a sentence can be composed of the meaning of its syntactic constituents.",
        "There are two different approaches following this principle: a pipeline architecture where the result of the parsing is passed as input to the semantic analyzer, and the integration of semantics directly into the parser.",
        "In this second approach, when performing syntactic and semantic analysis in parallel, the representation of the meaning for a constituent is created once all its constituent parts have been recognized.",
        "The main advantage of this approach is that semantic considerations can be used to reduce the number of possible syntactic structures to be considered.",
        "However, the integration of semantic and syntactic analysis has also disadvantages.",
        "The primary of them being that considerable effort is spent on the semantic analysis of constituents that, in the end, do not contribute to a successful parse.",
        "Additionally, the traditional wide-coverage grammars are not particularly well-suited for compositional semantic analysis because they include many general syntactic constituents with no semantic role.",
        "For these reasons, many practical systems requiring semantic analysis for a particular domain use grammars adapted to the specific domain.",
        "As explained in (Jurafsky and Martin, 2000), these grammars simplify semantic processing in several ways:",
        "• Their rules and constituents are designed to correspond directly to entities and relations from the domain.",
        "• The key semantic components occur together",
        "within single rules while in traditional grammars the key semantic elements are often widely distributed across parse trees.",
        "• Their nature enables a certain amount of pre",
        "diction about upcoming input, thus helping with anaphor and ellipsis phenomena.",
        "However, domain-restricted grammars and lexicon present several limitations.",
        "The possible sentences that can be analyzed correctly with domain-restricted resources are limited.",
        "Besides, the number of grammar rules needed for a particular domain can be high because syntactic generalizations are limited.",
        "Furthermore, application-restricted resources are expensive to develop and difficult to reuse.",
        "This paper describes the approach followed when applying syntax-driven semantics to a practical dialogue system for multiple applications.",
        "This system supports speech and textual",
        "interaction in several languages (English, Spanish, Catalan and Italian).",
        "The voice components of the system are based on VoiceXML.",
        "The automatic speech recognition system uses grammars to recognize and process user interventions.",
        "These grammars incorporate semantic information (following the standard Speech Recognition Grammar Specification).",
        "The text input is processed by a chart-based parser, implemented in Prolog, with top-down filtering that performs the syntactic and semantic analyses in parallel.",
        "A more detailed description of it can be found in (Gatius, 2001).",
        "In this dialogue system the application knowledge involved in the communication is represented in ontologies.",
        "These ontologies are used to generate the dialogues, the system messages and the linguistic structures necessary for processing user interventions.",
        "In this paper we focus on how the application specific knowledge represented in ontologies is used to improve the performance of the parser.",
        "In the current implementation of the dialogue system the parser is only used to process text input.",
        "Basically, it is used to study how the voice module could be improved.",
        "For this reason, the grammars and lexicons used by the parser to process textual input are very similar to those used by the speech recognizer.",
        "For the next version of the system we are planning to integrate the parser with the voice module, using the last VoiceXML version.",
        "As to the structure of this paper it is as follows: in the following section we describe the use of ontologies modelling the application tasks-specific knowledge for dialogue management.",
        "Section 3 describes how the application information represented in the ontologies is associated with the linguistic resources and how this information is used by the parser to interpret the user's interventions.",
        "Section 4 explains how the contextual information is used to improve the efficiency of the parser.",
        "Results of the parser performance are discussed in Section 5.",

        "They are appropriate for simple and structured tasks but not for complex applications, when the number of possible interaction paths grows.",
        "Many spoken question-answering systems use a more flexible dialogue management model, based on frames (or templates) representing the task model.",
        "These frames contain slots describing the various kinds of information the user would be asked to fill.",
        "The number of frames needed depends on the application tasks complexity.",
        "In most of those systems there is no explicit dialogue model.",
        "Frame-based system models are appropriate when the set of actions the system can do is reduced (being the number of frames limited), which is not the case in complex applications.",
        "The main problem in finite state and frame-based models is that they only support very limited user initiative.",
        "In more complex systems a more flexible communication is provided by including explicit dialogue model as well as task model.",
        "Several dialogue systems supporting flexible communication in complex domain also include an explicit representation of the domain model.",
        "An example of a system using a dialogue model, a task model and a domain model is described in [9].",
        "In this system, the intentional structure underlying the dialogue is derived from an ontology modelling the application tasks and the informational structure is obtained from the domain ontologies.",
        "One of the advantages of using ontologies for representing the application tasks in comparison",
        "to other conceptual representations, such as frames, is that in ontologies relations and preconditions between different entities are defined.",

        "In this paper we have described how the application specific knowledge represented in ontologies is used to improve the processing of user's interventions in a practical multilingual dialogue system for multiple applications.",
        "In this system the dialogues as well as the application-restricted resources are obtained from the ontologies representing the application specifications.",
        "The use of ontologies has proved specially appropriate for dialogue systems in complex domains (complex concepts and relations) as well as for systems in multiple domains (information common to several applications can be easily reused) and in those systems supporting different modes of communication and languages (the semantic interpretation is represented in base to the same ontology).",
        "We have described how a bottom-up parser uses the application specific knowledge associated with the lexical entries (obtained from the ontology representing the application) to process the user interventions.",
        "The resulting semantic interpretation is represented in base to the application specific ontology.",
        "In current implementation the semantics used to represent the application information associated with the lexical entries is very simple.",
        "For future prototypes we will study other forms of associating the application specific knowledge with the lexical entries.",
        "In order to improve the performance the parser also uses the context dialogue.",
        "It uses information about previously asked questions (about the conceptual attribute values) to select the grammar rules related to the dialogue focus.",
        "The use of application specific and context knowledge improves both the runtime processing and the resulting semantic interpretation.",
        "However, in order to achieve a flexible communication context information must be used appropriately.",
        "Future improvements in the system will include considering different type of information related to the dialogue state.",
        "We are planning to integrate the bottom-up parser with the voice module, using the last VoiceXML version.",
        "Future work will include comparing the results obtained when using the parser described to those obtained when using a statistical parser.",
        "Although tests with real users have not been done yet, we expect the linguistic resources we have developed from applications specification would not cover the different ways users express themselves.",
        "For this reason, we are planning to test the current implementation of the system with different types of users and enriching the linguistic resources using the samples obtained.",
        "We are also planning to test the parser functionality in dialogues where users have more initiative."
