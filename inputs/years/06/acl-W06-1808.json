        "Several future directions are obviously considered:",
        "• an analysis of needs for common knowledge so that the answer characterization task is made easier, • an analysis of how restrictions are lexicalized in texts (adjectives, relative clauses, etc.)",
        "in order to extract them easily, • an evaluation of the knowledge costs and of what domain specific is (especially for common knowledge about restrictions), • an evaluation of the quality of answers proposed to users and of the utility of a user model for the selection of the best answer."
