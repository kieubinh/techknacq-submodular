        "Question answering (QA) systems are information retrieval systems accepting queries in natural language and returning the results in the form of sentences (or paragraphs, or phrases).",
        "They move beyond standard information retrieval (IR) where results are presented in the form of a ranked list of query-relevant documents.",
        "Such a finer answer presentation is possible thanks to the application of computational linguistics techniques in order to filter irrelevant documents, and of a consistent amount of question preprocessing and result post-processing.",
        "However, in most state-of-the-art QA systems the output remains independent of the questioner’s characteristics, goals and needs; in other words, there is a lack of user modelling.",
        "For instance, an elementary school child and a University history student would get the same answer to the question: “When did the Middle Ages begin?”.",
        "Secondly, most QA systems focus on factoid questions, i.e. questions concerning people, dates, numerical quantities etc., which can generally be answered by a short sentence or phrase (Kwok et al., 2001).",
        "The mainstream approach to QA evaluation, represented by TREC-QA campaigns1, has long fostered the criterion that a “good” system is one that returns the “correct” answer in the shortest possible formulation.",
        "Although recent efforts in TREC 2003 and 2004 (Voorhees, 2003; Voorhees, 2004) denoted an interest towards list questions and definitional (or “other”) questions, we believe that there has not been enough interest towards non-factoid answers.",
        "The real issue is “realizing” that the answer to a question is sometimes too complex to be formulated and evaluated as a factoid: some queries have multiple, complex or controversial answers (take e.g. “What were the causes of World War II?”).",
        "In such situations, returning a short paragraph or text snippet is more appropriate than exact answer spotting.",
        "For instance, the answer to “What is a metaphor?” may be better understood with the inclusion of examples.",
        "This viewpoint is supported by recent user behaviour studies which showed that even in the case of factoid-based QA systems, the most eligible result format consisted in a paragraph where the sentence containing the answer was highlighted (Lin et al., 2003).",
        "The issue of non-factoids is related to the user modelling problem: while factoid answers do not necessarily require to be contextualized within the user’s knowledge and viewpoint, the need is much stronger in the case of definitions, explanations and descriptions.",
        "This is mentioned in the TREC 2003 report (Voorhees, 2003) when discussing the evaluation of definitional questions: however, the issue is expeditiously solved by assuming a fixed user profile (the “average news reader”).",
        "We are currently developing an adaptive system which adjusts its output with respect to a user model.",
        "The system can be seen as an enhanced IR system which adapts both the content and presentation of the final results, improving their quality.",
        "In this paper, we show that QA systems can benefit from the contribution of user models, and explain how these can be used to filter the information presented as an answer based on readability.",
        "Eventually, we describe preliminary results obtained via an evaluation framework inspired by user-centered search engine evaluation."

        "Our current application, YourQA2, is a learning-oriented system to help students find information on the Web for their assignments.",
        "Our UM consists of the user’s:",
        "• age range, a E {7 – 11,11 – 16, adult} • reading level, r E {poor, medium, good} • webpages of interest/bookmarks, w",
        "The age range parameter has been chosen to match the partition between primary school, contemporary school and higher education age in",
        "Britain; our reading level parameter takes three values which ideally (but not necessarily) correspond to the three age ranges and may be further refined in the future for more fine-grained modelling.",
        "Analogies can be found with the SeAn (Ardis-sono et al., 2001), and SiteIF (Magnini and Strap-parava, 2001) news recommender systems, where information such as age and browsing history, resp.",
        "are part of the UM.",
        "More generally, our approach is similar to that of personalized search systems (Teevan et al., 2005; Pitkow et al., 2002), which construct UMs based on the user’s documents and webpages.",
        "In our system, UM information is explicitly collected from the user; while age and reading level are self-assessed, the user’s interests are extracted from the document set w using a keyphrase extractor (see further for details).",
        "Eventually, a dialogue framework with a history component will contribute to the construction and update of the user model in a less intruding and thus more user-friendly way.",
        "In this paper we focus on how to adapt search result presentation using the reading level parameter: age and webpages will not be discussed."

        "However, a significant aspect of novelty in our architecture is that the QA component is supported by the user model.",
        "Additionally, we have changed the relative importance of the different tiers: while we drastically reduce linguistic processing during question processing and answer generation, we give more relief to the post-retrieval phase and to the role of the UM.",
        "Having removed the need for fine-grained answer spotting, the emphasis is shifted towards finding closely connected sentences that are highly",

        "Readability Within computational linguistics, several applications have been designed to address the needs of users with low reading skills.",

        "In the case of PSET (Carroll et al., 1999) for instance, a tagger, a morphological analyzer and generator and a parser are used to reformulate newspaper text for users affected by aphasia.",
        "Another interesting research is Inui et al.’s lexical and syntactical paraphrasing system for deaf students (Inui et al., 2003).",
        "In this system, the judgment of experts (teachers) is used to learn selection rules for paraphrases acquired using various methods (statistical, manual, etc.).",

        "Moreover, it is more applicable than length-based approach for Web documents, where sentences are typically short regardless of the complexity of the text.",
        "The language modelling approach proceeds in two phases: in the training phase, given a range of reading levels, a set of representative documents is collected for each reading level.",
        "A unigram language model lms is then built for each set s; the model consists of a list of the word stems appearing in the training documents with their individual probabilities.",
