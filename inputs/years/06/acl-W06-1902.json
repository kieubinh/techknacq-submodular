        "It was able to answer 42.6% of the questions correctly in a monolingual run.",
        "These questions were then translated manually from English into Arabic and back into English using an MT system, and then reapplied to the QA system.",
        "The system was able to answer 10.2% of the translated questions.",

        "The overall accuracy of a QA system is directly affected by its ability to correctly analyze the questions it receives as input, a Cross Language Question Answering (CLQA) system will be sensitive to any errors introduced during question translation.",
        "Many researchers criticize the MT-based CLIR approach.",
        "The reason for their criticism mostly stem from the fact that the current translation quality of MT is poor, in addition MT system are expensive to develop and their application degrades the retrieval efficiency due to the cost of the linguistic analysis.",
        "This paper investigates the extent to which MT error affects QA accuracy.",
        "It is divided as follows: in section 2 relevant previous work on cross-language retrieval is described, section 3 explains the experimental approach which includes the procedure and systems employed, it also discuss the results obtained, section 4 draws conclusions and future research on what improvements need to be done for MT systems."

        "Systran was used to translate 199 TREC questions from Arabic into English.",

        "Several translation errors appeared during translations which are of the type: wrong transliteration, wrong word sense, wrong word order and wrong pronoun.",
        "The translated questions were fed into AnswerFinder, which had a big impact on its accuracy in returning correct answers.",
        "AnswerFinder was seriously affected by the relatively poor output of Systran; its effectiveness was degraded by 32.4%.",
        "This conclusion confirms Rosso et al. (2005) findings using different QA system, different test sets and different machine translation system.",
        "Our results validate their results which they concluded that translation of the queries from Arabic into English has reduced the accuracy of QA system by more than 30%.",
        "We recommend using multiple MT to give a wider range of translation to choose from, hence, correct translation is more likely to appear in",
        "multiple MT systems than in a single MT system.",
        "However, it is essential to note that in some cases MT systems may all disagree with one another in providing correct translation or they may agree on the wrong translation.",
        "It should also be borne in mind that some keywords are naturally more important than others, so in a question-answering setting it is more important to translate them correctly.",
        "Some keywords may not be as important, and some keywords due to the incorrect analysis of the English question sentence by the Question Analysis module, may even degrade the translation and question-answering performance.",
        "We believe there are ways to avoid the MT errors that discussed previously (i.e. wrong transliteration, wrong word senses, wrong word order, and wrong translation of pronoun).",
        "Below are some suggestions to overcome such problems:",
        "• One solution is to make some adjustments (Pre or Post processing) to the question translation process to minimize the effects of translation by automatically correcting some regular errors using a regular written expression.",
        "• Another possible solution is to try build",
        "ing an interactive MT system by providing users more than one translation to pick the most accurate one, we believe this will offer a great help in resolving word sense problem.",
        "This is more suitable for expert users of a language.",
        "In this paper, we have presented the errors associated with machine translation which indicates that the current state of MT is not very reliable for cross language QA.",
        "Much work has been done in the area of machine translation for CLIR; however, the evaluation often focuses on retrieval effectiveness rather than translation correctness."
