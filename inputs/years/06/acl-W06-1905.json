        "Instead of combining multiple translation candidates with a disjunctive query operator (Isozaki et al., 2005), the TM selects the best combination of translated keywords from several sources: Machine Readable Dictionaries (MRDs), Machine Translation systems (MTs) and Web-mining-Based Keyword Translators (WBMTs) (Nagata et al., 2001, Li et al., 2003).",
        "For translation from English to Japanese, we used two MRDs, eight MTs and one WBMT.",

        "For translation from English to Chinese, we used one MRD, three MTs and one WBMT.",
        "After gathering all possible translations for every keyword, the TM uses a noisy channel model to select the best combination of translated keywords.",
        "The TM estimates model statistics using the World Wide Web.",
        "Details of the translation selection method are described in the rest of this subsection.",
        "The Noisy Channel Model: In the noisy channel model, an undistorted signal passes through a noisy channel and becomes distorted.",
        "Given the distorted signal, we are to find the original, undistorted signal.",
        "IBM applied the noisy channel model idea to translation of sentences from aligned parallel corpora, where the source language sentence is the distorted signal, and the",
        "target language sentence is the original signal (Brown et al., 1990).",
        "We adopt this model for disambiguating keyword translation, with the source language keyword terms as the distorted signal and the target language terms as the original signal.",
        "The TM's job is to find the target language terms given the source language terms, by finding the probability of the target language terms given the source language terms P(T |S).",
        "Using Bayes' Rule, we can break the equation down to several components:",
        "Because we are comparing probabilities of different translations of the same source keyword terms, we can simplify the problem to be: P(T |S) = P(T) ⋅ P(S |T) We can now reduce the equation to two components.",
        "P(T) is the language model and P(S |T) is the translation model.",
        "If we assume independence among the translations of individual terms, we can represent the translation probability of a keyword by the product of the probabilities of the individual term translations: i Estimating Probabilities using the World Wide Web: For estimating the probabilities of the translation model and the language model, we chose to gather statistics from the World Wide Web.",
        "There are three advantages in utilizing the web for gathering translation statistics: 1) it contains documents written in many different languages, 2) it has high coverage of virtually all types of words and phrases, and 3) it is constantly updated.",
        "However, we also note that the web contains a lot of noisy data, and building up web statistics is time-consuming unless one has direct access to a web search index.",
        "Estimating Translation Model Probabilities: We make an assumption that terms that are translations of each other co-occur more often in mixed-language web pages than terms that are not translations of each other.",
        "This assumption is analogous to Turney’s work on the co-occurrence of synonyms (Turney, 2001).",
        "We then define the translation probability of each keyword translation as: j Where si is the i-th term in the source language and tij is the j-th translation candidate for si.",
        "Let hits be a number of web pages retrieved from a certain search engine.",
        "co(si, t i,j) is the hits given a query si and tij., where log is applied to adjust the count so that translation probabilities can still be comparable at higher counts.",
        "Estimating Language Model Probabilities: In estimating the language model, we simply obtain hits given a conjunction of all the candidate terms in the target language, and divide that count by the sum of the occurrences of the individual terms:",
        "The final score of a translation candidate for a query is the product of the translation model score P(S |T) and the language model score P(T).",
        "Smoothing and Pruning: As with most statistical calculations in language technologies, there is a data sparseness problem when calculating the language model score.",
        "Also, because statistics are gathered real-time by accessing a remote search engine via internet, it can take a long time to process a single query when there is a large number of translation candidates.",
        "We describe methods for smoothing the language model and pruning the set of translation candidates below.",
        "The data sparseness problem occurs when there are many terms in the query, and the terms are relatively rare keywords.",
        "When calculating the language model score, it is possible that none of the translation candidates appear on any web page.",
        "To address this issue, we propose a \"moving-window smoothing\" algorithm:",
        "• When the target keyword co-occurrence",
        "count with n keywords is below a set threshold for all of the translation candidates, we use a moving window of size n-1 that \"moves\" through the keywords in sequence, splitting the set of keywords into two sets, each with n-1 keywords.",
        "• If the co-occurrence count of all of these",
        "sets of keywords is above the threshold, return the product of the language model",
        "score of these two sets as the language model score.",
        "• If not, decrease the window and repeat until either all of the split sets are above the threshold or n = 1.",
        "The moving window smoothing technique gradually relaxes the search constraint without losing the \"connectivity\" of keywords (there is always overlap in the split parts) before finally backing off to just the individual keywords.",
        "However, there are two issues worth noting with this approach:",
        "1.",
        "\"Moving-window smoothing\" assumes that keywords that are next to each other are also more semantically related, which may not always be the case.",
        "2.",
        "\"Moving-window smoothing\" tends to give the keywords near the middle of the question more weight, which may not be desirable.",
        "A better smoothing technique may be used with trying all possible \"splits\" at each stage, but this would greatly increase the time cost.",
        "Therefore, we chose the moving-window smoothing as a trade-off between a more robust smoothing technique that tries all possible split combinations and no smoothing at all.",
        "The set of possible translation candidates is produced by creating all possible combinations of the translations of individual keywords.",
        "For a question with n keywords and an average of m possible translations per keyword, the number of possible combinations is m\".",
        "This quickly becomes intractable as we have to access a search engine at least m\" times just for the language model score.",
        "Therefore, pruning is needed to cut down the number of translation candidates.",
        "We prune possible translation candidates twice during each run, using early and late pruning:",
        "1.",
        "Early Pruning: We prune possible translations of the individual keywords before combining them to make all possible translations of a query.",

        "2.",
        "Late Pruning: We prune possible transla",
        "tion candidates of the entire set of keywords after calculating translation probabilities.",
        "Since the calculation of the translation probabilities requires little access to the web, we can calculate only the language model score for the top N candidates with the highest translation score and prune the rest.",
        "An Example of English to Chinese Keyword Translation Selection: Suppose we translate the following question from English to Chinese.",
        "\"What if Bush leaves Iraq?\" Three keywords are extracted: “Bush”, “leaves”, and “Iraq.” Using two MT systems and an MRD, we obtain the following translations:",
        "\"Bush\" and \"leaves\" both have two translations because they are ambiguous keywords, while \"Iraq\" is unambiguous.",
        "Translation (1,1) means bush as in a shrub, and translation (1,2) refers to the person named Bush.",

        "We described how we extended an existing monolingual (English) system for CLQA (English to Chinese and English to Japanese), including a translation disambiguation technique which uses a noisy channel model with probability estimations using web as corpora.",
        "We discussed the influence of translation accuracy on CLQA by presenting experimental results and analysis.",
        "We concluded by introducing some language-specific issues for keyword translation from English to Chinese and Japanese which we hope to address in ongoing research."
