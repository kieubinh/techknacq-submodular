        "A Question Answering (QA) system seeks and shows the user an accurate and concise answer, given a free-form question, and using a large text data collection.",
        "The use of Cross Language Information Retrieval Systems (CLIR) is growing, and also the application of these ones into other general systems, such as Question Answering or Question Classification.",
        "A CLIR system is an Information Retrieval System that works with collections in several languages, and extract relevant documents or passages (Grefenstette, 1998).",
        "We have proposed a Multilingual Question Answering System (BRUJA - in Spanish “Busqueda de Respuestas University of Jaen”) that works with collections in several languages.",
        "Since there are several languages, tasks such as obtaining relevant documents and extracting the answer could be accomplished in two ways: using NPL tools and resources for each language or for a pivot language only (English) and translating to the pivot language the rest of the relevant information when it is required.",
        "Because of the translation step, the second approach is less accurate but more practical since we need only NPL resources for English.",
        "The central question is the noise, because of the translation process, is too high in order to use this approach in spite of their practical advantages.",
        "The first step of this system is a Question Classifier (QC).",
        "Given a query, a question classification module obtains the class of such question.",
        "This information is useful for the extraction of the answer.",
        "For example, given the query ”Where is Madrid?, the QA system expects a location entity as answer type.",
        "The proposed QA module works with questions in several languages, translates them into English using different online translators, and obtains the type of questions and some features, such as the focus, the keywords or the context.",
        "In this work we aim to find out whether a multilingual QC module is possible by using translation tools and English as pivot language or not."

        "Question Classification is the task that, given a question, classifies it in one of k semantic classes.",
        "Some QC systems are based on regular expressions and manual grammatical rules (Van Durme et al., 2003).",
        "Recent works in QC have studied different machine learning methods.",
        "(Zhang and Lee, 2003) propose a QC system that uses Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the best machine learning algorithm.",
        "They compare the obtained results with other algorithms, such as Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree or Sparse Network of Winnows (SNoW).",
        "(Li and Roth, 2002) propose a system based on SNoW.",
        "They used five main classes and fifty fined classes.",
        "Other systems have used SVM and modified kernels.",
        "QC systems have some restrictions (Hacioglu and Ward, 2003), such as: • Traditional question classification uses a set of rules, for instance “questions that start with Who ask about a person”.",
        "These are manual rules that have to be revised to improve the results.",
        "• These rules are very weak, because when new questions arise, the system has to be updated to classify them.",
        "Most of the QC systems use English as the main language, and some of the best and standard resources are developed for English.",
        "It would be possible to build a question classifier for every language based on machine learning, using a good training corpus for each language, but is something expensive to produce.",
        "For this reason we have used Machine Translation Systems.",
        "Machine Translation (MT) systems are very appreciated in CLIR (McNamee et al., 2000).",
        "Last years these systems have improved the results, but there are not translators for each language pair and the quality of the result depends on this pair.",
        "The reason of using MT and not a Spanish classifier is simple: we have developed a multilingual QA system that works in this moment with three languages: English, Spanish and French.",
        "Because it is too complex for us to work with resources into these three languages and also to manage the information into three languages, our kernel system works into English, and we use MT to translate information when it is necessary.",
        "We have developed a QC system that covers three tasks:",
        "• It uses machine learning algorithms.",
        "We have tested methods based on Support Vector Machine, for instance SVMLight or LibSVM,",

        "TiMBL 1 is a program that implements several Memory-Based Learning techniques.",
        "It stores a representation of the training set explicitly in memory, and classifies new cases by extrapolation from the most similar stored cases.",
        "• To classify Spanish questions we have checked two online machine translators.",
        "Our proposal is to study how the translation can affect in the final results, compared to the original English results.",
        "• Finally, we would obtain different results applying different levels of features (lexical, syntactic and semantic).",
        "In the next section well explain them and in results chapter we will see these differences.",
        "Our QC system has three independent modules, so it will be easy to replace each one with other to improve the final results.",
        "In Figure 1 we can see them.",
        "The first module translates the question into other languages, Spanish in this case.",
        "We have used two machine translation systema that work well for the language pair Spanish-English: Epals and Prompt.",
        "This module could work with other machine translation systems and other languages if there would be a good translator for the language pair used.",
        "The second module extracts some relevant features (see next section) using the original or the translated English questions.",
        "Some of these features will be used by the machine learning module (lexical, syntactic and semantic features) and the",
        "others will be used later in the answers extraction phase.",
        "Take into account that the second module also extracts important features such as the context of the question, the focus or the keywords that we would use in next steps of the Question Answering system.",
        "The final module applies the machine learning algorithm and returns the question category or class.",
        "In our first experiments we used Library for Support Vector Machines (LibSVM) and Bayesian Logistic Regression (BBR), but for this one we have used Tilburg Memory Based Learner (TiMBL).",
        "TiMBL (Daelemans et al., 2004) implements several Memory-Based Learning techniques, classic k-NN classification kernel and several metrics.",
        "It implements Stanfill modified value difference metric (MVDM), Jeffrey Divergence and Class voting in the k-NN kernel according to the distance of the nearest neighbors.",
        "It makes classification using heuristic approximations, such as the IGTREE decision tree algorithm and the TRIBL and TRIBL2 hybrids.",
