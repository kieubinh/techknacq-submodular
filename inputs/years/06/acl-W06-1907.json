        "Much of the research into automatic question answering (QA) has understandably concentrated on the English language with little regard to portability or efficacy in other languages.",
        "It is only relatively recently, with the introduction of the CLEF and NTCIR QA evaluations, that researchers have started to look at porting and evaluating the techniques that have been shown to work well for English to other languages.",
        "One of the major drawbacks of porting an English language QA system or approach to other languages is often the lack of the corresponding NLP tools in the target language.",
        "For instance, parsers and named-entity (NE)-taggers, which are typical components in many QA systems, are certainly not available for all the world’s languages.",
        "Trainable parsers and NE-taggers similarly require appropriate training data which, if not available, is costly and requires specialized knowledge to produce.",
        "Language-specific databases are also a common feature of many systems, some of which have taken many man-years to construct and verify.",
        "Such a component in many English-language systems, for example, is WordNet.",
        "While porting WordNet to other languages has been started in the Euro and Global WordNet projects they still only cover a relatively small number of languages.",
        "In this paper we describe the application of our data-driven approach to QA which was developed right from the outset with the aim of portability and robustness in mind.",
        "This statistical pattern classification approach to QA is essentially language independent and trainable given appropriate language-specific training data.",
        "No assumptions about the language are made by the model except that some notion of words or space-separated tokens must exist or be introduced where it is absent.",
        "Our only other requirements to build a QA system in a new target language are: a large collection of text data in the target language that can be searched for answers (e.g. the web), and a list of example questions-and-answers (q-and-a) in the target language.",
        "Given these data sources the remaining components can be obtained automatically for each language.",
        "So, in contrast to other contemporary approaches to QA our English language system does not use WordNet as in (Hovy et al., 2001; Moldovan et al., 2002), NE extraction, or any other linguistic information e.g. from semantic analysis (Hovy et al., 2001) or from question parsing (Hovy et al., 2001; Moldovan et al., 2002) and uses capitalised (where appropriate for the language) word tokens as the only features for mod",
        "elling.",
        "For our Japanese system, although we currently use Chasen to segment Japanese character sequences into units that resemble words, we make no use of any morphological information as used for example in (Fuchigami et al., 2004).",
        "Moreover, it should be noted that our approach is at the same time very different to other purely web-based approaches such as askMSR (Brill et al., 2002) and Aranea (Lin et al., 2002).",
        "For example, we use entire documents rather than the snippets of text returned by web search engines; we do not use structured document sources or databases and we do not transform the query in any way either by term reordering or by modifying the tense of verbs.",
        "These basic principles apply to each of our language-specific QA systems thus simplifying and accelerating development.",
        "The approach to QA that we adopt has previously been described in (Whittaker et al., 2005a; Whittaker et al., 2005b; Whittaker et al., 2005c) where the details of the mathematical model and how it was trained for English and Japanese were given.",
        "Our approach has also been successfully evaluated in the text retrieval conference (TREC) 2005 QA track evaluation (Voorhees, 2003) where our group placed eleventh out of thirty participants (Whittaker et al., 2005a).",
        "Although the TREC QA task is substantially different to web-based QA the TREC evaluation confirmed that our approach works and also provides an objective assessment of its quality.",
        "Similarly, for our Japanese language system we have previously evaluated the performance of our approach on the NTCIR-3 QAC-1 task (Whittaker et al., 2005c).",
        "Although our Japanese experiments were applied retrospectively, the results would have placed us in the midrange of participating systems in that year’s evaluation.",
        "In this paper we present additional experiments on Chinese and Swedish and explain how our statistical pattern classification approach to QA was successfully applied to these two new languages.",
        "Using our approach and given appropriate training data it is found that a reasonably proficient developer can build a QA system in a new language in around 10 hours.",
        "Evaluation of the Chinese and Swedish systems is performed using a translation of the first 200 factoid questions from the TREC 2003 evaluation which we have also made available online.",
        "We compare these results both qualitatively and quantitatively against results obtained previously for English and Japanese.",
        "The systems, built using this method, form the basis of our multi-language web demo which is publicly available at http://asked.jp.",
        "An outline of the remainder of this paper is as follows: we briefly describe our statistical pattern classification approach to QA in Section 2 repeating the important elements of our approach as necessary to understand the remainder of the paper.",
        "In Section 3 we describe the basic building blocks of our QA system and how they can typically be trained.",
        "We also give a breakdown of the data used to train each language specific QA system.",
        "In Section 4 we present the results of experiments on Chinese, Swedish, English and Japanese and in Section 5 we compare and analyse these results.",
        "We wrap up with a conclusion and further work in Sections 6 and 7."

        "In general, there are many valid and equiprobable A for a given W so this component can only re-rank candidate answers retrieved by the retrieval model.",

        "Suppose, for example, that the top-scoring example question in our set is “Who was the U.S. President who resigned as a result of the Watergate affair?” since the first six words in each question match each other and will likely result in a high probability being assigned.",

        "This was reduced to 50% for correct answers occuring the threshold number of 5 times or more.",
        "Clearly a more linguistics-based system suffers less from this lack of redundancy but as pointed out earlier the problem is simply transferred to the development stage instead, where the initial data or linguistic knowledge needed to train a system might well be lacking."

        "In this paper we have shown that usable performance from two prototype QA systems developed",
        "for Chinese and Swedish could be obtained in a matter of hours using our data-driven approach to question answering.",
        "While the performance of such systems was found to be below that of more developed systems that used the same approach we feel that this demonstrates the effectiveness of our language independent approach for web-based QA.",
        "One of the interesting observations from our experiments is the inherent difficulty of finding answers to questions when there is very little data available in the target language in which to search for answers.",
        "While one could argue that someone in Sweden or China may not be interested in finding out the winning team of the 1996 World Series this clearly misses the point and instead makes a compelling argument for cross-language QA (CLQA) whose profile has been steadily increasing due to the recent CLEF and NTCIR evaluations.",
        "While most attempts at CLQA have so far concentrated on translating the query into English and performing monolingual English QA on the translated query, we feel that an approach that also combines a simple system trained in the manner described in this paper would almost certainly benefit overall performance."

        "In the future we aim to improve the Chinese and Swedish systems by increasing the amount and quality of data used for training and also the data used for searching for answers as well as solving the explosion in memory usage that occurred with large amounts of Chinese text.",
        "We also intend to optimise the system parameters for each system using the questions and answers used for training with a rotating form of cross-validation so as to maximise use of the little data we have available.",
        "Given the rapid development time and reasonable performance of the approach outlined in this paper combined with the fact that specialized linguistic knowledge is unnecessary we also plan the development of yet more monolingual systems in other languages and hope to participate in the upcoming CLEF QA track."
