        "Question Answering (QA) is the task of, given a query expressed in Natural Language (NL), retrieving its correct answer (a single item, a text snippet,...).",
        "QA has become a popular task in the NL Processing (NLP) research community in the framework of different international ODQA evaluation contests such as: Text Retrieval Conference (TREC) for English, Cross-Lingual Evaluation Forum (CLEF) for European languages, and NTCIR for Asian languages.",
        "In this paper we describe our experiments in the adaptation and evaluation of an ODQA system to a Restricted Domain, the Geographical Domain.",
        "GeoTALP-QA is a multilingual Geographical Domain Question Answering (GDQA) system.",
        "This Restricted Domain Question Answering (RDQA) system has been built over an existing ODQA system, TALP-QA, a multilingual ODQA system that processes both factoid and definition questions (see (Ferr´es et al., 2005) and (Ferr´es et al., 2004)).",
        "The system was evaluated for Spanish and English in the context of our participation in the conferences TREC and CLEF in 2005 and has been adapted to a multilingual GDQA system for factoid questions.",
        "As pointed out in (Benamara, 2004), the Geographical Domain (GD) can be considered a middle way between real Restricted Domains and open ones because many open domain texts contain a high density of geographical terms.",
        "Although the basic architecture of TALP-QA has remained unchanged, a set of QA components were redesigned and modified and we had to add some specific components for the GD to our QA system.",
        "The basic approach in TALP-QA consists of applying language-dependent processes on both question and passages for getting a language independent semantic representation, and then extracting a set of Semantic Constraints (SC) for each question.",
        "Then, an answer extraction algorithm extracts and ranks sentences that satisfy the SCs of the question.",
        "Finally, an answer selection module chooses the most appropriate answer.",
        "We outline below the organization of the paper.",
        "In the next section we present some characteristics of RDQA systems.",
        "In Section 3, we present",
        "the overall architecture of GeoTALP-QA and describe briefly its main components, focusing on those components that have been adapted from an ODQA to a GDQA.",
        "Then, the Scope-Based Resources needed for the experimentation and the experiments are presented in Sections 4 and 5.",
        "In section 6 we present the results obtained over a GD corpus.",

        "RDQAs present some characteristics that prevent us from a direct use of ODQA systems.",
        "The most important differences are:",
        "• Usually, for RDQA, the answers are searched in relatively small domain specific collections, so methods based on exploiting the redundancy of answers in several documents are not useful.",
        "Furthermore, a highly accurate Passage Retrieval module is required because frequently the answer occurs in a very small set of passages.",
        "• RDQAs are frequently task-based.",
        "So, the repertory of question patterns is limited allowing a good accuracy in Question Processing with limited effort.",
        "• User requirements regarding the quality of the answer tend to be higher in RDQA.",
        "As (Chung et al., 2004) pointed out, no answer is preferred to a wrong answer.",
        "• In RDQA not only NEs but also domain specific terminology plays a central role.",
        "This fact usually implies that domain specific lexicons and gazetteers have to be used.",
        "• In some cases, as in GD, many documents included in the collections are far to be standard NL texts but contain tables, lists, ill-formed sentences, etc.",
        "sometimes following a more or less defined structure.",
        "Thus, extraction systems based, as our, on the linguistic structure of the sentences have to be relaxed in some way to deal with this kind of texts.",
        "More information about RDQA systems can be found in the ACL 2004 Workshop on QA in Restricted Domains1 and the AAAI 2005 Worshop on Question Answering in Restricted Domains (Molla and Vicedo, 2005) ."

        "• Referent ambiguity problem.",
        "This problem occurs when the same name is used for several locations (of the same or different class).",
        "In a question, sometimes it is impossible to solve this ambiguity, and, in this case, we have to accept as correct all of the possible interpretations (or a superclass of them).",
        "Otherwise, a trigger phrase pattern can be used to resolve the ambiguity (e.g. ”Madrid” is an ambiguous NE, but in the phrase, ”comu-nidad de Madrid” (State of Madrid), ambiguity is solved).",

        "lem occurs when the same location can have more than one name (in Spanish texts this frequently occurs as many place names occur in languages other than Spanish, as Basque, Catalan or Galician).",
        "Our approach to solve this problem is to group together all the geographical names that refer to the same location.",
        "All the occurrences of the geographical NEs in both questions and passages are substituted by the identifier of the group they belong to.",
        "We used the geographical knowledge available in the GNS gazetteer to obtain this geographical NEs groups.",
        "First, for each place name in the scope-based GNS gazetteer we obtained all the NEs that have the same feature designation code, latitude and longitude.",
        "For each group, we then selected an identifier choosing one of the NE included in it using the following heuristics: the information of the GNS field ”native” tells if a place name is native, conventional, a variant, or, is not verified.",

        "This paper summarizes our experiments adapting an ODQA to the GD and its evaluation in Spanish in the scope of the Spanish Geography.",
        "Out of 62 questions, our system provided the correct answer to 39 questions in the experiment with the best results.",
        "Our Passage Retrieval for ODQA offers less attractive results when using the SW corpus.",
        "The problem of using SW to extract the answers is that it gives few documents with the correct answer, and, it is difficult to extract the answer because the documents contain tables, lists, ill-formed sentences, etc.",
        "Our ODQA AE needs a grammatically well-structured text to extract correctly the answers.",
        "The QA system offers a low performance (33% of accuracy) when using this AE over the web-based retrieved passages.",
        "In some cases, the snippets are cut and we could expect a better performance retrieving the whole documents from Google.",
        "On the other hand, web-based snippet retrieval, with only one query per question, gives good results in Passage Retrieval.",
        "The QA system with the Frequency-Based AE obtained better results than with the ODQA AE (62.9% of accuracy).",
        "Finally, we conclude that our approach with Geographical scope-based resources are notably helpful to deal with multilingual Geographical Domain Question Answering."

        "We also want to improve the retrieval by crawling relevant documents from web search-engines instead of using snippets.",
        "This could be a good method to find more sentences with supported answers.",
