        "We describe a method which uses one or more intermediary languages in order to automatically generate translation dictionaries.",
        "Such a method could potentially be used to efficiently create translation dictionaries for language groups which have as yet had little interaction.",
        "For any given word in the source language, our method involves first translating into the intermediary language(s), then into the target language, back into the intermediary language(s) and finally back into the source language.",
        "The relationship between a word and the number of possible translations in another language is most often 1-to-many, and so at each stage, the number of possible translations grows exponentially.",
        "If we arrive back at the same starting point i.e. the same word in the source language, then we hypothesise that the meanings of the words in the chain have not diverged significantly.",
        "Hence we backtrack through the link structure to the target language word and accept this as a suitable translation.",
        "We have tested our method by using English as an intermediary language to automatically generate a Spanish-to-German dictionary, and the results are encouraging."

        "In this paper we describe a method which uses one or more intermediary languages to automatically generate a dictionary to translate from one language, , to another, .",
        "The method relies on using dictionaries that can connect to and back to via the intermediary language(s), e.g. , , , , where is an intermediary language such as English.",
        "The resources required to exploit the method are not difficult to find since dictionaries already exist that translate between English and a vast number of other languages.",
        "Whereas at present the production of translation dictionaries is manual (e.g. (Serasset1994)), our method is automatic.",
        "We believe that projects such as (Boitet et al.2002) and (Wiktionary), which are currently generating translation dictionaries by hand could benefit greatly from using our method.",
        "Translation dictionaries are useful not only for end-user consumption but also for various multilingual tasks such as cross-language question answering (e.g. (Ahn et al.2004)) and information retrieval (e.g. (Argaw et al.2004)).",
        "We have applied our method to automatically generate a Spanish-to-German dictionary.",
        "We chose this language pair because we were able to find an online Spanish-to-German dictionary which could be used to evaluate our result.",
        "The structure of the paper is as follows.",
        "In section 2.",
        "1, we describe how if we translate a word from a source language into an intermediary language, and then into a target language, the number of possible translations may grow drastically.",
        "Some of these translations will be ‘better’ than others, and in section 2.2 we give a detailed description of our method for identifying these ‘better’ translations.",
        "Having identified the ‘better’ translations we can then automatically generate a dictionary that translates directly from the source to the target language.",
        "In section 3 we describe how we used our method to automatically generate a Spanish-to-German dictionary, and in section 3.3, we evaluate the result.",
        "Finally, in section 4, we conclude and suggest future work."
