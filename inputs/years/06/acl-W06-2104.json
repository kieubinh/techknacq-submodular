        "Spatial meaning is usually divided into locational and directional meaning.",
        "The former could be said to be less complex than the second, since directional meaning by definition implies a change in place (cf. Helmantel 1998; Jackendoff 1983).",
        "This difference in complexity is also reflected in the order of acquisition of spatial prepositions, as locatives are acquired before directionals (Bowerman and Choi 2001).",

        "As we want to pair meaning with form, let us look at the markedness of the form of Finnish adpositional phrases.",
        "In Finnish in general, there are more postpositions than prepositions.",
        "Postpositions combine more often with genitive case than with partitive (54 vs. 10, respectively).",
        "The prepositions have a small preference for partitive case (9 vs. 6).",
        "Also for spatial adpositions, genitive case is assigned most, as can be seen in (5) and (6):",
        "(5) Spatial adpositions assigning genitive case: al ‘under’, ede-/ete- ‘front’ jälke-/jälje‘after’ luo- ‘to’, ‘by’, pää- ‘on’, sisä ‘in’, ta(ka)‘back’, viere- ‘beside’.",
        "(6) Spatial adpositions assigning partitive case: koh- ‘towards’, pitkin ‘along’, ‘all over’, päin ‘against’, vast ‘against’, ‘in the opposite direction’.",
        "Assuming that the most frequent form is unmarked (cf. the frequency criterion), we can conclude that genitive case is the unmarked form for the complement of the PP in Finnish.3 Before analyzing the Finnish data in Section 5, I will first introduce Bidirectional OT, the framework I am using.",
        "3 Another motivation for genitive being the standard case, though not pursued here, is the origin of adpositions.",
        "Postpositions deriving from nouns, like pää < ‘head’, usually take genitive case.",
        "Optimality Theory is a model of the system of the linguistic knowledge a speaker of a language has (cf.",
        "Prince and Smolensky 1993).",
        "The rules in this grammar are violable constraints, which can be in conflict with each other.",
        "Weak constraints can be violated in order to satisfy stronger ones.",
        "Each language has its own specific hierarchy of constraints.",
        "In the Generator possible output candidates (forms in case of production, and meanings in case of perception) are formed, that are evaluated in the Evaluator.",
        "The candidate that has the least serious violations of the constraints is the winner.",
        "Bidirectional OT gives a general procedure of optimization of the relation of form and meaning, simultaneously optimizing in both directions, from meaning to form, and from form to meaning.",
        "Hence, BiOT evaluates form-meaning pairs (Blutner et al.",
        "to appear: 90-91).",
        "In bidirectional OT a form-meaning pair is called super-optimal if there is no other super-optimal form-meaning pair with a different (i.e. less marked) form that expresses the same meaning better, and there is no other super-optimal form-meaning pair with a different meaning that is a better interpretation of that same form.",
        "This yields two super-optimal form-meaning pairs, namely the unmarked form with the unmarked meaning, and the marked form with the marked meaning.",
        "The widely attested Markedness principle of Horn (1984) which states that marked forms in languages go with marked meanings (and unmarked forms with unmarked meanings) is thus accounted for by bidirectional OT.",
        "In section 2 we saw which properties of a PP are marked.",
        "An unmarked PP preferably expresses a simple, concrete, spatial meaning.",
        "Put into markedness constraints, we get: *COMPLEXITY: avoid semantic complexity BC (BE CONCRETE): have a concrete meaning In my analysis, simple directional meaning violates *Complexity once, whereas complex directional meaning yields a double violation.",
        "In section 3, genitive case was shown to be the most frequent, hence unmarked form.",

        "Now let us have a look at the Finnish data.",
        "The general distribution of spatial adpositions was given in (5) and (6) above.",
        "This general distribution seems to follow the opposition locative-directional: as ‘towards’, ‘along’, ‘against’ are directional and the others (roughly) locational.4 As illustrated in Tableau 1, directional meanings violate *Complexity, and partitive forms violate UG.5",
        "Since the form-meaning pair <gen, loc> is the only candidate that satisfies all constraints it is the first super-optimal pair.",
        "In a second round of optimization the pairs <gen, dir> and <part, loc> fall out, because there is another form-meaning pair, namely <gen, loc>, with either a less marked meaning that is expressed by the same form, or with a less marked form that expresses the same meaning.",
        "This yields the second super-optimal form-meaning pair, namely <part, dir> which combines the marked form with the marked meaning.",
        "The unmarked locational meaning corresponds to the unmarked genitive form, and the marked directional one to the marked partitive.",
        "Thus, the general distribution of Finnish adpositions is accounted for.",
        "But, as mentioned before, besides these two groups, Finnish has a third set of adpositions combining with both cases:",
        "(7) Adpositions taking both genitive and partitive case: ympäri- ‘around’, keske-‘middle’, lähe‘near’, yli(-) ‘over’.",
        "The meaning of such adpositions in combination with genitive case is different from that of a combination with partitive case.",
        "In what follows, I will give an account of the form-meaning pairs involving these adpositions.",
        "First, let us look at the alternation of ympäri ‘around’ shown in examples (1) and (2), repeated below for convenience.",
        "(1) juoks-i-mme ympäri kaupunki-a run-PAST-1PL around city-PART ‘We were running around in the city’ (2) juoks-i-mme kaupungi-n ympäri",
        "run-PAST-1PL city-GEN around ‘We ran around the city’ In (1) around indicates a complex, random path comparable to the Greek example (4b), schematized in (3d).",
        "In (2) however, around describes a circle with the city as its centre (cf. (3c)).",
        "The constraint on complexity is playing a role in this alternation, as is illustrated in Tableau 2:",
        "As expected, the genitive case has the unmarked simple meaning, whereas the partitive case combines with the complex one.",
        "Simple directional meaning violates *Complexity once, as it is one step more complex than locational meaning; complex directional meaning yields a double violation.",
        "The alternation of keskellä ‘in the middle’ can be explained along the same lines.",
        "Again, genitive case combines with the unmarked meaning in (9), whereas the partitive is assigned the marked notion ‘all over’ in (8): (8) lelu-t o-vat",
        "‘The toys are in the middle of the floor’ (lit.",
        "at the centre) The third adposition to deal with is lähellä ‘near’.",
        "For the previous adpositions we saw that the case alternation was only used for an extended meaning.",
        "Rather unexpectedly, for lähellä partitive case is also possible within the simple spatial domain, as shown in (10).6",
        "As soon as the concreteness constraint BC becomes of importance, however, partitive case is used, as is clear from (11): (11) ole-mme lähellä ratkaisu-a be.PRES-1PL near solution-PART ‘We are close to a solution’ In this example, the constraint BC comes into play.",
        "The abstract meaning combines with partitive case, whereas the concrete one can have both cases.",
        "This is shown in the following tableau, in which the unpredicted pair is indicated with a question mark:",
        "Finally, let us turn to yli ‘over’.",
        "The preposition over has extensively been studied for English (cf. Lakoff 1987; Brugman 1988; Dewell 1994).",
        "The more central meanings are the locative ‘be in the space above something’ and ‘be on the other side of something’, and the directional ‘starting from one side of something, go to the other side via the covering space’ and ‘starting from one side of something, go to the other side via its (top) surface’.",
        "The reading ‘to exceed something’ that ‘over’ also has, is further removed from the central meaning.",
        "In Finnish we see that the more central notions are covered by the genitive case, as is shown in (12) and (13):",
        "Only within the extended ‘Excess’ meaning, the partitive case can occur, as can be seen in (14):",
        "on yli 2500 euro-a be.3SG.PRES over 2500 euro-PART ‘The price of this car is higher than 2500 Euro’ It is still possible to use genitive case here, but the 2500 Euro is pragmatically different for both constructions.",
        "With partitive case, it is an arbitrary amount, whereas it is precisely the amount I intended to spend on the car with the genitive.",
        "Here, the prominence of the amount makes it more concrete."
