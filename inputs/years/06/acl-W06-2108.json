        "It is difficult to give a comprehensive definition of what instrumentality is.",
        "In WordNet it is defined as ’an artifact, or a set of artifacts, that are instrumental (i.e. behave as instruments) in accomplishing some end’, i.e. reaching a certain goal.",
        "In this definition, the triple relation agent-instrument-goal (as in: John cuts the bread with a knife, where John is agent, knife is instrument that does the cutting, and bread cut is the goal), is left vague in what concerns the exact involvement of the agent and the instrument in the action, and the control the agent has on the instrument and on the action (Mari and St-Dizier 01).",
        "If almost anything can be an instrument, we can nevertheless formulate a few criteria that we will try to elaborate in this paper.",
        "First, an instrument is basically non volitional.",
        "When humans play the role of instruments, they are obviously volitional, but the action is controlled by another agent who acts as an ’initiator agent’, taking the initiative of the action.",
        "Instruments cannot be easily associated with traditional thematic roles, in fact this is not of much interest, because this is too superficial a notion and also because instruments are generally modifiers, not arguments.",
        "In this paper, we address instrumentality as conveyed by prepositions or equivalent means (e.g. postpositions, affixes).",
        "Our aim in this study is twofold: (1) to identify the conceptual facets of instrumentality so that a conceptual semantics can be defined in the spirit of (Talmy, 01, 03), (Wierzbicka 92, 96) and (2) to elaborate an accurate enough model for answering questions about instruments within a cooperative question-answering system.",
        "Instead of focusing on a specific language to elaborate all possible forms of instrumentality, we found it more adequate to develop a multilingual approach, considering languages from various families.",
        "We consider for Europe: German, Spanish, French, Italian; for India: Kashmiri, Urdu, Hindi and Bengali; for the far-east: Thai and Malay; for Northern Africa and the Middle East: Arabic, and Berber dialects (in the group of Amazigh languages).",
        "In this paper, we use the first letter of each language to identify it: Thai, Malay, Hindi, Urdu, Kashmiri, Bengali, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Arabic, BeRber).",
        "We have also more or less adequately transcribed characters into latin characters.",
        "The upper case A is equivalent to aa."
