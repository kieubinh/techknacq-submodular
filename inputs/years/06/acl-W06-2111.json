        "(3) Laura will stay in Ohio for two months.",
        "(4) Silvia has lived in Paris for three years.",
        "The adjuncts in (1) and (3) unambiguously specify the duration of Maria’s activity of playing the piano and of Laura’s stay in Ohio.",
        "The adjunct in (4), however, triggers an ambiguity: it can denote any three-year period in the past in which the state of Silvia’s living in Paris held, but it can also denote a period which started three years ago and which includes the time of utterance (Kamp and Reyle, 1993, 567).",
        "The relevance of this distinction is clear from the fact that there are languages which use different prepositions for both interpretations.",
        "Italian, for instance, employs the preposition per in the translation of (1), (3) and the first interpretation of (4), whereas it employs da in the translation of the second interpretation of (4).",

        "(6) Laura stara per due mesi nell’Ohio.",
        "(7) Silvia ha abitato per tre anni a Parigi.",
        "(8) Silvia abita a Parigi da tre anni.",
        "For ease of reference I will call the adjuncts in (1), (3), (4a), (5), (6) and (7) floating: they denote a stretch of time whose position on the time line is not defined.",
        "The adjuncts in (4b) and (8), by contrast, will be called anchored, since their position on the time line is fixed: their right boundary is supplied by the time of utterance.",
        "As illustrated in (9-10), the right boundary can also be supplied by a temporal adjunct, such as a PP[a] or a subordinate S[quando].",
        "(9) A quel punto Silvia abitava da treat that point Silvia lived for three anni a Parigi.",

        "In (2) and (11) the PP[in] adjuncts are unambiguously floating, but (12) is ambiguous: it can either mean that it will take Leo one hour to tune your piano or that he will start the activity of tuning your piano in an hour from now.",
        "In the first interpretation, the adjunct is floating, as in (2) and (11), but in the second one it is anchored: the beginning of the hour which will pass before Leo starts tuning the piano is supplied by the time of utterance.",
        "The relevance of the distinction is, again, brought out by the Italian equivalents.",

        "At the same time, it is also relevant for Natural Language Understanding, since it bears on the issue of scope.",

        "Since the adjuncts of duration are modifiers rather than arguments, they are not selected by their head sister.",
        "Instead, it is the head which is selected by the adjunct.",
        "Phrased in terms of the HPSG notation, a PP adjunct has a SELECT feature whose",
        "value spells out the syntactic and semantic properties of its head sister.2",
        "Since the SELECT feature is part of the HEAD value, it is shared between the PP and the preposition.",
        "From this it follows that prepositions which introduce an adjunct can impose constraints on the SYNSEM value of the phrase which the adjunct modifies.",
        "Exploiting this possibility we can capture the syntactic properties of the prepositions which introduce a durational adjunct in terms of the following AVM.3 In words, the prepositions which introduce a durational adjunct take an NP complement and project a PP which modifies a VP.",
        "Besides these properties, which they share with many other types of PP adjuncts, there is the more specific requirement that the NP complement must denote an amount of time.",
        "This is modeled in terms of its MARK(ING) and its CONTENT values.",
        "Starting with the latter and employing the semantic ontology of (Ginzburg and Sag, 2000), in which the CONTENT value of a nominal is an object of type scope-object, the relevant constraint can be defined as follows:",
        "In words, the index of the complement must be the argument of a predicate of type t-unit-rel.",
        "This is one of the intermediate types in the hierarchy of relations.",
        "Its subtypes are the predicates which express temporal units.",
        "The defining property of temporal units is that they succeed one another without interruption.",
        "A day, for instance, is a temporal unit, since it is immediately followed by another day, but a Friday is not, since it is not immediately followed by another Friday.",
        "The relevance of this distinction is illustrated by the fact that for a day and in ten minutes can be adjuncts of duration, whereas for Friday and in April cannot.",
        "Whether a PP[for/in] can be used as an adjunct of duration is not only determined by the semantic class of the noun, but also by the prenominals: for every day and in that month, for instance, cannot be used as adjuncts of duration.",
        "This is captured by the constraint that the NP must be indefinite, rather than universal or determinate.",
        "Evidence for making this threefold distinction and for modeling it in terms of the MARKING values is provided in (Van Eynde, 2005).4 A crucial factor in the semantic analysis of the durational adjuncts is their contribution to the meaning of the VP: the amount of time which is denoted by their NP daughter must somehow be related to the semantic properties of the VPs which they modify.",
        "To spell this out we first need a format for the semantic analysis of verbal objects.",
        "4If the NP is determinate, as in for the lastfive years, for the whole morning and da lunedi ‘since Monday’, it does not denote an amount of time, but an interval or an instant.",
        "Such PPs have meanings which resemble those of the durational adjuncts, but their contribution to the semantics of the VP is nonetheless different."

        "To model the semantic properties of verbal projections I extend the semantic ontology of (Ginzburg and Sag, 2000) with times and temporal objects.",
        "The temporal objects belong to a subtype of scope-object and, hence, have an index and a set of restrictions on that index.",
        "Besides, they have a TIMES attribute, which takes a list of times as its value.",
        "The objects of type time denote temporal entities and come in two kinds: instants and intervals.",
        "This distinction does not concern any inherent properties of the temporal entities, but rather their mode of individuation.",
        "The objects of type interval have a beginning, an end and a duration.",
        "Since the value of the EXTENT feature is of type scope-obj it can be identified with the amount of time which is expressed in an adjunct of duration.",
        "Of the various times which figure in the list of a temporal object, the rightmost one has a special role, since it is the one which is linked to the index of the verb.",
        "For ease of reference I will call it the V-time.",
        "The verb’s index ( ) is comparable to a David-sonian event variable, but has a slightly different role.",
        "It is, for instance, not only assigned to verbs and VPs which denote an event, but to all verbal projections, including the stative ones.",
        "The index is invariably the first argument of the relation which the verb denotes, as in greet-rel (i, x, y), and is linked to the V-time by means of the loc-rel relation.",
        "The function of this relation is to link the denotation of the V(P) to the time at which it holds.",
        "It is comparable to the overlap relation, familiar from Discourse Representation Theory: t. Since the temporal objects belong to a subtype of scope-obj, it follows that their indices are of the same type as those of the nominal objects.",
        "Given the ontology of (Ginzburg and Sag, 2000), this implies that they contain features for person, number and gender.5",
        "The presence of these features in the CONTENT values of verbs may, at first, seem awkward, since they model properties which are typical of N(P)s. A form like greets, for instance, requires its NP subject to have a third person singular index, but does not have a third person singular index of its own, as argued in (Pollard and Sag, 1994, 82).",
        "Looking closer, though, the assignment of these features to verbs does have a number of advantages.",
        "One is that it accounts for the agreement in clauses with a verbal subject.",
        "(28) Forging banknotes is/*are/*am not easy.",
        "(29) To make mistakes is/*are/*am human.",
        "Since the form is requires a subject with a third person singular index, it follows that the nonfinite VPs in (28) and (29) have a third person singular index, and since phrases share their index with their head daughter, this implies in turn that the verbs forging and make have a third person singular index.6 To avoid misunderstanding, it is worth stressing that this does not mean that they require a third person singular subject, but rather that they",
        "themselves are third person singular.",
        "This distinction is especially relevant for the finite verbs, as illustrated by (30) and (31).",
        "(30) That he/she snores is/*are/*am annoying.",
        "(31) That I/they snore is/*are/*am annoying.",
        "Also here the subjects are required to have a third person singular index, and since they are clauses which are headed by a finite verb, it follows that the finite verbs have a third person singular index.",
        "Moreover, this index is different from the one of their subject.",
        "Snore in (31), for instance, has a third person singular index, but requires its subject to have an index which is plural or non-third person.",
        "In sum, one advantage of the assignment of a third person singular index to verbs is that it accounts in a straightforward manner for the agreement data in (28-31).",
        "Another advantage is that the indices provide a way to capture the distinction between the aspectual classes (Aktionsarten).",
        "To see this, let us first revisit the role of the indices in nominal objects.",
        "As argued in (Pollard and Sag, 1994), the indices are not only useful to model agreement between a finite verb and its subject, or between an anaphoric pronoun and its antecedent, but also between a determiner and its nominal head.",
        "The demonstrative these, for instance, requires a nominal with a plural index, whereas this requires a nominal with a singular index.",
        "A similar constraint holds for the combination of a quantifying determiner and its head.",
        "While every and a require their nominal head to be singular and count, much requires it to be singular and mass: every/a/*much table vs. much/*every/*a traffic.",
        "Despite the obvious similarity with the constraints for the demonstrative determiners, they cannot be modeled in terms of the indices of (Pollard and Sag, 1994), since their indices do not contain any information about the mass/count distinction.",
        "A natural move, therefore, is to redefine the indices in such a way that this distinction can be integrated.",
        "Independent evidence for this move is provided by the fact that the mass/count distinction concerns the mode of individuation of the referent(s) of the nominal, rather than an inherent property of the referent(s), see footnote 5.",
        "Another piece of evidence is the fact that the mass/count distinction closely interacts with the NUMBER distinction: most of the relevant constraints simultaneously concern a number and a mass/count value.",
        "To model this I add a COUNTABILITY feature to the objects of type number, adopting a proposal of (Van Eynde, 2005).",
        "In terms of this dichotomy the count nouns have bounded indices, whereas the mass nouns have unbounded indices.",
        "Nouns which are used either way, such as glass, have the underspecified value in their lexical entry; this can be resolved by the addition of a determiner, as in a glass or much glass.",
        "Returning now to the verbs, it automatically follows from the presence of an index in their CONTENT values that they also have a COUNTABILITY feature.",
        "This is an advantage, since it provides us with the means to spell out the similarities between the count/mass distinction for nominals and the Aktionsart distinction for verbal projections.",
        "The states and processes, for instance, share the property of the mass nouns that their denotation is unbounded, whereas the accomplishments and the achievements share the property of the count nouns that their denotation is bounded (Bach, 1986).",
        "Exploiting the potential of this extended role of the indices I introduce a distinction between two types of temporal objects.",
        "The bounded ones have an index of type bounded and are subsumed by the following constraint: In words, the index of a bounded temporal object is temporally included in the V-time.",
        "Since inclusion is a special type of overlap, this is a more constrained version of (26).",
        "It corresponds to DRT’s ‘e t’.",
        "The unbounded temporal objects obviously have an index of type unbounded, but the relation",
        "of this index to the corresponding time is not subject to any further constraints; it is subsumed by the generic loc-rel.",
        "With the introduction of times, temporal objects and the boundedness distinction we have paved the way for a more detailed analysis of the various types of durational adjuncts."
