        "Ravichandran and Hovy (2002) present a method to automatically learn surface text patterns expressing relations between instances of classes using a search engine.",
        "Their method, based on a training set, identi£es natural language surface text patterns that express some relation between two instances.",
        "For example, “was born in” proved to be a precise pattern expressing the relation between instances Mozart (of class ‘person’) and 1756 (of class ‘year’).",
        "We address the issue of learning surface text patterns, since we observed two drawbacks of Ravichandran and Hovy’s work with respect to the application of such patterns in a general information extraction setting.",
        "The £rst drawback is that Ravichandran and Hovy focus on the use of such surface text patterns to answer so-called factoid questions (Voorhees, 2004).",
        "They use the assumption that each instance is related by R to exactly one other instance of some class.",
        "In a general information extraction setting, we cannot assume that all relations are functional.",
        "The second drawback is that the criterion for selecting patterns, precision, is not the only issue for a pattern to be effective.",
        "We call a pattern effective, if it links many different instance-pairs in the excerpts found with a search engine.",
        "We use an ontology to model the information domain we are interested in.",
        "Our goal is to populate an ontology with the information extracted.",
        "In an ontology, instances of one class can be related by some relation R to multiple instances of some other class.",
        "For example, we can identify the classes ‘movie’ and ‘actor’ and the ‘acts in’-relation, which is a many-to-many relation.",
        "In general, multiple actors star in a single movie and a single actor stars in multiple movies.",
        "In this paper we present a domain-independent method to learn effective surface text patterns representing relations.",
        "Since not all patterns found are highly usable, we formulate criteria to select the most effective ones.",
        "We show how such patterns can be used to populate an ontology.",
        "The identi£cation of effective patterns is important, since we want to perform as few queries to a search engine as possible to limit the use of its services.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "After de£n-ing the problem (Section 2) and discussing related work (Section 3), we present an algorithm to learn effective surface text patterns in Section 4.",
        "We discuss the application of this method in an ontology population algorithm in Section 5.",

        "Moreover, we consider some relation R between these classes and give a non-empty training set of instance-pairs TI, = {(x, y) I x E IQ n y E Ia}, which are instance-pairs that are known to be R-related.",
        "Problem: Given the classes cQ and ca, the sets of instances IQ and Ia, a relation R and a set of R-related instance-pairs TI,, learn effective surface text patterns that express the relation R. Say, for example, we consider the classes ‘author’ and ‘book title’ and the relation ‘has written’.",
        "We assume that we know some related instance-pairs , e.g. (‘Leo Tolstoy’, ‘War and Peace’) and (‘G¨unter Grass’, ‘Die Blechtrommel’).",
        "We then want to £nd natural language phrases that relate authors to the titles of the books they wrote.",
        "Thus, if we query a pattern in combination with the name of an author (e.g. ‘Umberto Eco wrote’), we want the search results of this query to contain the books by this author.",
        "The population of an ontology can be seen as a generalization of a question-answering setting.",
        "Unlike question-answering, we are interested in £nding all possible instance-pairs, not only the pairs with one £xed instance (e.g. all ‘author’-‘book’ pairs instead of only the pairs containing a £xed author).",
        "Functional relations in an ontology correspond to factoid questions, e.g. the population of the classes ‘person’ and ‘country’ and the ‘was born in’-relation.",
        "Non-functional relations can be used to identify answers to list questions, for example “name all books written by Louis-Ferdinand C´eline” or “which countries border Germany?”."

        "The algorithm performs well with respect to recall of the instances found: many big international restaurant branches were found.",
