        "Training material is always an issue when applying machine learning to deal with information extraction tasks.",
        "It is generally accepted that increasing the amount of training data used improves performance.",
        "However, training material comes at a cost, since it requires annotation.",
        "As a consequence, when adapting existing methods and techniques to a new domain, researchers and users are faced with the problem of absence of annotated material that could be used for training.",
        "A good example is the biomedical domain, which has attracted the attention of the NLP community relatively recently (Kim et al., 2004).",
        "Even though there are plenty of biomedical texts, very little of it is annotated, such as the GENIA corpus (Kim et al., 2003).",
        "A very popular and well investigated framework in order to cope with the lack of training material is the active learning framework (Cohn et al., 1995; Seung et al., 1992).",
        "It has been applied to various NLP/IE tasks, including named entity recognition (Shen et al., 2004) and parse selection (Baldridge and Osborne, 2004) with rather impressive results in reducing the amount of annotated training data.",
        "However, some criticism of active learning has been expressed recently, concerning the reusability of the data (Baldridge and Osborne, 2004).",
        "This paper presents a framework in order to deal with the lack of training data for NLP tasks.",
        "The intuition behind it is that annotated training data is produced by applying an (imperfect) unsupervised method, and then the errors inserted in the annotation are detected automatically and reannotated by a human annotator.",
        "The main difference compared to active learning is that instead of selecting unlabeled instances for annotation, possible erroneous instances are selected for checking and correction if they are indeed erroneous.",
        "We will refer to this framework as “active annotation” in the rest of the paper.",
        "The structure of this paper is as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we describe the software and the dataset used.",
        "Section 3 explores the effect of errors in the training data and motivates the active annotation framework.",
        "In Section 4 we describe the framework in detail, while Section 5 presents a method for estimating uncertainty for HMMs.",
        "Section 6 presents results from applying the active annotation.",
        "Section 7 compares the proposed framework to active learning and Section 8 attempts an analysis of its performance.",

        "The kind of noise we expect is mislabelled instances.",
        "In order to simulate the behavior of a hypothetical unsupervised method, we corrupted the training data artificially using the following models:",
        "• LowRecall: Change tokens labelled as entities to nonentities.",

        "It can be viewed alternatively as a random tagger which labels the data with some accuracy.",
        "The level of noise inserted is adjusted by specifying the probability with which a candidate label is changed.",
        "In all the experiments in this paper, for a particular model and level of noise, the corruption of the dataset was repeated five times in order to produce more reliable results.",
        "In practice, the behavior of an unsupervised method is likely to be a mixture of the above models.",
        "However, given that the method would tag the data with a certain performance, we attempted through our experiments to identify which of these (extreme) behaviors would be less harmful.",
        "In Figure 1, we present graphs showing the effect of noise inserted with the above models.",
        "The experimental procedure was to add noise to the training data according to a model, evaluate the performance of the hypothetical tagger that produced it, train Lingpipe on the noisy training data and evaluate the performance of the latter on the test data.",
        "The process was repeated for various levels of noise.",
        "In the top graph, the F-score achieved by Lingpipe (F-ling) is plotted against the F-score of",
        "the hypothetical tagger (F-tag), while in the bottom graph the F-score achieved by Lingpipe (F-ling) is plotted against the number of erroneous classifications made by the hypothetical tagger.",
        "A first observation is that limited noise does not affect the performance significantly, a phenomenon that can be attributed to the capacity of the machine learning method to deal with noise.",
        "From the point of view of correcting mistakes in the training data this suggests that not all mistakes need to be corrected.",
        "Another observation is that while the performance for all the models follow similar curves when plotted against the F-score of the hypothetical tagger, the same does not hold when plotted against the number of errors.",
        "While this can be attributed to the unbalanced nature of the task (very few entity tokens compared to non-entities), it also suggests that the raw number of errors in the training data is not a good indicator for the performance obtained by training on it.",

        "The first is to measure the reduction in the checked instances needed in order to achieve a certain level of performance.",

        "paradigm, a baseline for active annotation is random selection of instances to be checked.",

        "One option is to use an unsupervised learning algorithm, such the one presented by Collins & Singer (1999), where a seed set of rules is used to bootstrap a rule-based named entity recognizer.",
        "A different approach could be the use of a dictionary-based tagger, as in Morgan et al.",
        "(2003).",
        "It must be noted that the unsupervised method used to provide the initial tagging does not need to generalize to any data (a common problem for such methods), it only needs to perform well on the data used during active annotation.",
        "Generalization on unseen data is an attribute we hope that the supervised learning method s will have after training on the annotated material created with active annotation.",
        "The query module q is also different from the corresponding module in active learning.",
        "Instead of selecting unlabeled informative instances to be annotated and added to the training data, its purpose is to identify likely errors in the imperfectly labelled training data, so that they are checked and corrected by the human annotator.",
        "In order to perform error-detection, we chose to adapt the approach of Nakagawa and Matsumoto (2002) which resembles uncertainty based sampling for active learning.",
        "According to their paradigm, likely errors in the training data are instances that are “hard” for the classifier and inconsistent with the rest of the data.",
        "In our case, we used the uncertainty of the classifier as the measure of the “hardness” of an instance.",
        "As an indication of inconsistency, we used the disagreement of the label assigned by the classifier with the current label of the instance.",
        "Intuitively, if the classifier disagrees with the label of an instance used in its training, it indicates that there have been other similar instances in the training data that were labelled differently.",
        "Returning to the description of active annotation, the query module q ranks the instances in L first by their inconsistency and then by decreasing uncertainty of the classifier.",
        "As a result, instances that are inconsistent with the rest of the data and hard for the classifier are selected first, then those that are inconsistent but easy for the classifier, then the consistent ones but hard for the classifier and finally the consistent and easy ones.",
        "While this method of detecting errors resembles uncertainty sampling, there are other approaches that could have been used instead and they can be very different.",

        "Dickinson and Meuers (2003) proposed methods based on n-grams occurring with different labellings in the corpus.",
        "Therefore, while it is reasonable to expect some correlation between the selections of active annotation and active learning (hard instances are likely to be erroneously annotated by the unsupervised tagger), the task of selecting hard instances is quite different from detecting errors.",
        "The use of the disagreement between taggers for selecting candidates for manual correction is reminiscent of corrected co-training (Pierce and Cardie, 2001).",

        "The resulting distribution from Equation 3 cannot be compared across different token sequences.",
        "However, for the purpose of computing the uncertainty over a fixed token sequence it is a reasonable approximation.",
        "One way to estimate the uncertainty of the classifier is to calculate the conditional entropy of this distribution.",

        "In our case, X is l[n] and Y is l[n – 1] .",

        "The probabilities for each tag (needed for P(l[n – 1])) are not calculated directly from the model.",
        "P(l[n]) corresponds to P(l[n]It[n],t[n – 1],t[n – 2]), but since we are considering a fixed token sequence, we approximate its distribution using the conditional probability P(l [n] It[n], l [n – 1],t[n – 1],t[n – 2]), by marginalizing over l[n – 1] .",
        "Again, it must be noted that the above calculations are to be used in estimating uncertainty over a single word.",
        "One property of the conditional entropy is that it estimates the uncertainty of the predictions for the current label given knowledge of the previous tag, which is important in our application because we need the uncertainty over each label independently from the rest of the sequence.",
        "This is confirmed by the theory, from which we know that for a conditional distribution of X given Y the following equation holds, H[X IY] = H[X, Y] – H[Y], where H denotes the entropy.",
        "A different way of obtaining uncertainty estimations from HMMs in the framework of active learning has been presented in (Scheffer et al., 2001).",
        "There, the uncertainty is estimated by the margin between the two most likely predictions that would result in a different current label, explicitly:",
        "Intuitively, the margin M is the difference between the two highest scored predictions that disagree.",
        "The lower the margin, the higher the uncertainty of the HMM on the token at question.",
