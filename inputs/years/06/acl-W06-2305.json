        "Traditionally, broad coverage has always been considered to be a desirable property of a grammar: the more linguistic phenomena are treated properly by the grammar, the better results can be expected when applying it to unrestricted text (c.f.",
        "(Grover et al., 1993; Doran et al., 1994)).",
        "With the advent of empirical methods and the corresponding evaluation metrics, however, this view changed considerably.",
        "(Abney, 1996) was among the first who noted that the relationship between coverage and statistical parsing quality is a more complex one.",
        "Adding new rules to the grammar, i.e. increasing its coverage, does not only allow the parser to deal with more phenomena, hence more sentences; at the same time it opens up new possibilities for abusing the newly introduced rules to mis-analyse constructions which were already treated properly before.",
        "As a consequence, a net reduction in parsing quality might be observed for simple statistical reasons, since the gain usually is obtained for relatively rare phenomena, while the adverse effects might well affect frequent ones.",
        "(Abney, 1996) uses this observation to argue in favour of stochastic models which attempt to choose the optimal structural interpretation instead of only providing a list of equally probable alternatives.",
        "However, using such an optimization procedure is not necessarily a sufficient precondition to completely rule out the effect.",
        "Compared to traditional handwritten grammars, successful stochastic models like (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000) open up an even greater space of alternatives for the parser and accordingly offer a great deal of opportunities to construct odd structural descriptions from them.",
        "Whether the guidance of the stochastic model can really prevent the parser from making use of these unwanted opportunities so far remains unclear.",
        "In the following we make a first attempt to quantify the consequences that different degrees of coverage have for the output quality of a wide-coverage parser.",
        "For this purpose we use a Weighted Constraint Dependency Grammar (WCDG), which covers even relatively rare syntactic phenomena of German and performs reliably across a wide variety of different text genres (Foth et al., 2005).",
        "By combining handwritten rules with an optimization procedure for hypothesis selection, such a parser makes it possible to successively exclude certain rare phenomena from the coverage of the grammar and to study the impact of these modifications on its output quality 2 Some rare phenomena of German What are good candidates of ‘rare’ phenomena that might be intentionally removed from the coverage of our grammar?",
        "One possibility is to remove coverage for constructions that are already slightly dispreferred.",
        "For instance, apposition and coordination of noun phrases often violate the principle of projectivity: “I got a sled for Christmas, a parrot and a motor-bike.” This is quite a common construction, but still ‘rare’ in the sense that the great majority of appositions does respect projectivity, so that the example seems at least slightly unusual.",
        "But there are also syntactic relations that are quite rare but nevertheless appear perfectly normal when they do occur, such as direct appellations: “James, please open the door.” This might be because their frequency varies considerably between text types; everyone is familiar with personal appellation from everyday conversation, but it would be surprising to hear it from the mouth of a television news reader.",
        "Finally, some constructions form variants e.g. by omitting certain words: “I bought a new broom [in order] to clean the drive",
        "way.” Here the longer variant is unambiguously a subclause expressing purpose, while the shorter might be mistaken for a prepositional phrase, so it could be regarded as misleading for the parser.",
        "The selection is necessarily subjective, not only because the delimitation of a phenomenon is subjective (are all kinds of ellipsis fundamentally the same phenomenon or not?)",
        "but also because we can remove only those phenomena that are already covered in the first place.",
        "Therefore we have selected phenomena",
        "• that were explicitly added to the grammar at some point in order to deal with actually occurring unforeseen constructions, • that can easily be removed from the grammar without affecting other phenomena, • and that are relatively rare in all the texts we have investigated.",
        "Table 1 shows the 21 phenomena that we consider in this paper.",
        "(Note that the three earlier example sentences correspond to lines 1, 4, and 10 in this table, but that not all lines have exact counterparts in English.)",
        "The last column gives the overall frequency per 1,000 sentences of each phenomenon when measured across all trees in our collection.",
        "The collection contains sections of Bible text (Genesis 1–50), law text (the constitutions of Federal Germany and of the European Union), online technical newscasts (www.",
        "he i s e .",
        "de), novel text, and sentences from the NEGRA corpus of newspaper articles.",
        "Table 2 shows the sentence counts of the different sections and the frequency per 1000 of all 21 phenomena in each text type.",
        "It can be seen that most of the constructions remain quite rare overall, but often the frequency depends heavily on the text type, so that a high influence of the corpus can be expected for our experiments."

        "In WCDG (Schr¨oder, 2002), natural language is modelled as labelled dependency trees, in which each word is assigned exactly one other word as its regent (only the root of the syntax tree remains unsubordinated) and a label that describes the nature of their relation.",
        "The set of acceptable trees is defined not by way of generative rules, but only through constraints on well-formed structures.",
        "Every possible dependency tree is considered correct unless one of its edges or edge pairs violates a constraint.",
        "This permissiveness extends to many properties that other grammar formalisms consider non-negotiable; for instance, a WCDG can allow non-projective (or, indeed, cyclical) dependencies simply by not forbidding them.",
        "Since the constraints can be arbitrary logical formulas, a grammar rule can also allow some types of non-projective relations and forbid others, and in fact the grammar in question does precisely that.",
        "Weighted constraints can be written to express the fact that a construction is considered acceptable but not fully so.",
        "This mechanism is used extensively to achieve robustness against proper errors such as wrong inflection, ellipsis or mis-ordering; all of these are in fact expressed through defeasible constraints.",
        "But it can also express more subtle dispreferences against a specific phenomenon by writing only a weak constraint that forbids it; most of the phenomena listed in Table 1 are associated with such constraints to ensure that the parser assumes a rare construction only when this is necessary.",
        "We employ a previously existing wide-coverage WCDG of modern German (Foth et al., 2005) that covers all of the presented rare phenomena.",
        "It comprises about 1,000 constraints, 370 of which are hard constraints.",
        "The entire parser and the grammar of German are publicly available at http://nats-www.informatik.",
        "uni-hamburg.de/Papa/PapaDownloads.",
        "The optimal structure could be defined as the tree that violates the least important constraint (as in Optimality Theory), or the tree that violates the fewest constraints; in fact a multiplicative measure is used that combines both aspects by minimizing the collective dispreference for all phenomena in a sentence.",
        "Unfortunately, the resulting combinatorial problem is NP-complete and admits of no efficient exact solution algorithm.",
        "However, variants of a heuristic local search can be used, which try to find the optimal tree by constructing a complete tree and then changing it in those places that violate important constraints.",
        "This involves a trade-off between parsing accuracy and processing time, because the correct structure is more likely to be found if there is more time to try out more alternatives.",
        "Given enough time, the method works well enough that the overall system exhibits a competitive accuracy even though the theoretical accuracy of the language model may be compromised by search errors.",
        "As an example of the process, consider the following analysis of the German proverb “Wer anderen eine Grube gr¨abt, f¨allt selbst hinein.” (He who digs a hole for others, will fall into it himself.)",
        "The transformation starts with the following initial assumption ster anderen eine Grube 9räbt fällt selbst hinein .",
        "which, besides producing two isolated fragments instead of a spanning tree, also lacks a subject for the second clause.",
        "ster anderen eine Grube 9räbt fällt selbst hinein .",
        "To mend this problem the relative pronoun from the first clause has been taken as a subject for the second one, with the result that the conflict has simply been moved to the first part of the sentence.",
        "Nevertheless, the global score improved considerably, since the verb-second condition for German main clauses is violated less often.",
        "ster anderen eine Grube 9räbt fällt selbst hinein .",
        "Here, the indefinite plural pronoun ‘anderen’ is taken as the subject for the second clause, creating, however, an agreement error with the finite verb, which is singular.",
        "Both subclauses have still not been integrated into a single spanning tree.",
        "erer anderen eine Grube 9räbt fällt selbst hinein .",
        "The integration is then achieved, but unfortunately as a coordination without an appropriate conjunction being available.",
        "Moreover there is a problem with the hypothesized main clause, since it again does not obey the verb-second condition of German.",
        "erer anderen eine Grube 9räbt fällt selbst hinein .",
        "Therefore the interpretation is changed to a relative clause, which however cannot appear in isolation.",
        "The valency requirements of the verb ‘gr¨abt’ are satisfied by taking the indefinite pronoun ‘anderen’ as a direct object with the true object (‘eine Grube’) as a (mal-formed) apposition.",
        "erer anderen eine Grube 9räbt fällt selbst hinein .",
        "Finally, the analysis switches to an interpretation which accepts the second part of the sentence as the main clause and subordinates the first part as a subject clause.",
        "The problem with the apposition reading persists.",
        "erer anderen eine Grube 9räbt fällt selbst hinein .",
        "By interpreting the indefinite pronoun as an ethical dative, the direct object valence is freed for the NP ‘eine Grube’.",
        "Although this structure still violates some constraints (e.g. the ethical dative is slightly penalized for being somewhat unusual) a better one cannot be found.",
        "Note that the algorithm does not take the shortest possible transformation sequence; in fact, the first analysis could have been transformed directly into the last by only one exchange.",
        "Because the algorithm is greedy, it chooses a different repair at that point, but it still finds the solution in about three seconds on a 3 GHz Pentium machine.",
        "In contrast to stochastic parsing approaches, a WCDG can be modified in a specifically targeted manner.",
        "It therefore provides us with a grammar formalism which is particularly well suited to precisely measure the contributions of different linguistic knowledge sources to the overall parsing quality.",
        "In particular it allows us to",
        "1. switch off constraints, i.e. increase the space of acceptable constructions and/or syntactic structures, 2. weaken constraints, by changing the weight in a way that it makes the violation of the constraint condition more easily acceptable, 3. introduce additional dependency labels into the model, 4. remove existing dependency labels from the model 5. reinforce constraints, by removing guards for exceptional cases from them, 6. reinforce constraints, by strengthening their weights or making the constraint non-defeasible in the extreme case, and 7. introducing new constraints, to prohibit certain constructions and/or syntactic structures.",
        "Since for the purpose of our experiments, we start with a fairly broad-coverage grammar of German, from which certain rare phenomena will be removed, options 4 to 7 are most important for us."

        "In general, it is not easy to predict the possible outcome of a parsing run when using a grammar with a reduced coverage.",
        "Whether a sentence can be analysed at all solely depends on the available alternatives for structuring it.",
        "Which structural description it can receive, however, is influenced by the scores resulting from rule applications or constraint violations.",
        "Moreover, the transformation-based solution method used for the WCDG-experiments introduces yet another condition: since it is based on a limited heuristics for candidate generation, the grammar must license not only the final parsing result for a sentence, but also all the intermediate transformation steps with a sufficiently high score.",
        "This might exclude some structural interpretations from being considered at all if the grammar is not tolerant enough to accommodate highly deviant structures.",
        "Thus, the ability to deal with extragrammatical input in a robust manner is a crucial property if we are going to use a grammar with coverage limitations.",
        "Unfortunately, robust behaviour is usually achieved by extending instead of reducing the coverage of the model and compensating the resulting increase in ambiguity by an appropriately designed scoring scheme together with an optimization procedure.",
        "To deal with these opposing tendencies, it is obviously important to determine which parts of the model need to be relaxed to achieve a sufficient degree of robustness, and which ones can be reinforced to limit the space of alternatives in a sensible way.",
        "Excluding phenomena from the grammar which never occur in a corpus should always give an advantage, since this reduces the number of alternatives to consider at each step without forbidding any of the correct ones.",

        "We have investigated the effect of systematically reducing the coverage of a general grammar of German.",
        "By removing support for 21 rare phenomena, the overall parsing accuracy could be improved.",
        "We confirmed the initial assumption about the effects that broad coverage has on the parser: while it allows some special sentences to be analysed more accurately, it also causes a slight decrease on the much more numerous normal sentences.",
        "This result shows that at least with respect to this particular grammar, more coverage can indeed lead to less parsing accuracy.",
        "In the first experiment we measured the overall loss through adding coverage where it is not needed as about 0.4% of structural accuracy on newscast text, and 0.1% on NEGRA sentences.",
        "This figure can be interpreted as the result of overgenerating or ‘leaking’ of rare constructions into sentences where they are not wanted.",
        "Although we found that it makes little difference whether to remove support for very rare or for somewhat rare phenomena, judging constructions by how many leaks they actually cause leads to a greater improvement.",
        "On the NEGRA test set, removing the ‘known troublemakers’ leads to a greater increase of in accuracy of 0.4%, reducing the error rate for structural attachment by 4.2%.",
        "Of course, removing rare phenomena is not a viable technique to substantially improve parser accuracy, if only for the simple fact that it does not scale up.",
        "However, it confirms that as soon as a certain level of coverage has been reached, robustness, i.e. the ability to deal with unexpected data, is more crucial than coverage itself to achieve high quality results on unrestricted input.",
        "On the other hand, the improvement we obtained is not",
        "very large, compared to the already rather high overall performance of the parser.",
        "This may be due to the consistent use of weighted constraints in the original grammar, which slightly disprefer many of the 21 phenomena even when they are allowed, and we assume that the original grammar is already reasonably effective at preventing leaks.",
        "This claim might be confirmed by reversing the experiment: if all phenomena were allowed and all dispreferences switched off, we would expect even more leaks to occur.",
        "To carry out comparable experiments on generative stochastic models presents us with the difficulty that it would first be necessary to determine which of its parameters are responsible for covering a specific phenomenon, and whether they can be modified as to remove the construction from the coverage without affecting others as well.",
        "Even in WCDG it is difficult to quantify how much of the observed improvement results from plugged leaks, and how much from focussing.",
        "This could only be done by observing all intermediate steps in the solution algorithm, and counting how many trees that were used as intermediate results or considered as alternatives exhibit each phenomenon.",
        "The most promising result from the last experiment is that it is possible to detect particularly detracting phenomena, which are prime candidates for exclusion, in one part of a corpus and use them on another.",
        "This suggests itself to be exploited as a method to automatically adapt a broad-coverage grammar more closely to the characteristics of a particular corpus."
