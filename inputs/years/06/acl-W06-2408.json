        "It was then the task of a human annotator to select the right VMWEs, and occasionally to tag new VMWEs, missing from the database and thus having not been tagged automatically.",

        "Table 1 shows that the amount and proportion of VMWEs depends on the text class.",

        "The small proportion of VMWEs of the DB that can be found in real texts (compare row B with row A) may be first explained by the small size of the corpus.",
