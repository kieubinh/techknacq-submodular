        "Language is rife with ambiguity.",
        "Sentences can be structurally ambiguous, pronouns can be referentially ambiguous, and words can be polysemous.",
        "The human language faculty deals remarkably well with the omnipresent ambiguity, so well in fact that we are rarely aware of the multiple alternatives that are available.",
        "Despite our apparent lack of awareness, psycholinguistic research has shown that alternative meanings are nevertheless activated during processing.",
        "For example, in a seminal study of homograph recognition, Tanenhaus et al.",
        "(1979) demonstrated that multiple meanings of a homograph are initially activated even in highly constraining syntactic contexts, such as They all rose vs.",
        "They bought a rose.",
        "Likewise in speech production, Cutting and Ferreira (1999) showed that non-depicted senses of homophones are activated during picture naming.",
        "Thus, when either a homograph word or a picture with a homophone name are processed, multiple meanings are initially activated.",
        "Intuitively, however, one might expect differences in the degree to which multiple meanings are activated depending on the presentation mode.",
        "To our knowledge no investigation has compared picture (top-down) and word (bottom-up) semantic processing.",
        "In this paper, we investigate differences in the semantic information, namely associations, elicited in these two presentation modes.",
        "We reason that, if multiple meanings of an ambiguous word are activated when the stimulus is processed, then the elicited associates should reflect the ambiguity.",
        "If the degree of activation differs with respect to the presentation mode, the associates should reflect this difference as well.",
        "Manually linking associates to a particular word sense would be time intensive and subjective.",
        "Thus, we rely on computational methods that have the potential to automatically compare the associates provided for the two presentation modes and classify them into meaning-referring sets.",
        "These methods thus not only reveal differences in the associates elicited in the two presentation conditions but also, in the case of ambiguous nouns, identify which associates are related to which meaning of the word.",
        "Our analyses are guided by the following two questions:",
        "1.",
        "Are there systematic differences in associate response types when target objects are presented in written form compared to when the written form is accompanied by a pictorial representation?",
        "Predictions about which differences we expected in the response types are made, and the associate responses are analyzed accordingly (Section 4).",
        "2.",
        "Can we identify multiple senses of the nouns and discriminate between noun senses based on the associate responses?",
        "We apply a clustering technique to the target-response pairs; the cluster analysis gathers semantically similar target nouns, based on overlapping sets of associate responses, and predicts the ambiguity of nouns and their senses (Section 5).",
        "-n Section 2, we provide an overview of the types of differences we anticipate; Section 3 describes the materials and procedure used for the association elicitation; in Sections 4 and 5, we explain how response types were characterized and noun senses identified."

        "A critical component of the current study was the presentation of target stimuli in two forms: Lexical stimuli consisted of the written name of target objects; pictorial stimuli consisted of the written names accompanied by black and white line drawings of the referred-to objects.",
        "We assumed that, in some cases, associate responses elicited by written words would be different from associate responses elicited by pictures.",
        "Differences in responses might arise from a variety of sources: a) images might increase the salience of physical attributes of objects, b) images might show non-prototypical characteristics of objects that would not be evoked by words, c) when word forms have different shades of meaning, responses evoked by lexical stimuli might index any of the words’ meanings while responses evoked by pictorial representations might be more biased towards the depicted sense.",
        "To illustrate these points, consider the following example.",
        "The picture of a Hexe ‘witch’ from our study showed a witch riding on a broom, see Figure 1.",
        "This particular choice of activity, rather than, for example, a plausible alternative like stirring a cauldron or simply standing by herself, accentuated the relationship between witch and broom.",
        "Indeed, we found that this accentuation was reflected in the associate responses: 27 of the 50 participants (54%) who saw the picture of the witch produced broom as an associate while only 18 participants (36%) who read the word witch produced broom.",
        "Thus, the association strength of a response elicited by words does not necessarily generalize to picture stimuli, and vise versa.",
        "To demonstrate the relevance of presentation mode for potentially ambiguous nouns, consider a second example.",
        "The German word for ‘lock’ is Schloss.",
        "Schloss, however, also means ‘castle’.",

We used noun-condition combinations as compared to nouns only, because the clustering result should not only distinguish senses of nouns in general, but in addition predict the noun senses with respect to the condition.",

        "We primarily used the stylistic dictionary (Dudenredaktion, 2001), but used the foreign language dictionary (Dudenredaktion, 2005) if the noun was missing in the former.",
        "Each target noun was defined by its (short version) sense definitions.",
        "For example, Schloss was defined by the senses Vorrichtung zum Ver-schließen ‘device for closing’ and Wohngeb¨aude von F¨ursten und Adeligen ‘residential building for princes and noblemen’.",
        "As targets for the evaluation, we used the two cluster analyses as mentioned above, containing 100 and 200 clusters with membership probability cut-offs at 1%.",
        "Two annotators were then presented with two lists each: For each cluster analysis, they saw a list of the 51 selected target nouns, accompanied by the clusters they were members of, i.e., for which they showed a probability , ignoring the condition of the target noun (PW vs. W).",
        "In total, the annotators were given 82/91 clusters which included any of the 51 selected nouns.",
        "For each cluster, the annotators saw the five most probable associations, and all cluster members.",
        "The annotators were asked to select a Duden sense for each cluster, if possible.",
        "The results of the annotation are presented in Table 3.",
        "Annotator 1 identified a Duden sense for 72/75% of the clusters, annotator 2 for 78/71%.",
        "Interannotator agreement on which of the Duden senses was appropriate for a cluster (if any) was 81/85%; .",
        "The evaluation of the clusters as carried out by the sense annotation demonstrates that the cluster senses correspond largely to Duden senses.",
        "This first kind of evaluation models the precision of the cluster analyses.",
        "A second kind of evaluation assessed how many different Duden senses we capture with the cluster analyses; this evaluation mod-ells the recall of the cluster analyses.",
        "Duden defines a total of 113 senses to our target nouns.",
        "Table 4 specifies the recall for the data sets and annotators.",
        "The evaluations show that the precision is much larger than the recall.",
        "It might be worth applying the clustering with a different number of clusters",
        "and/or a different cut-off for the cluster membership probability, but that would lower the precision of the analyses.",
        "We believe that the evaluation numbers are quite impressive, especially considering that Duden not only specifies everyday vocabulary, but includes colloquial expressions (such as Ballon as ‘human head’), outdated senses (such as Mond as ‘month’), and domain-specific senses (such as Blatt as ‘shoulder of a hoofed game’)."

        "In this paper we evaluated differences in the types and strengths of semantic associations elicited under two conditions of presentation, ‘picture+word’ and ‘word only’.",
        "Consistent with prior psycholinguistic research, we observed associations to different meanings of a word in both conditions, supporting the idea that multiple meanings of homonyms are active during both picture and word processing.",
        "However, our analyses of response types also showed that responses to pictures were less diverse and idiosyncratic than responses to words, suggesting that the degree to which alternative meanings are active in the two presentation modes may indeed be different.",
        "One further implication of the analyses is that semantic associations (and especially association strengths) from word-based norming studies do not necessarily generalize for the purpose of experiments using depicted materials.",
        "This insight should have an impact on psycholinguistic studies when selecting depicted vs. written stimuli.",
        "Our predictions for the types of differences we expected were based on intuitive grounds.",
        "One might therefore question the value of the analyses presented in Section 4.",
        "It is interesting to note, however, that some of the predictions were in fact not born out.",
        "As the cluster analysis presented in Section 5 required differences between the two stimulus modes, it was critical that a proper evaluation of those differences be conducted, even if some of them seem trivially true.",
        "The cluster analysis demonstrated that we can capitalize on the semantic associations and both identify and discriminate the various senses of the target nouns.",
        "Indeed, the clusters not only revealed sense differences of target nouns with respect to their presentation modes, but also detected noun senses which had not been identified by the authors initially.",
        "This indicates that this method not only can discriminate between senses but it can also detect ambiguity.",
        "The cluster analysis allowed us to apply automatic methods of identifying which meaning of a word a particular associate refers to, which would otherwise be a time consuming and error-prone manual activity."
