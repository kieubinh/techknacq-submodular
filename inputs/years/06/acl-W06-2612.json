        "They are properties of individuals which are of greater importance in most communities.",
        "In technological oriented societies such as modern Western the reference between names as a label and the person is not as obvious as in small tribal societies.",
        "This is especially true where names are stored within large information systems.",
        "This includes government, medical, educational and even commercial records which are kept about individuals.",
        "Names are the most important referrer to a person even if there are numbering systems like ID numbers because such systems are not universal.",
        "Names are often queried in a different way than they were entered.",
        "Names represent complex lexical structures which have to be handled systematically for data entry, storage and retrieval in order to get sufficient recall or precision the retrieval process in.",
        "In this paper we present a first account of our findings on constructing Thai names with the help of an ontology of names as well as a working methodology for the naming process in Thai culture.",
        "This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 contains a description of names and their elements.",
        "In Section 3 we outline the concept of ontology of names.",
        "In Section 4 we present the construction process and system for Thai names.",
        "We apply this system together with an ontology to construct names with an appropriate meaning.",
        "Section 5 shows the conclusions of our study and further work which has to be performed.",
        "Names for individuals are often called proper names, for humans sometimes also an-throponyms.",
        "Names for places are called toponyms, for bodies of water hydronyms, for ethnic groups ethnonyms, for metaphors meto-nyms and so on.",
        "Names are more than just strings of characters.",
        "Names show important information such as titles, gender, marital status, and even birthplace.",
        "For this names provide different elements (Section 2.2), which may differ between cultures."

        "From the technical point of view we want to link and match as many names as possible with the correct individuals.",
        "If we deal with individuals of the same name, e.g. John Smith, we have to establish a second identifier at least.",
        "This can be – and is in many cases – a temporal element, like the date of birth, which is an individual and unchanging property of the person.",
        "Another way to circumvent the problem is to establish numbering systems, like ID numbers.",
        "Systems of numbers or other ciphers can be generated within individual organisations.",
        "It is not likely that the resulting ID numbers will be the same in different organisations.",
        "The numbering may have limitations as well, e.g. the individual health care setting (e.g. within a hospital or district) or, in principle, more widely (e.g. the National Health Service number).",
        "In the past, the National Health Service number in England and Wales had serious limitations as a matching variable, and it was not widely used on healthcare records.",
        "With the allocation of the new ten-digit number throughout the NHS all this has been changed (Gill, 1997).",
        "Although numbering systems are simple to implement they can lead to different errors in recording, transcripting, and keying.",
        "So we have to take into account methods which reduce these errors and facilitate good quality of data entry and retrieval.",
        "One such method uses a checking device such as check-digits (Wild, 1968, Hamming, 1986).",
        "When we are not able to use unique numbers or ciphers, natural matching variables are the person's name, date of birth, sex and perhaps other supplementary variables such as the address with postal code and place of birth, which are used in combination for matching.",
        "Recently, it has been suggested that this simple code could be extended for security critical places (e.g. airports, checkpoints etc.)",
        "with biometric marker information extracted from person identifier information e.g. fingerprints/iridograms."

        "The term ontology has been widely used in recent years in the field of Artificial Intelligence, computer and information science especially in domains such as, cooperative information systems, intelligent information integration, information retrieval and extraction, knowledge representation, and database management systems (Guarino, 1998, Andrade and Saltz, 1999, 2000).",
        "Many different definitions of the term are proposed.",
        "One of the most widely quoted and well-known definition of ontology is Gruber's (Gruber, 1993): An ontology is an explicit specification of a conceptualization.",
        "The term is borrowed from philosophy, where an ontology is a systematic account of existence.",
        "Here in this paper we adopt the following definition: Ontology is the study or concern about what kinds of things exist - what entities or things are there in the universe (Blackburn, 1996).",
        "Our work on ontologies will comprise: a terminological component where we lay down the concepts and an assertional component (or Knowledge Base) which contains the individual instances (entities).",
        "The level of description will be taxonomies with hierarchically related terms and controlled vocabularies (thesaurus) with the help of semantic networks.",
        "An ontology of names can be worked out in many different forms, but every ontology will include a dictionary, some definition of the terms",
        "(semantics), and indications how they depend on each other, e.g. in hierarchies and semantic networks.",
        "For example, an ontology of names can be defined as what kinds of names exist, e.g. first name, surname, nickname, etc (Section 2.2).",
        "This typically comprises definitions of different names, the elements of names and their structures.",
        "In this section we show how an ontology of names can be captured and defined.",
        "An ontology can also be used to establish the network of synonyms, e.g. using spelling norms to determine whether two names are the same/similar or not.",
        "For example, two names: Totie and Totiey can be defined based on assumption that they are the same as Totty.",
        "This attempts to tackle the seemingly irreducible conventions of surname.",
        "In compositional semantics let us consider the name “Gutensohn”.",

        "The name is a composition of the two strings Godith and Sohn, which have unambiguous, meaningful interpretations.",

        "The composition Gutsohn, Gudzon, or in other cultures: Guditson, Godye-son and Godithson and Godison (Reaney and Wilson 1997).",
        "We incorporate the different elements of personal names (Figure 1) into a semantic network (Figure 2) to illustrate how they associate with each other, e.g. with hierarchies.",
        "Identifying and searching result in a list many names with variations and meanings.",
        "In order to find the correct person with a name we have to adopt ontologies of names, e.g. based on place of birth or relationship of people.",
        "The typical origins of surnames which can be a basis for ontologies of names can be classified as follows: local surnames - surnames of relationship - surnames of occupation or office.",
        "Local surnames, which are most widely used, stem from toponyms, we can call them toponymic.",
        "They reflect land owners, place of birth, or the center of life.",
        "For example, Richard de Tonebridge was named after his castle of Tonbridge, but he was also called Richard de Clara from the Suffolk Clare, which became his chief seat and the family’s definitive surname.",
        "Also Richard de Hadestoke, a London alderman, had left Hadstock (Essex) and settled in London (Reaney and Wilson 1997).",
        "These local surnames derive (with occasional exceptions) from English, Scottish or French places (e.g. de, at, in).",
        "Toponymic Thai names are derived from Thai places and took originally a preposition na, for example, Prapas na Ranong is a person from a Southern province in Thailand called Ranong.",
        "Surnames which come from family relation are often called patronymic, but we have to introduce a more elaborate term, because we encounter names from females and other relations than just father, such as Gilbert Fathevedsteppeson, Richard Hannebrothir, America Ibbotdoghter, and John Prestebruther.",
        "Surnames of occupation and office refer to actual office holders like clergy names or state offices.",
        "Some of these, such as steward, constable, marshal, etc., became hereditary and gave rise to hereditary surnames, but the terms were also commonly used of lesser offices, whilst marshal was a common term for a farrier and such names frequently denoted the actual occupation.",
        "However, Nuns, Abbots, Priors, Monks and other clerical people were bound by vows of celibacy and thus did usually not have families which adopted their respective surname."
