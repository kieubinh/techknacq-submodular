        "In the R&D project DIRECT-INFO the concrete business case of sponsorship tracking was targeted.",
        "The scenario investigated within the project was that sponsors want to know how often their brands are mentioned in connection with the sponsored company.",
        "The visual detection of a brand (e.g. in videos) is not sufficient to meet the requirements of this business case.",
        "Multimodal analysis and fusion – as implemented within DIRECT-INFO – is needed in order to fulfill these requirements (Rehatschek, 2004).",
        "Within this context text analysis has been applied to documents reporting on entities, like football teams, that have close relations to large sponsoring companies.",
        "In the text analysis component of the system we had to detect if an entity was mentioned positively, negatively or neutrally.",
        "Besides all the processing and annotation issues to positive or negative mentions, we had to make our results available to a global MPEG-7 document, which is encoding the annotation results of various analysis of the modalities involved (logo detection, speech recognition, text analysis etc.).",
        "This global MPEG-7 document was the input for a fusion component.",
        "In the next sections we describe the Text Analysis (TA) component of DIRECT-INFO.",
        "We then briefly describe the linguistic description scheme (LDS) of MPEG-7 and show the annotation generated by the TA.",
        "Finally we briefly discuss the role the LDS, and generally speaking MPEG-7, can play in supporting an interoperable cross-media annotation strategy.",
        "It seems to us, that LDS is offering a good mean for adding semantic metadata to image/video, but not for a real semantic integration of text and media content annotation, which in the case of DIRECT-INFO was performed by an additional fusion component.",
        "2 The detection of positive/negative mentioning Our work in DIRECT-INFO has been dedicated in enhancing an already existing tool for linguistic annotation.",
        "This tool, called SCHUG (Shallow and CHunk-based Unification Grammar tool), is annotating texts considering both linguistic constituency and dependency structures (T. Declerck, M. Vela 2005).",
        "A first development step was dedicated in creating specialized lexicons for various types of lexical categories (like nouns, adjectives and verbs) that can bear the property of being intrinsically positive or negative in a specific domain, as can be seen just below in the case of soccer:",
        "Considering a sentence like “ManU takes the command in the game against the weak Spanish",
        "team”, the head-noun of the direct object (linguistically speaking) “the command” gets from the access to the specialized DIRECT-INFO lexicon a tag “INTERPRETATION” with value “positive”.",
        "Whereas the adjective “weak” in the PP-adjunct “in the game against the weak Spanish team” gets an “INTERPRETATION” tag with value “negative”.",
        "Once the words in the sentence have been lexically tagged with respect to their interpretation, the computing of the pos./neg.",
        "interpretation at the level of linguistic fragments and then at the level of the sentences can start.",
        "For this we have defined heuristics along the lines of the dependency structures delivered by the linguistic analysis.",
        "So in the case of the NP “the weak Spanish team”, the head noun “team”, as such a neutral expression, is getting the “INTERPRETATION” tag with the value “negative”, since it is modified by a “negative” adjective.",
        "In case the reference resolution algorithm of the linguistic tools has been able to specify that the “Spanish team” is in fact “Real Madrid” this entity gets a negative “INTERPRETATION” tag.",
        "The head noun of the NP realizing the subject of the sentence, “ManU” gets a positive mention tag, since it is the subject of a positive verb and direct object combination (the NP “the command” having a positive reading, whereas the verb “takes” has a neutral reading).",
        "A last aspect to be mentioned here concerns the treatment of the so-called polarity items.",
        "Specific words in natural language intrinsically carry a negation or position force (or scope).",
        "So the words not, none or no have an intrinsic negation force and negate the words and fragments in the context in which those specific words are occurring.",
        "The context that is negated by such words can be also called the “scope” (or the range) of the negation.",
        "Consider for example the sentence: “I would definitely pay £15 million to get Owen, not even a decent striker, instead...” Our tools are able to detect that the NP “decent striker” is negated, and therefore the positive reading of “decent striker” is being ruled out."

        "It is an excellent choice for describing audiovisual content because of its comprehensiveness and flexibility.",
        "The comprehensiveness results from the fact that the standard has been designed for a broad range of applications and thus employs very general and widely applicable concepts.",
        "The standard contains a large set of tools for diverse types of annotations on different semantic levels.",
        "The flexibility of MPEG-7, which is provided by a high level of generality, makes it usable for a broad application area without imposing strict constraints on the metadata models of these applications.",
        "The flexibility is very much based on the structuring tools and allows the description to be modular and on different levels of abstraction.",
        "MPEG-7 supports fine grained description, and it is possible to attach descriptors to arbitrary segments on any level of detail of the description.",

        "In the DIRECT-INFO project we managed to include results of text analysis in an automated fashion into a MPEG-7 description, which was dealing with the XML representation of the analysis of various modalities.",
        "Using corresponding metadata, it was possible to ensure the encoding/annotation of the related results in one file and to facilitate the access to the separated annotation using XPath.",
        "As such the DIRECT-INFO MPEG-7 annotation schema is offering a practicable multidimensional annotation scheme, if we consider a “dimensions” as being the output of the analysis of various modalities.",
        "MPEG-7 proved to be generic and flexible enough for combining, saving and accessing various types of annotation.",
        "Limitations of MPEG-7 were encountered when the task was about fusion or merging of information encoded in the various descriptors (or features), and this task was addressed in a posterior step, whereas the encoding scheme of MPEG-7 was not longer helpful, in defining for example relations between the annotation resulting from the different modules or for defining constraints between those annotation.",
        "There seems to be a need for a higher level of representation for annotation resulting from the analysis of distinct media, being low-level features for images or high-level semantic features for texts.",
        "The need of an “ontologization” of multimedia features has been already recognized and projects are already dealing with this, like AceMedia.",
        "Initial work in relating multimodal annotation in DIRECT-INFO will be further developed in K-Space, a new Network of Excellence, which goal is to provide for support in semantic inference for both automatic and semi-automatic annotation and retrieval of multimedia content.",
        "K-Space aims at closing the “semantic gap” between the low-level content descriptions and the richness and subjectivity of semantics in high-level human interpretations of audiovisual media."
