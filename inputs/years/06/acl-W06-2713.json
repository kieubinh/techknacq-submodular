        "It is well known that when using XML-based annotation schemes to represent multi layer annotations, it can be difficult to handle partially overlapping annotations.",
        "Annotating discontinuous elements may be considered as a variant of the same problem (Pianta and Bentivogli, 2004).",
        "Other difficulties can arise from the necessity of integrating manual and automatic annotations, as we will show in this paper.",
        "One of the most effective solutions to the above mentioned problems is the so called standoff annotation, based on the separation between textual data and annotations, and between various types of annotation, possibly pointing to same text.",
        "This approach has been systematically adopted in the design of MAF, a multilayer XML format developed for the EU-funded MEANING project, in the context of the creation of the Italian MEANING Corpus (Bentivogli et al., 2003).",
        "In this paper we will describe our experience in the use of MAF, with special emphasis on how we solved issues related to representing annotation levels which come from different sources, and can possibly overlap.",
        "We will also give details about the solutions we adopted to allow for efficient access and human browsing of MAF standoff annotations.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes MAF and the types of annotations which have been represented with it.",
        "Section 3 reports on the integration into MAF of linguistic annotations coming from different sources.",
        "Section 4 illustrates the strategies adopted to make the information encoded in MAF quickly accessible.",
        "Finally, Section 5 presents the MEANING Browser, a tool for accessing and navigating corpora linguistically annotated with MAF."

        "Following the proposals for the ISO/TC 37/SC 4 standard for linguistic resources (Ide and Romary, 2002), the MAF scheme is based on annotation structures and data categories.",
        "Each type of annotation structure (nestable <struct> elements) corresponds to a specific kind of linguistic object (e.g. tokens, lexical units, multi-words), and each instance of a linguistic object is identified by a unique identifier.",

        "Then the morphosyntactic level, representing word-related morphological information, contains pointers to the tokens, whereas the mul-tiword level points to the words described at morphosyntactic level.",

        "When using the Callisto graphical interface, all annotations of temporal expressions and entity mentions are carried out by selecting a sequence of contiguous characters.",
        "As a consequence, all AIF annotations make reference to character positions.",
        "However, from Section 2.2 we know that in MAF temporal expressions and entity mentions make reference to morphosyntactic linguistic objects, not characters.",
        "This implies that, to go from AIF to the MEANING Format, we need to translate annotations making reference to the position of characters into annotations that point to morphological entities.",
        "More precisely, we need to substitute pointers to character positions with pointers to morphosyntactic objects which have been marked automatically by TextPro.",
        "Carrying out this step will also achieve the integration of manual and automatic annotations.",
        "The integration step is possible because the MAF hierarchy of annotation levels points, at the lowest level, to character positions.",
        "By following the hierarchy of links relating the various annotation levels it is always possible to trace back a linguistic object to some sequence of characters in the raw text, and in the opposite direction, given a string, we know what linguistic objects correspond to it.",
        "Summing up, the integration of AIF annotations into MAF requires that, given the character positions contained in the AIF annotation of some string, we substitute the pointers to characters with the pointers to the linguistic objects that cover the same string."

        "To solve this problem we first analyzed existing native XML databases such as eXist, and Apache Xindice, but found that what was available at the time did not suited our needs.",

        "Once MAF data are stored in a relational database, they can be accessed quite efficiently.",
        "However, when the access to data requires joins of many tables, access times become incompatible with various kinds of applications, such as on-line corpus browsing.",
