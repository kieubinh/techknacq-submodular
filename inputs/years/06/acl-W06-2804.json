        "Secondly, the “WikiSpeak”, the spoken-written language used by Wikipedians in their backstage and informal community, will be taken into account.",
        "The initial findings of this research seem to suggest that, the language of the Wikipedia’s co-authored articles is formal and standardized in a way similar to that found in Encyclopaedia Britannica Online.",
        "By contrast, the WikiSpeak, as a new variety of NetSpeak Jargon, can be considered as a creative domain, an independent and individual expression of linguistic freedom of self-representation, characterizing the wiki Computer Mediated Discourse Community."

        "The encyclopaedia's structure, either hierarchical or alphabetically ordered, with its evolving nature is particularly adaptable to a disk-based or online format.",
        "All major printed encyclopaedias have moved to this method of delivery.",
        "Online Encyclopedias can include multimedia (such as video, sound clips and animated illustrations) unavailable in the printed format.",
        "They can make use of hypertext cross-references between conceptually related items and, furthermore, they offer the additional advantage of being dynamic: new and frequently updated information can be presented almost immediately, rather than waiting for the next release of a static format (as with a paper or disk publication).",
        "This research is based particularly on a contrastive linguistic analysis of Wikipedia and Encyclopaedia Britannica Online.",
        "The latter is considered one of the greatest examples of general encyclopaedias in the English speaking world.",
        "It contains 120,000 articles which are commonly considered accurate, reliable and well-written.",
        "Brief article summaries can be viewed for free on the net, while the full text is available only for individuals with monthly or yearly subscription.",
        "On the other hand, Wikipedia is a collaborative authoring project on the web, a repository of encyclopaedic knowledge, an example of a collaborative hypermedium focused on a common project.",
        "It is one of the most popular reference websites receiving around 50 million hits per day.",
        "It is a social e-democracy environment, designed with the goal of creating a free encyclopedia containing information on all subjects written collaboratively by volunteers.",
        "At the time of writing this paper the project has produced over two and half million articles and has been officially recognized as the largest international online community.",
        "It consists of 200 independent language editions and the English version is the biggest one with more than 962,995 articles (up to January 2006)."

      "text": [
        "With reference to the extensive empirical studies of Susan Herring on CMC, wikis and blogs considered as spaces belonging to the second web generation, can be regarded as adding new peculiarities to the existing synchronous and asynchronous tools of the first CMC generation (such as e-mail, mailing list, forum and chat).",
        "It is well known in media studies that “the medium is the message” as McLuhan (1964) pointed out in the sixties, and in fact the medium adds unique properties to",
        "the web genre in terms of production, function, and reception which cannot be ignored.",
        "Wikis are co-authoring tools which allow collective collaboration.",
        "They can be, simultaneously, a repository of information and an asynchronous tool of communication and discussion across the web (see Wikipedia).",
        "All wikis have integrated search engines for locating content and are open to anyone since they are considered a public space, even though they can be protected against unauthentic users.",
        "Their main aim is to create documents.",
        "Wikis, unlike traditionally designed web sites, encourage “topical writing” by using wiki links and creating a wide network of interconnected pages.",
        "The interlinking process becomes simpler to type by just putting the word(s) in square brackets.",
        "It simultaneously creates a new topic title (a WikiWord), a new writing space for that topic and a link to that space.",
        "Once created, a topic will be available anywhere on the wiki as whenever the WikiWord is typed, it will link to the writing space of that topic (Morgan, 2006).",
        "The writer, the supreme authority in print, is considered the one who transmits content through paper pages, to passive readers, whose role is merely to decode and interpret their message.",
        "The electronic writing space, being hypertextual and extremely flexible, changes the landscape.",
        "Writers can create multiple structures from the same topics (hierarchy, web, spiral, etc.)",
        "and readers can enter, browse and leave text at many points.",
        "In the hypertext, the author creates different paths for the reader, although there is neither a canonical path nor a defined page order to follow.",
        "The new active readers making their choices, become co-authors of the hypertext (Bolter, 1991).",
        "This idea is more pronounced on a wiki than elsewhere, because in an open wiki the reader can (if allowed) really interrupt the process, rewriting, changing, erasing and modifying the original text or creating new topics.",
        "Traditional writing creates a gap between writer and reader.",
        "Wiki technology mediates the gap because the two actors assume interchangeable roles in this new open e-environment.",
        "To conclude, wiki text is never static as it is considered revisable, atemporal as nodes continually change through the collaborative writing process, creating a never ending evolving network of topics.",
        "Thus, knowledge becomes webbed, contextualized though it remains temporary as it can always be changed or vandalized.",
        "Luckily, the original version can always, and easily, be recovered by SysOps1, through page histories2 (Morgan, 2006).",
        "Wikis offer two different writing modes.",
        "The first one is known as “document mode”.",
        "When it is used, contributors create documents collaboratively and can leave their additions to articles.",
        "Multiple authors can edit and update the content of documents which gradually become representations of contributors’ shared knowledge (Leuf and Cunningham, 2001).",
        "Wikis have two states, “Read” and “Edit”.",
        "“Read state” is by default.",
        "In this case, wiki pages look just like normal webpages.",
        "When the user wants to edit a page, he/she must only access the “edit state”.",
        "“Document mode” is expository, extensive, monological, formal, refined and less creative than “thread mode”.",
        "It is in third person and unsigned.",
        "“Document mode” demonstrates that knowledge is collective and that the ideas, not the writers, are the main focus.",
        "Writers contribute to “document mode” refactoring, reorganizing, incorporating and synthesizing “thread mode” comments in encyclopaedic articles and changing the first to third person (Morgan, 2006).",
        "The second wiki writing mode is “thread mode”.",
        "Contributors carry out discussions by posting signed messages in the discussion page connected to the main article.",
        "Others reply to the original message and so a group of threaded messages evolves (Morgan, 2006).",
        "“Thread mode” is dialogical, open, collective, dynamic and informal.",
        "It develops organically, without a predictive structure.",
        "It expresses public thinking, presents multiple positions and is exploratory.",
        "Entries are phrased in first person and are signed.",
        "Rather then replying to a discussion entry, the writer can refactor the page to incorporate suggestions made, then delete the comment.",
        "“Thread mode” demonstrates that knowledge is the result of constructivist collaboration and not a lonely production."

        "In this phase, an analysis of randomly selected sample articles has been carried out.",
        "The data for this research in progress has been based on two corpora.",
        "Up to now, they include a collection of txt files made up of one hundred articles representing topics taken from the Wiki Folksonomy’s 3 eight categories (culture, geography, history, life, mathematics, science, society, technology) and on a contrastive analysis of the same articles found in Encyclopaedia Britannica Online.",

        "Different factors have been taken into consideration in order to define the formality of Britannica vs Wikipedia.",
        "The first aspect has been articles’ length (total words) as conciseness was found to be a feature of formal written discourse (Chafe, 1982).",
        "The second, average word length (in letters) as short words have been considered a characteristic of informal genres (Biber, 1988).",
        "A high level of lexical density (Halliday, 1985) has been found in formal academic writing.",
        "It has been considered the main stylistic difference between speech and writing (Biber, 1988).",
        "Subsequently, the number of unique lexical items in the two corpora has been measured.",
        "With reference to the findings of Heylighen and Dewaele (1999), frequency of word suffixes typical in formal genres (such as -age, -ment, -ance/ence, -ion, -ity, -ism) and impersonal pronouns (it/they) have been calculated.",
        "A contrastive frequency of meaningful keywords has also been 3 Folksonomy is a neologism which indicates a practice of collaborative categorization which makes use of freely chosen keywords.",
        "Taxonomy derives from Greek “taxis” and “nomos”.",
        "“Taxis” means classification, “nomos” (or nomia) management and “folk” people; so folksonomy means people’s classification management.",
        "investigated.",
        "The informality of the language has been measured through the frequency of abbreviations, acronyms, contractions (I'm, don't, he's, etc.)",
        "and personal pronouns (I, we, you, he/she, they) which have been found to be typical of informal genres, such as face-to-face and phone conversations (Biber, 1988).",
        "As shown in Appendix A (Fig.",
        "1), the first results of this research conducted on one hundred articles have highlighted a number of differences and similarities between Wikipedia and Britannica.",
        "Articles in Britannica have proven to be shorter than those in Wikipedia (average length: 1728 vs 3510 words) and they have shown a higher lexical density (44.9% vs 31.4%).",
        "Although the level of total formality is clearly higher in Britannica (50.2% vs 36.6%), the frequency of formal nouns and impersonal pronouns typical of the formal discourse (5.3 vs 5.2) and the average word length (in letters 5.4 vs 5.2) has proven to be very similar.",
        "The divergent value is related to lexical density, but if text length varies widely (as happens in the two e-ncyclopedias) the different lexical items will appear to be much higher in the shortest text as their relationship is not linear.",
        "Each additional one hundred words of text adds fewer and fewer additional unique words (Biber, 1988).",
        "Thus, an interpretation of the collected data seems to suggest that thanks to the collective editorial control, the WikiLanguage of the co-authored articles shows a formal and standardized style similar to that found in Britannica.",

        "In conclusion, this research project has two main focuses: defining the Wikipedia language variations within a dual context of use: official encyclopaedic entries (WikiLanguage) vs backstage community Speak (WikiSpeak).",
        "Wikipedia, as a new expression for the encyclopedic genre, appears very similar to traditional printed encyclopedias due to its stylistic homogeneity, expressed Neutral Point name comes from the uppercase \"bumps\" in the middle of the compound word, suggesting the humps of a camel.",
        "of View7 and formal style.",
        "The first findings of this research in progress seem to demonstrate how Wikipedia succeeds in reproducing an extant traditional genre even if applied to a collaborative and constructivist scenario.",
        "According to Shephered and Watters (1998), extant subgenres are based on already existing genres in other media forms which have been converted into digital form (i.e. newspaper into electronic news); on the contrary, novel subgenres are entirely dependent on the new medium (i.e. homepages, search engines, webgames, etc.).",
        "They stated that when an extant genre migrates to a digital environment, it will initially be faithfully replicated: content and form will be preserved and the capabilities of the new medium will not be fully exploited (see Britannica).",
        "At a later stage in the evolution, variant genres are created.",
        "This process is driven by the technical capabilities of the new medium.",
        "It is the point of view of this study that Wikipedia can be taken as an example of the evolution of an extant traditional genre (encyclopedias) which has been officially preserved in the articles’ superficial form, but not in the writing and reading processes (social editing, intertextuality, high informativeness and browsing mechanisms).",
        "The articles’ textual form seems to suggest that when collaborative users have to respect stylistic established norms (see Wiki Manual of Style8) and shared social working ethics (see Wikiquette9), diversity and controversy are erased and the official requested style is respected within the open editing system.",
        "Nevertheless, technological advantages offered by collaborative software, reinforce the variety, the quick updating and interconnection of the information provided by the contributors’ multitude.",
        "Their voices, even if individually, originally and democratically expressed in the CMC wiki community, are merged and homogenized in the articles’ neutrality and formality.",
        "Linguistic analysis cannot be separated from the investigation of the main philosophical and political goals of Wikipedia whose main aim is to pursue freedom of content and information expressed through the Wikipedian “Collective” (Lèvy, 1994) and “Connective” Intelligence (de Kerckove, 1997) in this new acentric rhizomatic environment10 (Deleuze-Guattari, 1980).",
        "Encyclopaedia Britannica is a knowledge compendium without any political meaning hosted by a commercial website (.com).",
        "In the 18th century, the original French “Encyclopédie” from Diderot and D’Alambert was mainly a political project designed to propagate the ideas of Enlightenment and to establish the reign of reason in Europe (Soufron, 2004).",
        "Similarly, Wikipedia in the current I.C.T.",
        "age, can be considered as a post-modern Encyclopaedia, a copyleft reference work with a non-profit cultural goal (.org) affording a political project rather than merely a scientific one.",
        "It is aimed at changing the society of the 21st century by giving control over content to everyone and thus enhancing freedom of expression and recovering the original aim of the World Wide Web inventor: Sir Tim Berners Lee wanted the web to be a boundless library of Babel and not a global supermarket as it has become in the dot.com era."
