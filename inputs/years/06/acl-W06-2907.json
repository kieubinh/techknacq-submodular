        "Lexical substitution - the task of replacing a word with another one that conveys the same meaning - is a prominent task in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications.",
        "For example, in query expansion for information retrieval a query is augmented with synonyms of the original query words, aiming to retrieve documents that contain these synonyms (Voorhees, 1994).",
        "Similarly, lexical substitutions are applied in question answering to identify answer passages that express the sought answer in different terms than the original question.",
        "In natural language generation it is common to seek lexical alternatives for the same meaning in order to reduce lexical repetitions.",
        "In general, lexical substitution aims to preserve a desired meaning while",
        "coping with the lexical variability of expressing that meaning.",
        "Lexical substitution can thus be viewed within the general framework of recognizing entailment between text segments (Dagan et al., 2005), as modeling entailment relations at the lexical level.",
        "In this paper we examine the lexical substitution problem within a specific setting of text compression for subtitle generation (Daelemans et al., 2004).",
        "Subtitle generation is the task of generating target language TV subtitles for video recordings of a source language speech.",
        "The subtitles should be of restricted length, which is often shorter than the full translation of the original speech, yet they should maintain as much as possible the meaning of the original content.",
        "In a typical (automated) subtitling process the original speech is first translated fully into the target language and then the target translation is compressed to optimize the length requirements.",
        "One of the techniques employed in the text compression phase is to replace a target language word in the original translation with a shorter synonym of it, thus reducing the character length of the subtitle.",
        "This is a typical lexical substitution task, which resembles similar operations in other text compression and generation tasks (e.g. (Knight and Marcu, 2002)).",
        "This paper investigates the task of assigning likelihood scores for the correctness of such lexical substitutions, in which words in the original translation are replaced with shorter synonyms.",
        "In our experiments we use WordNet as a source of candidate synonyms for substitution.",
        "The goal is to score the likelihood that the substitution is admissible, i.e. yielding a valid sentence that preserves the original meaning.",
        "The focus of this paper is thus to utilize the subtitling setting in order to investigate lexical sub",
        "stitution models in isolation, unlike most previous literature in which this subtask has been embedded in larger systems and was not evaluated directly.",
        "We examine four statistical scoring models, of two types.",
        "Context independent models score the general likelihood that the original word is “replaceable” with the candidate synonym, in an arbitrary context.",
        "That is, trying to filter relatively bizarre synonyms, often of rare senses, which are abundant in WordNet but are unlikely to yield valid substitutions.",
        "Contextual models score the “fitness” of the replacing word within the context of the sentence, in order to filter out synonyms of senses of the original word that are not the right sense in the given context.",
        "We set up an experiment using actual subtitling data and human judgements and evaluate the different scoring methods.",
        "Our findings suggest the dominance, in this setting, of generic context-independent scoring.",
        "In particular, considering distributional similarity amongst WordNet synonyms seems effective for identifying candidate substitutions that are indeed likely to be applicable in actual texts.",
        "Thus, while distributional similarity alone is known to be too noisy as a sole basis for meaning-preserving substitutions, its combination with WordNet allows reducing the noise caused by the many WordNet synonyms that are unlikely to correspond to valid substitutions."

        "3.1.1 WordNet based Sense Frequencies (semcor)",

        "For a given source word u and target synonym v the score is calculated as the percentage of occurrences of u in SemCor for which the annotated synset contains v (i.e. u’s occurrences in which its sense is synonymous with v).",
        "This corresponds to the prior probability estimate that an occurrence of u (in an arbitrary context) is actually a synonym of v. Therefore it is suitable as a prior score for lexical substitution.3",

        "For example, in many situations the word answer is in the sense of a statement that is made in reply to a question or request.",
        "In such cases, such as in example 2 from Table 1, answer can be successfully replaced with reply yielding a substitution which conveys the original meaning.",
        "However, in situations such as in example 1 the word answer is in the sense of a general solution and cannot be replaced with reply.",
        "This is also the case in examples 4 and 5 in which subject does not appear in the sense of topic or theme.",
        "Having an inappropriate sense, however, is not the only reason for incorrect substitutions.",
        "In example 8 approach appears in a sense which is synonymous with attack and in example 9 problem appears in a sense which is synonymous with a quite uncommon use of the word job.",
        "Nevertheless, these substitutions were judged as unacceptable since the desired sense of the target word after the substitution is not very clear from the context.",
        "In many other cases, such as in example 7, though semantically correct, the substitution was judged as incorrect due to stylistic considerations.",
        "Finally, there are cases, such as in example 6 in which the source word is part of a collocation and cannot be replaced with semantically equivalent words.",
        "When analyzing the mistakes of the distributional similarity method it seems as if many were not necessarily due to the method itself but rather to implementation issues.",
        "The online source we used contains only the top most similar words for any word.",
        "In many cases substitutions were assigned a score of zero since they were not listed among the top scoring similar words in the database.",
        "Furthermore, the corpus that was used for training the similarity scores was news articles in American English spelling and does not always supply good scores to words of British spelling in our BBC dataset (e.g. analyse, behavioural, etc.).",
        "The similarity based method seems to perform better than the SemCor based method since, as noted above, even when the source word is in the appropriate sense it not necessarily substitutable with the target.",
        "For this reason we hypothesize that applying Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) methods to",
        "classify the specific WordNet sense of the source and target words may have only a limited impact on performance.",
        "Overall, context independent models seem to perform relatively well since many candidate synonyms are a priori not substitutable.",
        "This demonstrates that such models are able to filter out many quirky WordNet synonyms, such as problem and job.",
        "Fitness to the sentence context seems to be a less frequent factor and not that trivial to model.",
        "Local context (adjacent words) seems to play more of a role than the broader sentence context.",
        "However, these two types of contexts were not distinguished in the bag-of-words representations of the two contextual methods that we examined.",
        "It will be interesting to investigate in future research using different feature types for local and global context, as commonly done for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD).",
        "Yet, it would still remain a challenging task to correctly distinguish, for example, the contexts for which answer is substitutable by reply (as in example 2) from contexts in which it is not (as in example 1).",
