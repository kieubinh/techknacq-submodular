        "Distributional approaches to grammar induction exploit the principle of substitutability: constituents of the same type may be exchanged with one another without affecting the syntax of the surrounding context.",
        "Reversing this notion, if we can identify “surrounding context” by observation, we can hypothesize that word sequences occurring in that context will be constituents of the same type.",
        "Thus, distributional methods can be used to segment text into constituents and classify the results.",
        "This work focuses on distributional learning from raw text.",
        "Various models of distributional analysis have been used to induce syntactic structure, but most use probabilistic metrics to decide between candidate constituents.",
        "We show that the efficiency of these systems can be improved by exploiting some properties of probable constituents, but also that this reliance on probability is problematic for learning from text.",
        "As a consequence, we propose an extension to strict distributional learning that incorporates more information about constituent boundaries.",
        "The remainder of this paper describes our experiences with a heuristic system for grammar induction.",
        "We begin with a discussion of previous distributional approaches to grammar induction in Section 2 and describe their implications in Section 3.",
        "We then introduce a heuristic distributional system in Section 4, which we analyze empirically against a treebank.",
        "Poor system performance leads us to examine actual constituent-context distributions (Section 5), the implications of which motivate a more structured extension to our learning system, which we describe and analyze in Section 6."

        "From this alignment pattern, we can extract context-free grammar rules:",
        "While the definition of expression is straightforward, the definition of context is problematic.",
        "We would like as much context as possible, but word-sequence contexts become less probable as their length increases, making learning harder.",
        "Therefore, simple models of context are preferred, although the precise definition varies between systems.",
        "Distributional approaches to grammar induction fall into two categories, depending on their treatment of nested structure.",
        "The first category covers Expectation-Maximization (EM) systems.",
        "These systems propose constituents based on analysis of text, then select a non-contradictory combination of constituents for each sentence that maximizes a given metric, usually parsing probability.",
        "EM has the advantage that constituent probabilities are only compared when constituents compete, which removes the inherent bias towards shorter constituents, which tend to have higher probability.",
        "However, EM methods are more susceptible to data sparsity issues associated with raw text, because there is no generalization during constituent proposal.",
        "Examples of EM learning systems are Context Distribution Clustering (CDC) (Clark, 2001) and Constituent-Context Model (CCM) (Klein, 2005, Chapter 5), which avoid the aforementioned data-sparsity issues by using a part-of-speech (POS) tagged corpus, rather than raw text.",
        "Alignment Based Learning (ABL) (van Zaanen, 2000) is the only EM system applied directly to raw text.",
        "ABL uses minimal String-Edit Distance between sentences to propose constituents, from which the most probable combination is chosen.",
        "However, ABL is relatively inefficient and has only been applied to small corpora.",
        "The second category is that of incremental learning systems.",
        "An incremental system analyzes a corpus in a bottom-up fashion: each time a new constituent type is found, it is inserted into the corpus to provide data for later learning.",
        "This has the advantage of easing the data-sparsity issues described above because infrequent sequences are clustered into more frequent non-terminal symbols.",
        "However, in incremental systems, constituents are compared directly, which can lead to a bias towards shorter constituents.",
        "The EMILE system (Adriaans, 1999) learns shallow languages in an incremental manner, and has been applied to natural language under the assumption that such languages are shallow.",
        "Shallowness is the property whereby, for any constituent type in a language, there exist well-supported minimal units of that type.",
        "EMILE aligns complete sentences only, attempting to isolate minimal units, which are then used to process longer sequences.",
        "This method is efficient because alignment is non-recursive.",
        "However, as a consequence, EMILE offers only a limited treatment of nested and recursive structures.",
        "A more comprehensive approach to learning nested structure is found in the ADIOS system (Solan et al., 2003).",
        "ADIOS enumerates all patterns of a given length, under the condition that each sequence must have non-empty contexts and expressions.",
        "These patterns are ranked using an information gain metric, and the best pattern at each iteration is rewritten into the graph, before pattern scanning begins again.",
        "ADIOS learns context-sensitive equivalence classes, but does not induce grammars, and has not been formally evaluated against treebanks.",

        "The above systems have been evaluated with respect to the ATIS treebank.",
        "Compared with supervised parsers, these systems perform relatively poorly, with the strictly unsupervised EMILE and ABL systems recovering 16.8% and 35.6% of constituent structure respectively.",
        "The partially-supervised systems of CDC and CCM perform better, with the latter retrieving 47.6% of the constituent structure in ATIS.",

        "There are many issues with distributional learning, especially when learning from raw text.",
        "First, previous systems hypothesize and select constituents according to the probability of their contexts: ABL, EMILE and CCM use the probability of proposed equivalence classes, or the equivalent context probability; ADIOS uses an information gain metric, again favouring probable contexts.",
        "However, when learning from raw text, this preference for hypotheses with more probable contexts means that open-class words will seldom be considered as contexts.",
        "In POS-based learners, it is possible to align open-class POS contexts.",
        "These contexts are demonstrably important despite low word probabilities, which suggests that selecting contexts on the basis of probability will be limited in success.",
        "The second problem relates to word-senses.",
        "Alignment proceeds by matching orthographic types, but these types can have numerous associated syntactic senses.",
        "For example, ‘to’ plays two distinct roles: infinitive marker or preposition.",
        "If we align using the orthographic type, we will often misalign words, as seen in the following alignment: in the grey jacket John agreed to Here, we are (mis)aligning a prepositional ‘to’, with an infinitive marker.",
        "The result would be a correctly identified noun-phrase, ‘the man’, and an incorrect structure, contradicting both the verb-group ‘to see’ and the noun-phrase ‘me’.",
        "This problem does not affect POS-based learning systems, as POS tags are unambiguously assigned.",
        "Finally, grammar induction systems are typically inefficient, which prohibits training over large corpora.",
        "Distributional analysis is an expensive procedure, and must be performed for large numbers of word sequences.",
        "Previous approaches have tended to enumerate all alignment patterns, of which the best are selected using probabilistic metrics.",

        "Rather than enumerating all word sequences in a corpus, we propose a heuristic for guiding distributional systems towards more favourable alignment patterns, in a system called Directed Alignment.",
        "In this system, we define context as the ordered pair of left and right-context for a given constituent, (Cleft – C�ight), where Cleft and C�ight are single-units.",
        "The atomic units of this system are words, but learned constituents may also act as context-units.",
        "The probability of a pattern depends primarily on its contexts, since they are common to all matching sequences.",
        "We can reduce the task of finding probable alignments to simply finding probable context-pairs.",
        "However, we can reduce this further: for a context-pair to be probable, its components must also be probable.",
        "Therefore, rather than enumerating all patterns in the corpus, we direct the alignment procedure towards patterns where Cleft and C�ight are probable.",
        "The first stage of direction creates an index for the corpus, compiling a list of unit types, where units are initially words.",
        "From this list of types, the most probable 1% are selected as context-units.",
        "These context-units are the only types allowed to fill the roles Cleft and C�ight in alignment patterns.",

        "For each context-unit token cu in the index, we locate cu in the corpus and create an alignment pattern, such that cu is the left context (Cleft).",
        "Next, we scan the sequence of words following cu, extending the alignment pattern until another context-unit cu' is found, or a fixed length threshold is exceeded.",
        "If cu' is found, it fills the role of right context (C�ight), and the completed alignment pattern is cached; otherwise, the pattern is disregarded.",
        "Direction permits two forms of valid expressions in the context (cu – cu'):",
        "1. nci ... ncn, where each nci is a non-context 2. ci ... cn, where each ci is a context-unit",
        "The first of these forms allows us to examine non-nested alignments.",
        "The second allows us to analyze nested alignments only after inner constituents have been learned.",
        "These constraints reduce the number of constituents under consideration at any time to a manageable level.",
        "As a result, we can scan very large numbers of alignment patterns with relatively little overhead.",
        "As an example, consider the following sequence, with context units underlined: This would be broken into non-recursive expressions2: (put) the (whole egg) , all the (seasonings) and (vegetables) into the (bowl) and (process) for (10 seconds) until (smoothly pureed) .",

        "Following this generalization nested structures can be discovered using the same process.",

        "We have presented an incremental grammar induction system that uses heuristics to improve the efficiency of distributional learning.",
        "However, in tests over a large corpus, we have shown that it is capable of learning only a small subset of constituent structure.",
        "We have analyzed actual constituent-context distributions to explain these limitations.",
        "This analysis provides the motivation for a more structured learning method, which incorporates knowledge of verifiable constituent boundaries - the starts and ends of sentences.",
        "This improved system performs significantly better, with a 75% increase in recall over distributional methods, and a significant improvement at retrieving structures that are problematic for distributional methods alone."
