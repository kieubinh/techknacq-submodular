        "There is substantial literature on the evaluation of systems in the context of real users and/or realistic problems.",
        "The overall design issues were presented by Tague-Sutcliffe (1992) in a classic paper.",
        "Other authors who have contributed substantially to the discussion include Hersh and Over (2001).",
        "The basic change in viewpoint required, in the study of interactive systems with real users, is that one cannot follow the Cranfield Model, in which specific items (whether documents, or snippets of information) are known to be “good,” so that measures can be based on the count of such items (e.g., precision and recall).",
        "Instead, one must develop methods and metrics that are sensitive to individual users, tasks and contexts, and robust enough to allow for valid and reliable comparisons across systems.",
        "Most evaluations of QA systems have been conducted as part of the QA Track at TREC.",
        "They are system-oriented rather than user-oriented, with a focus on evaluating techniques for answer extraction, rather than interaction and use (Voorhees, 2003).",
        "In this paper, we consider an interactive system to be a system that supports at least one exchange between the user and system.",
        "Further, an interactive system is a system that allows the user full or partial control over content and action.",
        "While factoid QA plays a role in analytical QA, analytical QA also includes other activities, such as comparison and synthesis, and demands much richer interactions between the system, the information, and the user.",
        "Thus different evaluation measures are needed for analytical QA systems than for those supporting factoid QA.",
        "Emerging work in the QA community is addressing user interaction with factoid-based QA systems and other more complex QA tasks (Diekema, et al., 2004; Liddy, et al., 2004), but developing robust evaluation methods and metrics for interactive, analytical QA systems in realistic settings with target users and tasks remains an unresolved research problem.",
        "We describe a large-scale evaluation of four interactive QA systems with target users, completing target tasks.",
        "Here we present the evaluation method and design decisions for each aspect of the study as a case study.",
        "The goal of this paper is to identify key issues in the design of evaluations of interactive QA systems and help others construct their own evaluations.",
        "While systems participating in this evaluation received individual feedback about the performances of their systems, the purpose of the project was not to compare a series of systems and declare a ‘winner.’ In this paper we focus on the method and results of that method, rather than the performance of any one system.",
        "In section 2, we describe our evaluation approach, the evaluation environment, systems studied, subjects, corpus and scenarios, and",
        "experimental design.",
        "In Section 3 we report our instruments and other data collection techniques.",
        "In Section 4 we discuss our evaluation methods, and present key findings regarding the effectiveness of the various evaluation techniques.",
        "We conclude by considering future research directions for interactive QA evaluation."

        "The researchers spent approximately 3 weeks onsite preparing and administering the workshop.",
        "Intelligence analysts, the study participants, spent 2 weeks onsite.",
        "The evaluation employed 8 analysts, 8 scenarios in the chemical/biological WMD domain, and 4 systems – 3 QA systems and a Google1 baseline system.",
        "Each analyst used each system to analyze 2 scenarios and wrote a pseudo-report containing enough structure and content for it to be judged by peer analysts.",

        "It is important to note that analysis of qualitative data is costly – interviews were transcribed and training is needed to analyze and interpret data.",
        "Training is also necessary to conduct such interviews.",
        "Because researchers are essentially the ‘instrument’ it is important to learn to moderate one’s own beliefs and behaviors while interviewing.",
        "It is particularly important that interviewers not be seen by their interviewees as “invested in” any particular system; having individuals who are not system developers conduct interviews is essential.",
        "The SmiFro Console was not effective as implemented.",
        "Capturing analysts’ in situ thoughts with minimal disruption remains a challenge.",
        "Although SmiFro Console was not particularly effective, status report data was easy to obtain and somewhat effective, but defied analysis.",
        "Cross evaluation of reports was a sensitive and reliable method for evaluating product.",
        "Complementing questionnaires, it is a good method for assessing the quality of the analysts’ work products.",
        "The method is somewhat costly in terms of analysts’ time (contributing approximately 8% of the total time required from subjects), and analysis requires skill in statistical methods.",
        "System logs answered several questions not addressable with other methods including the Glass Box.",
        "However, logging is expensive, rarely reusable, and often unruly when extracting particular measures.",
        "Development of a standard logging format for interactive QA systems is advisable.",
        "The Glass Box provided data on user interaction across all systems at various levels of granularity.",
        "The cost of collection is low but the cost of analysis is probably prohibitive in most cases.",
        "NIST’s previous experience using Glass Box allowed for more rapid extraction, analysis and interpretation of data, which remained a very time consuming and laborious process.",
        "Other commercial tools are available that capture some of the same data and we recommend that research teams evaluate such tools for their own evaluations.",
        "Hypotheses.",
        "We started this study with hypotheses about the types of interactions that a good QA system should support.",
        "Of course, different methods were more or less appropriate for assessing different hypotheses.",
        "Table 4 displays part of our results with respect to the example hypotheses presented above in Table 1.",
        "For each of the example hypotheses provided in Table 1, we show",
        "Table 4: Most effective methods for gathering data about example hypotheses (see Table 1).",
        "Although not reported here, we note that the performance of each of the systems evaluated in this study varied according to hypothesis; in particular, some systems did well according to some hypotheses and poor according to others.",
        "Interaction.",
        "Finally, while the purposes of this paper were to present our evaluation method for interactive question answering systems, our instruments elicited interesting results about analysts’ perceptions of interaction.",
        "Foremost among them, users of interactive systems expect systems to exhibit behaviors which can be characterized as understanding what the user is looking for, what the user has done and what the user knows.",
        "Analysts in this study expected interactive systems to track their actions over time, both with the system and with information."

        "We have sketched a method for evaluating interactive analytic question answering system, identified key design decisions that developers must make in conducting their own evaluations, and described the effectiveness of some of our methods.",
        "Clearly, each evaluation situation is different, and it is difficult to develop one-size-fits-all evaluation strategies, especially for interactive systems.",
        "However, there are many opportunities for developing shared frameworks and an infrastructure for evaluation.",
        "In particular, the development of scenarios and corpora are expensive and should be shared.",
        "The creation of sharable questionnaires and other instruments that are customizable to individual systems can also contribute to an infrastructure for interactive QA evaluation.",
        "We believe that important opportunities exist through interactive QA evaluation for understanding more about the interactive QA process and developing extensive theoretical and empirical foundations for research.",
        "We encourage system developers to think beyond independent system evaluation for narrow purposes, and conduct evaluations that create and inform theoretical and empirical foundations for interactive question answering research that will outlive individual systems.",
        "Although we do not have space here to detail the templates, instruments, and analytical schemas used in this study, we hope that the methods and metrics developed in connection with our study are a first step in this direction3.",
        "We plan to publish the full set of results from this study in the future."
