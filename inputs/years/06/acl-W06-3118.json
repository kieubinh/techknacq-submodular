      "text": [
        "Phrase-based SMT relies on conditional distributions p(s1t) and p(t1s) that are derived from the joint frequencies c(s, t) of source/target phrase pairs observed in an aligned parallel corpus.",
        "Traditionally, relative-frequency estimation is used to derive conditional distributions, ie p(slt) = c(s, t)/ Ps c(s, t).",
        "However, relative-frequency estimation has the well-known problem of favouring rare events.",
        "For instance, any phrase pair whose constituents occur only once in the corpus will be assigned a probability of 1, almost certainly higher than the probabilities of pairs for which much more evidence exists.",
        "During translation, rare pairs can directly compete with overlapping frequent pairs, so overestimating their probabilities can significantly degrade performance.",
        "To address this problem, we implemented two simple smoothing strategies.",
        "The first is based on the Good-Turing technique as described in (Church and Gale, 1991).",
        "This replaces each observed joint frequency c with cg = (c + 1)n�+1/n�, where n, is the number of distinct pairs with frequency c (smoothed for large c).",
        "It also assigns a total count mass of n1 to unseen pairs, which we distributed in proportion to the frequency of each conditioning",
        "New York City, June 2006. c�2006 Association for Computational Linguistics",
        "where p(t) = c(t)/ Et c(t).",
        "The estimates for pg (tls) are analogous.",
        "The second strategy is Kneser-Ney smoothing (Kneser and Ney, 1995), using the interpolated variant described in (Chen and Goodman., 1998):1",
        "where D = n1/(n1 + 2n2), n1+(*, t) is the number of distinct phrases s with which t co-occurs, and pk(s) = n1+(s, *)/ Es n1+(s, *), with n1+(s, *) analogous to n1+(*, t).",
        "Our approach to phrase-table smoothing contrasts to previous work (Zens and Ney, 2004) in which smoothed phrase probabilities are constructed from word-pair probabilities and combined in a log-linear model with an unsmoothed phrase-table.",
        "We believe the two approaches are complementary, so a combination of both would be worth exploring in future work."

      "text": [
        "In a recent paper (Kuhn et al., 2006), we presented a new class of probabilistic ”Segment Choice Models” (SCMs) for distortion in phrase-based systems.",
        "In some situations, SCMs will assign a better distortion score to a drastic reordering of the source sentence than to no reordering; in this, SCMs differ from the conventional penalty-based distortion, which always favours less rather than more distortion.",
        "We developed a particular kind of SCM based on decision trees (DTs) containing both questions of a positional type (e.g., questions about the distance of a given phrase from the beginning of the source sentence or from the previously translated phrase) and word-based questions (e.g., questions about the presence or absence of given words in a specified phrase).",

        "to pairs s, t for which c(s, t) > 0, since these are the only ones considered by the decoder.",
        "segment-aligned corpus is obtained by training a phrase translation model on a large bilingual corpus and then using it (in conjunction with a distortion penalty) to carry out alignments between the phrases in the source-language sentence and those in the corresponding target-language sentence in a second bilingual corpus.",
        "Typically, the first corpus (on which the phrase translation model is trained) is the same as the second corpus (on which alignment is carried out).",
        "To avoid overfitting, the alignment algorithm is leave-one-out: statistics derived from a particular sentence pair are not used to align that sentence pair.",
        "Note that the experiments reported in (Kuhn et al., 2006) focused on translation of Chinese into English.",
        "The interest of the experiments reported here on WMT data was to see if the feature-rich DT-based distortion model could be useful for MT between other language pairs."
