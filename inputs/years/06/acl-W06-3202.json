        "In language technology applications, unknown words are a continuous problem.",
        "Especially, Text-to-speech (TTS) systems like those described in Sproat (1998) depend on the correct pronunciation of those words.",
        "Most of these systems use large pronunciation dictionaries to overcome this problem.",
        "However, the lexicons are finite and every natural language has productive word formation processes.",
        "Thus, a TTS system needs a module which converts letters to sounds and a second module which syllabifies these sound sequences.",
        "The syllabification information is important to assign the stress status of the syllable, to calculate the phone duration (Van Santen et al.",
        "(1997)), and to apply phonological rules (Kahn (1976), Blevins (1995)).",
        "Many automatic syllabification methods have been suggested e.g., (Daelemans and van den Bosch, 1992; Van den Bosch, 1997; Kiraz and M¨obius, 1998; Vroomen et al., 1998; M¨uller, 2001; Marchand et al., to appear 2006).",
        "M¨uller (2001) shows that incorporating syllable structure improves the prediction of syllable boundaries.",
        "The syllabification accuracy increases if the onset and coda is more fine-grained (M¨uller, 2002).",
        "However, she only incorporates partial phonotactic knowledge in her approach.",
        "For instance, her models cannot express that the phoneme /l/ is more likely to occur after an /s/ than after a /t/ in English.",
        "The information that a phoneme is very probable in a certain position (here, the /l/ appears as second consonant in a two-consonantal onset cluster) will not suffice to express English phonotactics of an entire consonant cluster.",
        "Moreover, she Abstract We report on a series of experiments with probabilistic context-free grammars predicting English and German syllable structure.",
        "The treebank-trained grammars are evaluated on a syllabification task.",
        "The grammar used by M¨uller (2002) serves as point of comparison.",
        "As she evaluates the grammar only for German, we reimplement the grammar and experiment with additional phonotactic features.",
        "Using bi-grams within the syllable, we can model the dependency from the previous consonant in the onset and coda.",
        "A 10- fold cross validation procedure shows that syllabification can be improved by incorporating this type of phonotactic knowledge.",
        "Compared to the grammar of M¨uller (2002), syllable boundary accuracy increases from 95.8% to 97.2% for English, and from 95.9% to 97.2% for German.",
        "Moreover, our experiments with different syllable structures point out that there are dependencies between the onset on the nucleus for German but not for English.",
        "The analysis of one of our phonotactic grammars shows that interesting phonotactic constraints are learned.",
        "For instance, unvoiced consonants are the most likely first consonants and liquids and glides are preferred as second consonants in two-consonantal onsets.",
        "only reports the performance of the German grammar.",
        "Thus, we are interested if the detection of syllable boundaries can be improved for both English and German by adding further phonotactic knowledge to a grammar.",
        "Phonotactic constraints within the onset or coda seem to be important for various tasks.",
        "Listeners indeed use phonotactic knowledge from their mother language in various listening situations.",
        "Vitevitch and Luce (1999), e.g., showed if English speakers have to rate nonsense words how “English-like” the stimuli are, highly probable phonotactic stimuli were rated more “English-like” than stimuli with a lower probability.",
        "Speakers make also use of their phonotactic knowledge when they have to segment a sequence into words.",
        "In a words spotting task, Weber and Cutler (2006) found evidence that speakers of American English can segment words much easier when the sequence contains phonotactic constraints of their own language.",
        "Beside many perception experiments which show that phonotactic constraints are useful information, many different methods have been suggested to model phonotactic constraints for language technology applications.",
        "Krenn (1997), for instance, uses Hidden Markov Models to tag syllable structure.",
        "The model decides whether a phoneme belongs to the onset, nucleus or coda.",
        "However, this model does not incorporate fine-grained phonotac-tics.",
        "Belz (2000) uses finite state automatons (FSA) to model phonotactic structure of different syllable types.",
        "We use similar positional features of syllables.",
        "Moreover, Carson-Berndsen (1998) and Carson-Berndsen et al.",
        "(2004) focus on automatically acquiring feature-based phonotactics by induction of automata which can be used in speech recognition.",
        "In our approach, we concentrate on explicit phonotactic grammars as we want to test different suggestions about the internal structure of words from phonological approaches (e.g. Kessler and Treiman (1997)).",
        "We assume, for instance, that codas depend on the previous nucleus and that onsets depend on the subsequent nucleus.",
        "In this paper, we present experiments on a series of context-free grammars which integrate step by step more phonological structure.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: we first introduce our grammar development approach.",

        "The rhyme is rewritten by the nucleus and the coda.",
        "Onset or coda could be empty.",
        "Furthermore, all grammar versions differentiate between monosyllabic and polysyllabic words.",
        "In polysyllabic words, the syllables are divided into syllables appearing word-initially, word-medially, and word-finally.",
        "Additionally, the grammars distinguish between consonant clusters of different sizes (ranging from one to five consonants).",
        "We assume that phonotactic knowledge within the onset and coda can help to solve a syllabification task.",
        "Hence, we change the rules of the syllable complexity grammar (M¨uller, 2002) such that phonotactic dependencies are modeled.",

        "Her approach differs in two ways.",
        "First, she only evaluates the German grammar and second she trains on a newspaper corpus.",
        "As we are interested in how her grammars perform on our corpus, we reimplemented her grammars and tested both in our 10-fold cross evaluation procedure.",
        "We find that the first grammar (M¨uller, 2001) achieves 85.45% word accuracy, 88.94% syllable accuracy and 94.37% syllable boundary accuracy for English and 84.21%, 90.86%, 95.36% for German respectively.",
        "The results show that the syllable boundary accuracy increases from 94,37% to 97.2% for English and from 95.3% to 97.2% for German.",
        "The experiments point out that phonotactic knowledge is a valuable source of information for syllabification."

        "Phonotactic restrictions are important for language perception and production.",
        "They influence the ability of children to segment words, and they help to recognize words in nonsense sequences.",
        "In this paper, we presented grammars which incorporate phonotactic restrictions.",
        "The grammars were trained and tested on a German and an English pronunciation dictionary.",
        "Our experiments show that English and German profit from phonotactic knowledge to predict syllable boundaries.",
        "We find evidence that German codas depend on the nucleus which does not apply for English.",
        "The English grammars which model the dependency of part of the onset or coda on the nucleus worsen the syllabification accuracy.",
        "However, the combination of both show a better performance than the base phonotactic grammar.",
        "This suggests that there are constrains in the selection of the onset and coda consonants."
