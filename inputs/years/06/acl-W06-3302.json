        "There is thus an urgent need for better access to current data and the various domains of expertise.",
        "Key considerations for improving information access include: 1) accessibility to different types of users; 2) high precision; 3) ease of use; 4) transparent retrieval across heterogeneous data sources; and 5) accommodation of rapid language change in the domain.",
        "Natural language searching refers to approaches that enable users to express queries in explicit phrases, sentences, or questions.",
