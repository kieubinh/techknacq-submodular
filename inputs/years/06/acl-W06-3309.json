        "Certain types of text follow a predictable structure, the knowledge of which would be useful in many natural language processing applications.",
        "As an example, scientific abstracts across many different",
        "fields generally follow the pattern of “introduction”, “methods”, “results”, and “conclusions” (Salanger-Meyer, 1990; Swales, 1990; Or�asan, 2001).",
        "The ability to explicitly identify these sections in unstructured text could play an important role in applications such as document summarization (Teufel and Moens, 2000), information retrieval (Tbahriti et al., 2005), information extraction (Mizuta et al., 2005), and question answering.",
        "Although there is a trend towards analysis of full article texts, we believe that abstracts still provide a tremendous amount of information, and much value can still be extracted from them.",
        "For example, Gay et al.",
        "(2005) experimented with abstracts and full article texts in the task of automatically generating index term recommendations and discovered that using full article texts yields at most a 7.4% improvement in F-score.",
        "Demner-Fushman et al.",
        "(2005) found a correlation between the quality and strength of clinical conclusions in the full article texts and abstracts.",
        "This paper presents experiments with generative content models for analyzing the discourse structure of medical abstracts, which has been confirmed to follow the four-section pattern discussed above (Salanger-Meyer, 1990).",
        "For a variety of reasons, medicine is an interesting domain of research.",
        "The need for information systems to support physicians at the point of care has been well studied (Covell et al., 1985; Gorman et al., 1994; Ely et al., 2005).",
        "Retrieval techniques can have a large impact on how physicians access and leverage clinical evidence.",
        "Information that satisfies physicians’ needs can be found in the MEDLINE database maintained by the U.S. National Library of Medicine",
        "(NLM), which also serves as a readily available corpus of abstracts for our experiments.",
        "Furthermore, the availability of rich ontological resources, in the form of the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) (Lindberg et al., 1993), and the availability of software that leverages this knowledge – MetaM ap (Aronson, 2001) for concept identification and SemRep (Rindflesch and Fiszman, 2003) for relation extraction – provide a foundation for studying the role of semantics in various tasks.",
        "McKnight and Srinivasan (2003) have previously examined the task of categorizing sentences in medical abstracts using supervised discriminative machine learning techniques.",
        "Building on the work of Ruch et al.",
        "(2003) in the same domain, we present a generative approach that attempts to directly model the discourse structure of MEDLINE abstracts using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs); cf. (Barzilay and Lee, 2004).",
        "Although our results were not obtained from the same exact collection as those used by authors of these two previous studies, comparable experiments suggest that our techniques are competitive in terms of performance, and may offer additional advantages as well.",
        "Discriminative approaches (especially SVMs) have been shown to be very effective for many supervised classification tasks; see, for example, (Joachims, 1998; Ng and Jordan, 2001).",
        "However, their high computational complexity (quadratic in the number of training samples) renders them prohibitive for massive data processing.",
        "Under certain conditions, generative approaches with linear complexity are preferable, even if their performance is lower than that which can be achieved through discriminative training.",
        "Since HMMs are very well-suited to modeling sequences, our discourse modeling task lends itself naturally to this particular generative approach.",
        "In fact, we demonstrate that HMMs are competitive with SVMs, with the added advantage of lower computational complexity.",
        "In addition, generative models can be directly applied to tackle certain classes of problems, such as sentence ordering, in ways that discriminative approaches cannot readily.",
        "In the context of machine learning, we see our work as contributing to the ongoing debate between generative and discriminative approaches – we provide a case study in an interesting domain that begins to explore some of these tradeoffs."

        "In our test collection, we observed a total of 2688 unique section headings in structured abstracts – these were manually mapped to the four broad classes of “introduction”, “methods”, “results”, and “conclusions”.",
        "All sentences falling under a section heading were assigned the label of its appropriately-mapped heading (naturally, the actual section headings were removed in our test collection).",

        "RESULTS– At follow-up, DOIT evidenced a significantly greater drop in A1c than EDUPOST.",
        "DOIT patients also reported significantly more frequent blood glucose monitoring and greater attention to carbohydrate and fat contents (ACFC) of food compared with EDUPOST patients.",
        "An increase in ACFC over the 6-month period was associated with improved glycemic control among DOIT patients.",
        "Also, the frequency of nurse case manager follow-up contacts was positively linked to better A1c outcomes.",
        "The addition of insulin did not appear to be a significant contributor to glycemic change.",
        "CONCLUSIONS– DOIT appears to be effective in promoting better diabetes care and positively influencing glycemia and diabetes-related self-care behaviors.",

        "All words in the training set were downcased, all numbers were converted into a generic symbol, and all singleton unigrams and bi-grams were removed.",
        "Using these results, each sentence was converted into a four dimensional vector, where each component represents the log probability, divided by the number of words, of the sentence under each of the four language models.",

        "For testing, we performed a Viterbi (maximum likelihood) estimation of the label of each test sentence/vector (also using the HTK toolkit).",

        "An interesting aspect of our generative approach is that we model HMM outputs as Gaussian vectors (log probabilities of observing entire sentences based on our language models), as opposed to sequences of terms, as done in (Barzilay and Lee, 2004).",
        "This technique provides two important advantages.",
        "First, Gaussian modeling adds an extra degree of freedom during training, by capturing second-order statistics.",
        "This is not possible when modeling word sequences, where only the probability of a sentence is actually used in the HMM training.",
        "Second, using continuous distributions allows us to leverage a variety of tools (e.g., LDA) that have been shown to be successful in other fields, such as speech recognition (Evermann et al., 2004).",
        "Table 2(b) represents the closest head-to-head comparison between our generative approach (HMM with LDA) and state-of-the-art results reported by M&S using SVMs.",
        "In some ways, the results reported by M&S have an advantage because they use significantly more training examples.",
        "Yet, we can see that generative techniques for the modeling of content structure are at least competitive – we even outperform SVMs on detecting “methods” and “results”.",
        "Moreover, the fact that the training and testing of HMMs have linear complexity (as opposed to the quadratic complexity of SVMs) makes our approach a very attractive alternative, given the amount of training data that is available for such experiments.",
        "Although exploration of the tradeoffs between generative and discriminative machine learning techniques is one of the aims of this work, our ultimate goal, however, is to build clinical systems that provide timely access to information essential to the patient treatment process.",
        "In truth, our cross-validation experiments do not correspond to any meaningful naturally-occurring task – structured abstracts are, after all, already appropriately labeled.",
        "The true utility of content models is to structure abstracts that have no structure to begin with.",
        "Thus, our exploratory experiments in applying content models trained with structured RCTs on unstructured RCTs is a closer approximation of an extrinsically-valid measure of performance.",
        "Such a component would serve as the first stage of a clinical question answering system (Demner-Fushman and Lin, 2005) or summarization system (McKe-own et al., 2003).",
        "We chose to focus on randomized controlled trials because they represent the standard benchmark by which all other clinical studies are measured.",
        "Table 3(b) shows the effectiveness of our trained content models on abstracts that had no explicit structure to begin with.",
        "We can see that although classification accuracy is lower than that from our cross-validation experiments, performance is quite respectable.",
