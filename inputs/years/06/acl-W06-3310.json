        "A histogram is counted over these 180 degrees.",

        "entropy, mean, 2nd and 3rd moments are extracted to summarize the EDH.",
        "The edge-based axis features are meant to help identify images containing graphs or charts.",
        "First, Sobel edges are extracted above a sensitivity threshold of 0.10 from the gray-scale image.",
        "This yields a binary-valued intensity image with 1’s occurring in locations of all edges that exceed the threshold and 0’s occurring otherwise.",
        "Next, the vertical and horizontal sums of this intensity image are taken yielding two vectors, one for each axis.",
        "Zero values are set to one to anticipate the entropy calculations.",

        "The last image feature under consideration was the number of 8-connected regions in the binary-valued, thresholded Sobel edge image as described above for the axis features.",
        "An 8-connected region is a group of edge pixels for which each member touches another member vertically, horizontally, or diagonally in the eight adjacent pixel positions surrounding it.",
