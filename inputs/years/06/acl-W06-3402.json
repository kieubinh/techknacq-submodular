        "In this paper we investigate one approach for automatically identifying “irrelevance” in the domain of telephone conversations.",

        "We apply inductive classifier learning algorithms to identify useful features and build classifiers to automatically label utterances.",
        "We begin in Section 2 by hypothesizing features that might be useful for the identification of irrelevant regions, as indicated by research on the linguistics of conversational speech and, in particular, small talk.",
        "Next we present our data and discuss our annotation methodology.",
        "We follow this with a description of the complete set of features and machine learning algorithms investigated.",

        "Thus we hypothesize that: Utterances near the beginning or end of conversations are less likely to be relevant.",
        "Cheepen also defines speech-in-action regions to be segments of conversation that are related to the present physical world or the activity of chatting, e.g. “What lovely weather.” or “It is so nice to see you.” Since these regions mainly involve participants identifying their shared social situation, they are not likely to contain transactional content.",
        "Further, since speech-in-action segments are distinguished by their focus on the present, we hypothesize that: Utterances with present tense verbs are less likely to be relevant.",
        "Finally, small talk that is not intended to demarcate social hierarchy tends to be abbreviated, e.g. “Nice day” (Laver, 1981).",

        "Three areas of related work in natural language processing have been particularly informative for our research.",
        "First, speech act theory states that with each utterance, a conversant is committing an action, such as questioning, critiquing, or stating a fact.",
        "This is quite similar to the notion of transactional and interactional goals.",
        "However, speech acts are generally focused on the lower level of breaking apart utterances and understanding their purpose, whereas we are concerned here with a coarser-grained notion of relevance.",
        "Work closer to ours is that of Bates et al.",
        "(Bates et al., 2005), who define meeting acts for recorded meetings.",
        "Of their tags, commentary is most similar to our notion of relevance.",
        "Second, there has been research on generating small talk in order to establish rapport between an automatic system and human user (Bickmore and Cassell, 2000).",
        "Our work complements this by potentially detecting off-topic speech from the human user as an indication that the system should also respond with interactional language.",
        "Third, off-topic detection can be viewed as a segmentation of conversation into relevant and irrelevant parts.",
        "Thus our work has many similarities to topic segmentation systems, which incorporate cue words that indicate an abrupt change in topic (e.g. “so anyway...”), as well as long term variations in word occurrence statistics (Hearst, 1997; Reynar, 1999; Beeferman et al., 1999, e.g.).",
        "Our approach uses previous and subsequent sentences to approximate these ideas, but might benefit from a more explicitly segmentation-based strategy."

        "In our work we use human-transcribed conversations from the Fisher data (LDC, 2004).",
        "In each conversation, participants have been given a topic to discuss for ten minutes.",
        "Despite this, participants often talk about subjects that are not at all related to the assigned topic.",
        "Therefore, a convenient way to define irrelevance in conversations in this domain is segments which do not contribute to understanding the assigned topic.",
        "This very natural definition makes the domain a good one for initial study; however, the idea can be readily extended to other domains.",
        "For example, broadcast debates, class lectures, and meetings usually have specific topics of discussion.",
        "The primary transactional goal of participants in the telephone conversations is to discuss the assigned topic.",
        "Since this goal directly involves the act of discussion itself, it is not surprising that participants often talk about the current conversation or",
        "the choice of topic.",
        "There are enough such segments that we assign them a special region type: Metacon-versation.",
        "The purely irrelevant segments we call Small Talk, and the remaining segments are defined as On-Topic.",
        "We define utterances as segments of speech that are delineated by periods and/or speaker changes.",
        "An annotated excerpt is shown in Table 1.",
        "For the experiments described in this paper, we selected 20 conversations: 4 from each of the topics “computers in education”, “bioterrorism”, “terrorism”, “pets”, and “censorship”.",
        "These topics were chosen randomly from the 40 topics in the Fisher corpus, with the constraint that we wanted to include topics that could be a part of normal small talk (such as “pets”) as well as topics which seem farther removed from small talk (such as “censorship”).",
        "Our selected data set consists of slightly more than 5,000 utterances.",
        "We had 2-3 human annotators label the utterances in each conversation, choosing from the 3 labels Metaconversation, Small Talk, and On-Topic.",
        "On average, pairs of annotators agreed with each other on 86% of utterances.",
        "The main source of annotator disagreement was between Small Talk and On-Topic regions; in most cases this resulted from differences in opinion of when exactly the conversation had drifted too far from the topic to be relevant.",
        "For the 14% of utterances with mismatched labels, we chose the label that would be “safest” in the information retrieval context where small talk might get discarded.",
        "If any of the annotators thought a given utterance was On-Topic, we kept it On-Topic.",
        "If there was a disagreement between Metaconver-sation and Small Talk, we used Metaconversation.",
        "Thus, a Small Talk label was only placed if all annotators agreed on it."

        "Table 2 shows the most useful tokens for distinguishing between the three categories according to this metric.",
        "Additionally, we include as features the utterance type (statement, question, or fragment), number of words in the utterance, and number of laughs in the utterance.",
        "Because utterances are long enough to classify individually but too short to classify reliably, we not only consider features of the current utterance, but also those of previous and subsequent utterances.",
        "More specifically, summed features are calculated for the five preceding utterances and for the five subsequent utterances.",
        "The number five was chosen empirically.",

        "However, redundant features do not make up a significant percentage of the overall feature set.",
