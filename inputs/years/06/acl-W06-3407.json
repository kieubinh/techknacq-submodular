        "In this paper we explore the problem of topic segmentation of dialogue.",
        "Use of topic-based models of dialogue has played a role in information retrieval (Oard et al., 2004), information extraction (Baufaden, 2001), and summarization (Zechner, 2001), just to name a few applications.",
        "However, most previous work on automatic topic segmentation has focused primarily on segmentation of expository text.",
        "This paper presents a survey of the state-of-the-art in topic segmentation technology.",
        "Using the definition of topic segment from (Pas-sonneau and Litman, 1993) applied to two different dialogue corpora, we present an evaluation including a detailed error analysis, illustrating why approaches designed for expository text do not generalize well to dialogue.",
        "We first demonstrate a significant advantage of our hybrid, supervised learning approach called Museli, a multi-source evidence integration approach, over competing algorithms.",
        "We then extend the basic Museli algorithm by introducing an intermediate level of analysis based on Sinclair and Coulthard’s notion of a dialogue exchange (Sin",
        "clair and Coulthard, 1975).",
        "We show that both our baseline and Museli approaches obtain a significant improvement when using perfect, hand-labeled dialogue exchanges, typically in the order of 2-3 contributions, as the atomic discourse unit in comparison to using the contribution as the unit of analysis.",
        "We further evaluate our success towards automatic classification of exchange boundaries using the same Museli framework."

        "In the most general sense, the challenge of topic segmentation can be construed as the task of finding locations in the discourse where the focus shifts from one topic to another.",
        "Thus, it is not possible to address topic segmentation of dialogue without first addressing the question of what a “topic” is.",
        "We began with the goal of adopting a definition of topic that meets three criteria.",
        "First, it should be reproducible by human annotators.",
        "Second, it should not rely heavily on domain-specific knowledge or knowledge of the task structure.",
        "Finally, it should be grounded in generally accepted principles of discourse structure.",
        "The last point addresses a subtle, but important, criterion necessary to adequately serve downstream applications using our dialogue segmentation.",
        "Topic analysis of dialogue concerns itself mainly with thematic content.",
        "However, boundaries should be placed in locations that are natural turning points in the discourse.",
        "Shifts in topic should be readily recognizable from surface characteristics of the language.",
        "With these goals in mind, we adopted a definition of “topic” that builds upon Passonneau and Litman’s seminal work on segmentation of monologue (Passonneau and Litman, 1993).",
        "They found that human annotators can successfully accomplish a flat monologue segmentation using an informal notion of speaker intention.",
        "Dialogue is inherently hierarchical in structure.",
        "However, a flat segmentation model is an adequate approximation.",
        "Passonneau and Litman’s pilot studies confirmed previously published results (Rotondo, 1984) that human annotators cannot reliably agree on a hierarchical segmentation of monologue.",
        "Using a stack-based hierarchical model of discourse, Flammia (1998) found that 90% of all information-bearing dialogue turns referred to the discourse purpose at the top of the stack.",
        "We adopt a flat model of topic segmentation based on discourse segment purpose, where a shift in topic corresponds to a shift in purpose that is acknowledged and acted upon by both conversational participants.",
        "We place topic boundaries on contributions that introduce a speaker’s intention to shift the purpose of the discourse, while ignoring expressed intentions to shift discourse purposes that are not taken up by the other participant.",
        "We adopt the dialogue contribution as the basic unit of analysis, refraining from placing topic boundaries within a contribution.",
        "This decision is analogous to Hearst’s (Hearst, 1994, 1997) decision to shift the TextTiling induced boundaries to their nearest reference paragraph boundary.",
        "We evaluated the reproducibility of our notion of topic segment boundaries by assessing inter-coder reliability over 10% of the corpus (see Section 5.1).",
        "Three annotators were given a 10 page coding manual with explanation of our informal definition of shared discourse segment purpose as well as examples of segmented dialogues.",

        "Existing topic segmentation approaches can be loosely classified into two types: (1) lexical cohesion models, and (2) content-oriented models.",
        "The underlying assumption in lexical cohesion models is that a shift in term distribution signals a shift in topic (Halliday and Hassan, 1976).",
        "The best known algorithm based on this idea is TextTiling (Hearst, 1997).",
        "In TextTiling, a sliding window is passed over the vector-space representation of the text.",
        "At each position, the cosine correlation between the upper and lower regions of the sliding window is compared with that of the peak cosine correlation values to the left and right of the window.",
        "A segment boundary is predicted when the magnitude of the difference exceeds a threshold.",
        "One drawback to relying on term co-occurrence to signal topic continuity is that synonyms or related terms are treated as thematically-unrelated.",
        "One proposed solution to this problem is Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Landauer and Dumais, 1997).",
        "Two LSA-based algorithms for segmentation are described in (Foltz, 1998) and (Olney and Cai, 2005).",
        "Foltz’s approach differs from TextTiling mainly in its use of an LSA-based vector space model.",
        "Olney and Cai address a problem not addressed by TextTiling or Foltz’s approach, which is that cohesion is not just a function of the repetition of thematically-related terms, but also a function of the presentation of new information in reference to information already presented.",
        "Their orthonormal basis approach allows for segmentation based on relevance and informativity.",
        "Content-oriented models, such as (Barzilay and Lee, 2004), rely on the re-occurrence of patterns of topics over multiple realizations of thematically similar discourses, such as a series of newspaper articles about similar events.",
        "Their approach utilizes a hidden Markov model where states correspond to topics and state transition probabilities correspond to topic shifts.",
        "To obtain the desired number of topics (states), text spans of uniform length (individual contributions, in our case) are clustered.",
        "Then, state emission probabilities are induced using smoothed cluster-specific language models.",
        "Transition probabilities are induced by considering the proportion of documents in which a contribution assigned to the source cluster (state) immediately precedes a contribution assigned to the target cluster (state).",
        "Following an EM-like approach, contributions are reassigned to states until the algorithm converges."

        "This decision is motivated by observations that participants with different speaker-roles, each with different goals in the conversation, introduce topics with a different frequency, introduce different types of topics, and may introduce topics in a different style that displays their status in the conversation.",

        "Training our models using only exchange initial contributions produced slightly worse results.",
        "We believe that the reduction of the amount of training data prevents our models from learning good generalizations.",
        "Thus, we trained our models using contributions (as in Section 5) and consider predictions only on exchange initial contributions.",
        "The Museli approach offers a significant advantage over TT in terms of Pk and F-measure.",
        "Using perfect-exchanges, it is not significantly better than Barzilay and Lee.",
        "It is significantly better than Foltz’s approach based on F-measure and significantly better than Olney and Cai based on Pk (p < .05).",
        "These experiments used hand coded exchange boundaries.",
        "We also evaluated our ability to automatically predict exchange boundaries.",
        "On the Thermo corpus, Museli was able to predict exchange boundaries with precision = 0.48, recall = 0.62, f-measure = 0.",
