        "One such question answering system (Narayanan and Harabagiu, 2004) takes PropBank/FrameNet annotations as input, uses the PropBank targets to indicate which actions are being described with which arguments and produces an answer using probabilistic models of actions as the tools of inference.",
        "Initiating these action models is called simulation.",
        "Such action models provide deep inferential capabilities for embodied domains.",
        "They can also, when provided with appropriate metaphoric mappings, be extended to cover metaphoric language (Narayanan, 1997).",
        "Exploiting the inferential capabilities of such action models over the broadest domain requires a system to determine whether a verb is being used literally or metaphorically.",
        "Such a system could then activate the necessary metaphoric mappings and initiate the appropriate simulation."

        "The benefit of employing the metaphor-based approach, as suggested in the introduction, comes when performing inference.",
        "As shown by (Narayanan, 1997), a metaphorical usage and a literal usage share inferential structure.",

        "Further, this sharing of inferential structure between the source and target domains simplifies the representational mechanisms used for inference making it easier to build the world models necessary for knowledge-intensive tasks like question answering (Sinha and Narayanan, 2005).",
        "3 Objective While this work in Cognitive Semantics is suggestive, without a corpus-based analysis, it is hard to accurately estimate the importance of metaphoric information for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks such as Question Answering or Information Distillation.",

        "We start with our computational definition of metaphor as a mapping from concrete to abstract domains.",

        "The arguments of a verb are an important factor for determining whether that verb is being used metaphorically.",
        "If they come from the source domain frame, then the likelihood is high that the verb is being used literally.",
        "In the example literal sentence from Figure 1, the theme is a person, which is a physical object and thus part of the source domain.",

Additionally, the Stanford classifier uses by default a Gaussian prior of 1 on the features, thus smoothing the feature weights and helping prevent overfitting.",
