        "We seek scalable, open-ended language systems by giving agents both the ability to use existing conventions or ontologies, and to invent or learn new ones as the needs arise.",

        "Construction grammar is receiving growing attention lately, partly because it has allowed linguists to discuss a wide range of phenomena which were difficult to handle in earlier frameworks (Goldberg, 1995; OstmanFried, 2005; Croft, 2001), and partly because it has allowed psychologists to describe in a more satisfactory way early language development (TomaselloBrooks, 1999).",
        "There were already some attempts to formalise construction grammar (KayFillmore, 1999) and build a computational implementation (BergenChang, 2003), but many open problems remain and at this early stage of fundamental research, it makes sense to explore alternative approaches.",
        "In our team, we focus on open-ended grounded dialogue, in other words how it is possible for a speaker to formulate an utterance about the world and for a hearer to understand what is meant (ClarkBrennan, 1991).",
        "The present paper briefly reports on the formalisation of construction grammar called Fluid Construction Grammar (FCG) that we have developed for this research.",
        "Although the formalism is novel in several fundamental aspects, it also builds heavily on the state of the art in formal and computational linguistics, particularly within the tradition of unification-based feature structure grammars such as HPSG (PollardSag, 1994).",
        "FCG has been under development from around 2001 and an implementation on a LISP substrate has been released through http://arti.vub.ac.be/FCG/ in 2005.",
        "The FCG core engine (for parsing and production) is fully operational and has already been used in some large-scale experiments in language grounding (SteelsLoetzsch, 2006).",
        "We do not claim to have a complete solution for all linguistic issues that arise in construction grammar, and neither do we claim that the solutions we have adopted so far are final.",
        "On the contrary, we are aware of many difficult technical issues that still remain unresolved and welcome any discussion that would bring us forward."

        "FCG grew out of efforts to understand the creative basis of language.",
        "Language creativity is more than the application of an existing set of rules (even if the rules are recursive and thus allow an infinite set of possible sentences).",
        "Human language users often stretch and expand rules whenever the need arises,",
        "tom shows two robots moving around in an environment that contains balls and boxes.",
        "The robots are equiped with a complex sensory-motor system, able to detect the objects and build an analog world model of their location and trajectories (as shown in the right top corner).",
        "and occasionally invent totally new ones.",
        "So we need to understand how new aspects of language (new concepts and conceptualisations, new lexical items, new syntactic and semantic categories, new grammatical constructions, new interaction patterns) may arise and spread in a population, the same way biologists try to understand how new life forms may arise (Steels, 2003).",
        "This motivation leads immediately to some requirements.",
        "First of all we always use multi-agent simulations so that we can investigate the spreading of conventions in a population.",
        "Agents take turns being speaker and hearer and build up competences in conceptualisation and verbalisation (for production) and parsing and interpretation (for understanding).",
        "They must be able to store an inventory of rules and apply them in either processing direction, and they must be able to expand their inventories both by inventing new constructions if necessary and by adopting those used by others.",
        "Second, the agents must have something to talk about.",
        "We are interested in grounded language, which means dialogue about objects and events in the world as perceived through a sensory-motor apparatus.",
        "We take embodiment literally.",
        "Our experiments use physical robots (Sony AIBOs) located in a real world environment (see figure 1 from (SteelsLoetzsch, 2006)) Third, the agents must be motivated to say and learn something.",
        "We achieve this by programming the robots with scripts to play language games.",
        "A language game sets up a joint attentional frame so that robots share general motives for interaction, a specific communicative goal (for example draw attention to an object), and give feedback to enable repair of miscommunication (for example through pointing).",
        "We typically perform experiments in which a population of agents starts with empty conceptual and linguistic repertoires and then builds from scratch a communication system that is adequate for a particular kind of language game.",
        "Agents seek to maximise communicative success while minimising cognitive effort.",
        "One advantage of grounded language experiments is that we can clearly monitor whether the capacities given to the agents are adequate for bootstrapping a language system and how efficient and successful they are.",
        "By starting from scratch, we can also test whether our objective of understanding language creativity has been achieved.",
        "Of course such experiments will never spontaneously lead to the emergence of English or any other human language, but we can learn a great deal about the processes that have given rise and are still shaping such languages."
