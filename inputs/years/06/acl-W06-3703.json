        "A body of research shows that language barriers impede access to care, compromise quality, and increase the risk of adverse outcomes.",
        "Although trained medical interpreters and bilingual healthcare providers are effective in overcoming such language barriers, the use of semi-fluent healthcare professionals and ad hoc interpreters causes more interpreter errors and lower quality of care (Flores 2005).",

        "Unlike other systems that try to solve the speech translation problem with the assumption that there is a moderate amount of data available, S-MINDS focuses on rapid building and deployment of speech translation systems in languages where little or no data is available.",

        "S-MINDS uses a number of voice-independent speech recognition engines with the usage dependent on the languages and the particular domain.",
        "These engines include Nuance 8.52, SRI EduSpeak 2.03, and Entropic’s HTK-based engine .4 There is a dialog/translation creation tool that allows us to compile and run our created dialogs with any of these engines.",
        "This allows our developers to be free from the nuances of any particular engine that is deployed.",
        "S-MINDS uses a combination of grammars and language models with these engines, depending on the task and the availability of training data.",
        "In the case of the system described in this document, we were using Nuance 8.5 for both English and Korean speech recognition.",
        "We use our own semantic parser, which identifies keywords and phrases that are tagged by the user; these in turn are fed into an interpretation engine.",
        "Because of the limited context, we can achieve high translation accuracy with the interpretation engine.",
        "However, as the name suggests, this engine does not directly translate users’ utterances but interprets what they say and paraphrases their statements.",
        "Finally, we use a voice generation system (which splices human recordings) along with the Festival TTS engine to output the translations.",
        "This has been recently replaced by the Cepstral TTS engine.",
        "Additionally, S-MINDS includes a set of tools to modify and augment the existing system with additional words and phrases in the field in a matter of a few minutes.",
        "The initial task given to us was a medical disaster recovery scenario that might occur near an American military base in Korea.",
        "We were given about 270 questions and an additional 90 statements that might occur on the interviewer side.",
        "Since our system is an interview-driven system (sometimes referred to as “1.5-way”), the second-language person is not given the option of initiating conversations.",
        "The questions and statements given to us covered several domains related to the task above, including medical triage, force protection at the",
        "installation gate, and some disaster recovery questions.",

        "This data collection was conducted over the course of 2 months via a telephone-based computer system that the native Korean speakers could call.",
        "The system first introduced the purpose of the data collection and then presented the participants with 12 different scenarios.",
        "The participants were then asked a subset of the questions after each of the scenarios.",
        "One advantage of the phone-based system – in addition to the savings in administrative costs – was that the participants were free to do the data collection any time during the day or night, from any location.",
        "The system also allowed participants to hang up and call back at a later time.",

        "Another 31% consisted of one-word answers (like “yes”).",

        "Approximately 85% of the usable data was used for training; the remainder was used for testing.",

        "We spent the first 10 days training them and the next two weeks closely supervising their work.",

        "Because of the scarcity of Korean-language data, we built this system based entirely on grammar language models rather than statistical language models.",
        "Grammars are generally more rigid than statistical language models, and as such grammars tend to have higher in-domain accuracy and much lower out-of-domain accuracy5 than statistical language models.",
        "This means that the system performance will depend greatly upon on how well our grammars cover the domains.",
