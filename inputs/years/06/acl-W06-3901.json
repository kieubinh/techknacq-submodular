        "In this way, such systems have the desirable property that if anaphora can be resolved to a linguistically available antecedent, this resolution applies, and only if there is no suitable antecedent, a deictic reading is generated.",
        "In this paper I formalize the entailments that follow from such anaphora resolution algorithms.",
        "In particular, I will suggest a simple, linguistically motivated, underspecified representation for anaphora – DRT, and place the burden of the resolution of anaphora and its consequences on an independently motivated logic for default reasoning – Default Logic."

        "(1) I had gone to see John before I visited Bill and Mary.",
        "He doesn't want to speak with her.",
        "What can we say about the resolution of the anaphora?",
        "The pronoun her probably refers to Mary; the pronoun he is ambiguous between John and Bill, but most likely refers to John.",
        "And either pronoun (or both) may be used deictically, referring to some other individual that is not denoted by a linguistic antecedent.",
        "What we would like is a system that allows us to represent all these options, pick those we consider plausible, and draw some inferences even in the absence of a clear resolution.",
        "Intuitively, the deictic interpretation is dispreferred; we will assume it only if there is no suitable linguistic antecedent.",
        "An elegant explanation of this fact can be provided by anaphora resolution algorithms that use domain building techniques (e.g., [1,10,11]).",
        "Model builders receive as input a set of propositions, and produce a model for them if such exists.",
        "Typically, the models so generated are minimal, i.e. models whose domain is only as large as it needs to be.",
        "Thus, if the referent of the pronoun can be identified with a linguistic antecedent, no additional elements need to be postulated.",
        "Only if this turns out to be impossible, will an additional element be added to the model, resulting in the deictic reading.",
        "The goal of this paper is not to propose new algorithms, but to formalize the idea of using minimal models to resolve (pronominal) anaphora, and the conclusions that can be drawn by such a system in case the anaphora is not resolved.1"

      "heading": "2. An Underspecified Representation for Anaphora",
      "text": [
        "As the discourse in (1) exemplifies, anaphora is often ambiguous.",
        "Moreover, the deictic possibility always exists, so it is always possible, in principle, that what we had identified as the antecedent of a pronoun actually is not, and the pronoun is used deictically.",
        "In the case of (1), since we have two pronouns, one with three possible interpretations (John, Bill, or the deictic use) and the other with two (Mary or deictic), we will have six potential interpretations.",
        "We need to be able to represent the ambiguity, but still draw inferences as best we can on the basis of what we know.",
        "This calls for some sort of underspecified representation, and some inference mechanism to derive conclusions from it.",
        "Many special formalisms have been proposed, whose sole purpose is to allow efficient representation of and reasoning with underspecification.",
        "I will not, however, go down this road, for several reasons.",
        "A formalism that is not independently motivated on linguistic grounds, and whose sole justification is to represent underspecification, may work in a practical system, but its explanatory adequacy from a linguistic point of view would be dubious.",
        "To give one example, recall that deictic readings of a pronoun are always possible, and this is the case across languages.",
        "Why is this?",
        "Why don't we have languages where pronouns are restricted to linguistic antecedents only, and deictic readings are indicated only by, say, demonstratives?",
        "A formalism that is only geared toward underspecification would be quite adequate if pronouns could only refer to linguistic antecedents, and it is hard to see why it would necessitate the availability of deictic readings.",
        "It is, of course, preferable to have the possibility of deictic readings follow directly from the representation, thus explaining the puzzle.",
        "Furthermore, a nonstandard representation will typically require nonstandard inference methods, especially tailored for the representation.2 Again, these inference methods would not be independently justified, unlike rules of common-sense inference that must, in one way or another, be used in order to understand natural language.",
        "An additional reason for keeping the representation as simple and as close to standard linguistic representations as possible is the fact that it is not likely to be replaced by a fully specified representation during the interpretation process.",
        "Normally, one uses an underspecified representation in the hope that, in the fullness of time, or as the need arises, it will be fully specified.",
        "In this sense, an underspecified representation is only a \"temporary measure.\"",
        "However, because it is always possible to interpret pronouns deictically, we can never fully specify the representation.",
        "The possibility always exists that we will receive later some information that will force us to interpret the pronoun deictically and undo our previous resolution.",
        "Hence, the representation of anaphora cannot be treated as a temporary measure, and must be as close as possible to the fully motivated representation.",
        "In this paper I am going to suggest that we don't need to look far for a representation and its associated inference method.",
        "A standard, linguistically motivated representation, without special machinery for underspecification, will do.3 For concreteness, I choose Discourse Representation Theory ([9]).",
        "Thus, for example, the discourse in (1) will be represented by the following DRS (here and elsewhere, ignoring tense and the possibility of a collective reading of the conjunction):",
        "visit(I,y)",
        "Note that this DRS does not resolve the anaphora.",
        "In this representation, u and v are subject to existential closure, and all we know is that some antecedent exists.",
        "So, in effect, the DRS (2) is an underspecified representation, containing all the possible ways of resolving the anaphora.",
        "Any specific resolution of the anaphora results in the addition of equalities identifying the referents of the pronouns.",
        "For example:",
        "visit(I,y)",
        "xyzuv John(x)",
        "The problem of anaphora resolution now becomes the problem of inferring the necessary equalities from the representation.",
        "Of course, DRT places some constraints on acceptable antecedents – they have to be accessible.",
        "Accessibility constraints can be modeled simply as inequalities between all inaccessible pairs of discourse referents.",
        "Additional constraints come from our world knowledge.",

        "Some form of nonmonotonic reasoning, attempting to derive consistent conclusions from an incomplete description of the world, is independently necessary for any kind of system that attempts to draw inferences from natural language texts.",
        "Thus, instead of devising a special form of inference mechanism for our underspecified representation, I will use well studied and independently motivated mechanisms for nonmonotonic reasoning (cf. [12,15]).",
        "Specifically, I choose Default Logic ([17]).",
        "Default Logic is one of the most widely used nonmonotonic formalisms and may be the only one that has a clearly useful contribution to the wider field of computer science through logic programming and database theory.",
        "A default theory is a pair (D,A), where D is a set of defaults and A is a set of first-order sentences (axioms).",
        "Defaults are expressions of the form where a(x), ß1(x),..., ßm(x), m > 1, and 7 (x) are formulas of first-order logic whose free variables are among x = x1,... ,xn.",
        "A default is closed if none of a,ß1,... ,ßm, and 7 contains a free variable.",
        "Otherwise it is open.",
        "Roughly speaking, the intuitive meaning of a default is as follows.",
        "For every n-tuple of objects t = t1,... ,tn, if a(t) is believed, and the ßi(t)s are consistent with one's beliefs, then one is permitted to deduce 7(t).",
        "Crucial to the interpretation of Default Logic is the notion of an extension.",
        "Roughly speaking, an extension of a default theory is a set of statements containing all the logical entailments of the theory, plus as many of the default inferences as can be consistently believed.",
        "Sometimes a default theory has more than one extension, as in the well known Nixon diamond.",
        "Suppose we have the following set of defaults:",
        "(5) J Quaker(x) : pacifist(x) Republican(x) : – pacifist(x) 1 ( ) 1 pacifist (x) , – pacifist (x) J .",
        "If Nixon is both a Quaker and a Republican, in one extension he will be pacifist, and in another he won't be.",
        "So, is Nixon a pacifist or isn't he?",
        "When faced with multiple extensions, there are two general strategies we can use to decide which conclusions to accept: skeptical or credulous reasoning.",
        "Skeptical reasoning means taking only what is true in all extensions.",
        "In the case of the Nixon diamond, we will believe neither that Nixon is a pacifist, nor that he is not a pacifist.",
        "Credulous reasoning means picking one extension, based on whatever principles one deems appropriate, and accepting its conclusions.",
        "This means we will pick one extension, perhaps using our knowledge of Nixon's statements and actions, and based on this extension, conclude whether he is a pacifist or not."
