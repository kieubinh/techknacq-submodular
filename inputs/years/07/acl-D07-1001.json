        "The computational treatment of sentence compression has recently attracted much attention in the literature.",
        "The task can be viewed as producing a summary of a single sentence that retains the most important information and remains grammatically correct (Jing 2000).",
        "Sentence compression is commonly expressed as a word deletion problem: given an input sentence of words W = w 1, w2,..., wn, the aim is to produce a compression by removing any subset of these words (Knight and Marcu 2002).",
        "Sentence compression can potentially benefit many applications.",
        "For example, in summarisation, a compression mechanism could improve the conciseness of the generated summaries (Jing 2000; Lin 2003).",
        "Sentence compression could be also used to automatically generate subtitles for television programs; the transcripts cannot usually be used verbatim due to the rate of speech being too high (Vandeghinste and Pan 2004).",
        "Other applications include compressing text to be displayed on small screens (Corston-Oliver 2001) such as mobile phones or PDAs, and producing audio scanning devices for the blind (Grefenstette 1998).",
        "Most work to date has focused on a rather simple formulation of sentence compression that does not allow any rewriting operations, besides word removal.",
        "Moreover, compression is performed on isolated sentences without taking into account their surrounding context.",
        "An advantage of this simple view is that it renders sentence compression amenable to a variety of learning paradigms ranging from instantiations of the noisy-channel model (Galley and McKeown 2007; Knight and Marcu 2002; Turner and Charniak 2005) to Integer Linear Programming (Clarke and Lapata 2006a) and large-margin online learning (McDonald 2006).",
        "In this paper we take a closer look at one of the simplifications associated with the compression task, namely that sentence reduction can be realised in isolation without making use of discourse-level information.",
        "This is clearly not true – professional abstracters often rely on contextual cues while creating summaries (Endres-Niggemeyer 1998).",
        "Furthermore, determining what information is important in a sentence is influenced by a variety of contextual factors such as the discourse topic, whether the sentence introduces new entities or events that have not been mentioned before, and the reader's background knowledge.",
        "The simplification is also at odds with most applications of sentence compression which aim to create a shorter document rather than a single sentence.",
        "The resulting document must not only be grammatical but also coherent if it is to function as a replacement for the original.",
        "However, this cannot be guaranteed without knowing how the discourse progresses from sentence to sentence.",
        "To give a simple example, a contextually aware compression system could drop a word or phrase from the current sentence, simply because it is not mentioned anywhere else in the document and is therefore deemed unimportant.",
        "Or it could decide to retain it for the sake of topic continuity.",
        "We are interested in creating a compression model that is appropriate for documents and sentences.",
        "To this end, we assess whether discourse-level information is helpful.",
        "Our analysis is informed by two popular models of discourse, Centering Theory (Grosz et al.",
        "1995) and lexical chains (Morris and Hirst 1991).",
        "Both approaches model local coherence – the way adjacent sentences bind together to form a larger discourse.",
        "Our compression model is an extension of the integer programming formulation proposed by Clarke and Lapata (2006a).",
        "Their approach is conceptually simple: it consists of a scoring function coupled with a small number of syntactic and semantic constraints.",
        "Discourse-related information can be easily incorporated in the form of additional constraints.",
        "We employ our model to perform sentence compression throughout a whole document (by compressing sentences sequentially) and evaluate whether the resulting text is understandable and informative using a question-answering task.",
        "Our method yields significant improvements over a discourse agnostic state-of-the-art compression model (McDonald 2006)."

        "Sentence compression has been extensively studied across different modelling paradigms and has received both generative and discriminative formulations.",
        "Most generative approaches (Galley and and Charniak 2005) are instantiations of the noisy-channel model, whereas discriminative formulations include decision-tree learning (Knight and Marcu 2002), maximum entropy (Riezler et al.",
        "2003), support vector machines (Nguyen et al.",
        "2004), and large-margin learning (McDonald 2006).",
        "These models are trained on a parallel corpus of long source sentences and their target compressions.",
        "Using a rich feature set derived from parse trees, the models learn either which constituents to delete or which words to place adjacently in the compression output.",
        "Relatively few approaches dispense with the parallel corpus and generate compressions in an unsupervised manner using either a scoring function (Clarke and Lapata 2006a; Hori and Furui 2004) or compression rules that are approximated from a nonparallel corpus such as the Penn Treebank (Turner and Charniak 2005).",
        "Our work differs from previous approaches in two key respects.",
        "First, we present a compression model that is contextually aware; decisions on whether to remove or retain a word (or phrase) are informed by its discourse properties (e.g., whether it introduces a new topic, whether it is semantically related to the previous sentence).",
        "Second, we apply our compression model to entire documents rather than isolated sentences.",
        "This is more in the spirit of real-world applications where the goal is to generate a condensed and coherent text.",
        "Previous work on summarisation has also utilised discourse information (e.g., Barzi-lay and Elhadad 1997; Daumé III and Marcu 2002; application to document compression is novel to our knowledge."

        "Obtaining an appropriate representation ofdiscourse is the first step towards creating a compression model that exploits contextual information.",
        "In this work we focus on the role of local coherence as this is prerequisite for maintaining global coherence.",
        "Ideally, we would like our compressed document to maintain the discourse flow of the original.",
        "For this reason, we automatically annotate the source document with discourse-level information which is subsequently used to inform our compression procedure.",
        "We first describe our algorithms for obtaining discourse annotations and then present our compression model.",
        "Centering Theory (Grosz et al.",
        "1995) is an entity-orientated theory of local coherence and salience.",
        "Although an utterance in discourse may contain several entities, it is assumed that a single entity is salient or \"centered\", thereby representing the current focus.",
        "One of the main claims underlying centering is that discourse segments in which successive utterances contain common centers are more coherent than segments where the center repeatedly changes.",
        "Each utterance Ui in a discourse segment has a list offorward-looking centers, Cf (Ui) and a unique backward-looking center, Cb(Ui).",
        "Cf (Ui) represents a ranking of the entities invoked by Ui according to their salience.",
        "The Cb of the current utterance Ui, is the highest-ranked element in Cf (Ui-1) that is also in Ui.",
        "The Cb thus links Ui to the previous discourse, but it does so locally since Cb(Ui) is chosen from Ui-1.",
        "Centering Algorithm So far we have presented centering without explicitly stating how the concepts \"utterance\", \"entities\" and \"ranking\" are instantiated.",
        "A great deal of research has been devoted into fleshing these out and many different instantiations have been developed in the literature (see Poe-sio et al.",
        "2004 for details).",
        "Since our aim is to identify centers in discourse automatically, our parameter choice is driven by two considerations, robustness and ease of computation.",
        "We therefore follow previous work (e.g., Milt-sakaki and Kukich 2000) in assuming that the unit of an utterance is the sentence (i.e., a main clause with accompanying subordinate and adjunct clauses).",
        "This is in line with our compression task which also operates over sentences.",
        "We determine which entities are invoked by a sentence using two methods.",
        "First, we perform named entity identification and coreference resolution on each document using LingPipe , a publicly available system.",
        "Named entities and all remaining nouns are added to the Cf list.",
        "Entity matching between sentences is required to determine the Cb ofa sentence.",
        "This is done using the named entity's unique identifier (as provided by LingPipe) or by the entity's surface form in the case of nouns not classified as named entities.",
        "Entities are ranked according to their grammatical roles; subjects are ranked more highly than objects, which are in turn ranked higher than other grammatical roles (Grosz et al.",
        "1995); ties are broken using left-to-right ordering of the grammatical roles in the sentence (Tetreault 2001).",
        "We identify grammatical roles with RASP (Briscoe and Carroll 2002).",
        "Formally, our centering algorithm is as follows (where Ui corresponds to sentence i):",
        "1.",
        "Extract entities from Ui.",
        "2.",
        "Create Cf(Ui) by ranking the entities in Ui according to their grammatical role (subjects > objects > others).",
        "3.",
        "Find the highest ranked entity in Cf (Ui-1) which occurs in Cf(Ui), set the entity to be Cb(Ui).",
        "The above procedure involves several automatic steps (named entity recognition, coreference resolution, identification of grammatical roles) and will unavoidably produce some noisy annotations.",
        "So, there is no guarantee that the right Cb will be identified or that all sentences will be marked with a Cb.",
        "The latter situation also occurs in passages that contain abrupt changes in topic.",
        "In such cases, none of the entities realised in Ui will occur in Cf (Ui-1).",
        "Rather than accept that discourse information may be absent in a sentence, we turn to lexical chains as an alternative means of capturing topical content within a document.",
        "Lexical cohesion refers to the degree of semantic relatedness observed among lexical items in a document.",
        "The term was coined by Halliday and Hasan (1976) who observed that coherent documents tend to have more related terms or phrases than incoherent ones.",
        "A number of linguistic devices can be used to signal cohesion; these range from repetition, to synonymy, hyponymy and meronymy.",
        "Lexical chains are a representation of lexical cohesion as sequences ofsemantically related words (Morris and Hirst 1991) and provide a useful means for describing the topic flow in discourse.",
        "For instance, a document with many different lexical chains will probably contain several topics.",
        "And main topics will tend to be represented by dense and long chains.",
        "Words participating in such chains are important for our compression task – they reveal what the document is about – and in all likelihood should not be deleted.",
        "Lexical Chains Algorithm Barzilay and Elhadad (1997) describe a technique for text summarisation based on lexical chains.",
        "Their algorithm uses WordNet to build chains of nouns (and noun compounds).",
        "These are ranked heuristically by a score based on their length and homogeneity.",

        "strong chains, i.e., chains whose score is two standard deviations above the average score.",
        "Like Barzilay and Elhadad (1997), we wish to determine which lexical chains indicate the most prevalent discourse topics.",
        "Our assumption is that terms belonging to these chains are indicative of the document's main focus and should therefore be retained in the compressed output.",
        "Barzilay and El-hadad's scoring function aims to identify sentences (for inclusion in a summary) that have a high concentration of chain members.",
        "In contrast, we are interested in chains that span several sentences.",
        "We thus score chains according to the number of sentences their terms occur in.",

        "Besides individual sentences, our goal was to evaluate the compressed document as whole.",

        "Two annotators were independently instructed to create Q&A pairs for the original documents in the test set.",

        "In this paper we proposed a novel method for automatic sentence compression.",
        "Central in our approach is the use of discourse-level information which we argue is an important prerequisite for document (as opposed to sentence) compression.",
        "Our model uses integer programming for inferring globally optimal compressions in the presence of linguistically motivated constraints.",
        "Our discourse constraints aim to capture local coherence and are inspired by centering theory and lexical chains.",
        "We showed that our model can be successfully employed to produce compressed documents that preserve most of the original's core content.",
        "Our approach to document compression differs from most summarisation work in that our summaries are fairly long.",
        "However, we believe this is the first step into understanding how compression can help summarisation.",
        "In the future, we will interface our compression model with sentence extraction.",
        "The discourse annotations can help guide the extraction method into selecting topically related sentences which can consequently be compressed together.",
        "The compression rate can be tailored through additional constraints which act on the output length to ensure precise word limits are obeyed.",
        "We also plan to study the effect of global discourse structure (Daumé III and Marcu 2002) on the compression task.",
        "In general, we will assess the impact of discourse information more systematically by incorporating it into generative and discriminative modelling paradigms.",
