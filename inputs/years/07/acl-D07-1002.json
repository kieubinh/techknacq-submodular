        "Recent years have witnessed significant progress in developing methods for the automatic identification and labeling of semantic roles conveyed by sentential constituents.",
        "The success of these methods, often referred to collectively as shallow semantic parsing (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), is largely due to the availability of resources like FrameNet (Fillmore et al., 2003) and PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005), which document the surface realization of semantic roles in real world corpora.",
        "More concretely, in the FrameNet paradigm, the meaning of predicates (usually verbs, nouns, or adjectives) is conveyed by frames, schematic representations of situations.",
        "Semantic roles (or frame elements) are defined for each frame and correspond to salient entities present in the evoked situation.",
        "Predicates with similar semantics instantiate the same frame and are attested with the same roles.",
        "The FrameNet database lists the surface syntactic realizations of semantic roles, and provides annotated example sentences from the British National Corpus.",
        "For example, the frame CommerceSell has three core semantic roles, namely Buyer, Goods, and Seller â€“ each expressed by an indirect object, a direct object, and a subject (see sentences (1a)-(1c)).",
        "It can also be attested with non-core (peripheral) roles (e.g., Means, Manner, see (1d) and (1e)) that are more generic and can be instantiated in several frames, besides CommerceSell.",
        "The verbs sell, vend, and retail can evoke this frame, but also the nouns sale and vendor.",
        "b.",
        "[Kim]Seller sold [the sweater]Goods.",
        "c. [My company]Seller has sold [more than three million copies]Goods.",
        "d. [Abby]Seller sold [the car]Goods [for cash]Means.",
        "e. [He]Seller [reluctanctly]Manner sold [his rock]Goods.",
        "By abstracting over surface syntactic configurations, semantic roles offer an important first step towards deeper text understanding and hold promise for a range of applications requiring broad coverage semantic processing.",
        "Question answering (QA) is often cited as an obvious beneficiary of semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002; Palmer et al., 2005; Narayanan and Harabagiu, 2004).",
        "Faced with the question Q: What year did the U.S. buy Alaska?",
        "and the retrieved sentence S:.. .before Russia sold Alaska to the United States in 1867, a hypothetical QA system must identify that United States is the Buyer despite the fact that it is attested in one instance as a subject and in another as an object.",
        "Once this information is known, isolating the correct answer (i.e., 1867) can be relatively straightforward.",
        "Although conventional wisdom has it that semantic role labeling ought to improve answer extraction, surprising little work has been done to this effect (see Section 2 for details) and initial results have been mostly inconclusive or negative (Sun et al., 2005; Kaisser, 2006).",
        "There are at least two good reasons for these findings.",
        "First, shallow semantic parsers trained on declarative sentences will typically have poor performance on questions and generally on out-of-domain data.",
        "Second, existing resources do not have exhaustive coverage and recall will be compromised, especially if the question answering system is expected to retrieve answers from unrestricted text.",
        "Since FrameNet is still under development, its coverage tends to be more of a problem in comparison to other semantic role resources such as PropBank.",
        "In this paper we propose an answer extraction model which effectively incorporates FrameNet-style semantic role information.",
        "We present an automatic method for semantic role assignment which is conceptually simple and does not require extensive feature engineering.",
        "A key feature of our approach is the comparison of dependency relation paths attested in the FrameNet annotations and raw text.",
        "We formalize the search for an optimal role assignment as an optimization problem in a bipartite graph.",
        "This formalization allows us to find an exact, globally optimal solution.",
        "The graph-theoretic framework goes some way towards addressing coverage problems related with FrameNet and allows us to formulate answer extraction as a graph matching problem.",
        "As a byproduct of our main investigation we also examine the issue of FrameNet coverage and show how much it impacts performance in a TREC-style question answering setting.",
        "In the following section we provide an overview of existing work on question answering systems that exploit semantic role-based lexical resources.",
        "Then we define our learning task and introduce our approach to semantic role assignment and answer extraction in the context of QA.",
        "Next, we present our experimental framework and data.",
        "We conclude the paper by presenting and discussing our results."

        "We briefly summarize the architecture of the QA system we are working with before formalizing the mechanics of our FrameNet-based answer extraction module.",
        "In common with previous work, our overall approach consists of three stages: (a) determining the expected answer type of the question, (b) retrieving passages likely to contain answers to the question, and (c) performing a match between the question words and retrieved passages in order to extract the answer.",
        "In this paper we focus on the last stage: question and answer sentences are normalized to a FrameNet-style representation and answers are retrieved by selecting the candidate whose semantic structure is most similar to the question.",

        "Semantic structures for questions and sentences are automatically derived using the model described in Section 4 (Model I).",

        "Question words, such as what, who, when, etc., are considered expected answer phrases (EAPs).",

        "Question and answer semantic structures are compared using a model based on graph matching detailed in Section 5 (Model II).",

        "Our method crucially exploits the annotated sentences in the FrameNet database together with the output of a dependency parser.",
        "Our guiding assumption is that sentences that share dependency relations will also share semantic roles as long as they evoke the same or related frames.",

        "For example, in Q: Who beat Floyd Patterson to take the title away?, beat, take away, and title are identified as predicate candidates and beat is selected the main predicate of the question.",

        "Each frame element is represented by an unlabeled dependency path Rw which we extract by traversing the dependency tree from w to p. Analogously, we extract from the FrameNet annotations all dependency paths RSR that are labeled with semantic role information and correspond to p.

        "We therefore may end up with the same role being assigned to two frame elements or with frame elements having no role at all.",
        "We remedy this shortcoming by treating the semantic role assignment as a global optimization problem.",

        "(3) Do the graph-based models introduced in this paper bring any performance gains over state-of-the-art shallow semantic parsers or more conventional syntax-based QA systems?",
        "Recall that our graph-based models were designed especially for the QA answer extraction task.",
        "Our results are summarized in Tables 1-3.",
        "Table 1 records the number of questions to be answered for the TREC02-05 datasets (Total).",
        "We also give information regarding the number of questions which are in principle unanswerable with a FrameNet-style semantic role analysis.",
        "Column NoFrame shows the number of questions which don't have an appropriate frame or predicate in the database.",
        "For example, there is currently no predicate entry for sponsor or sink (e.g., Q: Who is the sponsor of the International Criminal Court?",
        "and Q: What date did the Lusitania sink?).",
        "Column NoAnnot refers to questions for which no semantic role labeling is possible because annotated sentences for the relevant predicates are missing.",
        "For instance, there are no annotations for win (e.g., Q: What division did Floyd Patterson win? )",
        "or for hit (e.g., Q: What was the Beatles' first number one hit?).",
        "This problem is not specific to our method which admittedly relies on FrameNet annotations for performing the semantic role assignment (see Section 4).",
        "Shallow semantic parsers trained on FrameNet would also have trouble assigning roles to predicates for which no data is available.",
        "Finally, column NoMatch reports the number of questions which cannot be answered due to frame",
        "Table 1: Number of questions which cannot be answered using a FrameNet style semantic analysis; numbers in parentheses are percentages of Total (NoFrame: frames or predicates are missing; NoAnnot: annotated sentences are missing, NoMatch: questions and candidate answers evoke different frames.",
        "mismatches.",
        "Consider Q: What does AARP stand for?",
        "whose answer is found in S: The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) qualify for discounts....",
        "The answer and the question evoke different frames; in fact here a semantic role analysis is not relevant for locating the right answer.",
        "As can be seen NoMatch cases are by far the most frequent.",
        "The number of questions remaining after excluding NoFrame, NoAnnot, and NoMatch are shown under the Rest heading in Table 1.",
        "These results indicate that FrameNet-based semantic role analysis applies to approximately 35% of the TREC data.",
        "This means that an extraction module relying solely on FrameNet will have poor performance, since it will be unable to find answers for more than half of the questions beeing asked.",
        "We nevertheless examine whether our model brings any performance improvements on this limited dataset which is admittedly favorable towards a FrameNet style analysis.",
        "Table 2 shows the results of our answer extraction module (SemMatch) together with two baseline systems.",
        "The first baseline uses only dependency relation path information (SynMatch), whereas the second baseline (SemParse) uses Shal-maneser, a state-of-the-art shallow semantic parser for the role labeling task.",
        "We consider an answer correct if it is returned with rank 1.",
        "As can be seen, SemMatch is significantly better than both Syn-Match and SemParse, whereas the latter is significantly worse than SynMatch.",
        "Although promising, the results in Table 2 are not very informative, since they show performance gains on partial data.",
        "Instead of using our answer extraction model on its own, we next combined it with the syntax-based system mentioned above (SynMatch, see also Section 6 for details).",
        "If FrameNet is indeed helpful for QA, we would expect an ensemble sys-",
        "Table 2: System Performance on subset of TREC datasets (see Rest column in Table 1); *: significantly better than SemParse; ^: significantly better than SynMatch (p < 0.01, using a X test).",
        "Table 3: System Performance on TREC datasets (see Total column in Table 1); *: significantly better than +SemParse; : significantly better than SynMatch (p < 0.01, using a X test).",
        "tem to yield better performance over a purely syntactic answer extraction module.",
        "The two systems were combined as follows.",
        "Given a question, we first pass it to our FrameNet model; if an answer is found, our job is done; if no answer is returned, the question is passed on to SynMatch.",
        "Our results are given in Table 3.",
        "+SemMatch and +SemParse are ensemble systems using SynMatch together with the QA specific role labeling method proposed in this paper and Shalmaneser, respectively.",
        "We also compare these systems against SynMatch on its own.",
        "We can now attempt to answer our third question concerning our model's performance on the TREC data.",
        "Our experiments show that a FrameNet-enhanced answer extraction module significantly outperforms a similar module that uses only syntactic information (compare SynMatch and +Sem-Match in Table 3).",
        "Another interesting finding is that the shallow semantic parser performs considerably worse in comparison to our graph-based models and the syntax-based system.",
        "Inspection of the parser's output highlights two explanations for this.",
        "First, the shallow semantic parser has difficulty assigning accurate semantic roles to questions (even when they are reformulated as declarative sentences).",
        "And secondly, it tends to favor precision over recall, thus reducing the number of questions for which answers can be found.",
        "A similar finding is reported in Sun et al.",
        "(2005) for a PropBank trained parser.",

        "In this paper we assess the contribution of semantic role labeling to open-domain factoid question answering.",
        "We present a graph-based answer extraction model which effectively incorporates FrameNet style role semantic information and show that it achieves promising results.",
        "Our experiments show that the proposed model can be effectively combined with a syntax-based system to obtain performance superior to the latter when used on its own.",
        "Furthermore, we demonstrate performance gains over a shallow semantic parser trained on the FrameNet annotated corpus.",
        "We argue that performance gains are due to the adopted graph-theoretic framework which is robust to coverage and recall problems.",
        "We also provide a detailed analysis of the appropriateness of FrameNet for QA.",
        "We show that performance can be compromised due to incomplete coverage (i.e., missing frame or predicate entries as well as annotated sentences) but also because of mismatching question-answer representations.",
        "The question and the answer may evoke different frames or the answer simply falls outside the scope of a given frame (i.e., in a non predicate-argument structure).",
        "Our study shows that mismatches are relatively frequent and motivates the use ofsemantically informed methods in conjunction with syntax-based methods.",
        "Important future directions lie in evaluating the contribution of alternative semantic role frameworks (e.g., PropBank) to the answer extraction task and developing models that learn semantic roles directly from unannotated text without the support of FrameNet annotations (Grenager and Manning, 2006).",
        "Beyond question answering, we also plan to investigate the potential of our model for shallow semantic parsing since our experience so far has shown that it achieves good recall.",
