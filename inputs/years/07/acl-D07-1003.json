      "text": [
        "Open-domain question answering (QA) is a widely-studied and fast-growing research problem.",
        "State-of-the-art QA systems are extremely complex.",
        "They usually take the form of a pipeline architecture, chaining together modules that perform tasks such as answer type analysis (identifying whether the correct answer will be a person, location, date, etc.",
        "), document retrieval, answer candidate extraction, and answer reranking.",
        "This architecture is so predominant that each task listed above has evolved into its own sub-field and is often studied and evaluated independently (Shima et al., 2006).",
        "At a high level, the QA task boils down to only two essential steps (Echihabi and Marcu, 2003).",
        "The first step, retrieval, narrows down the search space from a corpus of millions of documents to a focused set of maybe a few hundred using an IR engine, where efficiency and recall are the main focus.",
        "The second step, selection, assesses each candidate answer string proposed by the first step, and finds the one that is most likely to be an answer to the given question.",
        "The granularity of the target answer string varies depending on the type of the question.",
        "For example, answers to factoid questions (e.g., Who, When, Where) are usually single words or short phrases, while definitional questions and other more complex question types (e.g., How, Why) look for sentences or short passages.",
        "In this work, we fix the granularity of an answer to a single sentence.",
        "Earlier work on answer selection relies only on the surface-level text information.",
        "Two approaches are most common: surface pattern matching, and similarity measures on the question and answer, represented as bags of words.",
        "In the former, patterns for a certain answer type are either crafted manually (Soubbotin and Soubbotin, 2001) or acquired from training examples automatically (Itty-cheriah et al., 2001; Ravichandran et al., 2003; Licuanan and Weischedel, 2003).",
        "In the latter, measures like cosine-similarity are applied to (usually) bag-of-words representations of the question and answer.",
        "Although many of these systems have achieved very good results in TREC-style evaluations, shallow methods using the bag-of-word representation clearly have their limitations.",
        "Examples of cases where the bag-of-words approach fails abound in QA literature; here we borrow an example used by Echihabi and Marcu (2003).",
        "The question is \"Who is the leader of France?",
        "\", and the sentence \"Henri Hadjenberg, who is the leader of France's Jewish community, endorsed ...\" (note tokenization), which is not the correct answer, matches all keywords in the question in exactly the same order.",
        "(The correct answer is found in \"Bush later met with French President Jacques Chirac.\")",
        "This example illustrates two types of variation that need to be recognized in order to connect this question-answer pair.",
        "The first variation is the change of the word \"leader\" to its semantically related term \"president\".",
        "The second variation is the syntactic shift from \"leader of France\" to \"French president.\"",
        "It is also important to recognize that \"France\" in the first sentence is modifying \"community\", and therefore \"Henri Hadjenberg\" is the \"leader of ... community\" rather than the \"leader of France.\"",
        "These syntactic and semantic variations occur in almost every question-answer pair, and typically they cannot be easily captured using shallow representations.",
        "It is also worth noting that such syntactic and semantic variations are not unique to QA; they can be found in many other closely related NLP tasks, motivating extensive community efforts in syntactic and semantic processing.",
        "Indeed, in this work, we imagine a generative story for QA in which the question is generated from the answer sentence through a series of syntactic and semantic transformations.",
        "The same story has been told for machine translation (Yamada and Knight, 2001, inter alia), in which a target language sentence (the desired output) has undergone semantic transformation (word to word translation) and syntactic transformation (syntax divergence across languages) to generate the source language sentence (noisy-channel model).",
        "Similar stories can also be found in paraphrasing (Quirk et al., 2004; Wu, 2005) and textual entailment (Harabagiu and",
        "Hickl, 2006; Wu, 2005).",
        "Our story makes use of a weighted formalism known as quasi-synchronous grammar (hereafter, QG), originally developed by D. Smith and Eisner (2006) for machine translation.",
        "Unlike most synchronous formalisms, QG does not posit a strict isomorphism between the two trees, and it provides an elegant description for the set of local configurations.",
        "In Section 2 we situate our contribution in the context of earlier work, and we give a brief discussion of quasi-synchronous grammars in Section 3.",
        "Our version of QG, called the Jeopardy model, and our parameter estimation method are described in Section 4.",
        "Experimental results comparing our approach to two state-of-the-art baselines are presented in Section 5.",
        "We discuss portability to cross-lingual QA and other applied semantic processing tasks in Section 6."

        "To model the syntactic transformation process, researchers in these fields – especially in machine translation – have developed powerful grammatical formalisms and statistical models for representing and learning these tree-to-tree relations (Wu and Wong, 1998; Eisner, 2003; Gildea, 2003; Melamed,",
        "Galley et al., 2006; Smith and Eisner, 2006, inter alia).",

        "Cartney et al., 2006).",
        "However, relatively fewer attempts have been made in the QA community.",
        "As pointed out by Katz and Lin (2003), most early experiments in QA that tried to bring in syntactic or semantic features showed little or no improvement, and it was often the case that performance actually degraded (Litkowski, 1999; Attardi et al., 2001).",
        "More recent attempts have tried to augment the bag-of-words representation – which, after all, is simply a real-valued feature vector – with syntactic features.",
        "The usual similarity measures can then be used on the new feature representation.",
        "For example, Pun-yakanok et al.",
        "(2004) used approximate tree matching and tree-edit-distance to compute a similarity score between the question and answer parse trees.",
        "Similarly, Shen et al.",

        "Cui et al.",
        "(2005) measured sentence similarity based on similarity measures between dependency paths among aligned words.",
        "They used heuristic functions similar to mutual information to assign scores to matched pairs of dependency links.",
        "Shen and Klakow (2006) extend the idea further through the use of log-linear models to learn a scoring function for relation pairs.",
        "Echihabi and Marcu (2003) presented a noisy-channel approach in which they adapted the IBM model 4 from statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1990; Brown et al., 1993) and applied it to QA.",
        "Similarly, Murdock and Croft (2005) adopted a simple translation model from IBM model 1 (Brown et al., 1990; Brown et al., 1993) and applied it to QA.",
        "Porting the translation model to QA is not straightforward; it involves parse-tree pruning heuristics (the first two deterministic steps in Echihabi and Marcu, 2003) and also replacing the lexical translation table with a monolingual \"dictionary\" which simply encodes the identity relation.",
        "This brings us to the question that drives this work: is there a statistical translation-like model that is natural and accurate for question answering?",
        "We propose Smith and Eisner s (2006) quasi-synchronous grammar (Section 3) as a general solution and the Jeopardy model (Section 4) as a specific instance."

        "For a formal description of QG, we recommend Smith and Eisner (2006).",
        "We briefly review the central idea here.",
        "QG arose out of the empirical observation that translated sentences often have some isomorphic syntactic structure, but not usually in entirety, and the strictness of the isomorphism may vary across words or syntactic rules.",
        "The idea is that, rather than a synchronous structure over the source and target sentences, a tree over the target sentence is modeled by a source-sentence-specific grammar that is inspired by the source sentence s tree.",
        "This is implemented by a \"sense\" – really just a subset of nodes in the source tree – attached to each grammar node in the target tree.",
        "The senses define an alignment between the trees.",
        "Because it only loosely links the two sentences syntactic structure, QG is particularly well-suited for QA insofar as QA is like \"free\" translation.",
        "A concrete example that is easy to understand is a binary quasi-synchronous context-free grammar (denoted QCFG).",
        "Let VS be the set of constituent tokens in the source tree.",
        "QCFG rules would take the augmented form where X, Y, and Z are ordinary CFG nonterminals, each Si G 2Vs (subsets of nodes in the source tree to which the nonterminals align), and w is a target-language word.",
        "QG can be made more or less \"liberal\" by constraining the cardinality of the Si (we force all |Si| = 1), and by constraining the relationships among the Si mentioned in a single rule.",
        "These are called permissible \"configurations.\"",
        "An example of a strict configuration is that a target parent-child pair must align (respectively) to a source parent-child pair.",

        "Here, following Smith and Eisner (2006), we use a weighted, quasi-synchronous dependency grammar.",
        "Apart from the obvious difference in application task, there are a few important differences with their model.",
        "First, we are not interested in the alignments per se; we will sum them out as a hidden variable when scoring a question-answer pair.",
        "Second, our probability model includes an optional mixture component that permits arbitrary features – we experiment with a small set of WordNet lexical-semantics features (see Section 4.4).",

        "The hidden variable treatment lets us avoid commitment to any one x mapping, making the method more robust to noisy parses (after all, the parser is not 100% accurate) and any wrong assumptions imposed by the model (that |x(i) | = 1, for example, or that syntactic transformations can explain the connection between q and a at all).",

        "pkid defines a distribution over syntactic children of qi and their labels, given (1) the word qi, (2) the parent of qi, (3) the dependency relation between qi and its parent, (4) the answer-word qi is aligned to, (5) the answer-word the child being predicted is aligned to, and (6) the remainder of the answer tree.",
