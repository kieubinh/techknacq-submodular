        "Two assumptions are particularly common.",
        "The first is the 1-to-N assumption, meaning that each source word generates zero or more target words, which requires heuristic techniques in order to obtain alignments suitable for training a SMT system.",
        "The second is the consecutive word-based \"phrasal SMT\" assumption.",
        "This does not allow gaps, which can be used to particular advantage by SMT models which model hierarchical structure.",
        "Previous discriminative models have either made such assumptions directly or used features from a generative model making such an assumption.",
        "Our objective is to automatically produce alignments which can be used to build high quality machine translation systems.",
        "These are presumably close to the alignments that trained bilingual speakers produce.",
        "Human annotated alignments often contain M-to-N alignments, where several source words are aligned to several target words and the resulting unit can not be further decomposed.",
        "Source or target words in a single unit are sometimes non-consecutive.",
        "In this paper, we describe a new generative model which directly models M-to-N non-consecutive word alignments.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "The generative story is presented, followed by the mathematical formulation.",
        "Details of the unsupervised training procedure are described.",
        "The generative model is then decomposed into feature functions used in a log-linear model which is trained using a semi-supervised algorithm.",
        "Experiments show improvements in word alignment accuracy and usage of the generated alignments in hierarchical and phrasal SMT systems results in an increased BLEU score.",
        "Previous work is discussed and this is followed by the conclusion."

        "In bootstrapping, a problem arises when we encounter infeasible alignment structure where, for instance, a source word generates target words but no link between any of the target words and the source word appears in the intersection, so it is not clear which target word is the target head word.",

        "In contrast with their approaches, we have a very flat, one-level notion of dependency, which is bilingually motivated and learned automatically from the parallel corpus.",

        "(Lacoste-Julien et al., 2006) created a discriminative model able to model 1-to-1, 1-to-2 and 2-to-1 alignments for which the best results were obtained using features based on symmetric HMMs trained to agree, (Liang et al., 2006), and intersected Model 4.",

        "LEAF is not bound by the structural restrictions present either directly in these models, or in the features derived from the generative models used.",
        "We also iterate the generative/discriminative process, which allows the discriminative predictions to influence the generative model.",
        "our work is most similar to work using discriminative log-linear models for alignment, which is similar to discriminative log-linear models used for the SMT decoding (translation) problem (Och and a log-linear model combining IBM Model 3 trained in both directions with heuristic features which resulted in a 1-to-1 alignment.",
        "(Fraser and Marcu, 2006b) described symmetrized training of a 1-toN log-linear model and a M-to-1 log-linear model.",
        "These models took advantage of features derived from both training directions, similar to the symmetrized lexicons of (Zens et al., 2004), including features derived from the HMM model and Model 4.",
        "However, despite the symmetric lexicons, these models were only able to optimize the performance of the 1-to-N model and the M-to-1 model separately, and the predictions of the two models required combination with symmetrization heuristics.",
        "We have overcome the limitations of that work by defining new feature functions, based on the LEAF generative model, which score non-consecutive M-to-N alignments so that the final performance criterion can be optimized directly.",
