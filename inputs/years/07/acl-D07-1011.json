        "Generation of Referring Expressions (GRE) is a well-studied subtask of microplanning in Natural Language Generation.",
        "Most algorithms in this area view GRE as a content determination problem, that is, their emphasis is on the construction of a semantic representation which is eventually mapped to a linguistic realisation (i.e. a noun phrase).",
        "Content Determination for GRE starts from a Knowledge Base (KB) consisting of a set of entities U and a set of properties P represented as attribute-value pairs, and searches for a description D C P which distinguishes a referent r G U from its distractors.",
        "Under this view, reference is mainly about identification of an entitiy in a given context (represented by the KB), a well-studied pragmatic function of definite noun phrases in both the psycholinguistic and the computational literature (Olson, 1970).",
        "For example, the KB in Table 1 represents 8 entities in a 2D visual domain, each with 6 attributes, including their location, represented as a combination of horizontal (X) and vertical (Y) numerical coordinates.",
        "To refer to an entity an algorithm searches through values of the different attributes.",
        "GRE has been dominated by Dale and Reiter's (1995) Incremental Algorithm (IA), one version of which, generalised to deal with non-disjunctive plural references, is shown in Algorithm 1 (van Deemter, 2002).",
        "A non-disjunctive reference to a set R is possible just in case all the elements of R can be distinguished using the same attribute-value pairs.",
        "Such a description is equivalent to the logical conjunction of the properties in question.",
        "This algorithm, lApiur, initialises a description D and a set of distractors C [1.1-1.2], and traverses an ordered list of properties, called the preference order (PO) [1.3], which reflects general or domain-specific prefAlgorithm 1 iAp;Â«r (R,u,PO 11: end for l2: return D",

        "For instance, with the PO in the top row of the Table, the algorithm first considers values of type, then colour, and so on, adding a property to D if it is true of the intended referents R, and has some contrastive value, that is, excludes some distractors [1.4].",
        "The description and the dis-tractor set C are updated accordingly [1.5-1.6], and the description returned if it is distinguishing [1.7].",

        "Moreover, the description does not include TYPE, though it has been argued that this is always required, as it maps to the head noun of an NP (Dale and Reiter, 1995).",
        "We will adopt this assumption here, for reasons explained below.",
        "Due to its hillclimbing nature, the IA avoids combinatorial search, unlike some predecessors which searched exhaustively for the briefest possible description of a referent (Dale, 1989), based on a strict interpretation of the Gricean Maxim of Quantity (Grice, 1975).",
        "Given that, under the view proposed by Olson (1970) among others, the function of a referential NP is to identify, a strict Gricean interpretation holds that it should contain no more information than necessary to achieve this goal.",
        "The Incremental Algorithm constitutes a departure from this view given that it can overspecify through its use of a PO.",
        "This has been justified on psycholinguistic grounds.",
        "Speakers overspecify their descriptions because they begin their formulation of a reference without exhaustively scanning a domain (Pechmann, 1989; Belke and Meyer, 2002).",
        "They prioritise the basic-level category (TYPE) of an object, and salient, absolute properties like COLOUR (Pechmann, 1989; Eikmeyer and Ahlsen, 1996), as well as locative properties in the vertical dimension (Arts, 2004).",
        "Relative attributes like SIZE are avoided unless absolutely required for identification (Belke and Meyer, 2002).",
        "This evidence suggests that speakers conceptualise referents as gestalts (Pechmann, 1989) whose core is their basic-level TYPE (Murphy, 2002) and some other salient attributes like COLOUR.",
        "For instance, according to",
        "Schriefers and Pechmann (1988), an NP such as the large black triangle reflects a conceptualisation of the referent as a black triangle, of which the SIZE property is predicated.",
        "Thus, the type+colour combination is not mentally represented as two separable dimensions.",
        "In what follows, we will sometimes refer to this principle as the Conceptual Gestalts Principle.",
        "Note that the IA does not fully mirror these human tendencies, since it only includes preferred attributes in a description if they remove some distractors given the current state of the algorithm, whereas psycholinguistic research suggests that people include them irrespective of contrastiveness (but cf. van der Sluis and Krahmer (2005)).",
        "More recent research on plural GRE has de-emphasised these issues, especially in case of disjunctive plural reference.",
        "Disjunction is required whenever elements of a set of referents R do not have identical distinguishing properties.",
        "For example, {ei,e3} can be distinguished by the following Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF) description:",
        "Such a description would be returned by a generalised version of Algorithm 1 proposed by van Deemter (2002).",
        "This generalisation, IAboo1 (so called because it handles all Boolean operators, such as negation and disjunction), first tries to find a non-disjunctive description using Algorithm 1.",
        "Failing this, it searches through disjunctions of properties of increasing length, conjoining them to the description.",
        "This procedure has three consequences:",
        "1.",
        "Efficiency: Searching through disjunctive combinations results in a combinatorial explosion (van Deemter, 2002).",
        "2.",
        "Gestalts and content: The notion of a 'preferred attribute' is obscured, since it is difficult to apply the same reasoning that motivated the P O in the IA to combinations like (COLOUR V SIZE).",
        "3.",
        "Form: Descriptions can become logically very complex (Gardent, 2002; Horacek, 2004).",
        "Proposals to deal with (3) include Gardent's (2002) non-incremental, constraint-based algorithm to generate the briefest available description of a set, an approach extended in Gardent et al.",
        "(2004).",
        "An alternative, by Horacek (2004), combines best-first search with optimisation to reduce logical complexity.",
        "Neither approach benefits from empirical grounding, and both leave open the question of whether previous psycholinguistic research on singular reference is applicable to plurals.",
        "This paper reports a corpus-based analysis of plural descriptions elicited in well-defined domains, of which Table 1 is an example.",
        "This study falls within a recent trend in which empirical issues in gre have begun to be tackled (Gupta and Stent, 2005; Jordan and Walker, 2005; Viethen and Dale, 2006).",
        "We then propose an efficient algorithm for the generation of references to arbitrary sets, which combines corpus-derived heuristics and a partitioning-based procedure, comparing this to iaboo1.",
        "Unlike van Deemter (2002), we only focus on disjunction, leaving negation aside.",
        "Our starting point is the assumption that plurals, like singulars, evince preferences for certain attributes as predicted by the Conceptual Gestalts Principle.",
        "Based on previous work in Gestalt perception (Wertheimer, 1938; Rock, 1983), we propose an extension of this to sets, whereby plural descriptions are preferred if (a) they maximise the similarity of their referents, using the same attributes to describe them as far as possible; (b) prioritise salient ('preferred') attributes which are central to the conceptual representation of an object.",
        "We address (3) above by investigating the logical form of plurals in the corpus.",
        "One determinant of logical form is the basic-level category of objects.",
        "For example, to refer to (ei, e2 } in the Table, an author has at least the following options:",
        "(b) the small red desk and the small blue sofa (c) the small desk and the small blue sofa (d) the small objects",
        "These descriptions exemplify three possible sources of variation:",
        "Disjunctive/Non-disjunctive: The last description, (3d), is non-disjunctive (i.e. it is logically a conjunction of properties).",
        "This, however, is only achievable through the use of a non-basic level value for the type of the entities (objects).",
        "Using the basic-level would require the disjunction ((type : desk) V (type : sofa)), which is the case in (3a-c).",
        "Given that basic-level categories are preferred on independent grounds (Rosch et al., 1976), we would expect examples like (3d) to be relatively infrequent.",
        "Aggregation: If a description is disjunctive, it may be aggregated, with properties common to all objects realised as wide-scope modifiers.",
        "For instance, in (3a), small modifies desk and sofa.",
        "By contrast, (3b) is non-aggregated: small occurs twice (modifying each coordinate in the np).",
        "Non-aggregated, disjunctive descriptions are logically equivalent to a partition of a set.",
        "For instance, (3c) partitions the set R = {ei, e2} into {{ei}, {e2}}, describing each element separately.",
        "Descriptions like (3b) are more overspecified than their aggregated counterparts due to the repetition of information.",
        "Paralellism/Similarity: Non-aggregated, disjunctive descriptions (partitions) may exhibit semantic parallelism: In (3b), elements of the partition are described using exactly the same attributes (that is, type, colour, and size).",
        "This is not the case in (3c), which does represent a partition but is nonparallel.",
        "Parallel structures maximise the similarity of elements of a partition, using the same attributes to describe both.",
        "The likelihood of propagation of an attribute across disjuncts is probably dependent on its degree of salience or preference (e.g. colour is expected to be more likely to be found in a parallel structure than size)."
