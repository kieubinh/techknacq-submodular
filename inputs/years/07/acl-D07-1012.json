        "The shallow processing approach predicts grammaticality based on n-gram frequency statistics: we present two versions, one which uses frequency thresholds and one which uses a decision tree trained on the frequencies of the rarest n-grams in the input sentence.",

        "The idea behind the parser-based approach to error detection is to use a broad-coverage hand-crafted precision grammar to detect ungrammatical sentences.",
        "This approach exploits the fact that a precision grammar is designed, in the traditional generative grammar sense (Chomsky, 1957), to distinguish grammatical sentences from ungrammatical sentences.",
        "This is in contrast to treebank-based grammars which tend to massively overgenerate and do not generally aim to discriminate between the two.",
        "In order for our approach to work, the coverage of the precision grammars must be broad enough to parse a large corpus of grammatical sentences, and for this reason, we choose the XLE (Maxwell and Kaplan, 1996), an efficient and robust parsing system for Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) (Kaplan and Bresnan, 1982) and the ParGram English grammar (Butt et al., 2002) for our experiments.",

        "Most publications in grammar-based automatic error detection focus on locating and categorising errors and giving feedback.",
        "Existing grammars are reused (Vandeventer Faltin, 2003), or grammars of limited size are developed from scratch (Reuer, 2003).",

        "Most shallow approaches to grammar error detection originate from the area of real-word spelling error correction.",

        "While he speculates that the bigram frequency should be compared to how often the same POS bigram is involved in errors in an error corpus, the proposed system uses the raw frequency with an empirically established threshold to decide whether a bigram indicates an error.",
        "In the same paper, a completely different approach is presented that uses the same POS tagger to consider spelling variants that have a different POS.",

        "A corpus of ungrammatical sentences can take the form of a learner corpus (Granger, 1993; Emi et al., 2004), i. e. a corpus of sentences produced by language learners, or it can take the form of a more general error corpus comprising sentences which are not necessarily produced in a language-learning context and which contain competence and performance errors produced by native and non-native speakers of the language (Becker et al., 1999; Foster and Vogel, 2004; Foster, 2005).",
