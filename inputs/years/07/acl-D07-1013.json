        "Syntactic dependency representations have a long history in descriptive and theoretical linguistics and many formal models have been advanced (Hudson, 1984; Mel'cuk, 1988; Sgall et al., 1986; Maruyama, 1990).",
        "A dependency graph of a sentence represents each word and its syntactic modifiers through labeled directed arcs, as shown in Figure 1, taken from the Prague Dependency Treebank (Bohmova et al., 2003).",
        "A primary advantage of dependency representations is that they have a natural mechanism for representing discontinuous constructions, arising from long distance dependencies or free word order, through non-projective dependency arcs, exemplified by the arc from jedna to Z in Figure 1.",
        "Syntactic dependency graphs have recently gained a wide interest in the computational linguistics community and have been successfully employed for many problems ranging from machine translation (Ding and Palmer, 2004) to ontology construction (Snow et al., 2004).",
        "In this work we focus on a common parsing paradigm called data-driven dependency parsing.",
        "Unlike grammar-based parsing, data-driven approaches learn to produce dependency graphs for sentences solely from an annotated corpus.",
        "The advantage of such models is that they are easily ported to any domain or language in which annotated resources exist.",
        "As evident from the CoNLL-X shared task on dependency parsing (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006), there are currently two dominant models for data-driven dependency parsing.",
        "The first is what Buchholz and Marsi (2006) call the \"all-pairs\" approach, where every possible arc is considered in the construction of the optimal parse.",
        "The second is the \"stepwise\" approach, where the optimal parse is built stepwise and where the subset of possible arcs considered depend on previous decisions.",
        "Theoretically, these models are extremely different.",
        "The all-pairs models are globally trained, use exact (or near exact) inference algorithms, and define features over a limited history of parsing decisions.",
        "The stepwise models use local training and greedy inference algorithms, but define features over a rich history of parse decisions.",
        "However, both models obtain similar parsing accuracies on a variety of languages, as seen in Table 1, which shows results for the two top performing systems in (\"all-pairs\") and Nivre et al.",
        "(2006) (\"stepwise\").",
        "Despite the similar performance in terms of overall accuracy, there are indications that the two types of models exhibit different behaviour.",
        "For example, Sagae and Lavie (2006) displayed that combining the predictions of both parsing models can lead to significantly improved accuracies.",
        "In order to pave the way for new and better methods, a much more detailed error analysis is needed to understand the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches.",
        "In this work we set out to do just that, focusing on the two top performing systems from the CoNLL-X shared task as representatives of the two dominant models in data-driven dependency parsing."

The parsing problem consists in finding a terminal configuration cm e Cx, starting from the initial configuration cx and taking the optimal transition t* = argmaxteT s(c, t) out of every configuration c. This can be seen as a greedy search for the optimal dependency graph, based on a sequence of locally optimal decisions in terms of the transition system.",
        "Many transition systems for data-driven dependency parsing are inspired by shift-reduce parsing, where configurations contain a stack for storing partially processed nodes.",

        "The data used in the experiments below are the outputs of MSTParser and MaltParser for all 13 languages, together with the corresponding gold standard graphs used in the evaluation.",
        "We constructed the data by simply concatenating a system's output for every language.",
        "This resulted in a single output file for each system and a corresponding single gold standard file.",
        "This method is sound because the data sets for each language contain approximately the same number of tokens - 5,000.",
        "Thus, evaluating system performance over the aggregated files can be roughly viewed as measuring system performance through an equally weighted arithmetic mean over the languages.",
        "It could be argued that a language by language comparison would be more appropriate than comparing system performance across all languages.",
        "However, as table Table 1 shows, the difference in accuracy between the two systems is typically small for all languages, and only in a few cases is this difference significant.",

        "To that end, we present a large set of experiments that relate parsing errors to a set of linguistic and structural properties of the input and predicted/gold standard dependency graphs.",
        "We argue that the results can be correlated to specific theoretical aspects of each model - in particular the trade-off highlighted in Section 2.4.",
        "For simplicity, all experiments report labeled parsing accuracies.",
        "Identical experiments using un-labeled parsing accuracies did not reveal any additional information.",
        "Furthermore, all experiments are based on the data from all 13 languages together, as explained in section 3.",
        "It is well known that parsing systems tend to have lower accuracies for longer sentences.",
        "Figure 2 shows the accuracy of both parsing models relative to sentence length (in bins of size 10: 1-10, 11-20, etc.).",
        "System performance is almost indistinguishable.",
        "However, MaltParser tends to perform better on shorter sentences, which require the greedy inference algorithm to make less parsing decisions.",
        "As a result, the chance of error propagation is reduced significantly when parsing these sentences.",
        "The fact that MaltParser has a higher accuracy (rather than the same accuracy) when the likelihood of error propagation is reduced comes from its richer feature representation.",
        "Another interesting property is accuracy relative to dependency length.",
        "The length of a dependency from word Wj to word Wj is simply equal to | i – j |.",
        "Longer dependencies typically represent modifiers of the root or the main verb in a sentence.",
        "Shorter dependencies are often modifiers of nouns such as determiners or adjectives or pronouns modifying their direct neighbours.",
        "Figure 3 measures the precision and recall for each system relative to dependency lengths in the predicted and gold standard dependency graphs.",
        "Precision represents the percentage of predicted arcs of length d that were correct.",
        "Recall measures the percentage of gold standard arcs of length d that were correctly predicted.",
        "Here we begin to see separation between the two systems.",
        "MSTParser is far more precise for longer dependency arcs, whereas MaltParser does better for shorter dependency arcs.",
        "This behaviour can be explained using the same reasoning as above: shorter arcs are created before longer arcs in the greedy parsing procedure of MaltParser and are less prone to error propagation.",
        "Theoretically, MST-Parser should not perform better or worse for edges of any length, which appears to be the case.",
        "There is still a slight degradation, but this can be attributed to long dependencies occurring more frequently in constructions with possible ambiguity.",
        "Note that even though the area under the curve is much larger for MSTParser, the number of dependency arcs with a length greater than ten is much smaller than the number with length less than ten, which is why the overall accuracy of each system is nearly identical.",
        "For all properties considered here, bin size generally shrinks in size as the value on the x-axis increases.",
        "The structure of the predicted and gold standard dependency graphs can also provide insight into the differences between each model.",
        "For example, measuring accuracy for arcs relative to their distance to the artificial root node will detail errors at different levels of the dependency graph.",
        "For a given arc, we define this distance as the number of arcs in the reverse path from the modifier of the arc to the root.",
        "Figure 4 plots the precision and recall of each system for arcs of varying distance to the root.",
        "Precision is equal to the percentage of dependency arcs in the predicted graph that are at a distance of d and are correct.",
        "Recall is the percentage of dependency arcs in the gold standard graph that are at a distance of d and were predicted.",
        "Figure 4 clearly shows that for arcs close to the root, MSTParser is much more precise than Malt-Parser, and vice-versa for arcs further away from the root.",
        "This is probably the most compelling graph given in this study since it reveals a clear distinction: MSTParser's precision degrades as the distance to the root increases whereas MaltParser's precision increases.",
        "The plots essentially run in opposite directions crossing near the middle.",
        "Dependency arcs further away from the root are usually constructed early in the parsing algorithm of MaltParser.",
        "Again a reduced likelihood of error propagation coupled with a rich feature representation benefits that parser substantially.",
        "Furthermore, MaltParser tends to over-predict root modifiers, because all words that the parser fails to attach as modifiers are automatically connected to the root, as explained in section 2.3.",
        "Hence, low precision for root modifiers (without a corresponding drop in recall) is an indication that the transition-based parser produces fragmented parses.",
        "The behaviour of MSTParser is a little trickier to explain.",
        "One would expect that its errors should be distributed evenly over the graph.",
        "For the most part this is true, with the exception of spikes at the ends of the plot.",
        "The high performance for root modification (distance of 1) can be explained through the fact that this is typically a low entropy decision - usually the parsing algorithm has to determine the main verb from a small set of possibilities.",
        "On the other end of the plot there is a sharp downwards spike for arcs of distance greater than 10.",
        "It turns out that MSTParser over-predicts arcs near the bottom of the graph.",
        "Whereas MaltParser pushes difficult parsing decisions higher in the graph, MSTParser appears to push these decisions lower.",
        "The next graph property we will examine aims to quantify the local neighbourhood of an arc within a dependency graph.",
        "Two dependency arcs, (i, j, l) and (i', jl') are classified as siblings if they represent syntactic modifications of the same word, i.e., i = i'.",
        "Figure 5 measures the precision and recall of each system relative to the number of predicted and gold standard siblings of each arc.",
        "There is not much to distinguish between the parsers on this metric.",
        "MSTParser is slightly more precise for arcs that are predicted with more siblings, whereas Malt-Parser has slightly higher recall on arcs that have more siblings in the gold standard tree.",
        "Arcs closer to the root tend to have more siblings, which ties this result to the previous ones.",
        "The final graph property we wish to look at is the degree of non-projectivity.",
        "The degree of a dependency arc from word w to word u is defined here as the number of words occurring between w and u that are not descendants of w and modify a word that does not occur between w and u (Nivre, 2006).",
        "In the example from Figure 1, the arc from jedna to Z has a degree of one, and all other arcs have a degree of zero.",
        "Figure 6 plots dependency arc precision and recall relative to arc degree in predicted and gold standard dependency graphs.",
        "MSTParser is more precise when predicting arcs with high degree and MaltParser vice-versa.",
        "Again, this can be explained by the fact that there is a tight correlation between a high degree of non-projectivity, dependency length, distance to root and number of siblings.",
        "It is important to relate each system's accuracy to a set of linguistic categories, such as parts of speech and dependency types.",
        "Therefore, we have made an attempt to distinguish a few broad categories that are cross-linguistically identifiable, based on the available documentation of the treebanks used in the shared task.",
        "For parts of speech, we distinguish verbs (including both main verbs and auxiliaries), nouns (including proper names), pronouns (sometimes also including determiners), adjectives, adverbs, adposi-tions (prepositions, postpositions), and conjunctions (both coordinating and subordinating).",
        "For dependency types, we distinguish a general root category (for labels used on arcs from the artificial root, including either a generic label or the label assigned to predicates of main clauses, which are normally verbs), a subject category, an object category (including both direct and indirect objects), and various categories related to coordination.",
        "Figure 7 shows the accuracy of the two parsers for different parts of speech.",
        "This figure measures labeled dependency accuracy relative to the part of speech of the modifier word in a dependency relation.",
        "We see that MaltParser has slightly better accuracy for nouns and pronouns, while MSTParser does better on all other categories, in particular conjunctions.",
        "This pattern is consistent with previous results insofar as verbs and conjunctions are often involved in dependencies closer to the root that span longer distances, while nouns and pronouns are typically attached to verbs and therefore occur lower in the graph, with shorter distances.",
        "Empirically, adverbs resemble verbs and conjunctions with respect to root distance but group with nouns and pronouns for dependency length, so the former appears to be more important.",
        "In addition, both conjunctions and adverbs tend to have a high number ofsiblings, making the results consistent with the graph in Figure 5.",
        "Adpositions and especially adjectives constitute a puzzle, having both high average root distance and low average dependency length.",
        "Adpositions do tend to have a high number of siblings on average, which could explain MSTParser's performance on that category.",
        "However, adjectives on average occur the furthest away from the root, have the shortest dependency length and the fewest siblings.",
        "As such, we do not have an explanation for this behaviour.",
        "In the top half of Figure 8, we consider precision and recall for dependents of the root node (mostly verbal predicates), and for subjects and objects.",
        "As already noted, MSTParser has considerably better precision (and slightly better recall) for the root category, but MaltParser has an advantage for the nominal categories, especially subjects.",
        "A possible explanation for the latter result, in addition to the length-based and graph-based factors invoked before, is that",
        "MaltParser integrates labeling into the parsing process, so that previously assigned dependency labels can be used as features, which may be important to disambiguate subjects and objects.",
        "Finally, in the bottom half of Figure 8, we display precision and recall for coordinate structures, divided into different groups depending on the type of analysis adopted in a particular treebank.",
        "The category CCH (coordinating conjunction as head) contains conjunctions analyzed as heads of coordinate structures, with a special dependency label that does not describe the function of the coordinate structure in the larger syntactic structure, a type of category found in the so-called Prague style analysis of coordination and used in the data sets for Arabic, Czech, and Slovene.",
        "The category CCD (coordinating conjunction as dependent) instead denotes conjunctions that are attached as dependents of one of the conjuncts with a label that only marks them as conjunctions, a type of category found in the data sets for Bulgarian, Danish, German, Portuguese, Swedish and Turkish.",
        "The two remaining categories contain conjuncts that are assigned a dependency label that only marks them as conjuncts and that are attached either to the conjunction (CJCC) or to another conjunct (CJCJ).",
        "The former is found in Bulgarian, Danish, and German; the latter only in Portuguese and Swedish.",
        "For most of the coordination categories there is little or no difference between the two parsers, but for CCH there is a difference in both precision and recall of almost 20 percentage points to MSTParser's advantage.",
        "This can be explained by noting that, while the categories CCD, CJCC, and CJCJ denote relations that are internal to the coordinate structure and therefore tend to be local, the CCH relations hold between the coordinate structure and its head, which is often a relation that spans over a greater distance and is nearer the root of the dependency graph.",
        "It is likely that the difference in accuracy for this type of dependency accounts for a large part of the difference in accuracy noted earlier for conjunctions as a part of speech.",
        "The experiments from the previous section highlight the fundamental trade-off between global training and exhaustive inference on the one hand and expressive feature representations on the other.",
        "Error propagation is an issue for MaltParser, which typically performs worse on long sentences, long dependency arcs and arcs higher in the graphs.",
        "But this is offset by the rich feature representation available to these models that result in better decisions for frequently occurring arc types like short dependencies or subjects and objects.",
        "The errors for MSTParser are spread a little more evenly.",
        "This is expected, as the inference algorithm and feature representation should not prefer one type of arc over another.",
        "What has been learned?",
        "It was already known that the two systems make different errors through the work of Sagae and Lavie (2006).",
        "However, in that work an arc-based voting scheme was used that took only limited account of the properties of the words connected by a dependency arc (more precisely, the overall accuracy of each parser for the part of speech of the dependent).",
        "The analysis in this work not only shows that the errors made by each system are different, but that they are different in a way that can be predicted and quantified.",
        "This is an important step in parser development.",
        "To get some upper bounds of the improvement that can be obtained by combining the strengths of each models, we have performed two oracle experiments.",
        "Given the output of the two systems, we can envision an oracle that can optimally choose which single parse or combination of sub-parses to predict as a final parse.",
        "For the first experiment the oracle is provided with the single best parse from each system, say G = (V, A) and G' = (V', A').",
        "The oracle chooses a parse that has the highest number of correctly predicted labeled dependency attachments.",
        "In this situation, the oracle accuracy is 84.5%.",
        "In the second experiment the oracle chooses the tree that maximizes the number of correctly predicted dependency attachments, subject to the restriction that the tree must only contain arcs from A U A'.",
        "This can be computed by setting the weight of an arc to 1 if it is in the correct parse and in the set A U A'.",
        "All other arc weights are set to negative infinity.",
        "One can then simply find the tree that has maximal sum of arc weights using directed spanning tree algorithms.",
        "This technique is similar to the parser voting methods used by Sagae and Lavie (2006).",
        "In this situation, the oracle accuracy is 86.9%.",
        "In both cases we see a clear increase in accuracy: 86.9% and 84.5% relative to 81% for the individual systems.",
        "This indicates that there is still potential for improvement, just by combining the two existing models.",
        "More interestingly, however, we can use the analysis to get ideas for new models.",
        "Below we sketch some possible new directions:",
        "1.",
        "Ensemble systems: The error analysis presented in this paper could be used as inspiration for more refined weighting schemes for ensemble systems of the kind proposed by Sagae and Lavie (2006), making the weights depend on a range of linguistic and graph-based factors.",
        "2.",
        "Hybrid systems: Rather than using an ensemble of several parsers, we may construct a single system integrating the strengths of each parser described here.",
        "This could defer to a greedy inference strategy during the early stages of the parse in order to benefit from a rich feature representation, but then default to a global exhaustive model as the likelihood for error propagation increases.",
        "3.",
        "Novel approaches: The two approaches investigated are each based on a particular combination of training and inference methods.",
        "We may naturally ask what other combinations may prove fruitful.",
        "For example, what about globally trained, greedy, transition-based models?",
        "This is essentially what Daumé III et al.",
        "(2006) provide, in the form of a general search-based structured learning framework that can be directly applied to dependency parsing.",
        "The advantage of this method is that the learning can set model parameters relative to errors resulting directly from the search strategy - such as error propagation due to greedy search.",
        "When combined with MaltParser's rich feature representation, this could lead to significant improvements in performance."
