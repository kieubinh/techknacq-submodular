        "Dependency parsing can be used to provide a \"bare bones\" syntactic structure that approximates semantics, and it has the additional advantage of admitting fast parsing algorithms (Eisner, 1996; McDonald et al., 2005b) with a negligible grammar constant in many cases.",
        "The latest state-of-the-art statistical dependency parsers are discriminative, meaning that they are based on classifiers trained to score trees, given a sentence, either via factored whole-structure scores (McDonald et al., 2005a) or local parsing decision scores (Hall et al., 2006).",
        "In the works cited, these scores are not intended to be interpreted as probabilistic quantities.",

        "A probability model permits alternative decoding procedures (Goodman, 1996).",
        "Well-motivated hidden variable training procedures (such as EM and conditional EM) are also readily available for probabilistic models.",
        "Finally, probability models can be chained together (as in a noisy channel model), mixed, or combined in a product-of-experts.",
