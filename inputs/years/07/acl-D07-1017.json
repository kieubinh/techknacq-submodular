        "Figure 2 shows the variation in the accuracy for the task of predicting the correct and incorrect inference rules for the different systems when varying the value of a.",
        "To obtain this graph, we classified the inference rules in the test set only as correct and incorrect without further classification based on directionality.",
        "All of our four systems obtained accuracy scores in the range of 68-70% showing a good performance on the task of determining plausibility.",
        "This however is only a small improvement over the baseline score of 66% obtained by assuming every inference to be plausible (as will be shown below, our system has most impact not on determining plausibility but on determining directionality).",
        "Manual inspection of some system errors showed that the most common errors were due to the well-known 'problem of an-tonymy' when applying the distributional hypothesis.",
        "In DIRT, one can learn rules like \"X loves Y' <=> \"X hates Y'.",
        "Since the plausibility of inference rules is determined by applying the distributional hypothesis and the antonym paths tend to take the same set of classes for X and Y, our models find it difficult to filter out the incorrect inference rules which DIRT ends up learning for this very same reason.",
        "To improve our system, one avenue of research is to focus specifically on filtering incorrect inference rules involving antonyms (perhaps using methods similar to (Lin et al.",
        "2003)).",
        "Figure 3 shows the variation in the accuracy for the task of predicting the directionality of the correct inference rules for the different systems when varying the value of p. To obtain this graph, we separated the correct inference rules form the incorrect ones and ran all the systems on only the correct ones, predicting only the directionality of each rule for different values of p. Too low a value of p means that the algorithms tend to predict most things as unidirectional and too high a value means that the algorithms tend to predict everything as bidirectional.",
        "It is clear from the figure that the performance of all the systems reach their peak performance in the range 2 < p < 4, which agrees with our intuition of obtaining the best system accuracy in a medium range.",
        "It is also seen that the best accuracy for each of the models goes up as compared to the corresponding values obtained in the general framework.",
        "The best performing system, IRM using CBC RSPs, reaches a peak accuracy of 63.64%, a much higher score than its accuracy score of 48% under the general framework and also a significant improvement over the baseline score of 48.48% for this task.",
        "Paired t-test shows that the difference is statistically significant at p<0.05.",
        "The baseline score for this task is obtained by assigning the most frequently occurring direction to all the correct inference rules.",
        "This paints a very encouraging picture about the ability of the algorithm to identify the directionality much more accurately if it can be provided with a cleaner set of inference rules."

        "Semantic inferences are fundamental to understanding natural language and are an integral part of many natural language applications such as question answering, summarization and textual entailment.",
        "Given the availability of large amounts of text and with the increase in computation power, learning them automatically from large text corpora has become increasingly feasible and popular.",
        "We introduced the Directionality Hypothesis, which states that if two paths share a significant number of relational selectional preferences (RSPs) and if the first has many more RSPs than the second, then the second path implies the first.",
        "Our experiments show empirical evidence that the Directionality Hypothesis with RSPs can indeed be used to filter incorrect inference rules and find the directionality of correct ones.",
        "We believe that this result is one step in the direction of solving the basic problem of semantic inference.",
        "Several questions must still be addressed.",
        "The models need to be improved in order to address the problem of incorrect inference rules.",
        "The distributional hypothesis does not provide a framework to address the issue with antonymy relations like \"X loves Y' <=> \"X hates Y' and hence other ideas need to be investigated.",
        "Ultimately, our goal is to improve the performance of NLP applications with better inferencing capabilities.",
        "Several recent data points, such as (Harabagiu and Hickl 2006), and others discussed in Section 2.1, give promise that refined inference rules for directionality may indeed improve question answering, textual entailment and multi-document summarization accuracies.",
        "It is our hope that methods such as the one proposed in this paper may one day be used to harness the richness of automatically created inference rule resources within large-scale NLP applications."
