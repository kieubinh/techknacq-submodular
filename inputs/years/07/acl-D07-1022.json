        "On this task, the Collins model achieves 90% F1-accuracy.",
        "Extended for new languages by Bikel (2004), it achieves only 75% on Arabic and 72% on Hebrew.",
        "It should come as no surprise that Semitic parsing lags behind English.",
        "The Collins model was carefully designed and tuned for WSJEnglish.",
        "Many of the features in the model depend on English syntax or Penn Treebank annotation conventions.",
        "Inherent in its crafting is the assumption that a million words of training text are available.",
        "Finally, for English, it need not handle morphological ambiguity.",
        "Indeed, the figures cited above for Arabic and Hebrew are achieved using gold-standard morphological disambiguation and part-of-speech tagging.",
        "* The authors acknowledge helpful feedback from the anonymous reviewers, Sharon Goldwater, Rebecca Hwa, Alon Lavie, and Shuly Wintner.",
        "Given only surface words, Arabic performance drops by 1.5 Fi points.",
        "The Hebrew Treebank (unlike Arabic) is built over morphemes, a convention we view as sensible, though it complicates parsing.",
        "This paper considers parsing for morphologically rich languages, with Hebrew as a test case.",
        "Morphology and syntax are two levels of linguistic description that interact.",
        "This interaction, we argue, can affect disambiguation, so we explore here the matter of joint disambiguation.",
        "This involves the comparison of a pipeline (where morphology is inferred first and syntactic parsing follows) with joint inference.",
        "We present a generalization of the two, and show new ways to do joint inference for this task that does not involve a computational blow-up.",

        "(h.) shows a morphological \"sausage\" lattice that encodes the morpheme-sequence analyses L(x) possible for a shortened sentence (unmodified \"meadow\").",
        "Shaded states are word boundaries, white states are intra-word morpheme boundaries; in practice we add POS tags to the arcs, to permit disambiguation.",
        "According to both native speakers we polled, both interpretations are grammatical – note the long-distance agreement required for grammaticality.",
        "(2001) built a Hebrew Treebank of 88,747 words (4,783 sentences) and parsed it using a probabilistic model.",
        "However, they assumed that the input to the parser was already (perfectly) morphologically disambiguated.",
        "This assumption is very common in multilingual parsing (see, for example, Cowan et al., 2005, and Buchholz et al., 2006).",
        "Until recently, the NLP literature on morphological processing was dominated by the largely non-probabilistic application of finite-state transducers (Kaplan and Kay, 1981; Koskenniemi, 1983; Beesley and Karttunen, 2003) and the largely unsupervised discovery of morphological patterns in text (Goldsmith, 2001; Wicentowski, 2002); Hebrew morphology receives special attention in Levinger et al.",

        "(2004), and Adler and El-hadad (2006).",
        "Lately a few supervised disambiguation methods have come about, including hidden Markov models (Hakkani-Tur et al., 2000; Hajic et al., 2001), conditional random fields (Kudo et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2005b), and local support vector machines (Habash and Rambow, 2005).",
        "There are also morphological disambiguators designed specifically for Hebrew (Segal, 2000; Bar-Haim et al., 2005).",
        "In NLP, the separation of syntax and morphology is understandable when the latter is impoverished, as in English.",
        "When both involve high levels of ambiguity, this separation becomes harder to justify, as argued by Tsarfaty (2006).",
        "To our knowledge, that is the only study to move toward joint inference of syntax and morphology, presenting joint models and testing approximation of these models with two parsers: one a pipeline (segmentation – tagging – parsing), the other involved joint inference of segmentation and tagging, with the result piped to the parser.",
        "The latter was slightly more accurate.",
        "Tsar-faty discussed but did not carry out joint inference.",
        "In a morphologically rich language, the different morphemes that make up a word can play a variety of different syntactic roles.",
        "A reasonable linguistic analysis might not make such morphemes immediate sisters in the tree.",
        "Indeed, the convention of the Hebrew Treebank is to place morphemes (rather than words) at the leaves of the parse tree, allowing morphemes of a word to attach to different nonterminal parents.",
        "Generating parse trees over morphemes requires the availability of morphological information when parsing.",
        "Because this analysis is not in general reducible to sequence labeling (tagging), the problem is different from POS tagging.",
        "Figure 1 gives an example from Hebrew that illustrates the interaction between morphology and syntax.",
        "In this example, we show two interpretations of the surface text, with the first being a more common natural analysis for the sentence.",
        "The first and third-to-last words' analyses depend on each other if the resulting analysis is to be the more natural one: for this analysis the first seven words have to be a noun phrase, while for the less common analysis (\"lying there nicely\") only the first six words compose a noun phrase, with the last two words composing a verb phrase.",
        "Consistency depends on a long-distance dependency that a finite-state morphology model cannot capture, but a model that involves syntactic information can.",
        "Disambiguating the syntax aids in disambiguating the morphology, suggesting that a joint model will perform both more accurately.",
        "In sum, joint inference of morphology and syntax is expected to allow decisions of both kinds to influence each other, enforce adherence to constraints at both levels, and to diminish the propagation of errors inherent in pipelines."

Instead, we use the joint, pg(t, m), which, strictly speaking, makes the model deficient (\"leaky\"), but permits a dynamic programming solution.",
        "Our models will be parametrized using either un-normalized weights (a log-linear model) or multinomial distributions.",
        "Either way, both models define scores over parts of analyses, and it may be advantageous to give one model relatively greater strength, especially since we often ignore constant normalizing factors.",

This is, of course pL(M?j = mj | x), the same quantity computed for fvari,a, except the score of a path in the lattice is now a sum of posteriors rather than a product.",

        "The metric is based on an alignment between the hypothesized sentence and the goldstandard sentence.",
        "We used a similar evaluation metric, which takes into account the information about parallel word boundaries as well, a piece of information that does not appear naturally in speech recognition.",

        "In case the best segmentation does not lead to a grammatical morpheme sequence (under the syntax model), the morphology model needs to be able to give relative strengths to the alternatives.",
        "The unigram model is less able to do this, because it ignores the context of the word, and so the benefit of joint parsing is lost.",
        "Most commonly the tuned value of a is around 10 (not shown, to preserve clarity).",
        "Because of ignored normalization constants, this does not mean that morphology is \"10 x more important than syntax,\" but it does mean that, for a particular pL and Pg, tuning their relative importance in decoding can improve accuracy.",

        "Some key differences preclude direct comparison: we modeled fine-grained tags (though we report both kinds of tagging accurcy), we employed a richer morphological lexicon (permitting analyses that are not just segmentation), and a different training/test split and length filter (we used longer sentences).",
