        "Sequence alignment is a problem that crops up in many forms, both in computational linguistics (CL) and in other endeavors.",
        "The ability to find an optimal alignment between two sequences has found application in a number of areas of CL, including phonetic modeling (Ristad and Yianilos, 1998), name transcription (Huang et al., 2004), and duplicate detection or information integration (Bilenko and Mooney, 2003; McCallum et al., 2005).",
        "Sequence alignment is a member of a broader class of problems which we might call sequence transduction, to which one of the core CL challenges, machine translation, belongs.",
        "Under the assumption that one string (the target) is produced through a series of local edits to another string (the source), and given an edit cost matrix, the optimal sequence of edits can be efficiently computed through dynamic programming (Needleman andWunsch, 1970).",
        "While the cost matrix traditionally has been set by hand, several recent papers have proposed determining edit costs empirically.",
        "These proposals arise from a variety oflearning paradigms, including generative models (Ristad and Yianilos, 1998; Bilenko and Mooney, 2003), conditional random fields (McCallum et al., 2005), maximum-margin methods (Joachims, 2003), and gradient boosting (Parker et al., 2006).",
        "While approaches based on generative models support only limited feature engineering, discriminative approaches share the advantage of allowing arbitrary features of the input sequences.",
        "We describe a new sequence alignment model based on the averaged perceptron (Collins, 2002), which shares with the above approaches the ability to exploit arbitrary features of the input sequences, but is distinguished from them by its relative simplicity and the incremental character of its training procedure.",
        "The fact that it is an online algorithm makes it straightforward to adapt to a range ofprob-lems.",
        "To show this, we evaluate the approach on several different tasks, some of them merely illustrative, but some with clear practical significance, particularly the problem of named entity transcription."

        "On a more practical level, this data set is noisier, occasionally containing character sequences in one string for which corresponding characters are lacking from its paired string.",
        "On the other hand, the Mandarin problem contains full names, rather than name components, which provides more context for ranking.",
        "We trained the edit model on both data sets using both the sampling procedure outlined above and the self-generation training regime, in each case for 20 epochs, producing models of orders from 1 to 3.",
        "However, we found that the efficiency of the phrase-based SMT system described in the previous section would be limited for this task, mainly due to two reasons: the character-based phrase models due to possible unseen phrases in an evaluation corpus, and the character sequence model as all candidate transcriptions confidently belong to the target language.",
        "Therefore, to make the phrase-based SMT system robust against data sparseness for the ranking task, we also make use of the IBM Model 4 (Brown et al., 1993) in both directions.",
        "The experiments show that IBM Model 4 is a reliable model for the ranking task.",
        "For each evaluation pair, we then ranked all available evaluation transcriptions, recording where in this list the true transcription fell.",
        "Table 8 compares the various models, showing the fraction of cases for which the true transcription was ranked highest, and its mean reciprocal rank (MRR).",
        "Both the phrase-based SMT model and the edit model perform well on this task.",
        "While the best configuration of PTEM outperforms the best SMT model, the differences are not significant at the 95% confidence level.",
        "However, compare these performance scores to those returned by the system ofLee and Chang (2003), who reported a peak MRR of 0.82 in similar experiments involving data different from ours.",

        "The comparison is interesting, inasmuch it does not support the conclusion that one regime is uniformly superior to the other.",
        "While generation regime yields the best performance on Arabic (using a high-order model), the ranking regime scores best on Mandarin (with a low-order model).",
        "When training a model to generate, it seems clear that more context in the form of larger n-grams is beneficial.",

        "The training of these models is an instance of the \"Generation\" scenario outlined in Section 2.3.",
        "However, because machine translation is a more challenging problem than name transcription (larger vocabularies, higher levels of ambiguity, non-monotonic transduction, etc.",
        "), our generalpurpose approach to generation training may be intractable for MT.",
        "Instead, much ofthe focus ofthese papers are the heuristics that are required in order to train such a model in this fashion, including feature selection using external resources (phrase tables), staged training, and generating to BLEU-maximal sequences, rather than the reference target.",
        "Klementiev and Roth (2006) explore the use of a perceptron-based ranking model for the purpose of finding name transliterations across comparable corpora.",
        "They do not calculate an explicit alignment between strings.",
        "Instead, they decompose a string pair into a collection of features derived from character n-grams heuristically paired based on their locations in the respective strings.",
        "Thus, Klementiev and Roth, in common with the two MT approaches described above, carefully control the features used by the perceptron.",
        "In contrast to these approaches, our algorithm discovers latent alignments, essentially selecting those features necessary for good performance on the task at hand.",

        "Comprising two sub-models, one for matching strings and one for non-matching, the model is trained on sequence pairs explicitly labeled \"match\" or \"non-match,\" and some care is apparently needed in selecting appropriate non-matching strings.",
        "It is therefore unclear how this model would be extended to problems involving ranking or generation.",
        "Joachims (2003) proposes SVM-align, a sequence alignment model similar in structure to that described here, but which sets weights through direct numerical optimization.",
        "Training involves exposing the model to sequence pairs, along with the correct alignment and some number of \"decoy\" sequences.",
        "The reliance on an explicit alignment and hand-chosen decoys yields a somewhat less flexible solution than that presented here.",
        "It is not clear whether these features of the training regime are indispensable, or whether they might be generalized to increase the approach's scope.",
