        "When the source of MWU for the type 1 experiments was the BBN, however, accuracy improved significantly over the baseline and the result is the highest accuracy achieved over all experiment types.",
        "One possible reason for the low accuracy scores in the type 1 experiments with the (Chieu and Ng, 2003) MWU chunked data could be noisy MWUs which negatively affect the grammar.",

        "In order to avoid changing the grammar through concatenation of MWU components (as in experiment type 1) and thus risking side-effects which cause some heretofore likely constructions become less likely and vice versa, we ran the next set of experiments (type 2) which leave the original grammar intact and alter the input f-structures only.",
        "These experiments were more successful overall and we achieved an improvement over the baseline for both BLEU and String Edit Distance scores with all MWU types.",
        "As can be seen from Table 11 the best score for automatically chunked MWUs are decreases marginally when we added the Stanford MWUs.",
        "In our final set of experiments (type 3) although the accuracy for all three types of MWUs improves over the baseline, accuracy is a little below the type 2 experiments.",
        "It is difficult to compare sentence generators since the information contained in the input varies greatly between systems, systems are evaluated on different test sets and coverage also varies considerably.",
