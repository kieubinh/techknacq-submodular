        "Another feature which characterises statistical generators is the probability model used to select the most probable sentence from among the space of all possible sentences licensed by the grammar.",
        "One generation technique is to first generate all possible sentences, storing them in a word lattice (Langkilde and Knight, 1998) or, alternatively, a generation forest, a packed represention ofalternate trees proposed by the generator (Langkilde, 2000), and then select the most probable sequence of words via an n-gram language model.",

        "In an error analysis of type 1 experiments with (Chieu and Ng, 2003) concatenated MWUs, we inspected those sentences where accuracy had decreased from the baseline.",
        "We found that for over half (51.5%) of these sentences, the input f-structures contained no multi-word units at all.",
        "The problem for these sentences therefore lay with the probabilistic grammar extracted from the MWU-chunked training data.",
        "When the source of MWU for the type 1 experiments was the BBN, however, accuracy improved significantly over the baseline and the result is the highest accuracy achieved over all experiment types.",
        "One possible reason for the low accuracy scores in the type 1 experiments with the (Chieu and Ng, 2003) MWU chunked data could be noisy MWUs which negatively affect the grammar.",

        "In order to avoid changing the grammar through concatenation of MWU components (as in experiment type 1) and thus risking side-effects which cause some heretofore likely constructions become less likely and vice versa, we ran the next set of experiments (type 2) which leave the original grammar intact and alter the input f-structures only.",
        "These experiments were more successful overall and we achieved an improvement over the baseline for both BLEU and String Edit Distance scores with all MWU types.",
        "As can be seen from Table 11 the best score for automatically chunked MWUs are decreases marginally when we added the Stanford MWUs.",
        "In our final set of experiments (type 3) although the accuracy for all three types of MWUs improves over the baseline, accuracy is a little below the type 2 experiments.",
        "It is difficult to compare sentence generators since the information contained in the input varies greatly between systems, systems are evaluated on different test sets and coverage also varies considerably.",
