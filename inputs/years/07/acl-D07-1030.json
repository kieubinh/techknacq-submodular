        "Within the Machine Translation (MT) field, by far the most dominant paradigm is SMT, but many existing commercial systems are rule-based.",
        "In this research, we are interested in answering the question of whether the existing RBMT systems could be helpful to the development of an SMT system.",
        "To find the answer, let us first consider the following facts:",
        "• Existing RBMT systems are usually provided as a black box.",
        "To make use of such systems, the most convenient way might be working on the translation results directly.",
        "• SMT methods rely on bilingual corpus.",
        "As a data driven method, SMT usually needs large bilingual corpus as the training data.",
        "Based on the above facts, in this paper we propose a method using the existing RBMT system as a black box to produce a synthetic bilingual corpus, which will be used as the training data for the SMT system.",
        "For a given language pair, the monolingual corpus is usually much larger than the real bilingual corpus.",
        "We use the existing RBMT system to translate the monolingual corpus into synthetic bilingual corpus.",
        "Then, even if there is no real bilingual corpus, we can train an SMT system with the monolingual corpus and the synthetic bilingual corpus.",
        "If there exist n available RBMT systems for the desired language pair, we use the n systems to produce n synthetic bilingual corpora, and n translation models are trained with the n corpora respectively.",
        "We name such a model the synthetic model.",
        "An interpolated translation model is built by linear interpolating the n synthetic models.",
        "In our experiments using BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) as the metric, the interpolated synthetic model achieves a relative improvement of 11.7% over the best RBMT system that is used to produce the synthetic bilingual corpora.",
        "Moreover, if a real bilingual corpus is available for the desired language pair, we build another translation model, which is named the standard model.",
        "Then we can build an interpolated model by interpolating the standard model and the synthetic models.",
        "Experimental results show that the interpolated model achieves an absolute improvement of 0.0245 BLEU score (13.1% relative) as compared with the standard model.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",

        "Then we train an SMT system with the combination of this synthetic bilingual corpus and the real bilingual corpus.",
        "The BLEU score of such system is 0.1887, while that of the model interpolation system is 0.2020.",
        "It indicates that the model interpolation method is significantly better than the corpus merge method.",
        "As discussed in Section 5.5, the number of the overlapped phrase pairs among the standard model and the synthetic models is very small.",
        "The newly added phrase pairs from the synthetic models can assist to improve the translation results of the interpolated model.",
        "In this section, we will use an example to further discuss the reason behind the improvement of the SMT system by using synthetic bilingual corpus.",
        "Table 5 shows an English sentence and its Chinese translations produced by different methods.",
        "And Figure 3 shows the phrase pairs used for translation.",
        "The results show that imperfect translations of RBMT systems can be also used to boost the performance of an SMT system.",
        "Further analysis is shown in Table 6.",
        "After adding the synthetic corpus produced by the RBMT systems, the interpolated model outperforms the standard models mainly for the following two reasons: (1) some new phrase pairs are added into the interpolated model.",
        "37.6% phrase pairs (1993 out of 5306) are newly learned and used for translation.",
        "For example, the phrase pair \"after-sale service <-> Uü=fjK# (shouhoufuwu)\" is added; (2) The probability distribution of the phrase pairs is changed.",
        "For example, the probabilities of the two pairs \"a brand name <-> (pinpai)\" and \"and the creation of <-> f \"frjii; (he chuangzao)\" increase.",
        "The probabilities of the other two pairs \"brand name <-> rhW (pinpai)\" and \"and the creation of a <-> fp IÜja (he jianli)\" decrease.",
        "We found that 930 phrase pairs, which are also in the phrase table of the standard model, are used by the interpolated model for translation but not used by the standard model.",
        "According to (Koehn and Monz, 2006; Callison-Burch et al., 2006), the RBMT systems are usually not adequately appreciated by BLEU.",
        "We also manually evaluated the RBMT systems and SMT systems in terms of both adequacy and fluency as defined in (Koehn and Monz, 2006).",
        "The evaluation results show that the SMT system with the interpolated model, which achieves the highest BLEU scores in Table 2, achieves slightly better adequacy and fluency scores than the two RBMT systems."
