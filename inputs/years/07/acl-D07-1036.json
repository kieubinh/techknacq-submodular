        "Statistical machine translation relies heavily on the available training data.",
        "Typically, the more data is used to estimate the parameters of the translation model, the better it can approximate the true translation probabilities, which will obviously lead to a higher translation performance.",
        "However, large corpora are not easily available.",
        "The collected corpora are usually from very different areas.",
        "For example, the parallel corpora provided by LDC come from quite different domains, such as Hongkong laws, Hangkong Hansards and Hongkong news.",
        "This results in the problem that a translation system trained on data from a particular domain(e.g. Hongkong Hansards) will perform poorly when translating text from a different domain(e.g. news articles).",
        "Our experiments also show that simply putting all these domain specific corpora together will not always improve translation quality.",
        "From another aspect, larger amount of training data also requires larger computational resources.",
        "With the increasing of training data, the improvement of translation quality will become smaller and smaller.",
        "Therefore, while keeping collecting more and more parallel corpora, it is also important to seek effective ways of making better use of available parallel training data.",
        "There are two cases when we train a SMT system.",
        "In one case, we know the target test set or target test domain, for example, when building a specific domain SMT system or when participating the NIST MT evaluation.",
        "In the other case, we are unaware of any information of the testing data.",
        "This paper presents two methods to exploit full potential of the available parallel corpora in the two cases.",
        "For the first case, we try to optimize the training data offline to make it match the test data better in domain, topic and style, thus improving the translation performance.",
        "For the second case, we first divide the training data into several domains and train submodels for each domain.",
        "Then, in the translation process, we try to optimize the predefined models according to the online input source sentence.",
        "Information retrieval model is used for similar sentences retrieval in both methods.",
        "Our preliminary experiments show that both methods can improve SMT performance without using any additional data.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the offline data selection and optimization method.",
        "Section 3 describes the online model optimization method.",
        "The evaluation and discussion are given in section 4.",

      "text": [
        "In offline training data optimization, we assume that the target test data or target test domain is known before building the translation model.",
        "We first select sentences similar to the test text using information retrieval method to construct a small and adapted training data.",
        "Then the extracted similar subset is used to optimize the distribution of the whole training data.",
        "The adapted and the optimized training data will be used to train new translation models.",
        "We use information retrieval method for similar data retrieval.",
        "The standard TF-IDF (Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency) term weighting scheme is used to measure the similarity between the test sentence and the training sentence.",
        "TF-IDF is a similarity measure widely used in information retrieval.",
        "Each document Di is represented as a vector (wn,wi2,...,win), n is the size of the vocabulary.",
        "Wj is calculate as follows:",
        "wj = tfj x log(idfj )",
        "tf j is the term frequency(TF) of the j-th word in the vocabulary in the document D , i.e. the number of occurrences; dfj is the inverse document frequency(IDF) of the j-th word calculated as below:",
        "# documents idfj =-.",
        "# documents containing j - th term",
        "The similarity between two documents is then defined as the cosine of the angle between the two vectors.",
        "We perform information retrieval using the Lemur toolkit.",
        "The source language part of the parallel training data is used as the document collection.",
        "Each sentence represents one document.",
        "Each sentence from the test data or test domain is used as one separate query.",
        "In the sentence retrieval process, both the query and the document are converted into vectors by assigning a term weight to each word.",
        "Then the cosine similarity is calculated proportional to the inner product of the two vectors.",
        "All retrieved sentences are ranked according to their similarity with the query.",
        "We pair each of the retrieved sentences with the corresponding target part and the top N most similar sentences pairs are put together to form an adapted parallel data.",
        "N ranges from one to several thousand in our experiments.",
        "Since Lemur toolkit gives the similarity score for each retrieved sentences, it is also possible to select the most similar sentences according to the similarity score.",
        "Note that the selected similar data can contain duplicate sentences as the top N retrieval results for different test sentences can contain the same training sentences.",
        "The duplicate sentences will force the translation probability towards the more often seen words.",
        "Intuitively, this could help.",
        "In experiment section, we will compare experimental results by keeping or removing duplicates to see how the duplicate sentences affect the translations.",
        "The selected subset contains the similar sentences with the test data or test domain.",
        "It matches the test data better in domain, topic and style.",
        "Hopefully, training translation model using this adapted parallel data may helpful for improving translation performance.",
        "In addition, the translation model trained using the selected subset is usually much smaller than that trained using the whole translation data.",
        "Limiting the size of translation model is very important for some real applications.",
        "Since SMT systems usually require large computation resource.",
        "The complexity of standard training and decoding algorithm depends mainly on the size of the parallel training data and the size of the translation model.",
        "Limiting the size of the training data with the similar translation performance would also reduce the memories and speed up the translations.",
        "In the information retrieval process, we only use the source language part for document indexing and query generating.",
        "It is easy to get source part of the test data.",
        "This is different from the common language model adaptation methods, which have to do at lease one pass machine translation to get the candidate English translation as query(Zhao 2004, Zhang 2006).",
        "So our method has the advantage that it is independent from the quality of baseline translation system.",
        "There are two factors on training data that influence the translation performance of SMT system: the scale and the quality.",
        "In some sense, we improve the quality of the training data by selecting the similar sentence to form an adapted training set.",
        "However, we also reduce the scale of the training data at the same time.",
        "Although this is helpful for some small device applications, it is also possible to induce the data sparseness problem.",
        "Here, we introduce a method to optimize between the scale and the quality of the training data.",
        "The basic idea is that we still use all the available training data; by redistributing the weight of each sentence pairs we adapt the whole training data to the test domain.",
        "In our experiments, we simply combine the selected small similar subset and the whole training data.",
        "The weights of each sentence pairs are changed accordingly.",
        "Figure 1 shows the procedure of the optimization.",
        "As can be seen, through the optimization, the weight of the similar sentence pairs are increased, while the general sentence pairs still have an ordinary weight.",
        "This make the translation model inclined to give higher probabilities to the adapted words, and at the same time avoid the data sparseness problem.",
        "Since we only change the weight of the sentence pairs, and no new training data is introduced, the translation model size trained on the optimized data will keep as the same as the original one.",
        "We use GIZA++ toolkit for word alignment training in the training process.",
        "The input training file formats for GIZA++ is as follows: Each training sentence pair is stored in three lines.",
        "The first line is the number of times this sentence pair occurred.",
        "The second line is the source sentence where each token is replaced by its unique integer id and the third is the target sentence in the same format.",
        "To deal with our optimized training data, we only need to change the number of sentence pairs in the first line accordingly.",
        "This will not call for extra training time and memory for the whole training process.",
        "It might be beneficial to investigate other sophisticated weighting schemes under the similar idea, such as to give more precise fractional weights to the sentences according the retrieval similarity scores."
