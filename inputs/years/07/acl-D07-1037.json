        "The goal of topic segmentation is to discover story boundaries in the stream of text or audio recordings.",
        "Story is broadly defined as segment of text containing topically related sentences.",
        "In particular, the task may require segmenting a stream of broadcast news, addressed by the Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) evaluation project (Wayne, 2000; Allan, 2002).",
        "In this case topically related sentences belong to the same news story.",
        "While we are considering TDT data sets in this paper, we would like to pose the problem more broadly and consider a domain-independent approach to topic segmentation.",
        "Previous research on topic segmentation has shown that lexical coherence is a reliable indicator of topical relatedness.",
        "Therefore, many approaches have concentrated on different ways of estimating lexical coherence of text segments, such as semantic similarity between words (Kozima, 1993), similarity between blocks of text (Hearst, 1994), and adaptive language models (Beeferman et al., 1999).",
        "These approaches use word repetitions to evaluate coherence.",
        "Since the sentences covering the same story represent a coherent discourse segment, they typically contain the same or related words.",
        "Repeated words build lexical chains that are consequently used to estimate lexical coherence.",
        "This can be done either by analyzing the number of overlapping lexical chains (Hearst, 1994) or by building a short-range and long-range language model (Beefer-man et al., 1999).",
        "More recently, topic segmentation with lexical chains has been successfully applied to segmentation of news stories, multi-party conversation and audio recordings (Galley et al., 2003).",
        "When the task is to segment long streams of text containing stories which may continue at a later point in time, for example developing news stories, building of lexical chains becomes intricate.",
        "In addition, the word repetitions do not account for synonymy and semantic relatedness between words and therefore may not be able to discover coherence of segments with little word overlap.",
        "Our approach aims at discovering semantic relatedness beyond word repetition.",
        "It is based on the notion of semantic cohesion rather than lexical cohesion.",
        "We propose to use a similarity metric between segments of text that takes into account semantic associations between words spanning a number ofseg-ments.",
        "This method approximates lexical chains by averaging the similarity to a number of previous text segments and accounts for synonymy by using a hybrid document indexing scheme.",

        "For the topic segmentation task we would like to define a similarity measure that accounts for synonymy and semantic association between words.",
        "This similarity measure will be used to evaluate semantic cohesion between text units and the decrease in semantic cohesion will be used as an indicator of a story boundary.",
        "First, we develop a document representation which supports this similarity measure.",
        "Capturing semantic relations between words in a document representation is difficult.",
        "Different approaches tried to overcome the term independence assumption of the bag-of-words representation (Salton and McGill, 1983) by using distributional term clusters (Slonim and Tishby, 2000) and expanding the document vectors with synonyms, see (Levow et al., 2005).",
        "Since content words can be combined into semantic classes there has been a considerable interest in low-dimensional representations.",
        "Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Deerwester et al., 1990) is one of the best known dimensionality reduction algorithms.",
        "In the LSA space documents are indexed with latent semantic concepts.",
        "LSA maps all words to low dimensional vectors.",
        "However, the notion of semantic relatedness is defined differently for subsets of the vocabulary.",
        "In addition, the numerical information, abbreviations and the documents' style may be very good indicators of their topic.",
        "However, this information is no longer available after the dimensionality reduction.",
        "We use a hybrid approach to document indexing to address these issues.",
        "We keep the notion of latent semantic concepts and also try to preserve the specifics of the document collection.",
        "Therefore, we divide the vocabulary into two sets: nouns and the rest of the vocabulary.",
        "The set of nouns does not include proper nouns.",
        "We use a method of spectral embedding, as described below and compute a low-dimensional representation for documents using only the nouns.",
        "We also compute a tf-idf representation for documents using the other set of words.",
        "Since we can treat each latent semantic concept in the low-dimensional representation as part of the vocabulary, we combine the two vector representations for each document by concatenating them.",
        "A vector space representation for documents and sentences is convenient and makes the similarity metrics such as cosine and distance readily available.",
        "However, those metrics will not work if they don't have a meaningful linguistic interpretation.",
        "Spectral methods comprise a family of algorithms that embed terms and documents in a low-dimensional vector space.",
        "These methods use pairwise relations between the data points encoded in a similarity matrix.",
        "The main step is to find an embedding for the data that preserves the original similarities.",
        "GLSA We use Generalized Latent Semantic Analysis (GLSA) (Matveeva et al., 2005) to compute spectral embedding for nouns.",
        "GLSA computes term vectors and since we would like to use spectral embedding for nouns, it is well-suited for our approach.",
        "GLSA extends the ideas of LSA by defining different ways to obtain the similarities matrix and has been shown to outperform LSA on a number of applications (Matveeva and Levow, 2006).",
        "GLSA begins with a matrix of pairwise term similarities S, computes its eigenvectors U and uses the first k of them to represent terms and documents, for details see (Matveeva et al., 2005).",
        "The justification for this approach is the theorem by Eckart and Young (Golub and Reinsch, 1971) stating that inner product similarities between the term vectors based on the eigenvectors of S represent the best element-wise approximation to the entries in S. In other words, the inner product similarity in the GLSA space preserves the semantic similarities in S.",
        "Since our representation will try to preserve semantic similarities in S it is important to have a matrix of similarities which is linguistically motivated.",
        "PMI Following (Turney, 2001; Matveeva et al., 2005), we use point-wise mutual information (PMI) to compute the matrix S. PMI between random variables representing the words wj and Wj is computed as",
        "v ' JJ P(Wi = l)P(Wj = 1) Thus, for GLSA, S (wj, Wj ) = PMI (wj, Wj ).",
        "Co-occurrence Proximity An advantage of PMI is the notion of proximity.",
        "The co-occurrence statistics for PMI are typically computed using a sliding window.",
        "Thus, PMI will be large only for words that co-occur within a small context of fixed size.",
        "Semantic Association vs. Synonymy Although GLSA was successfully applied to synonymy induction (Matveeva et al., 2005), we would like to point out that the GLSA discovers semantic association in a broad sense.",
        "Table 1 shows a few words from the TDT2 corpus and their nearest neighbors in the GLSA space.",
        "We can see that for \"witness\", \"finance\" and \"broadcast\" words are grouped into corresponding semantic classes.",
        "The nearest neighbors for \"hearing\" and \"stay\" represent their different senses.",
        "Interestingly, even for the abstract noun \"surprise\" the nearest neighbors are meaningful.",
        "We have two sets of the vocabulary terms: a set of nouns, N, and the other words, T. We compute tf-idf document vectors indexed with the words in T :",
        "where aj(wt) = tf(wt, dj) * idf (wt).",
        "We also compute a k-dimensional representation with latent concepts cj as a weighted linear combination of GLSA term vectors wt:",
        "We concatenate these two representations to generate a hybrid indexing of documents:",
        "In our experiments, we compute document and sentence representation using three indexing schemes: the tf-idfbaseline, the GLSA representation and the hybrid indexing.",
        "The GLSA indexing computes term vectors for all vocabulary words; document and sentence vectors are generated as linear combinations of term vectors, as shown above.",
        "One can define document similarity at different levels of semantic content.",
        "Documents can be similar because they discuss the same people or events and because they discuss related subjects and contain semantically related words.",
        "Hybrid Indexing allows us to combine both definitions of similarity.",
        "Each representation supports a different similarity measure.",
        "tf-idf uses term-matching, the GLSA representation uses semantic association in the latent semantic space computed for all words, and hybrid indexing uses a combination of both: term-matching for named entities and content words other than nouns combined with semantic association for nouns.",

        "We used both variants in our experiments.",
        "When using blocks, we computed blocks of a fixed size (typically 20 words) sliding over the documents in a fixed step size (10 or 5 words).",
        "The algorithm predicts a story boundary when the semantic cohesion between two consecutive units drops.",
        "Blocks can cross story boundaries, thus many predicted boundaries will be displaced with respect to the actual boundary.",
        "Averaged similarity In our preliminary experiments we used the largest difference in score to predict story boundary, following the TextTiling approach (Hearst, 1994).",
        "We found, however, that in our document collection the word overlap between sentences was often not large and pairwise similarity could drop to zero even for sentences within the same story, as will be illustrated below.",
        "We could not obtain satisfactory results with this approach.",
        "Therefore, we used the average similarity by using a history of fixed size n. The semantic cohesion score was computed for the position between two text units, tj and tj as follows:",
        "Our approach predicts story boundaries at the minima of the semantic cohesion score.",
        "Approximating Lexical Chains One of the motivations for our cohesion score is that it approximates lexical chains, as for example in (Galley et al., 2003).",
