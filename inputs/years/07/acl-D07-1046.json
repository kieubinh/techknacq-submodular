        "Morphological analysis and disambiguation are crucial preprocessing steps for a variety ofnatural language processing applications, from search and information extraction to machine translation.",
        "For languages with complex morphology these are nontrivial processes.",
        "This paper presents a morphological disambiguation module for Hebrew which uses a sophisticated combination of classifiers to rank the analyses produced by a morphological analyzer.",
        "This work has a twofold contribution: first, our system achieves over 91% accuracy on the full disambiguation task, reducing the error rate of the previous state of the art by 25%.",
        "More generally, we explore several ways for combining the predictions of simple classifiers under constraints; the insight gained from these experiments will be useful for other applications of machine learning to complex (morphological and other) problems.",
        "In the remainder of this section we discuss the complexity of Hebrew morphology, the challenge of morphological disambiguation and related work.",
        "We describe our methodology in Section 2: we use basic, naive classifiers (Section 3) to predict some components of the analysis, and then combine them in several ways (Section 4) to predict a consistent result.",
        "We analyze the errors of the system in Section 5 and conclude with suggestions for future work.",
        "Hebrew morphology is rich and complex.",
        "The major word formation machinery is root-and-pattern, and inflectional morphology is highly productive and consists of prefixes, suffixes and circumfixes.",
        "Nouns, adjectives and numerals inflect for number (singular, plural and, in rare cases, also dual) and gender (masculine or feminine).",
        "In addition, all these three types of nominals have two phonologically and morphologically distinct forms, known as the absolute and construct states.",
        "In the standard orthography approximately half of the nominals appear to have identical forms in both states, a fact which substantially increases the ambiguity.",
        "In addition, nominals take possessive pronominal suffixes which inflect for number, gender and person.",
        "Verbs inflect for number, gender and person (first, second and third) and also for a combination of tense and aspect/mood, referred to simply as 'tense' below.",
        "Verbs can also take pronominal suffixes, which are interpreted as direct objects, and in some cases can also take nominative pronominal suffixes.",
        "A peculiarity of Hebrew verbs is that the participle form can be used as present tense, but also as a noun or an adjective.",
        "These matters are complicated further due to two sources: first, the standard Hebrew orthography leaves most of the vowels unspecified.",
        "On top of that, the script dictates that many particles, including four of the most frequent prepositions, the definite article, the coordinating conjunction and some subordinating conjunctions, all attach to the words which immediately follow them.",
        "When the definite article h is prefixed by one of the prepositions b, k or l, it is assimilated with the preposition and the resulting form becomes ambiguous as to whether or not it is definite.",
        "For example, bth can be read either as b+th \"in tea\" or as b+h+th \"in the tea\".",
        "Thus, the form $bth can be read as an inflected stem (the verb \"capture\", third person singular feminine past), as $+bth \"that+field\", $+b+th \"that+in+tea\", even as $+bt+h \"that her daughter\".",
        "An added complexity stems from the fact that there are two main standards for the Hebrew script: one in which vocalization diacritics, known as niqqud \"dots\", decorate the words, and another in which the dots are missing, and other characters represent some, but not all of the vowels.",
        "Most of the texts in Hebrew are of the latter kind; unfortunately, different authors use different conventions for the undotted script.",
        "Thus, the same word can be written in more than one way, sometimes even within the same document.",
        "This fact adds significantly to the degree of ambiguity.",
        "Our departure point in this work is HAMSAH (Yona and Wintner, 2007), a wide coverage, linguistically motivated morphological analyzer ofHe-brew, which was recently reimplemented in Java and made available from the Knowledge Center for Processing Hebrew (http://mila.cs.",
        "technion.ac.il/).",
        "The output that HAMSAH produces for the form $bth is illustrated in Table 1.",
        "In general, it includes the part of speech (POS) as well as sub-category, where applicable, along with several POS-dependent features such as number, gender, tense, nominal state, definitness, etc.",
        "Identifying the correct morphological analysis of a given word in a given context is an important and non-trivial task.",
        "Unlike POS tagging, the task does not involve assigning an analysis to words which the analyzer does not recognize.",
        "However, selecting an analysis immediately induces a POS tagging for the target word (by projecting the analysis on the POS coordinate).",
        "Our main contribution in this work is a system that solves this problem with high accuracy.",
        "Compared with POS tagging of English, morphological disambiguation of Hebrew is a much more complex endeavor due to the following factors:",
        "Segmentation A single token in Hebrew can actually be a sequence of more than one lexical item.",
        "For example, analysis 4 of Table 1 ($+b+h+th \"that+in+the+tea\") corresponds to the tag sequence IN+IN+DT+NN.",
        "Large tagset The number of different tags in a language such as Hebrew (where the POS, morphological features and prefix and suffix particles are considered) is huge.",
        "HAMSAH produces 22 different parts of speech, some with subcategories; 6 values for the number feature (including disjunctions of values), 4 for gender, 5 for person, 7 for tense and 3 for nominal state.",
        "Possessive pronominal suffixes can have 15 different values, and prefix particle sequences can theoretically have hundreds of different forms.",
        "While not all the combinations of these values are possible, we estimate the number of possible analyses to be in the thousands.",
        "Ambiguity Hebrew is highly ambiguous: HAM-SAH outputs on average approximately 2.64 analyses per word token.",
        "Oftentimes two or more alternative analyses share the same part of speech, and in some cases two or more analyses are completely identical, except for their lexeme (see analyses 7 and 8 in Table 1).",
        "Morphological disambiguation of Hebrew is hence closer to the problem of word sense disambiguation than to standard POS tagging.",
        "Anchors, which are often function words, are almost always morphologically ambiguous in Hebrew.",
        "These include most of the high-frequency forms.",
        "Many of the function words which help boost the performance of English POS tagging are actually prefix particles which add to the ambiguity in Hebrew.",
        "Word order in Hebrew is freer than in English.",
        "1.3 Related work",
        "The idea of using short context for morphological disambiguation dates back to Choueka and Lusig-nan (1985).",
        "Levinger et al.",
        "(1995) were the first to apply it to Hebrew, but their work was hampered by the lack of annotated corpora for training and evaluation.",
        "The first work which uses stochastic contextual information for morphological disambiguation in Hebrew is Segal (1999): texts are analyzed using the morphological analyzer of Segal (1997); then, each word in a text is assigned its most likely analysis, defined by probabilities computed from a small tagged corpus.",
        "In the next phase the system corrects its own decisions by using short context (one word to the left and one to the right of the target word).",
        "The corrections are also automatically learned from the tagged corpus (using transformation-based learning).",
        "In the last phase, the analysis is corrected by the results of a syntactic analysis of the sentence.",
        "The reported results are excellent: 96.2% accuracy.",
        "More reliable tests, however, reveal accuracy of 85.5% only (Lember-ski, 2003, page 85).",
        "Furthermore, the performance of the program is unacceptable (the reported running time on \"two papers\" is thirty minutes).",
        "Bar-Haim et al.",
        "(2005) use Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to implement a segmenter and a tagger for Hebrew.",
        "The main innovation of this work is that it models word-segments (morphemes: prefixes, stem and suffixes), rather than full words.",
        "The accuracy of this system is 90.51% for POS tagging (a tagset of 21 POS tags is used) and 96.74% for segmentation (which is defined as identifying all prefixes, including a possibly assimilated definite article).",
        "As noted above, POS tagging does not amount to full morphological disambiguation.",
        "Recently, Adler and Elhadad (2006) presented an unsupervised, HMM-based model for Hebrew morphological disambiguation, using a morphological analyzer as the only resource.",
        "A morpheme-based model learns both segmentation and tagging in parallel from a large (6M words) un-annotated corpus.",
        "Reported results are 92.32% for POS tagging and 88.5% for full morphological disambiguation.",
        "We refer to this result as the state of the art and use the same data for evaluation.",
        "A supervised approach to morphological disambiguation of Arabic is given by Habash and Rambow (2005), who use two corpora of 120K words each to train several classifiers.",
        "Each morphological feature is predicted separately and then combined into a full disambiguation result.",
        "The accuracy of the dis-ambiguator is 94.8%-96.2% (depending on the test corpus).",
        "Note, however, the high baseline of each classifier (96.6%-99.9%, depending on the classifier) and the full disambiguation task (87.3%-92.1%, depending on the corpus).",
        "We use a very similar approach below, but we experiment with more sophisticated methods for combining simple classifiers to induce a coherent prediction."

        "These predictions may be contradicting (for example, the POS classifier can predict 'noun ' while the tense classifier predicts 'past ' ), and we use the constraints imposed by the morphological analyzer to enforce a consistent analysis.",

        "The scores assigned by the simple classifiers (except segmentation, for which we use the baseline) to each analysis are accumulated, and the score of the complete analysis is their sum (experiments with different weights to the various classifiers proved futile).",

        "As can be seen, the hierarchical combination performs worse than the naïve one.",
