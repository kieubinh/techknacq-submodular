        "Automatic summarization was first studied almost 50 years ago by Luhn (Luhn, 1958) and has continued to be a steady subject of research.",
        "Automatic summarization refers to the creation of a shortened version of a document or cluster of documents by a machine, see (Mani, 2001) for details.",
        "The summary can be an abstraction or extraction.",
        "In an abstract summary, content from the original document may be paraphrased or generated, whereas in an extract summary, the content is preserved in its original form, i.e., sentences.",
        "Both summary types can involve sentence compression, but abstracts tend to be more condensed.",
        "In this paper, we focus on producing fully automated single-document extract summaries of newswire articles.",
        "To create an extract, most automatic systems use linguistic and/or statistical methods to identify key words, phrases, and concepts in a sentence or across single or multiple documents.",
        "Each sentence is then assigned a score indicating the strength of presence of key words, phrases, and so on.",
        "Sentence scoring methods utilize both purely statistical and purely semantic features, for example as in (Vanderwende et al., 2006; Nenkova et al., 2006; Yih et al., 2007).",
        "Recently, machine learning techniques have been successfully applied to summarization.",
        "The methods include binary classifiers (Kupiec et al., 1995), Markov models (Conroy et al., 2004), Bayesian methods (Daumé III and Marcu, 2005; Aone et al., 1998), and heuristic methods to determine feature weights (Schiffman, 2002; Lin and Hovy, 2002).",
        "Graph-based methods have also been employed (Erkan and Radev, 2004a; Erkan and Radev, 2004b; cea and Radev, 2006).",
        "In 2001-02, the Document Understanding Conference (DUC, 2001), issued the task of creating a 100-word summary of a single news article.",
        "The best performing systems (Hirao et al., 2002; Lal and Ruger, 2002) used various learning and semantic-based methods, although no system could outperform the baseline with statistical significance (Nenkova, 2005).",
        "After 2002, the single-document summarization task was dropped.",
        "In recent years, there has been a decline in studies on automatic single-document summarization, in part because the DUC task was dropped, and in part because the task of single-document extracts may be counterintuitively more difficult than multidocument summarization (Nenkova, 2005).",
        "However, with the ever-growing internet and increased information access, we believe single-document summarization is essential to improve quick access to large quantities of information.",
        "Recently, CNN.com (CNN.com, 2007a) added \"Story Highlights\" to many news articles on its site to allow readers to quickly gather information on stories.",
        "These highlights give a brief overview of the article and appear as 3 – 4 related sentences in the form of bullet points rather than a summary paragraph, making them even easier to quickly scan.",
        "Our work is motivated by both the addition of highlights to an extremely visible and reputable online news source, as well as the inability of past single-document summarization systems to outperform the extremely strong baseline of choosing the first n sentences of a newswire article as the summary (Nenkova, 2005).",
        "Although some recent systems indicate an improvement over the baseline (Mi-halcea, 2005; Mihalcea and Tarau, 2005), statistical significance has not been shown.",
        "We show that by using a neural network ranking algorithm and third-party datasets to enhance sentence features, our system, NetSum, can outperform the baseline with statistical significance.",
        "Our paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 describes our two studies: summarization and highlight extraction.",
        "We describe our dataset in detail in Section 3.",
        "Our ranking system and feature vectors are outlined in Section 4.",
        "We present our evaluation measure in Section 5.",

        "First, can we extract three sentences that best \"match\" the highlights as a whole?",
        "In this task, we concatenate the three sentences produced by our system into a single summary or block, and similarly concatenate the three highlight sentences into a single summary or block.",
        "We then compare our system's block against the highlight block.",
        "Second, can we extract three sentences that best \"match\" the three highlights, such that ordering is preserved?",
        "In this task, we produce three sentences, where the first sentence is compared against the first highlight, the second sentence is compared against the second highlight, and the third sentence is compared against the third highlight.",
        "Credit is not given for producing three sentences that match the highlights, but are out of order.",
        "The second task considers ordering and compares sentences on an individual level, whereas the first task considers the three chosen sentences as a summary or block and disregards sentence order.",

        "Our goal is to extract three sentences from a single news document that best match various characteristics of the three document highlights.",

        "Then a set of features is extracted from each sentence in the train and test sets, and the train set is used to train the system.",
        "The system is then evaluated on the test set.",
        "The system learns from the train set the distribution of features for the best sentences and outputs a ranked list of sentences for each document.",
        "In this paper, we rank sentences using a neural network algorithm called RankNet (Burges et al., 2005).",
        "From the labels and features for each sentence, we train a model that, when run on a test set of sentences, can infer the proper ranking of sentences in a document based on information gathered during training about sentence characteristics.",
        "To accomplish the ranking, we use RankNet (Burges et al., 2005), a ranking algorithm based on neural networks.",
        "RankNet is a pair-based neural network algorithm used to rank a set of inputs, in this case, the set of sentences in a given document.",
        "The system is trained on pairs of sentences (Si, Sj), such that Si should be ranked higher or equal to Sj.",
        "Pairs are generated between sentences in a single document, not across documents.",
        "Each pair is determined from the input labels.",
        "Since our sentences are labeled using ROUGE (see Section 4.3), if the ROUGE score of Si is greater than the ROUGE score of Sj, then (Si,Sj) is one input pair.",
        "The cost function for RankNet is the probabilistic cross-entropy cost function.",
        "Training is performed using a modified version of the back propagation algorithm for two layer nets (Le Cun et al., 1998), which is based on optimizing the cost function by gradient descent.",
        "A similar method of training on sentence pairs in the context of multi-document summarization was recently shown in (Toutanova et al., 2007).",
        "Our system, NetSum, is a two-layer neural net trained using RankNet.",
        "To speed up the performance of RankNet, we implement RankNet in the framework of LambdaRank (Burges et al., 2006).",

        "The pairs are generated using the maximum ROUGE scores l1 (see Section 4.3).",
        "The other three rankers are trained to identify the sentence in the document that best matches highlight n. We train one ranker, NetSum(n), for each highlight n, for n = 1, 2, 3, resulting in three rankers.",
        "NetSum(n) is trained using pairs generated from the l1n ROUGE scores between sentence Si and highlight Hn (see Section 4.3).",
        "In this section, we describe how to determine which sentence in the document best matches a given highlight.",
        "Choosing three sentences most similar to the three highlights is very challenging since the highlights include content that has been gathered across sentences and even paragraphs, and furthermore include vocabulary that may not be present in the text.",
        "Jing showed, for 300 news articles, that 19% of human-generated summary sentences contain no matching article sentence (Jing, 2002).",
        "In addition, only 42% of the summary sentences match the content of a single article sentence, where there are still semantic and syntactic transformations between the summary sentence and article sentence..",
        "Since each highlight is human generated and does not exactly match any one sentence in the document, we must develop a method to identify how closely related a highlight is to a sentence.",
        "We use the ROUGE (Lin, 2004b) measure to score the similarity between an article sentence and a highlight sentence.",
        "We anticipate low ROUGE scores for both the baseline and NetSum due to the difficulty of finding a single sentence to match a highlight.",
        "Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation (Lin, 2004b), known as ROUGE, measures the quality of a model-generated summary or sentence by comparing it to a \"gold-standard\", typically human-generated, summary or sentence.",
        "It has been shown that ROUGE is very effective for measuring both single-document summaries and single-document headlines (Lin, 2004a).",
        "ROUGE-N is a N-gram recall between a modelgenerated summary and a reference summary.",
        "We use ROUGE-N, for N = 1, for labeling and evaluation of our model-generated highlights.",
        "ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 have been shown to be statistically similar to human evaluations and can be used with a single reference summary (Lin, 2004a).",
        "We have only one reference summary, the set of human-generated highlights, per document.",

        "We label each sentence Si by its ROUGE-1 score.",
        "For the first problem of matching the highlights as a block, we label each Si by li, the maximum ROUGE-1 score between Si and each highlight Hn, for n = 1, 2, 3, given by l1 = maxn(R(Si, Hn)).",
        "For the second problem of matching three sentences to the three highlights individually, we label each sentence Si by l1>n, the ROUGE-1 score between Si and Hn, given by l1n = R(Si; Hn).",

        "This feature is used only for NetSum(b) and NetSum(1).",
        "We include sentence position since we found in empirical studies that the sentence to best match highlight H1 is on average 10% down the article, the sentence to best match H2 is on average 20% down the article, and the sentence to best match H3 is 31% down the article.",
        "We calculate the position of Si in document D as where i = {1,..., 1} is the sentence number and I is the number of sentences in D.",

        "We calculate the SumBasic score of Si in document D as where p(w) is the probability of word w and |Si| is the number of words in sentence Si.",
        "We calculate p(w) as p(w) = Co^(w); where Count(w) is the number of times word w appears in document D and |D| is the number of words in document D. Note that the score ofa sentence is the average probability of a word in the sentence.",
