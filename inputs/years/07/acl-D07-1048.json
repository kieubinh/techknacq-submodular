        "\"Contact center\" is a general term for customer service centers, help desks, and information phone lines.",
        "Many companies operate contact centers to sell their products, handle customer issues, and address product-related and services-related issues.",
        "In contact centers, analysts try to get insights for improving business processes from stored customer contact data.",
        "Gigabytes of customer contact records are produced every day in the form of audio recordings of speech, transcripts, call summaries, email, etc.",
        "Though analysis by experts results in insights that are very deep and useful, such analysis usually covers only a very small (1-2%) fraction of the total call volume and yet requires significant workload.",
        "The demands for extracting trends and knowledge from the whole text data collection by using text mining technology, therefore, are increasing rapidly.",
        "In order to acquire valuable knowledge through text mining, it is generally critical to identify important expressions to be monitored and compared within the textual data.",
        "For example, given a large collection of contact records at the contact center of a manufacturer, the analysis of expressions for products and expressions for problems often leads to business value by identifying specific problems in a specific product.",
        "If 30% of the contact records with expressions for a specific product such as \"ABC\" contain expressions about a specific trouble such as \"cracked\", while the expressions about the same trouble appear in only 5% of the contact records for similar products, then it should be a clue that the product \"ABC\" may actually have a crack-related problem.",
        "An effective way to facilitate this type of analysis is to register important expressions in a lexicon such as \"ABC\" and \"cracked\" as associated respectively with their categories such as \"product\" and \"problem\" so that the behavior of terms in the same category can be compared easily.",
        "It is actually one of the most important steps of text mining to identify such relevant expressions and their categories that can potentially lead to some valuable insights.",
        "A failure in this step often leads to a failure in the text mining.",
        "Also, it has been considered an artistic task that requires highly experienced consultants to define such categories, which are often described as the viewpoint for doing the analysis, and their corresponding expressions through trial and error.",
        "In this paper, we propose a method to identify important segments of textual data for analysis from full transcripts of conversations.",
        "Compared to the written summary of a conversation, a transcription of an entire conversation tends to be quite lengthy and contains various forms of redundancy.",
        "Many of the terms appearing in the conversation are not relevant for specific analysis.",
        "For example, the terms for greeting such as \"Hello\" and \"Welcome to (Company A)\" are unlikely to be associated with specific business results such as purchased-or-not and satisfied-or-not, especially because the conversation is transcribed without preserving the nonverbal moods such as tone of voice, emotion etc.",
        "Thus it is crucial to identify key segments and notable expressions within conversations for analysis to acquire valuable insights.",
        "We exploit the fact that business conversations follow set patterns such as an opening followed by a request and the confirmation of details followed by a closing, etc.",
        "By taking advantage of this feature of business conversations, we have developed a method to identify key segments and the notable expressions within conversations that tend to discriminate between the business results.",
        "Such key segments, the trigger segments, and the notable expressions associated with certain business results lead us to easily understand appropriate viewpoints for analysis.",
        "Application of our method for analyzing nearly one thousand conversations from a rental car reservation office enabled us to acquire novel insights for improving agent productivity and resulted in an actual increase in revenues.",
        "Organization of the Paper: We start by describing the properties of the conversation data used in this paper.",

        "We consider business-oriented conversation data collected at contact centers handling inbound telephone sales and reservations.",
        "Such business oriented conversations have the following properties.",
        "• Each conversation is a one-to-one interaction between a customer and an agent.",
        "• For many contact center processes the conversation flow is well defined in advance.",
        "• There are a fixed number of outcomes and each conversation has one of these outcomes.",
        "For example, in car rentals, the following conversation flow is predefined for the agent.",
        "In practice most calls to a car rental center follow this call flow.",
        "• Opening - contains greeting, brand name, name of agent",
        "• Pick-up and return details - agent asks location, dates and times of pick up and return, etc.",
        "• Offering car and rate - agent offers a car specifying rate and mentions applicable special offers.",
        "• Personal details - agent asks for customer's information such as name, address, etc.",
        "• Confirm specifications - agent recaps reservation information such as name, location, etc.",
        "• Mandatory enquiries - agent verifies clean driving record, valid license, etc.",
        "• Closing - agent gives confirmation number and thanks the customer for calling.",
        "In these conversations the participants speak in turns and the segments can be clearly identified.",
        "Figure 1 shows part of a transcribed call.",
        "Each call has a specific outcome.",
        "For example, each car rental transaction has one of two call types, reservation or unbooked, as an outcome.",
        "Because the call process is pre-defined, the conversations look similar in spite of having different results.",
        "In such a situation, finding the differences in the conversations that have effects on the outcomes is very important, but it is very expensive and difficult to find such unknown differences by human analysis.",
        "We show that it is possible to define proper viewpoints and corresponding expressions leading to insights on how to change the outcomes of the calls.",

        "CUSTOMER: Aah ok I need it from SFO.",
        "AGENT: For what date and time.",
        "AGENT: Wonderful so let me see ok mam so we have a 12 or 15 passenger van avilable on this location on those dates and for that your estimated total for those three dates just 300.58$ this is with Taxes with surcharges and with free unlimited free milleage.",
        "AGENT : alright mam let me recap the dates you want to pick it up from SFO on 3rd August and drop it off on august 6th in LA alright",

        "In this section, we describe a method for automatically identifying valuable segments and concepts from the data for the user-specified difference analysis.",
        "First, we present a model to represent the conversational data.",
        "After that we introduce a method to detect the segments where the useful concepts for the analysis appear.",
        "Finally, we select useful expressions in each detected trigger segment.",
        "Each conversational data record in the collection D is defined as di.",
        "Each di can be seen as a sequence of conversational turns in the conversational data, and then di can be divided as where di is the k-th turn in di and Mi is the total number of turns in di.",
        "The + operator in the above equation can be seen as an equivalent of the string concatenation operator.",
        "We define as the portion of di from the beginning to turn j.",
        "Using the same notation, collection of d~mk constitutes the Chronologically Cumulative Data up to turn mk (Dk).",
        "Dk is represented as",
        "Figure 2 shows an image of the data model.",
        "We set some mk and prepare the chronologically cumulative data set as shown in Figure 3.",
        "We represent binary mutually exclusive business outcomes such as success and failure resulting from the conversations as \"A\" and \"not A\".",
        "di™.",
        "Trigger segments can be viewed as portions of the data which have important features which distinguish data of class \"A\" from data of class \"not A\".",
        "To detect such segments, we divide each chronologically cumulative data set Dk into two data sets, training data Dka%mng and test data Dtjk:st.",
        "Starting from D1, for each Dk we trained a classifier",
        "training",
        "and evaluated it on D accuracy, the fraction of correctly classified documents, as a metric of performance (Yang and Liu, 1999), we denote the evaluation result of the categorization as acc(categorizer(Dk)) for each Dkand plot it along with its turn.",
        "Figure 4 shows the effect of gradually increasing the training data for the classification.",
        "The distribution of expressions",
        "acc(categorizer(Di)) rigger",
        "in a business-oriented conversation will change almost synchronously because the call flow is predefined.",
        "Therefore acc(categorizer(Dk)) will increase if features that contribute to the categorization appear in Dk.",
        "In contrast, acc(categorizer(Dk)) will decrease if no features that contribute to the categorization are in Dk.",
        "Therefore, from the transitions of acc(categorizer(Dk)), we can identify the segments with increases as triggers where the features that have an effect on the outcome appear.",
        "We denote a trigger segment as seg(start position, end position).",
        "Because the total numbers of turns can be different, we do not detect the last section as a trigger.",
        "In Figure 4, seg(m\\,m2) and seg(m4,m5) are triggers.",
        "It is important to note that using the cumulative data is key to the detection of trigger segments.",
        "Using non-cumulative segment data would give us the categorization accuracy for the features within that segment but would not tell us whether the features of this segment are improving the accuracy or decreasing it.",
        "It is this gradient information between segments that is key to identifying trigger segments.",
        "Many approaches have been proposed for document classiication (Yang and Liu, 1999).",
        "In this research, however, we are not interested in the clas-siication accuracy itself but in the increase and decrease of the accuracy within particular segments.",
        "For example, the greeting, or the particular method of payment may not affect the outcome, but the mention of a speciic feature of the product may have an effect on the outcome.",
        "Therefore in our research we are interested in identifying the particular portion of the call where this product feature is mentioned, along with its mention, which has an effect on the outcome of the call.",
        "In our experiments we used the SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier (Joachims, 1998), but almost any classifier should work because our approach does not depend on the classiication method.",
        "In this section, we describe our method to extract effective expressions from the detected trigger segments.",
        "The effective expressions in Dk are those which are representative in the selected documents and appear for the irst time in the trigger segments seg(mi, mj).",
        "Numerous methods to select features exist (Hisamitsu and Niwa, 2002) (Yang and Ped-ersen, 1997).",
        "We use the % statistic for each expression in Dk as a representative metric.",
        "For the two-by-two contingency table of a expression w and a class \"A\" shown in Table 1, the % statistic is calculated as where N is the number of documents.",
        "This statistic can be compared to the % distribution with one degree of freedom to judge representativeness.",
        "We also want to extract the expressions that have not had an effect on the outcome before Dk.",
        "To detect the new expressions in Dk, we define the metric where w(Dk) is the frequency of expression w in the chronologically cumulative data Dk, max(a, b) selects the larger value in the arguments, mk is the number of turns in Dk, w(DkA) is the frequency of w in Dk with the outcome ofthe corresponding data being \"A\", and sign( ) is the signum function.",
        "When w in class \"A\" appears in Dk much more frequently than Dk-i compared with the ratio of their turns, this metric will be more than 1.",
        "We detect signii-cant expressions by considering the combined score X(w) • new(w).",
        "Using this combined score, we can ilter out the representative expressions that have already appeared before Dk and distinguish signii-cant expressions that irst appear in Dk for each class \"A\" and \"not A\".",

        "We have identiied important segments of the conversations by seeing changes in the accuracy ofa categorizer designed to segregate different business outcomes.",
        "We have also been able to extract effective expressions from these trigger segments to deine various viewpoints.",
        "Hence, viewpoint selection is now based on the trigger segments and effective expressions identiied automatically based on speci-ied business outcomes.",

        "There has been a lot of work on speciic tools for analyzing the conversational data collected at contact centers.",
        "These include call type classiication for the purpose of categorizing calls (Tang et al., 2003) (Zweig et al., 2006), call routing (Kuo and Lee, 2003) (Haffner et al., 2003), obtaining call log summaries (Douglas et al., 2005), agent assisting and monitoring (Mishne et al., 2005), and building of domain models (Roy and Subramaniam, 2006).",
        "Filtering problematic dialogs automatically from an automatic speech recognizer has also been studied (Hastie et al., 2002) (Walker et al., 2002).",
        "In contrast to these technologies, in this paper we consider the task of trying to ind insights from a collection of complete conversations.",
        "In (Nasukawa and Nagano, 2001), such an analysis was attempted for agent-entered call summaries of customer contacts by extracting phrases based on domain-expert-speciied viewpoints.",
        "In our work we have shown that even for conversational data, which is more complex, we could identify proper viewpoints and prepare expressions for each viewpoint.",
        "Call summaries by agents tend to mask the customers' intention at the start of the call.",
        "We get more valuable insights from the text mining analysis of conversational data.",
        "For such an analysis of conversational data, our proposed method has an important role.",
        "With our method, we find the important segments in the data for doing analyses.",
        "Also our analyses are closely linked to the desired outcomes.",
        "In trigger detection, we created a chronologically cumulative data set based on turns.",
        "We can also use the segment information such as the \"opening\" and \"enquiries\" described in Section 2.",
        "We prepared data with segment information manually assigned, made the chronologically cumulative data and applied our trigger detection method.",
        "Figure 6 shows the results of acc(categorizer(Dk)).",
        "The trend in",
        "Figure 6 is similar to that in Figure 5.",
        "From this result, it is observed that \"opening\" and \"offering\" segments are trigger segments.",
        "Usually, segmentation is not done in advance and to assign such information automatically we need data with labeled segmentation information.",
        "The results show that even in the absence of labeled data our trigger detection method identiies the trigger segments.",
        "In the experiments in Section 4, we set turns for each chronologically cumulative data by taking into account the predefined call flow.",
        "In Figure 5 we observe that the accuracy of the categorizer is decreasing even when using increasing parts of the call.",
        "Even the accuracy using the complete call is less than using only the irst turn.",
        "This indicates that the irst turn is very informative, but it also indicates that the features are not being used judiciously.",
        "In a conventional classification task, the number offeatures are sometimes restricted when constructing a categorizer.",
        "It is known that selecting only significant features improves the classification accuracy (Yang and Pedersen, 1997).",
        "We used Information Gain for selecting features from the document collection.",
        "This method selects the most discriminative features between two classes.",
        "As expected the classification accuracy improved significantly as we reduced the total number of features from over 2,000 to the range of 100 to 300.",
        "Figure 7 shows the changes in accuracy.",
        "In the pro-",
        "Figure 7: Result of acc(categorizer(Dk)) with top 100 to 300 features selected using information gain posed method, we detect trigger segments using the increases and decreases of the classification accuracy.",
        "By selecting features, the noisy features are not added in the segments.",
        "Decreasing portions, therefore are not observed.",
        "In this situation, as a trigger segment, we can detect the portion where the gradient of the accuracy curve increases.",
        "Also using feature selection, we find that the classification accuracy is highest when using the entire document, which is expected.",
        "However, we notice that the trigger segments obtained with and without feature selection are almost the same.",
        "In the experiment, we use manually transcribed data.",
        "As future work we would like to use the noisy output of an automatic speech recognition system to obtain viewpoints and expressions."

        "In this paper, we have proposed methods for identifying appropriate segments and expressions automatically from the data for user specified difference analysis.",
        "We detected the trigger segments using the property that a business-oriented conversation follows a predefined flow.",
        "After that, we identified the appropriate expressions from each trigger segment.",
        "It was found that in a long business-priented conversation there are important segments affecting the outcomes that can not been easily detected by just looking through the conversation, but such segments can be detected by monitoring the changes of the categorization accuracy.",
        "For the trigger segment detection, we do not use semantic segment information but only the positional segment information based on the conversational turns.",
        "Because our method does not rely on the semantic information in the data, therefore our method can be seen as robust.",
        "Through experiments with real conversational data, using identified segments and expressions we were able to define appropriate viewpoints and concepts leading to insights for improving the car rental business process.",
