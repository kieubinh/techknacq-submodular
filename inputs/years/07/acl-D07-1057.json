        "In the literature, much of the work on corefer-ence resolution is for English text (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002b; Yang et al., 2003; McCal-lum and Wellner, 2005).",

        "A prominent phenomenon in Chinese coreference resolution is the prevalence of zero pronouns.",
        "A zero pronoun (ZP) is a gap in a sentence which refers to an entity that supplies the necessary information for interpreting the gap.",
        "An anaphoric zero pronoun (AZP) is a zero pronoun that corefers to one or more overt noun phrases present in the preceding text.",
        "Zero pronouns occur much more frequently in Chinese compared to English, and pose a unique challenge in coreference resolution for Chinese.",
        "For example, Kim (2000) conducted a study to compare the use of overt subjects in English, Chinese, and other languages.",
        "He found that the use of overt subjects in English is over 96%, while this percentage is only 64% for Chinese, indicating that zero pronouns (lack of overt subjects) are much more prevalent in Chinese.",
        "Chinese zero pronouns have been studied in linguistics research (Li and Thompson, 1979; Li, 2004), but only a small body of prior work in computational linguistics deals with Chinese zero pronoun identification and resolution (Yeh and Chen, 2004; Converse, 2006).",
        "To our knowledge, all previous research on zero pronoun identification and resolution in Chinese uses hand-engineered rules or heuristics, and our present work is the first to perform both identification and resolution of Chinese anaphoric zero pronouns using a machine learning approach.",

        "Just like a coreferential noun phrase, a coreferen-tial zero pronoun can also corefer to a noun phrase in the preceding or following text, called anaphoric or cataphoric, respectively.",
        "Most coreferential zero pronouns in Chinese are anaphoric.",
        "In the corpus used in our evaluation, 98% of the coreferential zero pronouns have antecedents.",
        "Hence, for simplicity, we only consider anaphoric zero pronouns (AZP) in this work.",
        "That is, we only attempt to resolve a coreferential zero pronoun to noun phrases preceding it.",

        "Resolving an anaphoric zero pronoun to its correct antecedent in Chinese is a difficult task.",
        "Although gender and number information is available for an overt pronoun and has proven to be useful in pronoun resolution in prior research, a zero pronoun in Chinese, unlike an overt pronoun, provides no such gender or number information.",
        "At the same time, identifying zero pronouns in Chinese is also a difficult task.",
        "There are only a few overt pronouns in English, Chinese, and many other languages, and state-of-the-art part-of-speech taggers can successfully recognize most of these overt pronouns.",
        "However, zero pronouns in Chinese, which are not explicitly marked in a text, are hard to be identified.",
        "Furthermore, even if a gap is a zero pronoun, it may not be coreferential.",
        "All these difficulties make the identification and resolution of anaphoric zero pronouns in Chinese a challenging task.",
        "We use an annotated third-person pronoun and zero pronoun coreference corpus from Converse (2006).",
        "The corpus contains 205 texts from CTB 3.0, with annotations done directly on the parse trees.",
        "In the corpus, coreferential zero pronouns, third-person pronouns, and noun phrases are annotated as coref-erence chains.",

        "For example, in the following sentence, refers to an event in the preceding text, with no corresponding antecedent noun phrase.",
