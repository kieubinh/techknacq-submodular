        "Data-Oriented Parsing (DOP) is a framework for statistical parsing and language modeling originally proposed by Scha (1990).",
        "Some of its innovations, although radical at the time, are now widely accepted: the use of fragments from the trees in an annotated corpus as the symbolic grammar (now known as \"treebank grammars\", Charniak, 1996) and inclusion of all statistical dependencies between nodes in the trees for disambiguation (the \"all-subtrees approach\", Collins & Duffy, 2002).",
        "The best known instantiations of the DOPframework are due to Bod (1998; 2001; 2003), using the Probabilistic Tree Substitution Grammar (PTSG) formalism.",
        "Bod has advocated a maximalist approach to DOP, inducing grammars that contain all subtrees of all parse trees in the treebank, and using them to parse unknown sentences where all of these subtrees can potentially contribute to the most probable parse.",
        "Although Bod's empirical results have been excellent, his maximalism poses important computational challenges that, although not necessarily unsolvable, threaten both the scalability to larger treebanks and the cognitive plausibility of the models.",
        "In this paper I explore a different approach to DOP, that I will call \"Parsimonious Data-Oriented Parsing\" (P-DOP).",
        "This approach remains true to Scha's original program, by allowing, in principle, all possible subtrees of trees in the treebank to be the productive elements.",
        "But unlike Bod's approach, P-DOP aims at finding a succinct subset of such elementary trees, chosen such that it can still accurately describe observed distributions over phrase-structure trees.",
        "I will demonstrate that P-DOP leads to computationally more tracktable parsers, as well as linguistically more informative grammars.",
        "Moreover, as P-DOP is formulated as an enrichment of the treebank Probabilistic Context-free Grammar (PCFG), it allows for much easier comparison to alternative approaches to statistical parsing (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 1997; Johnson, 1998; Klein and",

        "Parsing with treebank PCFGs, in its simplest form, involves the following steps: (1) a treebank is created by extracting phrase-structure trees from an annotated corpus, and split in a train-and a testset; (2) a PCFG is read off from all productions in the trainset trees, with weights proportional to their frequency in the treebank (the \"relative frequency estimate\"); (3) a standard PCFG parser is used to find for each yield of the test-set trees the most probable parse; (4) these parses are compared to the test-set trees to count matching brackets, labels and trees.",
        "PCFGs incorporate a strong statistical independence assumption: that the expansion of a nonterminal node is only dependent on the node's label.",
        "All state-of-the-art wide-coverage parsers relax this assumption in some way, for instance by (i) changing the parser in step (3), such that the application of rules is conditioned on other steps in the derivation process (Collins, 1997; Charniak, 1997), or by (ii) enriching the nonterminal labels in step (1) with context-information (Johnson, 1998; Klein and Manning, 2003), along with suitable backtransforms in step (4).",
        "These two approaches often turn out to be equivalent, although for some conditionings it is not trivial to work out the equivalent enrichment and vice versa, especially when combined with smoothing.",
        "Interesting recent work has focused on the automatic induction of enrichments (Matzuzaki et al., 2005; Prescher, 2005), leading to extremely accurate parsers (Petrov et al., 2006).",
        "DOP relaxes the independence assumption by changing the class of probabilistic grammars induced in step (2).",
        "In DOP1 (Bod, 1998), a PTSG is induced, which consists, subject to some heuristic constraints, of all subtrees of the treebank trees with a weight proportional to their frequency.",
        "PTSGs allow multiple derivations to yield the same parse; in DOP1 the sum of their probabilities gives the probability of the parse.",
        "The relation between DOP and enrichment/conditioning models was clarified by Joshua Goodman, who devised an efficient PCFG transform of the DOP1 model (Goodman, 1996).",
        "The size of the PCFG resulting from this transform is linear in the number of nonterminals tokens in the corpus.",
        "Goodman's transform, in combination with a range of heuristics, allowed Bod (2003) to run the DOP model on the Penn Treebank WSJ benchmark and obtain some of the best results obtained with a generative model.",
        "The computational challenges for DOP are far from solved, however.",
        "The difference with style (ii) enrichment is that we derive many more rules from every original tree than the number of CFG-productions it contains.",
        "This is one reason why the relative frequency estimator for DOP is inconsistent (Johnson, 2002).",
        "But worse, perhaps, the size of the grammar remains gigantic, making it difficult for many in the field to replicate Bod's results.",
        "In this paper, we develop a parsimonious approach to DOP, that avoids many of the computational problems of the maximalist approach but tries to maintain its excellent empirical performance.",
        "Our approach starts, both conceptually and technically, with an analysis of where the PCFG independence assumption breaks down when modeling empirical distributions.",

        "In section 5 we discuss an algorithm for estimating PTSGs from a treebank, that is based on minimizing the differences between expected and observed subtree-frequencies.",

        "Only larger subtrees that receive relatively high scores should be used in parsing.",
        "Weights are proportional to subtree-frequencies in the DOP1 and related \"maximalist\" models.",
        "The differences between the frequency and score-distributions thus illustrate a very important difference between maximalist and parsimonious DOP.",
        "The characteristics of the score distribution allow P-DOP to throw away most of the subtrees without significantly affecting the distribution over complete parse trees that the grammar defines.",
        "This is the approach we take for evaluating parsing performance: we take as our baseline the treebank PCFG, and then add the n larger elementary trees with the highest scores from our induced PTSG."

        "For our parsing results we use BitPar, a fast and freely available general PCFG parser (Schmid, 2004) .",
        "In our first experiments we used the OVIS corpus, with semantic tags and punctuation removed, and all trees (train- and testset) binarized.",
        "As a baseline experiment, we read off the treebank PCFG as decribed in section 2.",
        "The recall, precision and complete match results are in table 1, labeled tb-pcfg.",
        "For comparison, we also show the results obtained with two versions of the DOP model, DOP1 (Bod, 1998) and DOP* (Zollmann and Sima'an, 2005) on the same treebank.",
        "We ran the pnp program as described above on the trainset, with parameters B = 1.0, 7 = 0.1 and d = 4.",
        "This run yielded a single PTSG that was used in 4 parsing runs.",
        "For these experiments, we added increasingly many of the depth> 1 elementary trees from the PTSG, with minimum scores of 7.0, 1.0, 0.5, and 0.075.",
        "The added elementary trees were first converted to PCFG rules, by labeling all internal nodes with a unique address label and reading off the CFG-productions.",
        "Each rule received a score equal to the score of the elementary tree it derived from.",
        "A copy of each rule, with the label removed, was also added with a negative score, BitPar automatically sums (and substracts) and normalizes the frequency information provided with each rule.",
        "Bit-Par was then run on the testset sentences, with the option to output the n best parses with n = 10 by default.",
        "These parses were then read in in a postprocessing program, which removes address labels, sums probabilities of equivalent parses and outputs the most probable parse for each sentence (this is the same approximation of MPP, albeit with smaller n, as used in most of Bod's DOP results).",
        "The results of these experiments are also in table 1, labeled pnpN, where N is the number of elementary trees added.",
        "Table 1: Results on the Dutch OVIS tree bank, with semantic tags and punctuation removed.",
        "Reported are evalb scores on a random testset of 1000 sentences (a second testset of 1000 sentences is kept for later evaluations).",
        "The trainset for both the treebank grammar and the pnp program consists of the remaining 8049 trees.",
        "Coverage in all cases in 989 sentences out of 1000.",
        "Results in brackets are from Zollman & Sima'an, 2005, using a different train-test set split.",
        "As these experiments show, adding larger elementary trees from the induced PTSG, in order of their assigned scores, monotonously increases the parse accuracy of the treebank PCFG.",
        "Although the final grammar is at least 5 times larger than the original treebank PCFG, and the parser therefore slower, the grammar is orders of magnitude smaller than the corresponding maximalist DOP models and shows comparable parse accuracy.",
        "For a second set of parsing experiments, we used the WSJ portion of the Penn Tree Bank (Marcus et al., 1993) and Helmut Schmid's enrichment program tmod (Schmid, 2006).",
        "Schmid's program enriches nonterminal labels in the treebank, using features inspired by (Klein and Manning, 2003).",
        "After enrichment, Schmid obtained excellent parsing scores with the treebank PCFG.",
        "In table 2, as model tb-pcfg, we give our baseline results.",
        "These are slightly lower than Schmid's, for two reasons: (i) our implementation ignores the upper/lower case distinction, and (ii) we do not use Schmid's word class automaton for unknown words (the only smoothing used is the built-in feature of the BitPar parser, which extracts an open-class-tag file from the lexicon file).",
        "Because our interest here is in the principles of enrichment we have not attempted to adapt these techniques for our implementation.",
        "As before, we ran the pnp program on the trainset, the enriched sections 2-21 of the WSJ.",
        "For computational reasons, pnp is only run on trees with a yield of length (including punctuation) < 20.",
        "This run, which took several days on a machine with 1.5Gb RAM, again produced a very large PTSG, from which we extracted the 1000 and 10000 depth >1 elementary trees with the highest scores for parsing experiments.",
        "Parsing and postprocessing is performed as before, with the MPP approximated from the best n = 20 parses.",
        "Results from these experiments are shown in table 2, as models pnp1000 and pnp10000.",
        "With a small number of added trees, we see a small drop in the parsing performance, which we interpret as evidence that our additions somewhat disturb the nicely tuned probability distribution of the treebank PCFG without providing many advantages, because the most frequent constructions have already been addressed in the manual PCFG enrichment.",
        "However, with 10000 added subtrees we see an increase in parse accuracy, providing evidence that pnp has learned potential enrichments that go beyond the manual enrichment.",
        "Table 2: Results on the WSJ section of the Penn Tree Bank, where nonterminals are enriched with features using Helmut Schmid's tmod program (Schmid, 2006).",
        "Reported are evalb scores (ignoring punctuation) on 1699 sentences < 100, including punctuation, from section 22.",
        "Sections 02-21 were the train set for the treebank PCFG; only trees with a yield (including punctuation) of length < 20 were used for the pnp program.",
        "Coverage in all cases is 1691 (excluding failed parses gives Fi = 85.19 for the tb-pcfg-baseline, and 85.54 for pnp10000).",
        "In figure 8(left) we plot the difference in parse accuracy between the treebank PCFG and our best model per testset sentence.",
        "To make the plot more informative, the sentences are ordered by increasing difference.",
        "Hence, on the left are sentences where the treebank PCFG scores better, and at the right the sentence where pnp10000 scores best.",
        "As is clear from this graph, for most sentences there is no difference, but there are small and about equally sized subsets of sentences for which one or the other model scores better.",
        "We have briefly analysed these sentences, but not found a clear pattern.",
        "In figure 8(right) we plot in a similar way the difference in log-likelihood that the parsers assign to each sentence.",
        "Here we see a clear pattern: only very few sentences receive slightly higher likelihood under the PCFG model.",
        "For a good portion of the sentences, however, the pnp10000 model assigns them somewhat and in some cases much higher likelihood.",
        "The highest likelihood gains are due to a small number of frequent multiword expressions, such as \"New York Stock Exchange Composite Trading\", which P-DOP treats as a unit; all of the other gains in likelihood are also due to the use of depth>1 elementary trees, including some non-contiguous constructions such as revenues rose CD % to $ CD million from $ CD million.",

        "We set out to develop a parsimonious approach to Data-Oriented Parsing, where all subtrees can potentially become units in a probabilistic grammar but only if the statistics require it.",
        "The grammars resulting from our algorithm are orders of magnitude smaller than those used in Bod's maximalist DOP.",
        "Although our parsing results are not yet at the level of the best results obtained by Bod, our results indicate that we are getting closer and that we already induce linguistically more plausible grammars.",
        "Could P-DOP eventually not only be more efficient, but also more accurate than maximalist DOP models?",
        "Bod has argued that the explanation for DOP's excellent results is that it takes into account all possible dependencies between productions in a tree, and not just those from an a-priori chosen subset (e.g. lexical, head, parent features).",
        "Nonhead dependencies in non-contiguous natural language constructions, like more ... than, as in more freight than cargo, are typically excluded in the enrichment/conditioning approaches discussed in section 2.",
        "Bod wants to include any dependency a priori, and then \"let the statistics decide\".",
        "Although the inclusion of all dependencies must somehow explain the performance difference between Bod's best generative model and manually enriched PCFG models, this explanation is not entirely satisfactory.",
        "Zuidema (2006a) shows that also the estimator (Bod, 2003) uses is biased and inconsistent, and will, even in the limit of infinite data, not correctly identify many possible distributions over trees.",
        "This is not just a theoretical problem.",
        "For instance, in the Penn Tree Bank the construction won't VP is annotated as (VP (MD wo) (RB n't) VP).",
        "There is a strong dependency between the two morphemes: wo doesn't exist as an independent word, and strongly predicts n't.",
        "However, Bod's estimator will continue to reserve probability mass for other combinations with the same POS-tags such as wo not, even with an infinite data set only containing will not and wo n't.",
        "Because in parsing the strings are given, this particular example will not harm the parse accuracy results.",
        "The example might be diagnostic for other cases that do, however, and certainly will have impact when DOP is used as language model.",
        "P-DOP, in contrast, does converge to grammars that treat won't as a single unit.",
        "The exact relation of P-DOP to other DOP models, including S-DOP (Bod, 2003), Backoff-DOP (Sima'an and Buratto, 2003), DOP* (Zollmann and Sima'an, 2005) and ML-DOP (Bod, 2006; based on Expectation Maximization) and not dissimilar automatic enrichment models such as (Petrov et al., 2006), remains a topic for future work.",
