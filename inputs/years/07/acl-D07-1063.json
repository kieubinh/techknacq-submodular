        "A number of techniques have been proposed for years.",
        "Japanese dependency is usually represented by the relation between phrasal units called 'bunsetsu' chunks, which are the smallest meaningful sequences consisting of an independent word and accompanying words (e.g., a noun and a particle).",
        "Hereafter, a 'chunk' means a bunsetsu chunk in this paper.",

        "rection from the modifier to the modifiee.",
        "All dependencies in a sentence are represented by a dependency tree, where a node indicates a chunk, and node B is the parent of node A when chunk B is the modifiee of chunk A.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example of a dependency tree.",
        "The task of Japanese dependency analysis is to find the modifiee for each chunk in a sentence.",
        "The task is usually regarded as construction of a dependency tree.",
        "In primitive approaches, the probabilities of dependencies are given by manually constructed rules and the modifiee of each chunk is determined.",
        "However, those rule-based approaches have problems in coverage and consistency.",
        "Therefore, a number of statistical techniques using machine learning algorithms have recently been proposed.",
        "In most conventional statistical techniques, the probabilities of dependencies between two chunks are learned in the learning phase, and then the modifiee of each chunk is determined using the learned models in the analysis phase.",
        "In terms of dependency trees, the parent node of each node is determined based on the likeliness of parent-child relations between two nodes.",
        "We here take notice of the characteristics of dependencies which cannot be captured well only by the parent-child relation.",
        "Consider, for example, Figure 1.",
        "In Figure 1, ID 3(pizza-and) and ID 4(salad-accusative) are in a parallel structure.",
        "In the structure, node 4 is a child of node 5(ate), but node 3 is not a child of 5, although 3 and 4 are both foods and should share a tendency of being subcategorized by the verb \"eat\".",
        "A number of conventional models use the pair of 3(pizza-and) and 5(ate) as a negative instance because 3 does not modify 5.",
        "Consequently, those models cannot learn and use the sub-categorization preference of verbs well in the parallel structures.",
        "We focus on ancestor-descendant relations to compensate for the weakness.",
        "Two nodes are in the ancestor-descendant relation when one of the two nodes is included in the path from the root node to the other node.",
        "The upper node of the two nodes is called an 'ancestor node' and the lower node a 'descendant node'.",
        "When the ancestor-descendant relation is used, both of the above two instances for nodes 3 and 4 can be considered as positive instances.",
        "Therefore, it is expected that the ancestor-descendant relation helps the algorithm capture the characteristics that cannot be captured well by the parent-child relation.",
        "We aim to improve the performance of Japanese dependency analysis by taking the ancestor-descendant relation into account.",
        "In exploiting ancestor-descendant information, it came to us that redundant information is effectively utilized in a coding problem in communications (Mackay, 2003).",
        "Therefore, we propose a method in which the problem of determining the modifiee of a chunk is regarded as a kind of a coding problem: dependency is expressed as a sequence of values, each of which denotes whether a parent-child relation or an ancestor-descendant relation holds between two chunks.",
        "In Section 2, we present the related work.",
        "In Section 3, we explain our method.",
        "In Section 4, we describe our experiments and their results, where we show the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

        "Finally, we describe the summary of this paper and the future work in Section 6.",
        "2 Conventional Statistical Methods for Japanese Dependency Analysis",
        "First, we describe general formulation of the probability model for dependency analysis.",
        "We denote a sequence of chunks, \"b\\,b2, ...,bm\", by B, and a sequence of dependency patterns, \"Dep(l), Dep(2),Dep(m)\", by D, where Dep(i) = j means that bi modifies bj.",
        "Given the sequence B of chunks as an input, dependency analysis is defined as the problem of finding the sequence D of the dependency patterns that maximizes the conditional probability P(D | B).",
        "A number of the conventional methods assume that dependency probabilities are independent of each other and approximate P(D | B) with Y^-1 P(Dep(i) | B).",
        "P(Dep(i) I B) is estimated using machine learning algorithms.",
        "For example, Haruno et al.",
        "(1999) used Decision Trees, Sekine (2000) used Maximum Entropy Models, Kudo and Matsumoto (2000) used Support Vector Machines.",
        "Another notable method is Cascaded Chunking Model by Kudo and Matsumoto (2002).",
        "In their model, a sentence is parsed by series of the following processes: whether or not the current chunk modifies the following chunk is estimated, and if it is so, the two chunks are merged together.",
        "Sassano (2004) parsed a sentence efficiently using a stack.",
        "The stack controls the modifier being analyzed.",
        "These conventional methods determine the modifiee of each chunk based on the likeliness of dependencies between two chunks (in terms of dependency tree, the likeliness of parent-child relations between two nodes).",
        "The difference between the conventional methods and the proposed method is that the proposed method determines the modifiees based on the likeliness of ancestor-descendant relations in addition to parent-child relations, while the conventional methods tried to capture characteristics that cannot be captured by parent-child relations, by adding ad-hoc features such as features of \"the chunk modified by the candidate modifiee\" to features of the candidate modifiee and the modifier.",
        "However, these methods do not deal with ancestor-descendant relations between two chunks directly, while our method uses that information directly.",
        "In Section 5, we empirically show that our method uses the ancestor-descendant relation more effectively than the conventional ones and explain that our method is justifiable in terms of a coding problem."

        "The methods explained in this section construct a dependency tree by series of actions of attaching a node to one of the nodes in the trees being constructed.",

        "To satisfy the requirement, we note the characteristic of Japanese dependencies: dependencies are directed from left to right.",
        "(i.e., the parent node is closer to the end of a sentence than its child node).",
        "Therefore, our methods analyze a sentence backwards as in Sekine (2000) and Kudo and Matsumoto (2000).",

        "Next, the parent node of ID 2(at lunchtime), and finally, that of ID l(he-nominative) is determined and dependencies in a sentence are identified.",
        "Please note that our methods are applicable only to dependency structures of languages that have a consistent head-direction like Japanese.",
        "We explain three methods that are different in the information used in determining the modifiee of each chunk.",
        "In Section 3.1, we explain PARENT METHOD and ANCESTOR METHOD, which determine the modifiee of each chunk based on the likeliness of only one type of the relation.",
        "PARENT METHOD uses the parent-child relation, which is used in conventional Japanese dependency analysis.",
        "ANCESTOR METHOD is novel in that it uses the ancestor-descendant relation which has not been used in the existing methods.",
        "In Section 3.2, we explain our method, PARENT-ANCESTOR METHOD, which determines the modifiees based on the likeliness of both ancestor-descendant and parent-child relations.",
        "When the modifiee is determined using the ancestor-descendant relation, it is necessary to take into account the relations with every node in the tree.",
        "Consider, for example, the case that the modifiee of ID l (he-nominative) is determined in Figure 1.",
        "When using the parent-child relation, the modifiee can be determined based only on the relation between ID l and 5.",
        "On the other hand, when using the ancestor-descendant relation, the modifiee cannot be determined based only on the relation between ID l and 5.",
        "This is because if one of ID 2, 3 and 4 is the modifiee of ID l, the relation between ID l and 5 is ancestor-descendant.",
        "ID 5 is determined as the modifiee of ID l only after the relations with each node of ID 2, 3 and 4 are recognized not to be ancestor-descendant.",
        "An elegant way to use the ancestor-descendant relation, which we propose in this paper, is to represent a dependency as a codeword where each bit indicates the relation with a node in the tree, and determine the modifiee based on the relations with every node in the tree (for details to the next section).",

        "In that case, the added redundancy may not help errors be corrected than cause an error.",

        "The approaches assign a unique n-bit codeword to each class, and then n classifiers are trained to predict each bit.",
        "The predicted class is the one whose codeword is closest to the codeword produced by the classifiers.",
        "The codewords in these approaches are designed to be well-separated from one another and have sufficient error-correcting ability (e.g., BCH code).",
        "However, these existing codewords are not applicable to the proposed method.",
        "In the proposed method, we have two models respectively derived from the parent-child and ancestor-descendant relation, which can be interpreted in terms of both linguistic aspects and tree structures.",
        "If we use ECOC, however, pairs of nodes are divided into positive and negative instances arbitrarily.",
        "Since this division lacks linguistic or structural meaning, training instances will lose consistency and any proper model will not be obtained.",
        "Moreover, we have to prepare different models for each stage in tree construction, because the length of the codewords vary according to the number of nodes in the current tree.",
        "In this section, we compare the performance of dependency analysis with various distance functions: hamming distance, euclidean distance, cosine distance, and manhattan distance.",
        "These distance functions between sequences X=\"x1 x2 ... xn\" and Y=\"y1 y2 ... Vn\" are defined as follows:",
        "• Man(X, Y) = Eti I x* – y* |.",
        "In the hamming distance, string-output is converted to a binary sequence with their elements being of – 1 or 1.",
        "The cosine distance is equivalent to the Euclidean distance under the condition that the absolute value of every component of string [k] is 1.",
        "The results of dependency analysis using these distance functions are shown in Table 6.",
        "In Table 6, '(n)' means that the nearest chunk in a sentence is selected as the modifiee in order to break a tie, which happens when the number of sequences satisfying the condition in step 5 is two or more, while '(f)' means that the furthest chunk is selected.",
        "If the results in case of (n) and (f) are the same, (n) and (f) are omitted and only one result is shown.",
        "METHOD in any distance functions.",
        "It means that the effectiveness of the proposed method does not depend on distance functions.",
        "The result using the hamming distance is much worse than using the other distance functions.",
        "It means that using the scores output by SVMs as the likeliness of a certain relation improves the accuracy.",
        "The results of (n) and (f) in the hamming distance are different.",
        "It is because the hamming distances are always positive integers and ties are more likely to happen.",
