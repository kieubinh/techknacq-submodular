        "It is widely acknowledged that coordinate conjunctions often consist of two or more conjuncts having similar syntactic constructs.",
        "Our coordination detection model also follows this observation.",
        "To detect such similar constructs, we use the sequence alignment technique (Gusfield, 1997).",
        "Sequence alignment is defined in terms of transformation of one sequence (string) into another through an alignment, or a series of edit operations.",
        "Each of the edit operations has an associated cost, and the cost of an alignment is defined as the total cost of edit operations involved in the alignment.",
        "The minimum cost alignment can be computed by dynamic programming in a state space called an edit graph, such as illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "In this graph, a complete path starting from the upper-left initial vertex and arriving at the lower-right terminal vertex constitutes a global alignment.",
        "Likewise, a partial path corresponds to a local alignment.",

        "The maximal local alignment between two identical sequences is a trivial (global) alignment of identity transformation (the diagonal path in an edit graph).",

        "Designing heuristic rules for coordination detection, such as those proposed in previous studies, translates to the design of suitable features in our model.",
        "Our learning method is an extension of Collins's perceptron-based method for sequence labeling (Collins, 2002).",

        "Collins's method, like the linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001; Sha and Pereira, 2003), seeks for a complete path from the initial vertex to the terminal using the Viterbi algorithm.",
        "In an edit graph, on the other hand, coordinations are represented by partial paths.",

        "But to deal with complex coordinations, a more expressive score function is sometimes desirable, so that scores can be computed not only on the basis of a single edit operation, but also on consecutive edit operations.",
        "Edit graphs are not designed to accommodate features for such a higher-order interaction of edit operations.",
        "To reconcile these incompatibilities, we derive a more finer-grained model from the original edit graph.",
        "In presenting the description of our model below, we reserve the terminology 'vertex' and 'edge' for the original edit graph, and use 'node' and 'arc' for our new model, to avoid confusion.",

        "In Figure 2, the augmented Outside edges in this unique path are plotted as dotted lines for illustration.",
        "Thus we obtain a complete path which is compatible with Collins's perceptron-based sequence learning method.",
        "The objective of the learning algorithms, which we will describe in Section 4, is to optimize the weight of features so that running the Viterbi algorithm will yield the same path as the gold standard.",
        "Because a node in our state space corresponds to an edge in the original edit graph (see Figure 3), an arc in our state space is actually a pair of consecutive edges (or equivalently, edit operations) in the original graph.",

        "Using these boxes, we evaluate precision, recall and F rates through the following definition.",
        "The precision measures how many of the boxes output by the algorithm exactly match those in the gold standard, and the recall rate is the percentage of boxes found by the algorithm.",
        "The F rate is the harmonic mean of the precision and the recall.",
        "The second evaluation method (\"chunk-based evaluation\") for conjuncts is based on whether the algorithm correctly outputs the beginning and end of each conjunct, in the same manner as the chunking tasks.",
        "Here, we adopt the evaluation criteria for the",
        "CoNLL 99 NP bracketing task; the precision equals how many of the NP conjuncts output by the algorithm are correct, and the recall is the percentage of NP conjuncts found by the algorithm.",
        "Of these two evaluation methods for conjuncts, it is harder to obtain a higher pairwise evaluation score than the chunk-based evaluation.",
        "To be counted as a true positive in the pairwise evaluation, two consecutive chunks must be output correctly by the algorithm.",
        "For the correctness of the coordination range, we check if both the start of the first coordinated conjunct and the end of the last conjunct in the gold match those output by the algorithm The reason we evaluate coordination range is to compare our proposed method with the full parsers trained on WSJ (but applied to GENIA).",
        "Although WSJ and GE-",
        "NIA differ in the way conjuncts are annotated, they are mostly identical on how the range of coordinations are annotated, and hence comparison is feasible in terms of coordination range.",

        "In (Clegg and Shepherd, 2007), an F score of75.5 is reported for the Bikel parser on coordination detection.",
