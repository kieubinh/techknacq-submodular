        "In this paper, we study automatic paragraph segmentation (APS).",
        "This task is closely related to some well known problems such as text segmentation, discourse parsing, topic shift detection and is relevant for various important applications in speech-to-text and text-to-text tasks.",
        "In speech-to-text applications, the output of a speech recognition system, such as the output of systems creating memos and documents for the Parliament House, is usually raw text without any punctuation or paragraph breaks.",
        "Clearly, such text requires paragraph segmentations.",
        "In text-to-text processing, such as summarization, the output text does not necessarily retain the correct paragraph structure and may require post-processing.",
        "There is psycholinguistic evidence as cited by Sporleder & Lapata (2004) showing that insertion of paragraph breaks could improve the readability.",
        "Moreover, it has been shown that different languages may have cross-linguistic variations in paragraph boundary placement (Zhu, 1999), which indicates that machine translation can also benefit from APS.",
        "APS can also recover the paragraph breaks that are often lost in the OCR applications.",
        "There has been growing interest within the NLP community for APS in recent years.",
        "Previous methods such as Sporleder & Lapata (2004); Genzel (2005); Filippova & Strube (2006) treat the problem as a binary classification task, where each sentence is labeled as the beginning of a paragraph or not.",
        "They focus on the use of features, such as surface features, language modeling features and syntactic features.",
        "The effectiveness of features is investigated across languages and/or domains.",
        "However, these approaches ignore the inherent sequential nature of APS.",
        "Clearly, consecutive sentences within the same paragraph depend on each other.",
        "Moreover, paragraphs should exhibit certain properties such as coherence, which should be explored within an APS system.",
        "One cannot incorporate such properties/features when APS is treated as a binary classification problem.",
        "To overcome this limitation, we cast APS as a sequence prediction problem, where the performance can be significantly improved by optimizing the choice of labeling over whole sequences of sentences, rather than individual sentences.",
        "Sequence prediction is one of the most promi-",
        "Figure 1: Top: sequence (horizontal line) with segment boundaries (vertical lines).",
        "This corresponds to a model where we estimate each segment boundary independently of all other boundaries.",
        "Middle: simple semi-Markov structure.",
        "The position of the segment boundaries only depends on the position of its neighbors, as denoted by the (red) dash arcs.",
        "Bottom: a more sophisticated semi-Markov structure, where each boundary depends on the position oftwo of its neighbors.",
        "This may occur, e.g., when the decision of where to place a boundary depends on the content of two adjacent segments.",
        "The longer range interaction is represented by the additional (blue) arcs.",
        "nent examples of structured prediction.",
        "This problem is generally formalized such that there exists one variable for each observation in the sequence and the variables form a Markov chain (HMM).",
        "Segmentation of a sequence has been studied as a class of sequence prediction problems with common applications such as protein secondary structure prediction, Named Entity Recognition and segmentation of FAQ's.",
        "The exceptions to this approach are Sarawagi & Cohen (2004); Raetsch & Sonnenburg (2006), which show that Semi-Markov models (SMMs) (Janssen & Limnois, 1999), which are a variation of Markov models, are a natural formulation for sequence segmentation.",
        "The advantage of these models, depicted in Figure 1, is their ability to encode features that capture properties of a segment as a whole, which is not possible in an HMM model.",
        "In particular, these features can encode similarities between two sequence segments of arbitrary lengths, which can be very useful in tasks such as",
        "APS.",
        "In this paper, we present a Semi-Markov model for APS and propose a max-margin training on these methods.",
        "This training method is a generalization of the Max-Margin methods for HMMs (Altun et al., 2003b) to SMMs.",
        "It follows the recent literature on discriminative learning of structured prediction (Lafferty et al., 2001; Collins, 2002; Altun et al., 2003a; Taskar et al., 2003).",
        "Our method inherits the advantages of discriminative techniques, namely the ability to encode arbitrary (overlapping) features and not making implausible conditional independence assumptions.",
        "It also has advantages of SMM models, namely the ability to encode features at segment level.",
        "We present a linear time inference algorithm for SMMs and outline the learning method.",

        "This is opposed to an HMM where there exists one variable for each observation.",
        "More formally, in SMMs, y e Y is a sequence of segment labelings si = (b, Zj) where bi is a non-negative integer denoting the beginning of the ithsegment which ends at position bi+1 – 1 and whose label is given by Zi (Sarawagi & Cohen, 2004).",

        "So the first segment is [0, b1), and the last segment is [bL-1,N), where [a, b) denotes all the sentences from a to b inclusive a but exclusive b.",

        "One of the advantages of this method is its ability to incorporate the cost function that the classifier is evaluated with.",
        "Let A(y, y) be the cost of predicting y instead of y.",
        "For instance, A is usually the 0-1 loss for binary and multiclass classification.",
        "However, in segmentation, this may be a more sophisticated function such as the symmetric difference of y and y as discussed in Section 2.2.",
        "Then, one can argue that optimizing a loss function that incorporates this cost can lead to better generalization properties.",
        "One can find a theoretical analysis of this approach in Tsochantaridis et al.",
        "(2004).",
        "We follow the general framework of Tsochan-taridis et al.",
        "(2004) and look for a hyperplane that separates the correct labeling yi of each observation sequence xi in our training set from all the incorrect labelings Y – yi with some margin that depends on A additively .",
        "In order to allow some outliers, we use slack variables £j and maximize the minimum margin, F(xi, yi) – maxy€y _yi F(xi, y), across training instances i. Equivalently,",
        "To solve this optimization problem efficiently, one can investigate its dual given by",
        "Vi,y < C, aiy > 0.",
        "Here, there exists one parameter aiy for each training instance xi and its possible labeling y e Y.",
        "Solving this optimization problem presents a formidable challenge since Y generally scales exponentially with the number of variables within each variable y.",
        "This essentially makes it impossible to find an optimal solution via enumeration.",
        "Instead, one may use a column generation algorithm (Tsochantaridis et al., 2005) to find an approximate solution in polynomial time.",
        "The key idea is to find the most violated constraints (3b) for the current set of parameters and satisfy them up to some precision.",
        "In order to do this, one needs to find which can usually be done via dynamic programming.",
        "As we shall see, this is an extension of the Viterbi algorithm for Semi Markov models.",

        "We refer the reader to Tsochantaridis et al.",
        "(2005) for details.",
        "To adapt the above framework to the segmentation setting, we need to address three issues: a) we need to specify a loss function A for segmentation, b) we need a suitable feature map $ as defined in Section 2.3, and c) we need to find an algorithm to solve (5) efficiently.",
        "The max-margin training of SMMs was also presented in Raetsch & Sonnenburg (2006)",

        "SMMs can extract three kinds of features from the input/output pairs: a) node features, i. e. features that encode interactions between attributes of the observation sequence and the (label of a) segment (rather than the label of each observation as in HMM), b) features that encode interactions between neighboring labels along the sequence and c) edge features, i.e. features that encode properties of segments.",
