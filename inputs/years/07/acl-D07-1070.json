        "Yet an adequate labeled training corpus – a large treebank of manually constructed parse trees of typical sentences – is rarely available and would be prohibitively expensive to develop.",
        "We show how it is possible to train instead from a small hand-labeled treebank in the target domain, together with a large unannotated collection of indomain sentences.",
        "Additional resources such as parsers for other domains or languages can be integrated naturally.",
        "Dependency parsing is important as a key component in leading systems for information extraction (Weischedel, 2004) and question answering (Peng et al., 2005).",
        "These systems rely on edges or paths in dependency parse trees to define their extraction patterns and classification features.",
        "Parsing is also key to the latest advances in machine translation, which translate syntactic phrases (Galley et al., 2006; Marcu et al., 2006; Cowan et al., 2006)."

      "heading": "2. Our Approach",
      "text": [
        "Our approach rests on three observations:",
        "• Recent \"feature-based\" parsing models are an excellent fit for bootstrapping, because the parse is often overdetermined by many redundant features.",
        "• The feature-based framework is flexible enough to incorporate other sources of guidance during training or testing – such as the knowledge contained in a parser for another language or domain.",
        "• Maximizing a combination of likelihood on labeled data and confidence on unlabeled data is a principled approach to bootstrapping.",
        "McDonald et al.",
        "(2005) introduced a simple, flexible framework for scoring dependency parses.",
        "Each directed edge e in the dependency tree is described with a high-dimensional feature vector f (e).",
        "The edge's score is the dot product f (e) • 6, where 6 is a learned weight vector.",
        "The overall score of a dependency tree is the sum of the scores of all edges in the tree.",
        "Given an n-word input sentence, the parser begins by scoring each of the O(n) possible edges, and then seeks the highest-scoring legal dependency tree formed by any n – 1 of these edges, using an O(n) dynamic programming algorithm (Eisner, 1996) for projective trees.",
        "For non-projective parsing, O(n), or with some trickery O(n), greedy algorithms exist (Chu and Liu, 1965; Edmonds, 1967; Gabow et al., 1986).",
        "The feature function f may pay attention to many properties of the directed edge e. Of course, features may consider the parent and child words connected by e, and their parts of speech.",
        "But some features used by McDonald et al.",
        "(2005) also consider the parts of speech of words adjacent to the parent and child, or between the parent and child, as well as the number of words between the parent and child.",
        "In general, these features are not available in a generative model such as a PCFG.",
        "Although feature-based models are often trained purely discriminatively, we will see in §2.6 how to train them to model conditional probabilities.",
        "The above parsing model is robust, thanks to its many features.",
        "On the Penn Treebank WSJ sections 02-21, for example, McDonald's parser extracts 5.5 million feature types from supervised edges alone, with about 120 feature tokens firing per edge.",
        "The highest-scoring parse tree represents a consensus among all features on all prospective edges.",
        "Even if a prospective edge has some discouraging features (i.e., with negative or zero weights), it may still have a relatively high score thanks to its other features.",
        "Furthermore, even if the edge has a low total score, it may still appear in the consensus parse if the alternatives are even worse or are incompatible with other high-scoring edges.",
        "Put another way, the parser is not able to include high-scoring features or edges independently of one another.",
        "Selecting a good feature means accepting all other features on that edge.",
        "It also means rejecting various other edges, because of the global constraints that a legal parse tree must give each word only one parent and must be free of cycles and, in the projective case, crossings.",
        "Our observation is that this situation is ideal for so-called \"bootstrapping,\" \"co-training,\" or \"minimally supervised\" learning methods (Yarowsky, 1995; Blum and Mitchell, 1998; Yarowsky and Wi-centowski, 2000).",
        "Such methods should thrive when the right answer is overdetermined owing to redundant features and/or global constraints.",
        "Concretely, suppose we start by training a supervised parser on only 100 examples, using some regularization method to prevent overfitting to this set.",
        "While many features might truly be relevant to the task, only a few appear often enough in this small training set to acquire significantly positive or negative weights.",
        "Even this lightly trained parser may be quite sure of itself on some test sentences in a large unanno-tated corpus, when one parse scores far higher than all others.",
        "More generally, the parser may be sure about part of a sentence: it may be certain that a particular edge is present (or absent), because that edge tends to be present (or absent) in all high-scoring parses.",
        "Retraining the feature weights 6 on these high-confidence edges can learn about additional features that are correlated with an edge's success or failure.",
        "For example, it may now learn strong weights for lexically specific features that were never observed in the supervised training set.",
        "The retrained parser may now be able to confidently parse even more of the unannotated examples; so we can iterate the process.",
        "Our hope is that the model identifies new good and bad edges at each step, and does so correctly.",
        "The more features and global constraints the model has,",
        "• the more power it will have to discriminate among edges even when 6 is insufficiently trained.",
        "(Some feature weights may be too weak (i.e., too close to zero) because the initial labeled set is small.)",
        "• the more robust it will be against errors even when 6 is incorrectly trained.",
        "(Some feature weights may be too strong or have the wrong sign, because of overfitting or mistaken parses during bootstrapping.)",
        "In the former case, strong features lend their strength to weak ones.",
        "In the latter case, a conflict among strong features weakens the ones that depart from the consensus, or discounts the example sentence if there is no consensus.",
        "Previous work on parser bootstrapping has not been able to exploit this redundancy among features, because it has used PCFG-like models with far fewer features (Steedman et al., 2003).",
        "The previous section assumed that we had a small supervised treebank in the target language and domain (plus a large unsupervised corpus).",
        "We now consider other, more dubious, knowledge sources that might supplement or replace this small treebank.",
        "In each case, we can use these knowledge sources to derive features that may – or may not – prove trustworthy during bootstrapping.",
        "Parses from a different domain.",
        "One might have a treebank for a different domain or genre of the target language.",
        "One could simply include these trees in the initial supervised training, and hope that bootstrapping corrects any learned weights that are inappropriate to the target domain, as discussed above.",
        "In fact, McClosky et al.",
        "(2006) found a similar technique to be effective – though only in a model with a large feature space (\"PCFG + reranking\"), as we would predict.",
        "However, another approach is to train a separate out-of-domain parser, and use this to generate additional features on the supervised and unsupervised in-domain data (Blitzer et al., 2006).",
        "Bootstrapping now teaches us where to trust the out-of-domain parser.",
        "If our basic model has 100 features, we could add features 101 through 200, where for example /i23(e) = /23 • logPr(e) and Pr(e) is the posterior edge probability according to the out-of-domain parser.",
        "Learning that this feature has a high weight means learning to trust the out-of-domain parser's decision on edges where in-domain feature 23 fires.",
        "Even more sensibly, we could add features such as /2o1(e) = J2^ 1 /(e) • 9i, where f and 6 are the feature and weight vectors for the out-of-domain parser.",
        "Learning that this feature has a high weight means learning to trust the out-of-domain parser's feature",
        "weights for a particular class of features (those numbered 1 through 10).",
        "This addresses the intuition that some linguistic phenomena remain stable across domains.",
        "Parses of translations.",
        "Suppose we have translations into English of some of our supervised or unsupervised sentences.",
        "Good probabilistic dependency parsers already exist for English, so we run one over the English translation.",
        "We can now derive many additional features on candidate edges on the target sentence.",
        "For example, dependency edges in the target language of the form c – ^ p (this denotes a child-to-parent dependency with label possessor) might often correspond to dependency paths in the",
        "English translation of the form p' of < – – c'.",
        "To discover whether this is so, we define a feature i by",
        ", prep pobj .",
        "where c',p' range over word tokens in the English translation, \"of\" is a literal English word, and the probabilities are posteriors provided by a probabilistic aligner and a probabilistic English parser.",
        "Note that this is a single feature (not a feature family parameterized by c, p).",
        "It scores any candidate edge on whether it is a – ^ edge that seems to align to an",
        "prep pobj English < – of < – path.",
        "This method is inspired by Hwa et al.",
        "(2005), who bootstrapped parsers for Spanish and Chinese by projecting dependencies from English translations and training a new parser on the resulting noisy treebank.",
        "They used only 1-best translations, 1-best alignments, dependency paths of length 1, and no labeled data in Spanish or Chinese.",
        "Hwa et al.",
        "(2005) used a manually written postprocessor to correct some of the many incorrect projections.",
        "By contrast, our framework uses the projected dependencies only as one source of features.",
        "They may be overridden by other features in particular cases, and will be given a high weight only if they tend to agree with other features during bootstrapping.",
        "A similar soft projection of dependencies was used in supervised machine translation by Smith and Eisner (2006), who used a source sentence's dependency paths to bias the generation of its translation.",
        "Note that these bilingual features will only fire on those supervised or unsupervised sentences for which we have an English translation.",
        "In particular, they will usually be unavailable on the test set.",
        "However, we hope that they will seed and facilitate the bootstrapping process, by helping us confidently parse some unsupervised sentences that we would not be able to confidently parse without an English translation.",
        "Parses of comparable English sentences.",
        "World knowledge can be useful in parsing.",
        "Suppose you see a French sentence that contains mangeons and pommes, and you know that manger=eat and pomme=apple.",
        "You might reasonably guess that pommes is the direct object of mangeons, because you know that apple is a plausible direct object for eat.",
        "We can discover this last bit of world knowledge from comparable English text.",
        "Translation dictionaries can themselves be induced from comparable corpora (Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002; Schafer, 2006; Klementiev and Roth, 2006), or extracted from bitext or digitized versions of human-readable dictionaries if these are available.",
        "The above inference pattern can be captured by features similar to those in equation (1).",
        "For example, one can define a feature j by",
        "| p' translates p, c' translates c)",
        "where each event in the event space is a pair (c', p') of same-sentence tokens in comparable English text, all pairs being equally likely.",
        "Thus, to estimate Pr(- | •), the denominator counts same-sentence token pairs ( c', p') in the comparable English corpus that translate into the types (c, p), and the numerator counts such pairs that are also related by a PreP of |po-j path.",
        "Since the lexical translations and dependency paths are typically not labeled in the English corpus, a given pair must be counted fractionally according to its posterior probability of satisfying these conditions, given models of contextual translation and English parsing.",
        "Section 2.2 assumed a relatively conventional kind of bootstrapping, where each iteration retrains the model on the examples where it is currently most confident.",
        "This kind of \"confidence thresholding\" has been popular in previous bootstrapping work (as cited in §2.2).",
        "It attempts to maintain high accuracy while gradually expanding coverage.",
        "The assumption is that throughout the training procedure, the parser's confidence is a trustworthy guide to its correctness.",
        "Different bootstrapping procedures use different learners, smoothing methods, confidence measures, and procedures for \"forgetting\" the label-ings from previous iterations.",
        "In his analysis of Yarowsky (1995), Abney (2004) formulates several variants of bootstrapping.",
        "These are shown to increase either the likelihood of the training data, or a lower bound on that likelihood.",
        "In particular, Abney defines a function K that is an upper bound on the negative log-likelihood, and shows his bootstrapping algorithms locally minimize K.",
        "We now present a generalization of Abney's K function and relate it to another semi-supervised learning technique, entropy regularization (Brand, 1999; Grandvalet and Bengio, 2005; Jiao et al., 2006).",
        "Our experiments will tune the feature weight vector, 6, to minimize our function.",
        "We will do so simply by applying a generic function minimization method (stochastic gradient descent), rather than by crafting a new Yarowsky-style or Abney-style iterative procedure for our specific function.",
        "Suppose we have examples xi and corresponding possible labelings yi;k. We are trying to learn a parametric model pe(yi,k | Xi).",
        "If p(yi,k | Xi) is a \"labeling distribution\" that reflects our uncertainty about the true labels, then our expected negative log-likelihood of the model is",
        "wherepi(-) d=f j5(^ | Xi) andpe,i(-) = pe(• I Xi).",
        "Note that K is a function not only of 6 but also of the labeling distribution p ; a learner might be allowed to manipulate either in order to decrease K.",
        "The summands of K in equation (3) can be divided into two cases, according to whether Xi is labeled or not.",
        "For the labeled examples {Xi : i e L}, the labeling distribution p i is a point distribution that assigns all probability to the true, known label y*.",
        "Then H(pi) = 0.",
        "The total contribution of these examples to K simplifies to J2ieL – log pe(y* | xi), i.e., just the negative log-likelihood on the labeled data.",
        "But what is the labeling distribution for the unla-beled examples {xi : i e L}?",
        "Abney simply uses a uniform distribution over labels (e.g., parses), to reflect that the label is unknown.",
        "If his bootstrapping algorithm \"labels\" xi, then i moves into L and H(p i) is thereby reduced from maximal to 0.",
        "As a result, a method that labels the most confident examples may reduce K, and Abney shows that his method does so.",
        "Our approach is different: we will take the labeling distribution p i to be our actual current belief pe i, and manipulate it through changing 6 rather than L. L remains the original set of supervised examples.",
        "The total contribution of the unsupervised examples to K then simplifies to J2H(pe,i).",
        "We have no reason to believe that these two contributions (supervised and unsupervised) should be weighted equally.",
        "We thus introduce a multiplier 7 to form the actual objective function that we minimize with respect to 6:",
        "One may regard 7 as a Lagrange multiplier that is used to constrain the classifier's uncertainty H to be low, as presented in the work on entropy regularization (Brand, 1999; Grandvalet and Bengio, 2005;",
        "Jiao et al., 2006).",
        "Conventional bootstrapping retrains on the most confident unsupervised examples, making them more confident.",
        "Gradient descent on equation (4) essentially does the same, since unsupervised examples contribute to (4) only through H, and the shape of the H function means that it is most rapidly decreased by making the most confident unsupervised examples more confident.",
        "Besides favoring models that are self-confident on the unlabeled data, the objective function (4) also explicitly asks the model to continue to get the correct answers on the initial supervised corpus.",
        "1/7 controls the strength of this request.",
        "One could obtain a similar effect in conventional bootstrapping by up-weighting the initial labeled corpus when retraining.",
        "Minimizing equation (4) for parsing is more computationally intensive than in many other applications of bootstrapping, such as word sense disambiguation or document classification.",
        "With millions of features, our objective could take many iterations to converge to a local optimum, if we were only to update our parameter vector 6 after each iteration through a large unsupervised corpus.",
        "For many machine learning problems over large datasets, online learning methods such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD) have been empirically observed to converge in fewer iterations (Bottou, 2003).",
        "In SGD, instead of taking an optimization step in the direction of the gradient calculated over all unsupervised training examples, we parse each example, calculate the gradient of the objective function evaluated on that example alone, and then take a small step downhill.",
        "The update rule is thus where 6(t) is the parameter vector at time t, F(t) (6) is the objective function specialized to the time-t example, and n > 0 is a learning rate that we choose.",
        "We check for convergence after each pass through the example set.",
        "To evaluate equation (4), we need a conditional model of trees given a sentence xi.",
        "We define one by exponentiating and normalizing the tree scores:",
        "pe,i(yi,fc) = exp(Eeey.ifc f (e) ^ 6)/Zi.",
        "With exponentially many parses of xi, does our objective function (4) now have prohibitive computational complexity?",
        "The complexity is actually similar to that of the inside algorithm for parsing.",
        "In fact, the first term of (4) for projective parsing is found by running the O(n) inside algorithm on supervised data, and its gradient is found by the corresponding O(n) outside algorithm.",
        "For non-projective parsing, the analogy to the inside algorithm is the O(n) \"matrix-tree algorithm,\" which is dominated asymptotically by a matrix determinant (Smith and Smith, 2007; Koo et al., 2007; McDonald and Satta, 2007).",
        "The gradient of a determinant may be computed by matrix inversion, so evaluating the gradient again has the same O(n) complexity as evaluating the function.",
        "The second term of (4) is the Shannon entropy of the posterior distribution over parses.",
        "Computing this for projective parsing takes O(n) time, using a dynamic programming algorithm that is closely related to the inside algorithm (Hwa, 2000).",
        "For non-projective parsing, unfortunately, the runtime rises to O(n), since it requires determinants of n distinct matrices (each incorporating a log factor in a different column; we omit the details).",
        "The gradient evaluation in both cases is again about as expensive as the function evaluation.",
        "A convenient speedup is to replace Shannon entropy with Renyi entropy.",
        "The family of Renyi entropy measures is parameterized by a:",
        "In our setting, where p = pe,i, the events y are the possible parses of xi.",
        "Observe that under our definition of p, £y p(y)a = {£y expEeey f (e) • (a6)]}/Za.",
        "We already have Zi from running the inside algorithm, and we can find the numerator by running the inside algorithm again with 6 scaled by a.",
        "Thus with Renyi entropy, all computations and their gradients are O(n) – even in the non-projective case.",
        "Renyi entropy is also a theoretically attractive generalization.",
        "It can be shown that lima^1 Ra(p) is in fact the Shannon entropy H(p) and that linia^oo R«(p) = – logmaxy p(y), i.e. the negative log probability of the modal or \"Viterbi\" label (Arndt, 2001; Karakos et al., 2007).",
        "The a = 2 case, widely used as a measure of purity in decision tree learning, is often called the \"Gini index.\"",
        "Finally, when a = 0, we get the log of the number of labels, which equals the H(uniform distribution) that Abney used in equation (3)."
