        "Probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs) have been a core modeling technique for many aspects of linguistic structure, particularly syntactic phrase structure in treebank parsing (Charniak, 1996; Collins, 1999).",
        "An important question when learning PCFGs is how many grammar symbols to allocate to the learning algorithm based on the amount of available data.",
        "The question of \"how many clusters (symbols)?\"",
        "has been tackled in the Bayesian nonparametrics literature via Dirichlet process (DP) mixture models (Antoniak, 1974).",
        "DP mixture models have since been extended to hierarchical Dirichlet processes (HDPs) and HDP-HMMs (Teh et al., 2006; Beal et al., 2002) and applied to many different types of clustering/induction problems in NLP (Johnson et al., 2006; Goldwater et al., 2006).",

        "Specifically, an HDP-PCFG is defined to have an infinite number of symbols; the Dirichlet process (DP) prior penalizes the use of more symbols than are supported by the training data.",
        "Note that \"nonparametric\" does not mean \"no parameters\"; rather, it means that the effective number of parameters can grow adaptively as the amount of data increases, which is a desirable property of a learning algorithm.",
        "As models increase in complexity, so does the uncertainty over parameter estimates.",
        "In this regime, point estimates are unreliable since they do not take into account the fact that there are different amounts of uncertainty in the various components of the parameters.",
        "The HDP-PCFG is a Bayesian model which naturally handles this uncertainty.",
        "We present an efficient variational inference algorithm for the HDP-PCFG based on a structured mean-field approximation of the true posterior over parameters.",
        "The algorithm is similar in form to EM and thus inherits its simplicity, modularity, and efficiency.",
        "Unlike EM, however, the algorithm is able to take the uncertainty of parameters into account and thus incorporate the DP prior.",
        "Finally, we develop an extension of the HDP-PCFG for grammar refinement (HDP-PCFG-GR).",
        "Since treebanks generally consist of coarsely-labeled context-free tree structures, the maximum-likelihood treebank grammar is typically a poor model as it makes overly strong independence assumptions.",
        "As a result, many generative approaches to parsing construct refinements of the treebank grammar which are more suitable for the modeling task.",
        "Lexical methods split each pre-terminal symbol into many subsymbols, one for each word, and then focus on smoothing sparse lexical statismethods refine the grammar in a more conservative fashion, splitting each non-terminal or pre-terminal symbol into a much smaller number of subsymbols (Klein and Manning, 2003; Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Petrov et al., 2006).",

        "For each mixture component z £ {1,..., K}, the parameters of the component 0z are drawn from some prior Go.",
        "Given the model parameters (/3,0), the data points are generated i.i.d.",
        "by first choosing a component and then generating from a data model F parameterized by that component.",

        "Each component (cluster) z has multinomial parameters 0z which specifies a distribution F(•; 0z) over words.",
        "It is customary to use a conjugate Dirichlet prior G0 = Dirichlet(a',..., a') over the multinomial parameters, which can be interpreted as adding a' – 1 pseu-docounts for each word.",
        "We now consider the extension of the Bayesian finite mixture model to a nonparametric Bayesian mixture model based on the Dirichlet process.",
        "We focus on the stick-breaking representation (Sethuraman, 1994) of the Dirichlet process instead of the stochastic process definition (Ferguson, 1973) or the Chinese restaurant process (Pitman, 2002).",
        "The stick-breaking representation captures the DP prior most explicitly and allows us to extend the finite mixture model with minimal changes.",
        "Later, it will enable us to readily define structured models in a form similar to their classical versions.",
        "Furthermore, an efficient variational inference algorithm can be developed in this representation (Section 2.6).",
        "The key difference between the Bayesian finite mixture model and the DP mixture model is that the latter has a countably infinite number of mixture components while the former has a predefined K. Note that if we have an infinite number of mixture components, it no longer makes sense to consider a symmetric prior over the component probabilities; the prior over component probabilities must decay in some way.",
        "The stick-breaking distribution achieves this as follows.",

        "For completeness, we have also included unary productions, which are essentially the PCFG counterpart of transitions in HMMs.",
        "Finally, since each node i in the parse tree involves a symbolsubsymbol pair (si,zi), each subsymbol needs to specify a distribution over both child symbols and subsymbols.",
        "The former can be handled through a finite Dirichlet distribution since all symbols are known and observed, but the latter must be handled with the Dirichlet process machinery, since the number of subsymbols is unknown.",

        "We constrain q(f ) to be a degenerate distribution truncated at K; i.e., f z = 0 for z > K. While the posterior grammar does have an infinite number of symbols, the exponential decay of the DP prior ensures that most of the probability mass is contained in the first few symbols (Ish-waran and James, 2001).",

        "As K increases, our approximation improves.",

        "While the classical E-step uses the current rule probabilities 0, our mean-field approximation involves an entire distribution q(0).",
        "Fortunately, we can still handle this case by replacing each rule probability with a weight that summarizes the uncertainty over the rule probability as represented by q.",
        "We define this weight in the sequel.",
        "It is a common perception that Bayesian inference is slow because one needs to compute integrals.",

        "Specifically, consider a set of rules with the same left-hand side.",
        "The weights for all these rules only differ in the numerator (Equation (9)), so applying exp(^( )) creates a local preference for right-hand sides with larger counts.",
        "Also note that the rule weights are not normalized; they always sum to at most one and are equal to one exactly when q(0) is degenerate.",

        "Our goal is to learn a refined grammar, where each symbol in the training set is split into K subsymbols.",

        "There are six hyperparameters in the HDP-PCFG-GR model, which we set in the following manner: a = 1, aT = 1 (uniform distribution over unar-ies versus binaries), aE = 1 (uniform distribution over terminal words), au(s) = ab(s) = , where N(s) is the number of different unary (binary) right-hand sides of rules with left-hand side s in the treebank grammar.",
        "The two most important hyperparameters are au and aB, which govern the sparsity of the right-hand side for unary and binary rules.",
        "We set au = aB although more performance could probably be gained by tuning these individually.",

        "Without smoothing, ordinary PCFGs trained using EM improve as K increases but start to overfit around K = 4.",
        "Simple add-1.01 smoothing prevents overfitting but at the cost of a sharp increase in grammar sizes.",
        "The HDP-PCFG obtains comparable performance with a much smaller number of rules.",
        "We also trained on sections 2-21 to demonstrate that our methods can scale up and achieve broadly comparable results to existing state-of-the-art parsers.",
        "When using a truncation level of K = 16, the standard PCFG with smoothing obtains an Fi score of 88.36 using 706157 effective rules while the HDP-PCFG-GR obtains an Fi score of 87.08 using 428375 effective rules.",
