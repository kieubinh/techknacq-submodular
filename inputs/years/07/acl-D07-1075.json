        "Many information extraction (IE) systems rely on rules or patterns to extract words and phrases based on their surrounding context (e.g., (Soderland et al., 1995; Riloff, 1996; Califf and Mooney, 1999; Yan-garber et al., 2000)).",
        "For example, a pattern like \"<subject> was assassinated\" can reliably identify a victim of a murder event.",
        "Classification-based IE systems (e.g., (Freitag, 1998; Freitag and McCal-lum, 2000; Chieu et al., 2003)) also generally decide whether to extract words based on properties of the words themselves as well as properties associated with their surrounding context.",
        "In this research, we propose an alternative approach to IE that decouples the tasks of finding a relevant region of text and finding a desired extraction.",
        "In a typical pattern-based IE system, the extraction patterns perform two tasks: (a) they recognize that a relevant incident has occurred, and (b) they identify and extract some information about that event.",
        "In contrast, our approach first identifies relevant regions of a document that describes relevant events, and then applies extraction patterns only in these relevant regions.",
        "This decoupled approach to IE has several potential advantages.",
        "First, even seemingly good patterns can produce false hits due to metaphor and idiomatic expressions.",
        "However, by restricting their use to relevant regions of text, we could avoid such false positives.",
        "For example, \"John Kerry attacked George Bush \" is a metaphorical description of a verbal tirade, but could be easily mistaken for a physical attack.",
        "Second, IE systems are prone to errors of omission when relevant information is not explicitly linked to an event.",
        "For instance, a phrase like \"the gun was found...\" does not directly state that the the gun was used in a terrorist attack.",
        "But if the gun is mentioned in a region that clearly describes a terrorist attack, then it can be reasonably inferred to have been used in the attack.",
        "Third, if the IE patterns are restricted to areas of text that are known to be relevant, then it may suffice to use relatively general patterns, which may be easier to learn or acquire.",
        "Our approach begins with a relevant sentence classifier that is trained using only a few seed patterns and a set of relevant and irrelevant documents (but no sentence-level annotations) for the domain of interest.",
        "The classifier is then responsible for identifying sentences that are relevant to the IE task.",
        "Next, we learn \"semantically appropriate\" extraction patterns by evaluating candidate patterns using a semantic affinity metric.",
        "We then separate the patterns into primary and secondary patterns, and apply them selectively to sentences based on the relevance judgments produced by the classifier.",
        "We evaluate our IE system on two data sets: the MUC-4 IE terrorism corpus and ProMed disease outbreak articles.",
        "Our results show that this approach works well, often outperforming the AutoSlog-TS IE system which benefits from human review."

      "heading": "2. Motivation and Related Work",
      "text": [
        "Our research focuses on event-oriented information extraction (IE), where the goal of the IE system is to extract facts associated with domain-specific events from unstructured text.",
        "Many different approaches to information extraction have been developed, but generally speaking they fall into two categories: classifier-based approaches and rule/pattern-based approaches.",
        "Classifier-based IE systems use machine learning techniques to train a classifier that sequentially processes a document looking for words to be extracted.",
        "Examples of classifier-based IE systems are SRV (Freitag, 1998), HMM approaches (Freitag and Mc-Callum, 2000), ALICE (Chieu et al., 2003), and Relational Markov Networks (Bunescu and Mooney, 2004).",
        "The classifier typically decides whether a word should be extracted by considering features associated with that word as well as features of the words around it.",
        "Another common approach to information extraction uses a set of explicit patterns or rules to find relevant information.",
        "Some older systems relied on hand-crafted patterns, while more recent systems learn them automatically or semi-automatically.",
        "Examples of rule/pattern-based approaches to information extraction are FASTUS (Hobbs et al., 1997), PALKA (Kim and Moldovan, 1993), LIEP (Huffman, 1996), CRYSTAL (Soder-land et al., 1995), AutoSlog/AutoSlog-TS (Riloff, 1993; Riloff, 1996), RAPIER (Califf and Mooney, 1999), WHISK (Soderland, 1999), ExDisco (Yan(Popescu et al., 2004).",
        "One commonality behind all of these approaches is that they simultaneously decide whether a context is relevant and whether a word or phrase is a desirable extraction.",
        "Classifier-based systems rely on features that consider both the word and its surrounding context, and rule/pattern-based systems typically use patterns or rules that match both the words around a candidate extraction and (sometimes) properties of the candidate extraction itself.",
        "There is a simplicity and elegance to having a single model that handles both of these problems at the same time, but we hypothesized that there may be benefits to decoupling these tasks.",
        "We investigate an alternative approach that involves two passes over a document.",
        "In the first pass, we apply a relevant region identifier to identify regions of the text that appear to be especially relevant to the domain of interest.",
        "In the second pass, we apply extraction patterns inside the relevant regions.",
        "We hypothesize three possible benefits of this decoupled approach.",
        "First, if a system is certain that a region is relevant, then it can be more aggressive about searching for extractions.",
        "For example, consider the domain of terrorist event reports, where a goal is to identify the weapons that were used.",
        "Existing systems generally require rules/patterns to recognize a context in which a weapon is explicitly linked to an event or its consequences (e.g., \"attack with <np>\", or \" < np> caused damage\" ).",
        "However, weapons are not always directly linked to an event in text, but they may be inferred through context.",
        "For instance, an article may mention that a weapon was \"found\" or \"used\" without explicitly stating that it was involved in a terrorist event.",
        "However, if we know in advance that we are in a relevant context, then we can reliably infer that the weapon was, most likely, used in the event.",
        "Second, some patterns may seem to be relevant locally, but they can be deemed irrelevant when the global context is considered.",
        "For example, consider these sentences from the MUC-4 terrorism corpus:",
        "D 'Aubuisson unleashed harsh attacks on Duarte...",
        "Other brave minds that advocated reform had been killed before in that struggle.",
        "Locally, patterns such as \"<subject> unleashed attacks\" and \" <subject> had been killed\" seem likely to identify the perpetrators and victims of a physical attack.",
        "But when read in the full context of these sentences, it becomes clear that they are not related to a specific physical attack.",
        "Third, decoupling these tasks may simplify the learning process.",
        "Identifying relevant regions amounts to a text classification task, albeit the goal is to identify not just relevant documents, but relevant subregions of documents.",
        "Within a relevant region the patterns may not need to be as discriminating.",
        "So a more general learning approach may suffice.",
        "In this paper, we describe an IE system that consists of two decoupled modules for relevant sentence identification and extraction pattern learning.",
        "In Section 3, we describe the self-trained sentence classifier, which requires only a few seed patterns and relevant and irrelevant documents for training.",
        "Section 4 describes the extraction pattern learning module, which identifies semantically appropriate patterns for the IE system using a semantic affinity measure.",
        "Section 5 explains how we distinguish Primary patterns from Secondary patterns.",
        "Section 6 presents experimental results on two domains.",
        "Finally, Section 7 lists our conclusions and future work."

        "Our hypothesis is that if a system can reliably identify relevant regions of text, then extracting information only from these relevant regions can improve IE performance.",
        "There are many possible definitions for relevant region (e.g., Salton et al.",
        "(1993), Callan (1994)), and exploring the range of possibilities is an interesting avenue for future work.",
        "For our initial investigations of this idea, we begin by simply defining a sentence as our region size.",
        "This has the advantage of being an easy boundary line to draw (i.e., it is relatively easy to identify sentence boundaries) and it is a small region size yet includes more context than most current IE systems do.",
        "Our goal is to create a classifier that can determine whether a sentence contains information that should be extracted.",
        "Furthermore, we wanted to create a classifier that does not depend on manually annotated sentence data so that our system can be easily ported across domains.",
        "Therefore, we devised a method to self-train a classifier using a training set of relevant and irrelevant documents for the domain, and a few seed patterns as input.",
        "However, this results in an asymmetry in the training set.",
        "By definition, if a document is irrelevant to the IE task, then it cannot contain any relevant information.",
        "Consequently, all sentences in an irrelevant document must be irrelevant, so these sentences form our initial irrelevant sentences pool.",
        "In contrast, if a document is relevant to the IE task, then there must be at least one sentence that contains relevant information.",
        "However, most documents contain a mix of both relevant and irrelevant sentences.",
        "Therefore, the sentences from the relevant documents form our unlabeled sentences pool.",
        "Figure 1 shows the self-training procedure, which begins with a handful of seed patterns to initiate the learning process.",
        "The seed patterns should be able to reliably identify some information that is relevant to the IE task.",

        "The patterns serve as a simple pattern-based classifier to automatically identify some relevant sentences.",
        "In iteration 0 of the self-training loop (shown as dotted lines in Figure 1), the pattern-based classifier is applied to the unlabeled sentences to automatically label some of them as relevant.",
        "Next, an SVM (Vapnik, 1995) classifier is trained using these relevant sentences and an equal number of irrelevant sentences randomly drawn from the irrelevant sentences pool.",
        "We artificially created a balanced training set because the set of irrelevant sentences is initially much larger than the set of relevant sentences, and we want the classifier to learn how to identify new relevant sentences.",
        "The feature set consists of all unigrams that appear in the training set.",
        "The SVM is trained using a linear kernel with the default parameter settings.",
        "In a self-training loop, the classifier is then applied to the unlabeled sentences, and all sentences that it classifies as relevant are added to the relevant sentences pool.",

        "One motivation for creating a relevant region classifier is to reduce the responsibilities of the extraction patterns.",

        "In this section, we describe a method to automatically identify semantically appropriate extraction patterns for use with the sentence classifier.",
        "In previous work (Patwardhan and Riloff, 2006), we introduced a metric called semantic affinity which was used to automatically assign event roles to extraction patterns.",
        "Semantic affinity measures the tendency of a pattern to extract noun phrases that belong to a specific set of semantic categories.",
        "To use this metric for information extraction, a mapping must be defined between semantic categories and the event roles that are relevant to the IE task.",
        "For example, one role in the terrorism domain is physical target, which refers to physical objects that are the target of an attack.",
        "Most physical targets fall into one of two general semantic categories: building or vehicle.",
        "Consequently, we define the mapping \"Target – building, ve-hicle\".",
        "Similarly, we might define the mapping \"Victim – human, animal, plant\" to characterize possible victims of disease outbreaks.",
        "Each semantic category must be mapped to a single event role.",
        "This is a limitation of our approach for domains where multiple roles can be filled by the same class of fillers.",
        "However, sometimes a general semantic class can be partitioned into subclasses that are associated with different roles.",
        "For example, in the terrorism domain, both perpetrators and victims belong to the general semantic class HuMAN.",
        "But we used the subclasses TERRORiST-HuMAN, which represents likely perpetrator words (e.g., \"terrorist\", \"guerrilla\", and \"gunman\") and civilian-human, which represents ordinary people (e.g., \"photogra-pher\",\"rancher\", and \"tourist\"), in order to generate different semantic affinity estimates for the perpetrator and victim roles.",
        "To determine the semantic category of a noun, we use the Sundance parser (Riloff and Phillips, 2004), which contains a dictionary of words that have semantic category labels.",
        "Alternatively, a resource such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) could be used to obtain this information.",
        "All semantic categories that cannot be mapped to a relevant event role are mapped to a special Other role.",
        "To estimate the semantic affinity of a pattern p for an event role rk, the system computes f(p, rk), which is the number of pattern p's extractions that have a head noun belonging to a semantic category mapped to r .",
        "These frequency counts are obtained by applying each pattern to the training corpus and collecting its extractions.",
        "The semantic affinity of a pattern p with respect to an event role r is formally defined as:",
        "where R is the set of event roles {n, r2,..., r|R|}.",
        "Semantic affinity is essentially the probability that a phrase extracted by pattern p will be a semantically appropriate filler for role rk, weighted by the log of the frequency.",
        "Note that it is possible for a pattern to have a semantic affinity for multiple event roles.",

        "Then for each event role, we rank the patterns based on their semantic affinity for that role.",
        "Figure 2 shows the 10 patterns with the highest semantic affinity scores for 4 event roles.",
        "In the terrorism domain, we show patterns that extract weapons andperpetrator organizations (PerpOrg).",
        "In the disease outbreaks domain, we show patterns that extract diseases and victims.",

        "The portion in brackets (between < and >) is extracted, and the other words must match the surrounding context.",
        "In some cases, all of the matched words are extracted (e.g., \"<# birds>\").",

        "This evaluation is not perfect for two reasons: (1) answer key strings do not always appear in relevant sentences., and (2) some arguably relevant sentences may not contain an answer key string (e.g., they may contain a pronoun that refers to the answer, but the pronoun itself is not the desired extraction).",
        "However, judging the relevance of sentences without relying on answer keys is also tricky, so we decided that this approach was probably good enough to get a reasonable assessment of the classifier.",
        "Using this criterion, 17% of the sentences in the terrorism articles are relevant, and 28% of the sentences in the disease outbreaks articles are relevant.",
        "Table 1 shows the accuracy, recall, precision, and F scores of the SVM classifiers after each self-training iteration.",
        "The classifiers generated after the third iteration were used in our IE experiments.",
        "The final accuracy is 82% in the terrorism domain, and 63% for the disease outbreaks domain.",
        "The precision on irrelevant sentences is high in both domains, but the precision on relevant sentences is relatively weak.",
        "Despite this, we will show in Section 6.3 that the classifier is effective for the IE task.",
        "The reason why the classifier improves IE performance is because it favorably alters the proportion of relevant sentences that are passed along to the IE system.",
        "For example, an analysis of the tuning set shows that removing the sentences deemed to be irrelevant by the classifier increases the proportion of relevant sentences from 17% to 46% in the terrorism domain, and from 28% to 41% in the disease outbreaks domain.",
        "We will also see in Section 6.3 that IE recall only drops a little when the sentence classifier is used, despite the fact that its recall on relevant sentences is only 63% in terrorism and 72% for disease outbreaks.",
        "One possible explanation is that the answer keys often contain multiple acceptable answer strings (e.g., \"John Kennedy\" and \"JFK\" might both be acceptable answers).",
        "On average, the answer keys contain approximately 1.64 acceptable strings per answer in the terrorism domain, and 1.77 acceptable strings per answer in the disease outbreaks domain.",
        "Thus, even if the sentence classifier discards some relevant sentences, an equally acceptable answer may be found in a different sentence.",

        "This demonstrates that our sentence classifier is having the desired effect.",
        "However, observe that the precision gain comes with some loss in recall points.",
        "Clearly, this drop in recall is due to the answers embedded inside relevant sentences incorrectly classified as irrelevant.",

        "Thus, if we compare each Rel row with the Sel row immediately below it, we see the effect of loosening the reins on the Primary patterns (the Secondary patterns are still restricted to the relevant sentences).",

        "In this work, we described an information extraction system based on a relevant sentence classifier and extraction patterns learned using a semantic affinity metric.",
        "The sentence classifier was self-trained using only relevant and irrelevant documents plus a handful of seed extraction patterns.",
        "We showed that separating the task of relevant region identification from that of pattern extraction can be effective for information extraction.",
        "In addition, we observed that the use of a relevant sentence classifier is beneficial for an IE system.",
        "There are several avenues that need to be explored for future work.",
        "First, it would be interesting to see if the use of richer features can improve classifier performance, and if that in turn improves the performance of the IE system.",
        "We would also like to experiment with different region sizes and study their effect on information extraction.",
        "Finally, other techniques for learning semantically appropriate extraction patterns could be investigated."
