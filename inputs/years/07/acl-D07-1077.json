        "In reordering approaches, sentences in the source language are first parsed, for example using a Treebank-trained parser.",
        "A series of transformations is then applied to the resulting parse tree, with the goal of transforming the source language sentence into a word order that is closer to that of the target language.",
        "The reordering process is used to prepro-cess both the training and test data used within an existing SMT system.",

        "Figure 1 gives an example illustrating some of the differences in word order between the two languages.",

        "As exemplified by this sentence, Chinese differs from English in several important respects: for example, relative clauses appear before the noun being modified; prepositional phrases often appear before the head they modify; and so on.",
        "It can be seen that some significant reordering of the input is required to produce a good English translation.",

        "More recently developed hierarchical systems (e.g., (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Chiang, 2005; Marcu et al., 2006)) may be better equipped to deal with reordering of this type; however, in this example they would effectively have to first identify the span of the relative clause, and then move it into the correct position, without any explicit representation of the source language syntax.",

        "(2006) make use of a parser in the target language, i.e., English).",

        "However, the results in Table 6 did not settle our question: the reordered system performed worse than the baseline on unre-ordered data, while the baseline system performed worse than the reordered system on reordered data, both of which can be explained by the mismatched conditions between training and testing.",

        "In this paper, we described a set of syntactic reordering rules that exploit systematic differences between Chinese and English word order to transform Chinese sentences to be much closer to English in terms of their word order.",
        "We evaluated the reordering approach within the MOSES phrase-based SMT system (Koehn et al., 2007).",
        "The reordering approach improved the BLEU score for the MOSES system data.",
        "Our manual evaluation of the reordering accuracy indicated that the reordering approach is helpful at improving the translation quality despite relatively frequent reordering errors.",
        "The reordering approach even achieved a 0.62 gain in BLEU score when only the test data are reordered.",
        "An important category we examined but did not reorder was clauses of type IP, which generally corresponds to declarative sentences in Chinese.",
        "Sentences of this form have quite similar top-level constituent ordering to English: both follow SVO (subject-verb-object) order.",
        "There are several special cases in which English and Chinese differ, the most notable being the topicalization of objects or temporal and locative noun phrases (which function as adverbial phrases).",
        "We did not try to restore them to the canonical order for several reasons.",
        "First, top-icalization of temporal and locative phrases happens in English as well.",
        "For example, \"In Israel yesterday, an explosion killed one person and injured twelve\" is a perfectly acceptable English sentence.",
        "Second, the parser's performance on special constructions is likely to be poor, resulting in frequent reordering errors.",
        "Third, special constructions that do not occur often in the data are less likely to have a significant impact on the translation performance.",
        "Thus our strategy has been to find reordering rules for syntactic categories that are common in the data and systematically different between the two languages.",
        "In our experiments, the phrase-based MT system uses an un-lexicalized reordering model, which might make the effects of the syntactic reordering method more pronounced.",
        "However, in an early experiment submitted to the official NIST 2006 MT evaluation, the reordered system also improved the BLEU score substantially (by 1.34 on NIST 2006 data) over a phrase-based MT system with lexical-ized reordering models (Koehn et al., 2005).",
        "The same set of reordering rules in the experimental setting in the current paper achieve a 1.82 BLEU improvement on the same data set, which is comparable to the 1.34 gain for the lexicalized system.",
        "We plan to output reordered lattices in the future, so that the approach would be more robust to errors made during parsing/reordering."
