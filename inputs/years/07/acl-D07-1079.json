        "By contrast, explicit syntax approaches seek to directly model the relations learned from parsed data, including models between source trees and target trees (Gildea, 2003; Eisner, 2003; Melamed, 2004; Cowan et al., 2006), source trees and target strings (Quirk et al., 2005; Huang et al., 2006), or source strings and target trees (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Galley et al., 2004).",
        "It is unclear which of these important pursuits will best explain human translation data, as each has advantages and disadvantages.",
        "A strength of phrase models is that they can acquire all phrase pairs consistent with computed word alignments, snap those phrases together easily by concatenation, and reorder them under several cost models.",
        "An advantage of syntax-based models is that outputs tend to be syntactically well-formed, with reordering influenced by syntactic context and function words introduced to serve specific syntactic purposes.",
        "A great number of MT models have been recently proposed, and other papers have gone over the expressive advantages of syntax-based approaches.",
        "But it is rare to see an in-depth, quantitative study of strengths and weaknesses of particular models with respect to each other.",
        "This is important for a scientific understanding of how these models work in practice.",
        "Our main novel contribution is a comparison of phrase-based and syntax-based extraction methods and phrase pair coverage.",
        "We also add to the literature a new method of improving that coverage.",
        "Additionally, we do a careful study of several syntax-based extraction techniques, testing whether (and how much) they affect phrase pair coverage, and whether (and how much) they affect end-to-end MT accuracy.",
        "The MT accuracy tests are needed because we want to see the individual effects of particular techniques under the same testing conditions.",
        "For this comparison, we choose a previously established statistical phrase-based model (Och and Ney, 2004) and a previously established statistical string-to-tree model (Galley et al., 2004).",
        "These two models are chosen because they are the basis of two of the most successful systems in the NIST 2006 MT evaluation."
