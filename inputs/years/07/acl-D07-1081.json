        "Text categorization is a classical text information processing task which has been studied adequately (Sebastiani, 2002).",
        "A typical text categorization process usually involves these phases: document indexing, dimensionality reduction, classifier learning, classification and evaluation.",
        "The vector space model is frequently used for text representation (document indexing); dimensions of the learning space are called terms, or features in a general machine learning context.",
        "Term selection is often necessary because:",
        "• Many irrelevant terms have detrimental effect on categorization accuracy due to overfitting",
        "(Sebastiani, 2002).",
        "• Some text categorization tasks have many relevant but redundant features, which also hurt the categorization accuracy (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2004).",
        "• Considerations on computational cost:",
        "(i) Many sophisticated learning machines are very slow at high dimensionalities, such as LLSF (Yang and Chute, 1994) and SVMs.",
        "(ii) In Asian languages, the term set is often very large and redundant, which causes the learning and the predicting to be really slow.",
        "(iii) In some practical cases the computational resources (time or space) are restricted, such as hand-held devices, real-time applications and frequently retrained systems.",
        "(iv) Some deeper analysis or feature reconstruction techniques rely on matrix factorization (e.g. LSA based on SVD), which might be computationally intractable while the dimensionality is large.",
        "Sometimes an aggressive term selection might be needed particularly for (iii) and (iv).",
        "But it is notable that the dimensionality is not always directly connected to the computational cost; this issue will be touched on in Section 6.",
        "Although we have many general feature selection techniques, the domain specified ones are preferred (Guyon and Elis-seeff, 2003).",
        "Another reason for ad hoc term selection techniques is that many other pattern classification tasks has no sparseness problem (in this study the sparseness means a sample vector has few nonzero elements, but not the high-dimensional learning space has few training samples).",
        "As a basic motivation of this study, we hypothesize that the low accuracy at low dimensionalities is mainly due to the sparseness problem.",
        "Many term selection techniques were presented and some of them have been experimentally tested to be high-performing, such as Information Gain, %(Yang and Pedersen, 1997; Rogati and Yang, 2002) and Bi-Normal Separation (Forman, 2003).",
        "Everyone of them adopt a criterion scoring and ranking the terms; for a target dimensionality d, the term selection is simply done by picking out the top-d terms from the ranked term set.",
        "These high performing criteria have a common characteristic – both discrim-inability and coverage are implicitly considered.",
        "• discriminability: how unbalanced is the distribution of the term among the categories.",
        "• coverage: how many documents does the term occur in.",
        "(Borrowing the terminologies from document indexing, we can say the specificity of a term set corresponds to the discriminability of each term, and the exhaustivity of a term set corresponds to the coverage of each term.)",
        "The main difference among these criteria is to what extent the discriminability is emphasized or the coverage is emphasized.",
        "For instance, empirically IG prefers high frequency terms more than % does, which means IG emphasizes the coverage more than % does.",
        "The problem is, these criteria are nonparametric and do the same ranking for any target dimensionality.",
        "Small term sets meet the specificity-exhaustivity dilemma.",
        "If really the sparseness is the main reason of the low performance of a small term set, the specificity should be moderately sacrificed to improve the exhaustivity for a small term set; that is to say, the term selection criterion should consider coverage more than discriminability.",
        "Contrariwise, coverage could be less considered for a large term set, because we need worry little about the sparseness problem and the computational cost might decrease.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the document collections used in this study, as well as other experiment settings; Section 3 investigates the relation between sparseness (measured by average vector length) and categorization accuracy; Section 4 explains the basic idea of scalable term selection and proposed a potential approach; Section 5 carries out experiments to evaluate the approach, during which some empirical rules are observed to complete the approach; Section 6 makes some further observations and discussions based on Section 5; Section 7 gives a concluding remark."
