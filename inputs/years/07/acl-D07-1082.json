        "Word sense ambiguity is a major obstacle to accurate information extraction, summarization, and machine translation (Ide and Veronis, 1998).",
        "In recent years, a variety of techniques for machine learning algorithms have demonstrated remarkable performance for automated word sense disambiguation (WSD) (Chan and Ng, 2006; Dagan et.",
        "al., 2006; Xue et.",
        "al., 2006; Kohomban and Lee.",
        "2005; Dang and Palmer, 2005), when enough labeled training data is available.",
        "However, creating a large sense-tagged corpus is very expensive and time-consuming, because these data have to be annotated by human experts.",
        "Among the techniques to solve the knowledge bottleneck problem, active learning is a promising way (Lewis and Gale, 1994; McCallum and Ni-gram, 1998).",
        "The purpose of active learning is to minimize the amount of human labeling effort by having the system automatically select for human annotation the most informative unannotated case.",
        "In real-world data, the distribution of the senses of a word is often very skewed.",
        "Some studies reported that simply selecting the predominant sense provides superior performance, when a highly skewed sense distribution and insufficient context exist (Hoste et al., 2001; McCarthy et.",
        "al., 2004).",
        "The data set is imbalanced when at least one of the senses is heavily underrepresented compared to the other senses.",
        "In general, a WSD classifier is designed to optimize overall accuracy without taking into account the class imbalance distribution in a real-world data set.",
        "The result is that the classifier induced from imbalanced data tends to over-fit the predominant class and to ignore small classes (Japkowicz and Stephen, 2002).",
        "Recently, much work has been done in addressing the class imbalance problem, reporting that resampling methods such as oversampling and under-sampling are useful in supervised learning with imbalanced data sets to induce more effective classifiers (Estabrooks et al., 2004; Zhou and Liu, 2006).",
        "In general framework of active learning, the learner (i.e. supervised classifier) is formed by using supervised learning algorithms.",
        "To date, however, no-one has studied the effects of oversampling and under-sampling on active learning methods.",
        "In this paper, we study active learning with resampling methods addressing the class imbalance problem for WSD.",
        "It is noteworthy that neither of these techniques need modify the architecture or learning algorithm, making them very easy to use and extend to other domains.",
        "Another problem in active learning is knowing when to stop the process.",
        "We address this problem in this paper, and discuss how to form the final classifier for use.",
        "This is a problem of estimation of classifier effectiveness (Lewis and Gale, 1994).",
        "Because it is difficult to know when the classifier reaches maximum effectiveness, previous work used a simple stopping condition when the training set reaches desirable size.",
        "However, in fact it is almost impossible to predefine an appropriate size of desirable training data for inducing the most effective classifier.",
        "To solve the problem, we consider the problem of estimation of classifier effectiveness as a second task of estimating classifier confidence.",
        "This paper adopts two strategies: max-confidence and min-error, and suggests a prediction solution by considering max-confidence as the upper bound and min-error as the lower bound for the stopping conditions."

        "The ability of the active learner can be referred to as selective sampling, of which two major schemes exist: uncertainty sampling and committee-based sampling.",
        "The former method, for example proposed by Lewis and Gale (1994), is to use only one classifier to identify unlabeled examples on which the classifier is least confident.",
        "The latter method (McCallum and Nigam, 1998) generates a committee of classifiers (always more than two classifiers) and selects the next unlabeled example by the principle of maximal disagreement among these classifiers.",
        "With selective sampling, the size of the training data can be significantly reduced for text classification (Lewis and Gale, 1994; McCallum and Nigam, 1998), and word sense disambiguation (Chen, et al.",
        "2006).",
        "A method similar to committee-based sampling is co-testing proposed by Muslea et al.",
        "(2000), which trains two learners individually on two compatible and uncorrelated views that should be able to reach the same classification accuracy.",
        "In practice, however, these conditions of view selection are difficult to meet in real-world word sense disambiguation tasks.",
        "Recently, much work has been done on the class imbalance problem.",
        "The well-known approach is resampling, in which some training material is duplicated.",
        "Two types of popular resampling methods exist for addressing the class imbalance problem: oversampling and under-sampling.",
        "The basic idea of resampling methods is to change the training data distribution and make the data more balanced.",
        "It works ok in supervised learning, but has not been tested in active learning.",
        "Previous work reports that cost-sensitive learning is a good solution to the class imbalance problem (Weiss, 2004).",
        "In practice, for WSD, the costs of various senses of a disambiguated word are unequal and unknown, and they are difficult to evaluate in the process of learning.",
        "In recent years, there have been attempts to apply active learning for word sense disambiguation (Chen et al., 2006).",

        "Under-sampling is a popular method in addressing the class imbalance problem by changing the training data distribution by removing some exemplars of the majority class at random.",
        "Some previous work reported that under-sampling is effective in learning on large imbalanced data sets (Japkowicz and Stephen, 2002).",
        "However, as under-sampling removes some potentially useful training samples, it could cause negative effects on the classifier performance.",
        "One-sided sampling is a method similar to under-sampling, in which redundant and borderline training examples are identified and removed from training data (Kubat and Matwin, 1997).",
        "Kuban and Matwin reported that one-sided sampling is effective in learning with two-class large imbalanced data sets.",
        "However, the relative computational cost of one-sided sampling in active learning is very high, because sampling computations must be implemented for each learning iteration.",
        "Our primitive experimental results show that, in the multi-class problem of WSD, one-sided sampling degrades the performance of active learning.",
        "And due to the high computation complexity of onesided sampling, we use random under-sampling in our comparison experiments instead.",
        "To control the degree of change of the training data distribution, the ratio of examples from the majority and the minority class after removal from the majority class is called the removal rate (Jo and Japkowicz, 2004).",
        "If the removal rate is 1.0, then under-sampling methods build data sets with complete class balance.",
        "However, it was reported previously that perfect balance is not always the optimal rate (Estabrooks et al., 2004).",
        "In our comparison experiments, we set the removal rate for under-sampling to 0.8, since some cases have 0.8 as the optimal rate reported in (Estabrooks et al., 2004).",
        "Over-sampling is also a popular method in addressing the class imbalance problem by resampling the small class until it contains as many examples as the large one.",
        "In contrast to under-sampling, oversampling is the process of adding examples to the minority class, and is accomplished by random sampling and duplication.",
        "Because the process of oversampling involves making exact copies of examples, it usually increases the training cost and may lead to overfit-ting.",
        "There is a recent variant of oversampling named SMOTE (Chawla et al., 2002) which is a synthetic minority oversampling technique.",
        "The authors reported that a combination of SMOTE and under-sampling can achieve better classifier performance in ROC space than only under-sampling the majority class.",
        "In our comparison experiments, we use over-sampling, measured by a resampling rate called the addition rate (Jo and Japkowicz, 2004) that indicates the number of examples that should be added into the minority class.",
        "The addition rate for oversampling is also set to 0.8 in our experiments.",
        "While oversampling decreases the between-class imbalance, it increases the within-class imbalance (Jo and Japkowicz, 2004) because of the increase of exact copies of examples at random.",
        "To alleviate this within-class imbalance problem, we propose a bootstrap-based oversampling method (BootOS) that uses a bootstrap resampling technique in the process of over-sampling.",
        "Bootstrapping, explained below, is a resampling technique similar to jackknifing.",
        "There are two reasons for choosing a bootstrap method as resampling technique in the process of over-sampling.",
        "First, using a bootstrap set can avoid exactly copying samples in the minority class.",
        "Second, the bootstrap method may give a smoothing of the distribution of the training samples (Hamamoto et al.",
        ", 1997), which can alleviate the within-class imbalance problem cased by over-sampling.",
        "To generate the bootstrap set, we use a well-known bootstrap technique proposed by Hama-moto et al.",

        "In the following experiments, the entropy threshold used in max-confidence strategy is set to 0.001, and the accuracy threshold used in min-error strategy is set to 0.9.",
        "In Table 2, the column \"Size\"\" stands for the size of unlabeled data set of corresponding noun word used in active learning.",
        "There are two columns for each stopping condition: the left column \"num\" presents number of learned instances and the right column \"%\" presents its percentage over all data when the corresponding stopping condition is met.",
        "As shown in Table 2, the min-error strategy based on feedback of human annotator is very close to the ideal method.",
        "Therefore, when comparing to ideal stopping condition, min-error strategy is a good choice as stopping condition for active learning.",
        "It is important to note that the min-error method does not need more additional computational costs, it only depends upon the feedback of human annotator when labeling the chosen unlabeled samples.",
        "From experimental results, we can see that max-confidence strategy is worse than min-error method.",
        "However, we believe that the entropy of each unlabeled sample is a good signal to stop active learning.",
        "So we suggest that there may be a good prediction solution in which the min-error strategy is used as the lower-bound of stopping condition, and max-confidence strategy as the upper-bound of stopping condition for active learning."

        "As discussed above, finding more instances for infrequent senses at the earlier stages of active learning is very significant in making the corpus richer, meaning less effort for human labeling.",
        "In practice, another way to learn more instances for infrequent senses is to first build a training data set by active learning or by human efforts, and then build a supervised classifier to find more instances for infrequent sense.",
        "However, it is interesting to know how much initial training data is enough for this task, and how much human labeling efforts could be saved.",
        "From experimental results, we found that among these chosen unlabeled instances by active learner, some instances are informative samples helpful for improving classification performance, and other instances are borderline samples which are unreliable because even a small amount of noise can lead the sample to the wrong side of the decision boundary.",
        "The removal of these borderline samples might improve the performance of active learning.",
        "The proposed prediction solution based on max-confidence and min-error strategies is a coarse framework.",
        "To predict when to stop active learning procedure, it is logical to consider the changes of accuracy performance of the classifier as a signal to stop the learning iteration.",
        "In other words, during the range predicted by the proposed solution, if the change of accuracy performance of the learner (classifier) is very small, we could assume that the current classifier has reached maximum effectiveness."

        "In this paper, we consider the class imbalance problem in WSD tasks, and analyze the effect of resampling techniques including oversampling and under-sampling in active learning.",

        "Under-sampling causes negative effect on active learning.",
        "A new oversampling method named BootOS based on bootstrap technique is proposed to alleviate the within-class imbalance problem of over-sampling, and works better than ordinary oversampling in active learning for WSD.",
        "It is noteworthy that none of these techniques require to modify the architecture or learning algorithm; therefore, they are very easy to use and extend to other applications.",
        "To predict when to stop active learning, we adopt two strategies including max-confidence and min-error as stopping conditions.",
        "According to our experimental results, we suggest a prediction solution by considering max-confidence as the upper bound and min-error as the lower bound of stopping conditions for active learning.",
