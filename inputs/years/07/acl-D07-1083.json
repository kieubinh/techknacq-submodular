        "Structured output learning (SOL) methods, which attempt to optimize an interdependent output space globally, are important methodologies for certain natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as part-of-speech tagging, syntactic chunking (Chunking) and named entity recognition (NER), which are also referred to as sequence labeling tasks.",
        "When we consider the nature of these sequence labeling tasks, a semi-supervised approach appears to be more natural and appropriate.",
        "This is because the number of features and parameters typically become extremely large, and labeled examples can only sparsely cover the parameter space, even if thousands of labeled examples are available.",
        "In fact, many attempts have recently been made to develop semi-supervised SOL methods (Zhu et al., 2003; Li and McCallum, 2005; Altun et al., 2005; Jiao et al., 2006; Brefeld and",
        "Scheffer, 2006).",
        "With the generative approach, we can easily incorporate unlabeled data into probabilistic models with the help of expectation-maximization (EM) algorithms (Dempster et al., 1977).",
        "For example, the Baum-Welch algorithm is a well-known algorithm for training a hidden Markov model (HMM) of sequence learning.",
        "Generally, with sequence learning tasks such as NER and Chunking, we cannot expect to obtain better performance than that obtained using discriminative approaches in supervised learning settings.",
        "In contrast to the generative approach, with the discriminative approach, it is not obvious how un-labeled training data can be naturally incorporated into a discriminative training criterion.",
        "For example, the effect of unlabeled data will be eliminated from the objective function if the unlabeled data is directly used in traditional i.i.d.",
        "conditional-probability models.",
        "Nevertheless, several attempts have recently been made to incorporate unlabeled data in the discriminative approach.",
        "An approach based on pairwise similarities, which encourage nearby data points to have the same class label, has been proposed as a way of incorporating unlabeled data discriminatively (Zhu et al., 2003; Altun et al., approach generally requires joint inference over the whole data set for prediction, which is not practical as regards the large data sets used for standard sequence labeling tasks in NLP.",
        "Another discriminative approach to semi-supervised SOL involves the incorporation of an entropy regularizer (Grandvalet and Bengio, 2004).",
        "Semi-supervised conditional random fields (CRFs) based on a minimum entropy regularizer (SS-CRF-MER) have been proposed in (Jiao et al., 2006).",
        "With this approach, the parameter is estimated to maximize the likelihood of labeled data and the negative conditional entropy of unlabeled data.",
        "Therefore, the structured predictor is trained to separate unlabeled data well under the entropy criterion by parameter estimation.",
        "In contrast to these previous studies, this paper proposes a semi-supervised SOL framework based on a hybrid generative and discriminative approach.",
        "A hybrid approach was first proposed in a supervised learning setting (Raina et al., 2003) for text classification.",
        "(Fujino et al., 2005) have developed a semi-supervised approach by discriminatively combining a supervised classifier with generative models that incorporate unlabeled data.",
        "We extend this framework to the structured output domain, specifically for sequence labeling tasks.",
        "Moreover, we re-formalize the objective function to allow the incorporation of discriminative models (structured predictors) trained from labeled data, since the original framework only considers the combination of generative classifiers.",
        "As a result, our hybrid model can significantly improve on the state-of-the-art performance obtained with supervised SOL methods, such as CRFs, even if a large amount of labeled data is available, as shown in our experiments on CoNLLaddition, compared with SS-CRF-MER, our hybrid model has several good characteristics including a low calculation cost and a robust optimization in terms of a sensitiveness of hyper-parameters.",
        "This is described in detail in Section 5.3."

      "text": [
        "This paper focuses solely on sequence labeling tasks, such as named entity recognition (NER) and syntactic chunking (Chunking), as SOL problems.",
        "Thus, let x=(x1}..., xs) be an input sequence, and y=(y0,..., ys+i) be a particular output sequence, where yo and ys+i are special fixed labels that represent the beginning and end of a sequence.",
        "As regards supervised sequence learning, CRFs are recently introduced methods that constitute flexible and powerful models for structured predictors based on undirected graphical models that have been globally conditioned on a set of inputs (Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "Let X be a parameter vector and f (ys-1,ys, x) be a (local) feature vector obtained from the corresponding position s given x. CRFs define the conditional probability, p(y\\x), as being proportional to a product of potential functions on the cliques.",
        "That is, p(y\\x) on a (linear-chain) CRF can be defined as follows:",
        "p(y\\x; X) = Zx)Ilexp(X • f (Vs-i,ys, x)).",
        "Z(x) = E„ Ftf+i exP(X • f (ys-i,ys, x)) is a normalization factor over all output values, Y, and is also known as the partition function.",
        "For parameter estimation (training), given labeled data V\\ = {(xk, yk)}K=1, the Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) parameter estimation, namely maximizing logp(X\\Vi), is now the most widely used CRF training criterion.",
        "Thus, we maximize the following objective function to obtain optimal X:",
        "where fs is an abbreviation of f(ys-i, ys, x) and p(X) is a prior probability distribution of X.",
        "A gradient-based optimization algorithm such as L-BFGS (Liu and Nocedal, 1989) is widely used for maximizing Equation (1).",
        "The gradient of Equation (1) can be written as follows:",
        "-J2 EP(y\\xk-,x)[J2 f >\\ + V log p(X).",
        "Calculating Ep(y\\x^X) as well as the partition function Z(x) is not always tractable.",
        "However, for linear-chain CRFs, a dynamic programming algorithm similar in nature to the forward-backward algorithm in HMMs has already been developed for an efficient calculation (Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "For prediction, the most probable output, that is, y = argmaxy^y p(y\\x; X), can be efficiently obtained by using the Viterbi algorithm.",
        "3 Hybrid Generative and Discriminative Approach to Semi-Supervised SOL",
        "In this section, we describe our formulation of a hybrid approach to SOL and a parameter estimation method for sequence predictors.",
        "We assume that we have a set of labeled and unlabeled data, D = {Vh Vu}, where Vl = {(xn, yn)}%=i and",
        "Du = {xm}m=1.",
        "Let us assume that we have I-units of discriminative models, pD, and J-units of generative models, pG.",
        "Our hybrid model for a structured predictor is designed by the discriminative combination of several joint probability densities of x and y, p(x, y).",
        "That is, the posterior probability of our hybrid model is defined by providing the log-values of p(x, y) as the features of a log-linear model, such that:",
        "Here, r = {{Yi}j=i, {yrepresents the discriminative combination weight of each model where S [0,1].",
        "Moreover, A={Xi}j=1 and 0= {0j }J=1 represent model parameters of individual models estimated from labeled and unlabeled data, respectively.",
        "Using pD(x, y) = pD(y\\x)pD(x),we can derive the third line from the second line, where pD(x; Xi)Yi for all i are canceled out.",
        "Thus, our hybrid model is constructed by combining discriminative models, piD(y\\ x; Xi), with generative models, pf(x, y; 0j).",
        "Hereafter, let us assume that our hybrid model consists of CRFs for discriminative models, pD, and HMMs for generative models, pG, shown in Equation (2), since this paper focuses solely on sequence modeling.",
        "For HMMs, we consider a first order HMM defined in the following equation:",
        "Qys+i,xs+i = 1.",
        "It can be seen that the formalization in the loglinear combination of our hybrid model is very similar to that of LOP-CRFs (Smith et al., 2005).",
        "In fact, if we only use a combination of discriminative models (CRFs), which is equivalent to Yj = 0 for all j, we obtain essentially the same objective function as that of the LOP-CRFs.",
        "Thus, our framework can also be seen as an extension of LOP-CRFs that enables us to incorporate unlabeled data.",
        "For estimating the parameter r, let us assume that we already have discriminatively trained models on labeled data, pD(y\\x; Aj).",
        "We maximize the following objective function for estimating parameter r under a fixed 0 :",
        "where p(T) is a prior probability distribution of r.",
        "The value of r providing a global maximum of £Hys°L(r\\0) is guaranteed under an arbitrary fixed value in the 0 domain, since CHySOL(T\\0) is a concave function of r. Thus, we can easily maximize Equation (3) by using a gradient-based optimization algorithm such as (bound constrained) L-BFGS (Liu andNocedal, 1989).",
        "We cannot directly incorporate unlabeled data for discriminative training such as Equation (3) since the correct outputs y for unlabeled data are unknown.",
        "On the other hand, generative approaches can easily deal with unlabeled data as incomplete data (data with missing variable y) by using a mixture model.",
        "A well-known way to achieve this incorporation is to maximize the log likelihood of un-labeled data with respect to the marginal distribution of generative models as",
        "£(0) = J2iogJ2 p(xm, y; O).",
        "In fact, (Nigam et al., 2000) have reported that using unlabeled data with a mixture model can improve the text classification performance.",
        "According to Bayes' rule, p(y\\x; O) oc p(x, y; O), the discriminant functions of generative classifiers are provided by generative models p(x, y; O).",
        "Therefore, we can regard L(O) as the logarithm of the sum of discriminant functions for all missing variables y of unlabeled data.",
        "Following this view, we can directly incorporate unlabeled data into our hybrid model by maximizing the and 9ysXs represent the transition probability between states ys-i and ys and the symbol emission probability of the s-th position of the corresponding input sequence, respectively, where discriminant functions g of our hybrid model in the same way as for a mixture model as explained above.",
        "Thus, we maximize the following objective function for estimating the model parameters 0 for generative models ofunlabeled data:",
        "where p(0) is a prior probability distribution of 0.",
        "Here, the discriminant function g of output y given input x in our hybrid model can be obtained by the numerator on the third line of Equation (2), since the denominator does not affect the determination of y, that is,",
        "Under a fixed r, we can estimate the local maximum of G(0\\r) around the initialized value of 0 by an iterative computation such as the EM algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977).",
        "Let 0\" and 0' be estimates of 0 in the next and current steps, respectively.",
        "Using Jensen's inequality, log a < a – 1, we obtain a Q-function that satisfies the inequality such that",
        "+ log p(&\").",
        "Since Q(0', 0'; r) is independent of 0'', we can improve the value of G(0\\r) by computing 0'' to maximize Q(0'', 0'; r).",
        "We can obtain a 0 estimate by iteratively performing this update while G(0\\r) is hill climbing.",
        "As shown in Equation (5), R is used for estimating the parameter 0.",
        "The intuitive effect of maximizing Equation (4) is similar to performing 'soft-clustering'.",
        "That is, unlabeled data is clustered with respect to the R distribution, which also includes information about labeled data, under the constraint of generative model structures.",
        "According to our definition, the 0 and r estimations are mutually dependent.",
        "That is, the parameters of the hybrid model, r, should be estimated",
        "1.",
        "Given training set: Du = [xm}M=1 and",

        "using Equation (3) with a fixed 0, while the parameters of the generative models, 0, should be estimated using Equation (4) with a fixed r. As a solution to our parameter estimation, we search for the 0 and r that maximize £HySOL(r\\0) and G(0\\r) simultaneously.",
        "For this search, we compute and r by maximizing the objective functions shown in Equations (4) and (3) iteratively and alternately.",
        "We summarize the algorithm for estimating these model parameters in Figure 1.",
        "Note that during the r estimation (procedure 4.2 in Figure 1), r can be over-fitted to the labeled training data if we use the same labeled training data as used for the A estimation.",
        "There are several possible ways to reduce this over-fit.",
        "In this paper, we select one of the simplest; we divide the labeled training data Dl into two distinct sets V[ and V\".",
        "Then, V[ and Dl' are individually used for estimating A and r, respectively.",
        "In our experiments, we divide the labeled training data Vl so that 4/5 is used for V[ and the remaining 1/5 for V''.",
        "Let Nr(x) represent the denominator of Equation (2), that is the normalization factor of R. We can rearrange Equation (2) as follows:",
        "where ViDs represents the potential function of the s-th position of the sequence in the i-th CRF and VGS represents the probability of the s-th position in the j-th HMM, that is, ViDs = exp(Xi • f s) and VGS = 0ys-1 ,ysdys,xs, respectively.",
        "See the Appendix for the derivation of Equation (6) from Equation (2).",
        "2.",
        "Compute A, using D'.",
        "To estimate r(*+1), namely procedure 4.2 in Figure 1, we employ the derivatives with respect to Yiand Yj shown in Equation (6), which are the parameters of the discriminative and generative models, respectively.",
        "Thus, we obtain the following derivatives with respect to Yi:",
        "n n - ER(y\\xn;A,®,T)['^2 log VDS] .",
        "The first and second terms are constant during iterative procedure 4 in our optimization algorithm shown in Figure 1.",
        "Thus, we only need to calculate these values once at the beginning of procedure 4.",
        "Let as(y) and (3s(y) represent the forward and backward state costs at position s with output y for corresponding input x.",
        "Let Vs(y,y') represent the products of the total value of the transition cost between s – 1 and s with labels y and y' in the corresponding input sequence, that is, Vs(y,y') = Yli[VDs(y, y'Ylj [VGs(y, y')]Yj.",
        "The third term, which indicates the expectation of potential functions, can be rewritten in the form of a forward-backward algorithm, that is, where ZR(x) represents the partition function of our hybrid model, that is, ZR(x)=NR(x) Ui[Zi(x)]Yi.",
        "Hence, the calculation of derivatives with respect to Yi is tractable since we can incorporate the same forward-backward algorithm as that used in a standard CRF.",
        "Then, the derivatives with respect to Yj, which are the parameters of generative models, can be written as follows:",
        "G>LHySOL(r\\Q) d-yj = log pf (x», y»)-^2 ER(y\\xn.A:@r)^^2 log VGs] .",
        "Again, the second term, which indicates the expectation of transition probabilities and symbol emission probabilities, can be rewritten in the form of a forward-backward algorithm in the same manner as Y%, where the only difference is that ViDs is substituted by VGs in Equation (7).",
        "To estimate 0(*+1), which is procedure 4.1 in Figure 1, the same forward-backward algorithm as used in standard HMMs is available since the form of our Q-function shown in Equation (5) is the same as that of standard HMMs.",
        "The only difference is that our method uses marginal probabilities given by R instead of the p(x, y ; 0) of standard HMMs.",
        "Therefore, only a forward-backward algorithm is required for the efficient calculation of our parameter estimation process.",
        "Note that even though our hybrid model supports the use of a combination of several generative and discriminative models, we only need to calculate the forward-backward algorithm once for each sample during optimization procedures 4.1 and 4.2.",
        "This means that the required number of executions of the forward-backward algorithm for our parameter estimation is independent of the number of models used in the hybrid model.",
        "In addition, after training, we can easily merge all the parameter values in a single parameter vector.",
        "This means that we can simply employ the Viterbi-algorithm for evaluating unseen samples, as well as that of standard CRFs, without any additional cost."

        "Thus, our hybrid approach is more scalable for the size of unlabeled data, since HySOL only needs a standard forward-backward algorithm whose time complexity is O(LS).",
        "In fact, we still have a question as to whether SS-CRF-MER is really scalable in practical time for such a large amount of unlabeled data as used in our experiments, which is about 680 times larger than that of (Jiao et al., 2006).",
        "Scalability for unlabeled data will become really important in the future, as it will be natural to use millions or billions of unlabeled data for further improvement.",
        "Second, SS-CRF-MER has a sensitive hyper-parameter in the objective function, which controls the influence of the un-labeled data.",
        "In contrast, our objective function only has a hyper-parameter of prior distribution, which is widely used for standard MAP estimation.",
        "Moreover, the experimental results shown in Tables 3 and 4 indicate that HySOL is rather robust with respect to the hyper-parameter since we can obtain fairly good performance without a prior distribution.",
        "With respect to the performance of NER and Chunking tasks, the current best performance is reported in (Ando and Zhang, 2005), which we refer to as 'ASO-semi', as shown in Figures 5 and 6.",
        "ASO-semi also incorporates unlabeled data solely for the additional information in the same way as our method.",
