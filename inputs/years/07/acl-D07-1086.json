        "Billions of times every day, people around the world communicate with Internet search engines via a small text box on a web page.",
        "The user provides a sequence of words to the search engine, and the search engine interprets the query and tries to return web pages that not only contain the query tokens, but that are also somehow about the topic or idea that the query terms describe.",
        "Recent years have seen a widespread recognition that the user is indeed providing natural language text to the search engine; query tokens are not independent, unordered symbols to be matched on a web document but rather ordered words and phrases with syntactic relationships.",
        "For example, Zhai (1997) pointed out that indexing on single-word symbols is not able to distinguish a search for \"bank terminology\" from one for \"terminology bank.\"",
        "The reader can submit these queries to a current search engine to confirm that modern indexing does recognize the effect of token order on query meaning in some way.",
        "Accurately interpreting query semantics also depends on establishing relationships between the query tokens.",
        "For example, consider the query \"two man power saw.\"",
        "There are a number of possible interpretations of this query, and these can be expressed through a number of different segmentations or bracketings of the query terms:"

        "One simple way to make use of these interpretations in search would be to put quotation marks around the phrasal segments to require the search engine to only find pages with exact phrase matches.",
        "If, as seems likely, the searcher is seeking pages about the large, mechanically-powered two-man saws used by lumberjacks and sawyers to cut big trees, then the first segmentation is correct.",
        "Indeed, a phrasal search for \"two man power saw\" on Google does find the device of interest.",
        "So does the second interpretation, but along with other, less-relevant pages discussing competitions involving \"two-man handsaw, two-woman handsaw, power saw log bucking, etc.\"",
        "The top document returned for the third interpretation, meanwhile, describes a man on a rampage at a subway station with two cordless power saws, while the fourth interpretation finds pages about topics ranging from hockey's thrilling two-man power play advantage to the man power situation during the Second World War.",
        "Clearly, choosing the right segmentation means finding the right documents faster.",
        "Query segmentation can also help if insufficient pages are returned for the original query.",
        "A technique such as query substitution or expansion (Jones et al., 2006) can be employed using the segmented units.",
        "For example, we could replace the sexist \"two man\" modifier with the politically-correct \"two person\" phrase in order to find additional relevant documents.",
        "Without segmentation, expanding via the individual words \"two,\" \"man,\" \"power,\" or \"saw\" could produce less sensible results.",
        "In this paper, we propose a data-driven, machine-learned approach to query segmentation.",
        "Similar to previous segmentation approaches described in Section 2, we make a decision to segment or not to segment between each pair of tokens in the query.",
        "Unlike previous work, we view this as a classification task where the decision parameters are learned dis-criminatively from gold standard data.",

        "Section 4 describes our labelled data, as well as the specific tools used for our experiments.",

        "(2006) use MI between pairs of tokens as the sole factor in deciding on segmentation breaks.",
        "If the MI is above a threshold (optimized on a small training set), the pair of tokens is joined in a segment.",
        "Otherwise, a segmentation break is made.",
        "Query segmentation is related to the task of noun compound (NC) bracketing.",
        "NC bracketing determines the syntactic structure of an NC as expressed by a binary tree, or, equivalently, a binary bracketing (Nakov and Hearst, 2005a).",
        "Zhai (1997) first identified the importance of syntactic query/corpus parsing for information retrieval, but did not consider query segmentation itself.",
        "In principle, as N increases, the number of binary trees for an N-token compound is much greater than the 2N-1 possible segmentations.",
        "In practice, empirical NC research has focused on three-word compounds.",
        "The computational problem is thus deciding whether the three-word NC has a left or right-bracketing structure (Lauer, 1995).",
        "For the segmentation task, analysing a three-word NC requires deciding between four different segmentations.",
        "For example, there are two bracketings for \"used car parts,\" the left-bracketing \"[[used car] parts]\" and the right-bracketing \"[used [car parts]],\" while there are four segmentations, including the case where there is only one segment, \"[used car parts]\" and the base case where each token forms its own segment, \"[used] [car] [parts].\"",
        "Query segmentation thus naturally handles the case where the query consists of multiple, separate noun phrases that should not be analysed with a single binary tree.",
        "Despite the differences between the tasks, it is worth investigating whether the information that helps disambiguate left and right-bracketings can also be useful for segmentation.",
        "In particular, we explored many of the sources of information used by Nakov and Hearst (2005a), as well as several novel features that aid segmentation performance and should also prove useful for NC analysis researchers.",
        "Unlike all previous approaches that we are aware of, we apply our features in a flexible discriminative framework rather than a classification based on a vote or average of features.",
        "NC analysis has benefited from the recent trend of using web-derived features rather than corpus-based counts (Keller and Lapata, 2003).",
        "Lapata and Keller (2004) first used web-based co-occurrence counts for the bracketing of NCs.",
        "Recent innovations have been to use statistics \"beyond the N-gram,\" such as counting the number of web pages where a pair of words w, x participate in a genitive relationship (\"w's x\"), occur collapsed as a single phrase (\"wx\") (Nakov and Hearst, 2005a) or have a definite article as a left-boundary marker (\"the w x\") (Nicholson and Baldwin, 2006).",
        "We show strong performance gains when such features are employed for query segmentation.",
        "NC bracketing is part of a larger field of research on multiword expressions including general NC interpretation.",
        "NC interpretation explores not just the syntactic dependencies among compound constituents, but the semantics of the nominal relationships (Girju et al., 2005).",
        "Web-based statistics have also had an impact on these wider analysis tasks, including work on interpretation of verb nominalisa-tions (Nicholson and Baldwin, 2006) and NC coordination (Nakov and Hearst, 2005b)."

        "Ultimately, the mappings produced by these approaches were not as accurate as a simple formulation that creates a full query segmentation y as the combination of independent classification decisions made between each pair of tokens in the query.",
        "In the classification framework, the input is a query, x, a position in the query, i, where 0<i<N, and the output is a segmentation decision yes/no.",
        "The training set of segmented queries is converted into examples of decisions between tokens and learning is performed on this set.",

        "There are a number ofpossible indicators ofwhether a segmentation break occurs between a pair of tokens.",
        "Some of these features fire separately for each token x in our feature window, while others are defined over pairs or sets of tokens in the window.",
        "We first describe the features that are defined for the tokens around the decision boundary, xL0 and xR0, before describing how these same features are extended to longer phrases and other token pairs.",
        "Table 1 lists the binary features that fire if particular aspects of a token or pair of tokens are present.",
        "For example, one of the POS-tags features will fire if the pair's part-of-speech tags are DT JJ, another feature will fire if the position of the pair in the token is 2, etc.",
        "The two lexical features (for when the token is \"the\" and when the token is \"free\") fire separately for the left and right tokens around the decision boundary.",
        "They are designed to add discrimination for these common query words, motivated by examples in our training set.",
        "For example, in the training set, \"free\" often occurs in its own segment when it's on the left-hand-side of a decision boundary (e.g. \"free\" \"online\" ...), but may join into a larger segment when it's on the right-hand-side of a collocation (e.g. \"sulfite free\" or \"sugar free\").",
        "The classifier can use the feature weights to encourage or discourage segmentation in these specific situations.",
        "For statistical features, previous work (Section 2) suggests that the mutual information between the decision tokens xL0 and xR0 may be appropriate.",
        "The log of the pointwise mutual information (Church and Hanks, 1989) between the decision-boundary tokens xlo,xro is:",
        "This is equivalent to the sum: log C (xL0xR0) + log K – log C(xL0) – log C(xR0).",

        "Our initial ranking formulation (Section 3.1), for example, could learn a model that prefers segmentations with higher agreement, but still prefers any annotated segmentation to alternative, unobserved structures.",
        "As there is growing interest in making maximal use of annotation resources within discriminative learning techniques (Zaidan et al., 2007), developing a general empirical approach to learning from ambiguously-labelled examples would be both an important contribution to this trend and a potentially helpful technique in a number of NLP domains."

        "We have developed a novel approach to search query segmentation and evaluated this approach on actual user queries, reducing error by 56% over a recent comparison approach.",
        "Gains in performance were made possible by both leveraging recent progress in feature engineering for noun compound bracketing, as well as using a flexible, discriminative incorporation of association information, beyond the decision-boundary tokens.",
        "We have created and made available a set of manually-segmented user queries, and thus provided a new testing platform for other researchers in this area.",
        "Our initial formulation of query segmentation as a structured learning problem, and our leveraging of association statistics beyond the decision boundary, also provides powerful tools for noun compound bracketing researchers to both move beyond three-word compounds and to adopt discriminative feature weighting techniques.",
        "The positive results achieved on this important application should encourage further interdisciplinary collaboration between noun compound interpretation and information retrieval researchers.",
        "For example, analysing the semantics of multiword expressions may allow for more-focused query expansion; knowing to expand \"bank manager\" to include pages describing a \"manager of the bank,\" but not doing the same for non-compositional phrases like \"real estate\" or \"private investigator,\" requires exactly the kind of techniques being developed in the noun compound interpretation community.",
        "Thus for query expansion, as for query segmentation, work in natural language processing has the potential to make a real and immediate impact on search-engine technology.",

        "The next step in this research is to directly investigate how query segmentation affects search performance.",
        "For such an evaluation, we would need to know, for each possible segmentation (including no segmentation), the document retrieval performance.",
        "This could be the proportion of returned documents that are deemed to be relevant to the original query.",
        "Exactly such an evaluation was recently used by Ku-maran and Allan (2007) for the related task of query contraction.",
        "Of course, a dataset with queries and retrieval scores may serve for more than evaluation; it may provide the examples used by the learning module.",
        "That is, the parameters of the contraction or segmentation scoring function could be discrim-inatively set to optimize the retrieval of the training set queries.",
        "A unified framework for query contraction, segmentation, and expansion, all based on dis-criminatively optimizing retrieval performance, is a very appealing future research direction.",
        "Tn this framework, the size of the training sets would not be limited by human annotation resources, but by the number of queries for which retrieved-document relevance judgments are available.",
        "Generating more training examples would allow the use of more powerful, finer-grained lexical features for classification."
