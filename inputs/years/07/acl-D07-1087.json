        "Over the past decades much textual data has become available in electronic form.",
        "Many text types are inherently more or less structured, for example, classified advertisements for appartments, medical records, or logs of archaeological finds or zoological specimens collected during expeditions.",
        "Such documents consist of a number of shorter texts (or entries), each describing an individual object (e.g., an appartment, or an archaeological find) or event (e.g., a patient presenting to a health care provider).",
        "These descriptions in turn typically consist of different segments (or fields) which contain information of a specific type drawn from a more or less given inventory.",
        "Example (1), for instance, shows two descriptions of zoological specimens (a snake and three frogs) collected during an expedition.",
        "The descriptions contain different segments giving information about the specimens and the circumstances of their collection.",
        "For example, in the first description, Lep-tophis and ahaetulla refer, respectively, to the genus and species of the specimen, road to Overtoom mentions the place of collection, in bush above water encodes information about the biotope, in the process of eating Hyla minuta is a remark about the circumstances of collection, 16-V-1968 gives the collection date and RMNH15100 the registration number.",
        "(1) Leptophis ahaetulla, road to Overtoom, in bush",
        "Hyla minuta 1 $ 2 c?",
        "Las Claritas, 9-VI-1978 quaking near water 50 cm above water surface, near secondary vegetation, 200 m, M.S.",
        "Hoogmoed, RMNH",
        "Unfortunately, this inherent structure is rarely made explicit.",
        "While the different object or event descriptions might be indicated by additional white-space or other formatting means, as in the example above, the individual fields within a description are typically not marked in any way.",
        "However, knowledge of the inherent structure would be very beneficial for information extraction and retrieval.",
        "For instance, texts in their raw form only allow key word search.",
        "To retrieve all entries describing specimens of type Hyla minuta from a zoological field report, one can only search for occurrences of that string anywhere in the document.",
        "This can return false positives, such as the first description in (1) above, which does contain the string but is not about a Hyla minuta specimen but about a specimen of type Lep-tophis ahaetulla (the string Hyla minuta just happens to occur in the special remarks field).",
        "On the other hand, if the genus and species information in an entry was explicitly marked, it would be possible to query specifically for entries whose genus is Hyla and whose species is minuta, thus avoiding the retrieval of entries in which this string occurs in another ield.",
        "The task of automatically finding and labelling segments in object or event descriptions has been referred to as field segmentation (Grenager et al., 2005).",
        "It can be seen as a sequence labelling problem, where each text is viewed as a sequence of tokens and the aim is to assign each token a label indicating to what segment the token belongs (e.g., biotope or location).",
        "If training data in the form of texts annotated with segment information was readily available, the problem could be approached by training a sequence labeller in a supervised machine learning set-up.",
        "However, manually annotated data is rarely available.",
        "creating it from scratch is not only time consuming but usually also requires a certain amount of expert knowledge.",
        "Moreover, the sequence labeller has to be retrained for each new domain (e.g., natural history vs. archaeology) and possibly also each sub-domain (e.g., insects vs. mammals) due to the fact that the inventory of ields varies.",
        "Thus, fully supervised machine learning is not feasible for this task.",
        "In this paper, we explore two approaches which require no or only a very small amount of manually labelled training data.",
        "Both approaches exploit the fact that there are often resources derived from the original documents that can potentially be utilised to bootstrap a sequence labeller in the absence of labelled training data.",
        "It is common practice, for example, that information contained in (semi-structured) ield reports or medical records is manually entered into a database, usually in an attempt to make the data more accessible and easier to search.",
        "In such databases, each row corresponds to an entry in the original document (e.g., a zoological specimen) and the database columns correspond to the ields one would like to discern in the original document.",
        "Manually converting raw text documents into databases is a laborious task though, and it is rather common that the database covers only a small fraction of the objects described in the original texts.",
        "The research question we address in this paper is whether it is possible to bootstrap a domain-speciic ield segmentation system from an existing, manually created database for that domain.",
        "Such a system could then be applied to the remaining texts in that domain, which could then be segmented (semi-)automatically and possibly be added to the original database.",
        "A database does not make perfect training material for a ield segmenter though, as it is only derived from the original document and there are typically signiicant (and sometimes systematic) differences between the two data sources: First, while the ordering of the segments in a semi-structured text document is often not entirely ixed, some orderings are more likely than others.",
        "This information is lost in the derived databases.",
        "Second, the databases may contain information that is not normally present in the underlying text documents, for example information relating to the storage of an object in a collection.",
        "conversely, some of the details present in the texts might be omitted from the database, e.g., the special remarks field might be signiicantly shortened in the database.",
        "Third, pieces of information are frequently rewritten when entered in the database, in some cases these differences may be systematic, e.g., dates, person names, or registration numbers might be written in a different format.",
        "Also, ield boundaries in the text documents are sometimes indicated by punctuation, such as commas, and ields sometimes start with explicit key words, such as collector.",
        "Both of these features are missing from the database.",
        "Despite of this, these databases will provide certain clues about the structure and content of different segments in the text documents.",
        "We exploit this in two different ways: (i) by concatenating database ields to artiicially create annotated training data for a supervised machine learner, and (ii) by using the database to build language models for the ield segmentation task."

        "The main idea is to assign labels to trigrams in the sequence using a sliding window.",
        "Because each token, except the boundary tokens, is contained in three different trigrams (i.e., the one centred on the token to its left, the one centred on itself, and the one centred on the token to its right), each token gets three labels assigned to it, over which voting can be performed.",

        "We also implemented two post-processing rules: (i) turning the label other between two identical neighbouring labels into the surrounding labels, and (ii) labelling commas as other if the neighbouring labels are not identical.",
        "3.3 Supervised Learning from Automatically Generated Training Data",
        "Our first strategy was to automatically generate training data for a supervised machine learner from the database.",
        "since the rows in the database correspond to field book entries and the columns corresponds to the fields that we want to identify, training data can be obtained by concatenating the cells in each database row.",
        "The order of the fields in the field book entries is not fixed and this should also be reflected in the artificially generated training data.",
        "However, the field sequence is not entirely random, i.e., not all sequences are equally likely.",
        "If a small amount of manually annotated data is available, the field transition probabilities can be estimated from this, otherwise the best one can do is to assume uniform probabilities for all possible orderings.",
        "We experimented with both strategies, creating two different training sets, one in which the database cells were concatenated randomly with uniform probabilities, and another in which the cells were concatenated to reflect the field ordering probabilities estimated from ten entries in the manually labelled development set.",
        "When estimating the field transition probabilities, we computed a probability distribution over the initial fields of an entry as well as the conditional probability distributions of a field x following a field y for all seen segment pairs in the ten entries.",
        "To account for unobserved events, we used Laplace smoothing.",
        "The artificially created training data were then converted to a token-based representation in which each token corresponds to an instance to be labelled with the field to which it belongs.",
        "On the whole, we had just under 700,000 instances (i.e., tokens) in our training data.",
        "We implemented 107 features, falling in three classes:",
        "• the neighbouring tokens (in a window of 5 centering on the token in focus)",
        "• the typographic properties of the focus token (word vs. number, capitalisation, number of characters in the token etc.)",
        "• the tfidf weight of the focus token in its context with respect to each of the columns in the database (i.e., the fields)",
        "The tfidf-based features were computed for a window of three, centering on the token in focus.",
        "For all n-grams in this window covering the token in focus (i.e., the trigram, the two bigrams, and the unigram of the focus token), we calculated the tfidf similarity with the columns in the database, where the similarity between an n-gram U and a column colxis defined as:",
        "tfidfti,colx = tfti,colx log idfti",
        "The term frequency, tfti>colx is the number of occurrences of t j in colx divided by the number of occurrences of all n-grams of length n in colx (0 if the n-gram does not occur in the column).",
        "The inverse document frequency, idfti, is the number of all columns in the database divided by the number of columns containing tj.",
        "A high tfidf weight for a given n-gram in a given column means that it frequently occurs in that column but rarely in other columns, thus it is a good indicator for that column.",
        "The training data was then used to train a memory-based machine learner (TiMBL (Daele-mans et al., 2004), default settings, k = 3, numeric features declared) to determine which field each token belongs to.",
        "Our second approach combines language modelling and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (Rabiner, 1989).",
        "Hidden Markov Models have been in use for information extraction tasks for a long time.",
        "A probabilistic model is trained to assign a label, or state to each of a sequence of observations, where both labels and observations are expected to be sequentially correlated; hence the popularity of HMMs in natural language processing and information extraction.",
        "Recently, a large number of more sophisticated learning techniques have largely replaced HMMs for information extraction; however unlike most of those newer techniques, HMMs offer the advantage of having a well-established unsupervised training procedure: the Baum-Welch algorithm (Baum et al., 1970).",
        "Training a Hidden Markov Model, whether supervised or unsupervised, comes down to estimating three probability distributions.",
        "1.",
        "An initial state distribution n, which models the probability of the first observation of a sequence to have a certain label.",
        "2.",
        "A state-transition distribution A, modelling the conditional probability of being in a certain state s, given that the previous state was s'.",
        "3.",
        "A state-emission distribution B, which models the conditional probability of observing a certain object o given some state s.",
        "For information extraction tasks, the typical interpretation of an observation as referred to above, is that of a token, where the entire observation sequence commonly corresponds to one sentence.",
        "In the current study, we chose to apply HMMs on a somewhat higher level, where an observation corresponds to a segment of the field book entry.",
        "Ideally, one such segment maps one-to-one to a cell in the specimen database, though we leave open the possibility ofmerging several segments into one database cell.",
        "Provided that a field book entry can be segmented reliably, we have turned one part of the learning problem, that of estimating the state-emission",
        "to sequence labelling tasks (Van den Bosch and canisius, 2006; Van den Bosch and Daelemans, 2005).",
        "distribution, into one for which we have (almost) perfect supervised training data: the contents of the database cells.",
        "The general form of a Hidden Markov Model's state-emission distribution is P(o|s), where s is the state, i.e. a field type in our case, and o is the observation.",
        "As mentioned before, we treat a segment of tokens as one observation, therefore our state-emission distribution will look like P(o = t\\,t2,...,tnls).",
        "Essentially, what we have here is a language model, conditioned on the current state.",
        "Since the specimen database provides a large amount of labelled segment sequences, any probabilistic language modelling method can be used to estimate the state-emission distribution.",
        "Whereas the specimen database provides sufficient information to estimate the state-emission distribution in a fully supervised way, the initial-state and state-transition distributions cannot be derived from the database alone.",
        "Columns in a database are either unordered or ordered in a way that does not necessarily reflect the order they had in the field book entries they were extracted from.",
        "However, the original field book entries do show a rather systematic structure.",
        "Often, using information about the order fields typically occur in, seems to be the only way to distinguish certain field types from one another.",
        "To estimate the two missing probability distributions, the Baum-Welch algorithm was used, updating the initial-state and state-transition distributions, while keeping the state-emission distributions unchanged.",
        "In our setup, the Hidden Markov Model expects the input texts to be pre-segmented.",
        "To come up with a good initial segmentation of an input entry, we again chose a language-modelling approach.",
        "It is expected that segment boundaries can best be recognised by looking for unusual token subsequences; that is, token sequences that are highly unlikely to occur within a field according to the information we obtained from the specimen database about what a typical segment does look like.",
        "A bigram language model has been trained on the contents of all the columns of the specimen database.",
        "Using this language model and the Viterbi algorithm, the globally most-likely segmentation of the input text is predicted.",
        "The state-emission model is constructed by training a separate bigram language model for each column of the specimen database.",
        "Combining those gives us the conditional distribution required for a Hidden Markov Model.",
        "However, in a database, not every column has necessarily been filled for every record.",
        "For example, in the Reptiles and Amphibians database, there are columns that only contain actual data as infrequently as in 5% of the records.",
        "Relative to columns that contain data more often, these sparsely-filled columns tend to be overestimated when simply computing a likelihood according to the language model.",
        "For this reason, a penalty term is added to the state-emission distribution corresponding to the probability that a record contains data for the given column.",
        "The likelihood computed by the language model and the corresponding penalty term are then simply multiplied.",
        "For building both types of language model presented in the two previous sections, we used n-gram language modelling as implemented by the SRI Language Modelling Toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).",
        "With this toolkit, high-order n-gram models can be built, where the sparsity problem often encountered with such models is tackled by various smoothing methods.",
        "We supplemented this built-in n-gram smoothing, with our own smoothing on the token level by replacing low-frequent words with symbols reflecting certain orthographic features of the original word, and numbers with a symbol only encoding the number of digits in the original number.",
        "In addition to these general measures to deal with sparsity, we also applied a small number of knowledge-driven modifications to the training data for the language models.",
        "The need for those is caused by the fact that the contents of the specimen database are almost, but not entirely extracted literally from the original field book entries.",
        "For example, for the second entry ofExample 1, the following information is stored in the database.",
        "Genus Hyla Species minuta Gender 1f + 2 m Place Las Claritas",
        "Biotope quaking near water 50 cm above water surface, near secondary vegetation Height 200 m Collector M.S.",
        "Hoogmoed Registration number 27217 27219",
        "Comparing just this single field book entry with its corresponding database record, one can already see several mismatches.",
        "The gender symbols and $ in the field book texts are stored as m and f in the database.",
        "The collection date 9-VI-1978, has been converted to 9-6-1978 before adding it to the database, i.e. the Roman numeral for the month number has been mapped to the corresponding Arabic numeral.",
        "As a final example, in the field book entry the registration number for the specimen is preceded by the symbol RMNH; in the database this standard symbol is stripped of and only the number is stored.",
        "Each of these differences, while only small, will hinder the performance of a language model trained on the contents of the database and applied to field book texts.",
        "As a simple illustration of this, when encountering the symbol RMNH in a field book entry, this most likely indicates the start of a new (registration number) segment.",
        "However, in the database, on which all language models are trained, RMNH never occurs as a symbol in the registration number column; it does occur a few times in the column for special remarks but never at the start of the text.",
        "As a result, a segmentation model trained on the contents of the database, on encountering the symbol RMNH will always opt for continuing the existing segment as opposed to starting a new one, which is most likely the better choice.",
        "Fortunately, many such mismatches between the text in field books and the database are systematic and can easily be covered by a small number of manually constructed rules that modify the training data for the language models.",
        "Among others, we added the RMNH symbol in front of registration numbers, and randomly changed some month numbers from Arabic numerals to Roman numerals.",
        "Another difference between the field books and the database that turned out to be rather crucial is the fact that many segments in the field book entries are separated by commas.",
        "Such commas used",
        "Table 2: Performance of all baseline and learning approaches on the Reptiles and Amphibians data, expressed in token accuracy, precision, recall, F-score, and WindowDiff.",
        "For WindowDiff, lower scores are better.",
        "as delimiters between fields do not appear in the database, where fields correspond to columns and boundaries between fields consequently do not have to be explicitly marked by punctuation.",
        "For example, the comma between Las Claritas and 9-VI-1978 only serves to separate the Place segment from the Collection date segment; the comma is not copied to the database.",
        "However, commas do occur field-internally in the database, especially in longer fields such as special remarks.",
        "Hence a language model trained on the database in its original form will never have encountered a comma functioning as a segment boundary marker and thus will not recognise that commas may be used for this purpose in the field book entries.",
        "To deal with this, we modified the training data for the segment model by randomly inserting commas at the end ofsome segments.",
        "Experimental results point out that this modification has a large impact on the performance of the segmentation model.",
        "To evaluate the performance of the two approaches, we applied them to the Reptiles and Amphibians database.",
        "First we computed baseline scores using the approaches described in Section 3.2.",
        "All resulting scores are listed in Table 2.",
        "Performance of the systems was measured using a number of different metrics, each reflecting different qualities of the output.",
        "The most basic one, token accuracy, simply measures the percentage of tokens that were assigned the correct field type.",
        "It has the disadvantage that it does not reflect the quality of the segments that were found.",
        "For a more segment-oriented evaluation, we used precision, recall and F-score on correctly identified and labelled segments.",

        "The biggest problem of all baseline approaches is that their performance with respect to the segment-oriented measures is disappointing.",

        "was trained on randomly concatenated training data, MBL bias on data modelled after 10 training sequences), we see that the small amount of prior knowledge used for generating the artificial training data results in a substantial improvement compared with the memory-based learner that was trained on randomly concatenated training data with uniform probabilities.",
        "As can be seen in the last row of Table 2, the Hidden Markov Model outperforms all other approaches in all aspects; it attains both the best token accuracy (56.9), and by far the best F-score (60.3).",

        "Information extraction is often used to automate the process of filling a structured database with content extracted from written texts.",
        "Supervised machine learning approaches have been successfully applied for creating systems capable ofperforming this task.",
        "However, the supervised nature of these approaches requires large amounts of annotated training data; the acquisition of which is often a laborious and time-consuming process.",
        "In this study, we experimented with two machine learning techniques that do not require such annotated training data, but can be trained on a database containing information derived from the type ofdocuments targeted by the application.",
        "The first approach is an attempt to employ a standard supervised machine learning algorithm, training it on artificial labelled training data.",
        "These data are created by concatenating the contents of the cells of the database records in random order.",
        "Experiments with this approach pointed out that truly random concatenation of database fields results in weak performance; a rather simple baseline approach, which only matches substrings of a field book entry with the contents of the database, leads to better results.",
        "However, if a small amount of annotated field book entries is available – in this study, 10 entries turned out to be sufficient – one can estimate field ordering probabilities that can be used to generate more realistic training data from the database.",
        "A machine learner trained on these data labelled 10% more tokens correctly than the system trained on the randomly generated data.",
        "Our second approach is based on unsupervised Hidden Markov modelling.",
        "First, an n-gram language model is used to divide the field book entries into unlabelled segments.",
        "Then, a Hidden Markov Model is trained on these segmented entries using the Baum-Welch algorithm to estimate statetransition probabilities.",
        "The resulting HMM labels the segments found in the preceding segmentation step.",
        "The HMM state-emission distributions are estimated by training n-gram language models on the contents of the database columns.",
        "The performance of the HMM proved to be superior to the other approaches, outperforming the supervised learner by labelling 56.9% of the tokens correctly, as well as attaining good results in terms of segment-level F-score (60.3).",
        "Experiments with the HMM approach on a second, independent data set confirmed its generality."
