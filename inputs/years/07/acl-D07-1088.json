        "The discovery and extraction of specific types of information, and its (re)structuring and storage into databases, are critical tasks for data mining, knowledge acquisition, and information integration from large corpora or heterogeneous resources (e.g., Muslea et al., 2001; Arasu and GarciaMolina, 2003).",
        "For example, webpages of products on Amazon may contain a list of data records such as books, watches, and electronics.",
        "Automatic extraction of individual records will facilitate the access and management of data resources.",
        "Most current approaches address this problem for structured or semi-structured text, for instance, from XML format files or lists and/or tabular data records on webpages (e.g., Liu et al., 2003; Zhu et al., 2006).",
        "The techniques applied rely strongly on the analysis of document structure derived from the webpage's html tags (e.g., the DOM tree model).",
        "Regarding unstructured text, most Information Extraction (IE) work has focused on named entities (people, organizations, places, etc.).",
        "Such IE treats each extracted element as a separate record.",
        "Much less work has focused on the case where several related pieces of information have to be extracted to jointly comprise a single data record.",
        "In this work, it is usually assumed that there is only one record for each document (e.g., Kristjannson et al., 2004).",
        "Almost no work tries to extract multiple data records from a single document.",
        "Multiple data records can be scattered across the narrative in free text.",
        "The problem becomes much harder as there are no explicit boundaries between data records and no heavily indicative format features (like html tags) to utilize.",
        "With the exponential increase of unstructured text resources (e.g., digitalized publications, papers and/or technical reports), knowledge needs have made it a necessity to explore this problem.",
        "For example, biomedical papers contain numerous experiments and findings.",
        "But the large volume and rate of publication have made it infeasible to read through the articles and manually identify data records and attributes.",
        "We present a study to extract data records and attributes from the biomedical research literature.",
        "This is part of an effort to develop a Knowledge Base Management System to benefit neuroscience research.",
        "Specifically we are interested in knowledge of various aspects (attributes) of Tract-tracing Experiments (TTE) (data records) in neuroscience.",
        "The goal of TTE experiments is to chart the interconnectivity of the brain by injecting tracer chemicals into a region of the brain and identifying corresponding labeled regions where the tracer is taken up and transported to (Burns et al., 2007).",
        "To extract data records from the research literature, we need to solve two sub-problems: discovering individual attributes of records and grouping them into one or more individual records, each record representing one TTE experiment.",
        "Each attribute may contain a list of words or phrases and each record may contain a list of attributes.",
        "Listing each sentence from top to bottom, we call the first problem the Horizontal Problem (HP) and the second the Vertical Problem (VP).",
        "Figure 1 provides an example of a TTE research article with colored fragments representing attributes and dashed frames representing data records.",
        "For instance, the third dashed frame represents one experiment record having three attributes with corresponding biological interpretations: \"no labeled cells\", \"the DCN\", and \"the contralateral AVCN\".",
        "We view the HP and VP problems as two sequential labeling problems and describe our approach using two-level Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001) models to extract data records and their attributes.",
        "The HP problem (finding individual attribute values) is solved using a sentence-level CRF labeling model that integrates a rich set of linguistic features.",
        "For the VP problem, we apply a discourse-level CRF model to identify individual experiments (data records).",
        "This model utilizes deep semantic knowledge from the HP results (attribute labels within sentences) together with semantic language models and achieves significant improvements over baseline systems.",
        "This paper mainly focuses on the VP problem, since linguistic features for the HP problem is the general IE topic of much past research (e.g., Peng and McCallum, 2004).",
        "We apply various feature combinations to learn the most suitable and indicative linguistic features.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in the next section we discuss related work.",

        "Most of those approaches rely on the analysis of document structure (reflected in, for example, html tags), from which record templates are derived.",

        "Given the problem of identifying one or more records in free text, it is natural to turn toward text segmentation.",
        "The Natural Language Processing (NLP) community has come up with various solutions towards topic-based text segmentation (e.g., Hearst, 1994; Choi, 2000; Malioutov and Barzilay, 2006).",
        "Most unsupervised text segmentation approaches work under optimization criteria to maximize the intra-segment similarity and minimize the inter-segment similarity based on word distribution statistics.",
        "However, this approach cannot be applied directly to data record extraction.",
        "A careful study of our corpus shows that data records share many words and phrases and are not distinguishable based on word similairties.",

        "We therefore first perform some sentence level extraction (following the HP problem) and then integrate semantic labels and semantic language model features into a discourse level CRF model to represent the template for extracting data records in the future.",
        "Recently an increasing number of research efforts on text mining and IE have used CRF models provides a compact way to integrate different types of features when sequential labeling is important.",
        "Recent work includes improved model variants (e.g., Jiao et al., 2006; Okanohara et al., 2006) and applications such as web data extraction (Pinto et al., 2003), scientific citation extraction (Peng and McCallum, 2004), and word alignment (Blunsom and Cohn, 2006).",
        "But none of them have used CRFs for discourse level data record extraction.",
        "We use a CRF model to represent a data record template and integrate various knowledge as CRF features.",
        "Instead of traditional work on the sentence level, our focus here is on the discourse level.",
        "As this has not been carefully explored, we experiment with various selected features.",
        "For the biomedical domain, our work will facilitate biomedical research by supporting the construction of Knowledge Base Management Systems (e.g., Stephan et al., 2001; Hahn et al., 2002; Burns and Cheng, 2006).",

        "System Gold",
        "This is a real example from the testing set.",
        "For records R1, R3, and R6, the system can extract the exact sentences contained.",
        "For record R2 and R5, although they do not exactly match at the sentence level, the extracted record contains the entire required set of attributes as in the gold standard.",
        "When we investigated the errors, we found that sometimes the extracted data records combined two or more smaller gold standard records, or vice versa.",
        "As shown in Figure 4, extracted records R4 and R7 are both combinations of records in the gold standard.",
        "This is partially due to the granularity definition problem.",
        "Authors may mention several approaches/symptoms to one type of experiment for a single purpose.",
        "In this case, it is almost infeasible to have annotators strictly agree on granularity and thus to teach the system to acquire this knowledge.",
        "For example, in the gold standard, the annotator annotated three successive sentences as three separate records but the system output those as only one data record.",
        "In this extreme case, it is too hard to expect the system to perform well.",
        "In our approach, the semantic attribute labels and semantic language models require the result of the initial sentence-level labeling, which has an F-score of 0.79.",
        "The error may propagate into the data record extraction procedure and lower overall system performance.",
        "In our current experiments, we also assume all the attributes within one segment belong to one record.",
        "However, the situation of embedded data records will make this problem harder.",
        "For example, authors sometimes compare the current experiment with other approaches in referenced papers.",
        "In this case, those attributes should be excluded from the records.",
        "We need to invent rules or constraints to filter them out.",
        "When such reference occurs at experiment boundaries, it brings higher risk for correct results.",
        "It is a very hard problem to extract from unstructured text neat structured records.",
        "The annotators sometimes employ background knowledge or reasoning when performing manual extraction; such knowledge cannot today be easily modeled and integrated into learning systems.",
        "In our study, we also compared some feature selection approaches.",
        "Similar to (Yang and Pedersen, 1997), we tried Feature Instance Frequency, Mutual Information, Information Gain, and CHI-square test.",
        "But we eventually found that the system including all the features worked best, and with all the other configurations unchanged, feature instance frequency worked at almost the same level as other complex measures such as mutual information and information gain."
