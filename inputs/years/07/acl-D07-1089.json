        "In addition, the utility function should be easily decomposable, to enable direct optimization using posterior-decoding.",

        "Hence, an accuracy measure which is based on a metric follows the intuition that reducing the distance to the correct answer should increase the accuracy of the predicted answer.",
        "Therefore, defining a metric space for the objects of a given problem leads to a natural definition of accuracy.",
        "Another advantage of using a metric-based accuracy measure is the ability to provide bounds in the search space using the triangle inequality.",
        "For example, while searching for the answer with the optimal (metric-based) expected utility, a step of length x can only change the expected utility as well as the actual utility by at most ±x units.",

        "Other utility functions, such as Dice, Jaccard and Hamming can be used as Uset_agreement.",

        "where 7 e [0, to) is a gap-factor, and // e (0, to) is a match factor.",
        "The neutral value for both parameters is 1.",
        "Increasing 7 results in increased utility to sparser MCAs, while reducing 7 increases the utility of denser alignments.",
        "However, in the case of MCA, the gap-factor only affects the first aligned word position, but it cannot affect the number of word positions each word is aligned to.",
        "The match-factor adds this functionality by rewarding MCAs that align words to multiple word positions when // > 1, and penalizing such MCAs when // < 1.",

        "On average, 20% of the source words are aligned to at least one other target word in a given reference pairwise alignment.",
        "Since the union of all the pairwise alignments results in only a single test MCA, it is hard to make strong arguments about the performance",

        "of the system in general.",
        "Therefore, we concentrate our discussion on general trends, and do not claim that the specific performance numbers we report here are statistically significant.",
        "As a point of comparison, the SMT community has been evaluating performance of word-alignment systems on an even smaller dataset of 447 pairs of non-overlapping sentences (Mihalcea and Pedersen, 2003).",
        "We first analyze the performance of the system on pairwise citance alignments.",
        "Instead of taking the equivalence closure of – p we take only the symmetric closure.",
        "The result is 990 many-to-many pairwise alignments.",
        "In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the posterior-decoding algorithm, we generate the Viterbi alignments using the same CRF model.",
        "The Viterbi many-to-many pairwise alignments are then generated by combining equivalent pairs of many-to-one alignments using three different standard symmetrization methods for word-alignment – union, intersection, and the refined method of Och & Ney (2003).",
        "Figure 3 shows the recall/precision trade-off of the pairwise posterior-decoding and Viterbi alignments.",
        "The curve for the posterior-decoding alignments was produced by varying the gap and match factors.",
        "For the Viterbi alignments, only three results could be generated (one for each symmetrization method).",
        "However, since the refined method produced a very similar result to the union, only the union is displayed in the figure.",
        "The important observation is that while posterior-decoding enables refined control over the recall/precision tradeoff, the Viterbi decoding generates only three alignments, which cover only a small fraction of the curve at its high precision range.",
        "The union of Viterbi alignments achieves 0.531 recall at 0.913 precision, which is similar result to the 0.540 recall at 0.909 precision achieved using posterior-decoding with gap-factor and match-factor set to 1.",
        "However, unlike Viterbi, posterior-decoding produces alignments with much higher recall levels, by increasing the match-factor and decreasing the gap-factor.",
        "For example setting the gap-factor to 0.1 and match-factor to 1.2 results in alignments with 0.636 recall at 0.517 precision, and setting them to 0.05 and 1.5 results in 0.742 recall at 0.198 precision.",
        "Generally, the gap and match factor affect the accuracy of the alignments as expected.",
        "In particular, the alignments with the best AMA (0.889) and the best F1-measure (0.678) are generated when the gap match factor are set to their natural values (1,1), which theoretically should maximize the expected AMA.",
        "The performance of the pairwise alignments validates the underlying probabilistic model, showing it behaves as theoretically expected.",
        "However, the union of all pairwise alignments is not a valid MCA.",
        "To evaluate the MCA posterior decoding algorithm, we compared it to baseline MCAs.",
        "The baseline MCAs are constructed by using only the normalized-editdistance",
        "edit-distance (clk ,cj )",
        "and defining clk – ",
        "if and only if normalized-edit-distance(c%k, ) < 5, where 5 is a distance threshold.",
        "The final baseline MCA is constructed by taking the equivalence closure of all pairwise alignments, ~s = ( – U( – )-1))+.",
        "The 5 parameter can be used to control the recall/precision trade-off, since increasing it adds more position-pairs to the alignment, thus increasing recall, while decreasing it increases precision.",
        "Figures 4 compares the performance of the CRF posterior-decoding MCAs with the baseline MCAs.",
        "The different MCAs were produced by varying the gap and match factors in the case of the posterior-decoding, and 5 for the baseline MCAs.",
        "The CRF curve clearly dominates the baseline curve.",
        "However, they do overlap in range between 0.52 and 0.55 recall (0.84 and 0.90 precision).",
        "This is prob-",
        "Figure 4: Recall/Precision curve of MCAs comparing CRF with posterior decoding to normalized-edit-distance baseline.",
        "ably a range in which for this particular MCA the orthographic similarity is the most dominant feature.",
        "While the baseline curve drops sharply after that range, the posterior-decoding curve keeps improving recall up to 0.636 at 0.748 precision, before a major drop in precision.",
        "The additional recall is due to the ability of the CRF model to incorporate multiple overlapping features.",
        "In particular, the domain-specific features are important for aligning words and phrases that have little or no orthographic similarity.",
        "At the other end of the overlap range, the posterior-decoding achieves better precision than the baseline for the same recall levels.",
        "For example, the posterior decoding gets 0.381 recall at 0.982 precision compared with 0.346 at 0.937 for the baseline.",
        "Unlike the pairwise alignment case, the neutral settings of the gap and match factors did not result in the best AMA score.",
        "This is due to the equivalence closure heuristic that results in MCAs that are too dense, since a single link between two equivalence classes causes them to merge.",
        "The best AMA score (0.886) is obtained by reducing the gap-factor to 0.5 and match-factor to 0.45, in order to compensate for the effect of the equivalence closure heuristic.",
        "For comparison, the best F1-measure (0.690) is achieved by setting the gap and match factors to 0.75.",
        "sites (e.g., phosphorylated and unphosphorylated) and complex entities (e.g., cell cycle v.s.",
        "cell line).",
        "In addition, a large portion of FN errors are due to not aligning entities that belong to just four equivalence classes (e.g., 97 FN errors caused by terms in the class of motif, site and domain).",
        "Other types of errors include not aligning plural and singular forms of the same entities, aligning only part of multiword entities, and incorrectly aligning orthographically similar entities that belong to different classes."

        "Unlike biological sequence alignment, citance alignments are much more subjective, as they depend on a loose definition of semantic homology between entities.",
        "Even the definition of the basic entities can vary, since in many cases noun-compounds and other multi-word entities seem to be a more natural choice for basic elements of semantic homology and alignment.",
