        "The current state-of-the-art approach to statistical machine translation, so-called phrase-based models, is limited to the mapping of small text chunks without any explicit use of linguistic information, may it be morphological, syntactic, or semantic.",
        "Such additional information has been demonstrated to be valuable by integrating it in preprocessing or postprocessing steps.",
        "However, a tighter integration of linguistic information into the translation model is desirable for two reasons:",
        "• Translation models that operate on more general representations, such as lemmas instead of surface forms of words, can draw on richer statistics and overcome the data sparseness problems caused by limited training data.",
        "• Many aspects of translation can be best explained on a morphological, syntactic, or semantic level.",
        "Having such information available to the translation model allows the direct modeling of these aspects.",
        "For instance: reordering at the sentence level is mostly driven",
        "Figure 1: Factored representations of input and output words incorporate additional annotation into the statistical translation model.",
        "by general syntactic principles, local agreement constraints show up in morphology, etc.",
        "Therefore, we extended the phrase-based approach to statistical translation to tightly integrate additional information.",
        "The new approach allows additional annotation at the word level.",
        "A word in our framework is not only a token, but a vector of factors that represent different levels of annotation (see Figure 1).",
        "We report on experiments with factors such as surface form, lemma, part-of-speech, morphological features such as gender, count and case, automatic word classes, true case forms of words, shallow syntactic tags, as well as dedicated factors to ensure agreement between syntactically related items.",
        "This paper describes the motivation, the modeling aspects and the computationally efficient decoding methods of factored translation models.",
        "We present briefly results for a number of language pairs.",

        "Rich morphology often poses a challenge to statistical machine translation, since a multitude of word forms derived from the same lemma fragment the data and lead to sparse data problems.",
        "If the input language is morphologically richer than the output language, it helps to stem or segment the input in a preprocessing step, before passing it on to the translation system (Lee, 2004; Sadat and Habash, 2006).",

        "In their approaches, first, an n-best list with the best translations is generated for each input sentence.",
        "Then, the n-best list is enriched with additional features, for instance by syntactically parsing each candidate translation and adding a parse score.",
        "The additional features are used to rescore the n-best list, resulting possibly in a better best translation for the sentence.",
        "The goal of integrating syntactic information into the translation model has prompted many researchers to pursue tree-based transfer models (Wu, 1997; Alshawi et al., 1998; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Melamed, 2004; Menezes and Quirk, 2005; Galley et al., 2006), with increasingly encouraging results.",

        "We presented an extension of the state-of-the-art phrase-based approach to statistical machine translation that allows the straightforward integration of additional information, may it come from linguistic tools or automatically acquired word classes.",

        "These experiments demonstrate that within the framework of factored translation models additional information can be successfully exploited to overcome some shortcomings of the currently dominant phrase-based statistical approach.",
        "The framework of factored translation models is very general.",
        "Many more models that incorporate different factors can be quickly built using the existing implementation.",
        "We are currently exploring these possibilities, for instance use of syntactic information in reordering and models with augmented input information.",
        "We have not addressed all computational problems of factored translation models.",
        "In fact, computational problems hold back experiments with more complex factored models that are theoretically possible but too computationally expensive to carry out.",
        "Our current focus is to develop a more efficient implementation that will enable these experiments.",
        "Moreover, we expect to overcome the constraints of the currently implemented synchronous factored models by developing a more general asynchronous framework, where multiple translation steps may operate on different phrase segmentations (for instance a part-of-speech model for large scale reordering)."
