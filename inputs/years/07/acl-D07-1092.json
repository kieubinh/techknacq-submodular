        "In practice, since the number of minimum-cost paths may be exponential in the size of the strings being aligned, we consider the synchronization of a maximum of M best paths in each edit-distance table.",
        "The worst-case complexity of our analogical solver is O([|A| x (|B| + |C|)] + [M x (|A| + ins(B,C))]), where the first term corresponds to the computation of the two edit-distance tables, source (French) stems",

        "Note that this way of measuring response and precision is clearly biased toward translation systems that can hypothesize several candidate translations for each word, as statistical systems usually do.",
        "The reason of this choice was however guided by a lack of precision of the reference we anticipated, a point we discuss in Section 4.1.3.",
        "The figures for the French-to-English direction are reported in Table 2.",
        "We observe that the ratio of unknown words that get a translation by analog is clearly impacted by the size of the lexicon LT we use for computing analogies: the larger the better.",
        "This was expected since the larger a lexicon is, the higher the number of source analogies that can be made and consequently, the higher the number of analogies that can be projected onto the output space.",
        "The precision of analog is rather stable across variants and ranges between 50% to 60%.",
        "The second observation we make is that the baselines perform worse than analog in all but the L500000 cases.",
        "Since our baselines propose translations to each source word, their response rate is maximum.",
        "Their precision, however, is an issue.",
        "Expectedly, base1 is the worst ofthe two baselines.",
        "If we arbitrarily fix the response rate of base2 to the one of ana lo g, the former approach shows a far lower precision (e.g., 34.4 against 59.4 for L200000).",
        "This not only indicates that analogical learning is handling unknown words better than base2, but as well, that a combination of both approaches could potentially yield further improvements.",
        "A last observation concerns the fact that analog performs equally well on the out-domain material.",
        "This is very important from a practical point of view and contrasts with some related work we discuss in Section 5.",
        "At first glance, the fact that base2 outperforms analog on the larger training size is disappointing.",
        "After investigations, we came to the conclusion that this is mainly due to two facts.",
        "First, the number of unknown words on which both systems were tested is rather low in this particular case (e.g., 34 for the in-domain corpus).",
        "Second, we noticed a deficiency of the reference lexicon Lref for many of those words.",
        "After all, this is not surprising since the words unseen in the 500 000 pairs of training sentences, but encountered in the full training corpus (688 000 pairs) are likely to be observed only a few times, therefore weakening the associations automatically acquired for these entries.",
        "We evaluate that a third of the reference translations were wrong in this setting, which clearly raises some doubts on our automatic evaluation procedure in this case.",
