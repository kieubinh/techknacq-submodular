        "Modeling how languages change phonologically over time (diachronic phonology) is a central topic in historical linguistics (Campbell, 1998).",
        "The questions involved range from reconstruction of ancient word forms, to the elucidation of phonological drift processes, to the determination of phylogenetic relationships between languages.",
        "However, this problem has received relatively little attention from the computational community.",
        "What work there is has focused on the reconstruction of phylogenies on the basis of a Boolean matrix indicating the properties of words in different languages (Gray and Atkinson, 2003; Evans et al., 2004; Ringe et al., 2002; Nakhleh et al., 2005).",
        "In this paper, we present a novel framework, along with a concrete model and experiments, for the probabilistic modeling of diachronic phonology.",
        "We focus on the case where the words are etymological cognates across languages, e.g. French /aire and Spanish hacer from Latin /acere (to do).",
        "Given this information as input, we learn a model acting at the level of individual phoneme sequences, which can be used for reconstruction and prediction, Our model is fully generative, and can be used to reason about a variety of types of information.",
        "For example, we can observe a word in one or more modern languages, say French and Spanish, and query the corresponding word form in another language, say Italian.",
        "This kind of lexicon-filling has applications in machine translation.",
        "Alternatively, we can also reconstruct ancestral word forms or inspect the rules learned along each branch of a phylogeny to identify salient patterns.",
        "Finally, the model can be used as a building block in a system for inferring the topology of phylogenetic trees.",
        "We discuss all of these cases further in Section 4.",
        "The contributions of this paper are threefold.",
        "First, the approach to modeling language change at the phoneme sequence level is new, as is the specific model we present.",
        "Second, we compiled a new corpus and developed a methodology for quantitatively evaluating such approaches.",
        "Finally, we describe an efficient inference algorithm for our model and empirically study its performance.",
        "While our word-level model of phonological change is new, there have been several computational investigations into diachronic linguistics which are relevant to the present work.",

        "'nlp.cs.berkeley.edu/pages/historical.html",
        "for languages has been studied by several authors.",
        "These approaches descend from glottochronology (Swadesh, 1955), which views a language as a collection of shared cognates but ignores the structure of those cognates.",
        "This information is obtained from manually curated cognate lists such as the data of Dyen et al.",
        "(1997).",
        "As an example of a cognate set encoding, consider the meaning \"eat\".",
        "There would be one column for the cognate set which appears in French as manger and Italian as mangiare since both descend from the Latin mandere (to chew).",
        "There would be another column for the cognate set which appears in both Spanish and Portuguese as comer, descending from the Latin comedere (to consume).",
        "If this were the only data, algorithms based on this data would tend to conclude that French and Italian were closely related and that Spanish and Portuguese were equally related.",
        "However, the cognate set representation has several disadvantages: it does not capture the fact that the cognate is closer between Spanish and Portuguese than between French and Spanish, nor do the resulting models let us conclude anything about the regular processes which caused these languages to diverge.",
        "Also, the existing cognate data has been curated at a relatively high cost.",
        "In our work, we track each word using an automatically obtained cognate list.",
        "While our cognates may be noisier, we compensate by modeling phonological changes rather than boolean mutations in cognate sets.",

        "However, they do not consider the question of reconstruction or inference in multi-node phylogenies, nor do they present a learning algorithm for such models.",
        "Finally, for the specific application of cognate prediction in machine translation, essentially transliteration, there have been several approaches, including Kondrak (2002).",

        "In particular, we consider rules on the branch between la and vl, for which we have historical evidence.",
        "For example, documents such as the Appendix Probi (Baehrens, 1922) provide indications of orthographic confusions which resulted from the growing gap between Classical Latin and Vulgar Latin phonology around the 3rd and 4th centuries AD.",
        "The Appendix lists common misspellings of Latin words, from which phonological changes can be inferred.",
        "On the la to vl branch, rules for word-final deletion of classical case markers dominate the list (rules ranks 1 and 3 for deletion of final /s/, ranks 2 and 4 for deletion of final /m/).",
        "It is indeed likely that these were generally eliminated in Vulgar Latin.",
        "For the deletion of the /m/, the Appendix Probi contains pairs such as PASSIM NON PASSI and OLIM NON OLI.",
        "For the deletion of final /s/, this was observed in early inscriptions, e.g. CORNELIO for CORNE-LIOS (Allen, 1989).",
        "The frequent leveling of the distinction between /o/ and /u/ (rules ranked 5 and 6) can be also be found in the Appendix Probi: COLUBER NON COLOBER.",
        "Note that in the specific example shown, the model lowers the orignal /u/ and then re-raises it in the pt branch due to a latter process along that branch.",
        "Similarily, major canonical rules were discovered in other branches as well, for example, /v/ to /b/ fortition in Spanish, /s/ to /z/ voicing in Italian, palatalization along several branches, and so on.",
        "Of course, the recovered words and rules are not perfect.",
        "For example, reconstructed Ibero /trinta/ to Spanish /treinta/ (thirty) is generated in an odd fashion using rules /e/ to /i/ and /n/ to /in/.",
        "Moreover, even when otherwise reasonable systematic sound changes are captured, the crudeness of our fixed-granularity contexts can prevent the true context",
        "many environments t – d / UNROUNDED UNROUNDED many environments initial or intervocalic / ROUNDED _ UNROUNDED",
        "m – .........................",
        "u – o ..................",
        "....... r – r e – e ...................",
        "..... v – b o – u ......................",
        "S ~* ................................",
        "u – o / many environments",
        "Figure 6: The tree shows the system's hypothesised derivation of a selected Latin word form, VERBUM (word/verb) into the modern Spanish, Italian and Portuguese pronunciations.",
        "The Latin root and modern leaves were observed while the hidden nodes as well as all the derivations were obtained using the parameters computed by our model after 15 iterations of EM.",
        "Nontrivial rules (i.e. rules that are not identities) used at each stage are shown along the corresponding edge.",
        "The boxes display the top four nontrivial rules corresponding to each of these evolutionary branches, ordered by the number of time they were applied during the last E round of sampling.",
        "Note that since our natural classes are of fixed granularity, some rules must be redundantly discovered, which tends to flood the top of the rule lists with duplicates of the top few rules.",
        "We summarized such redundancies in the above tables.",
        "from being captured, resulting in either rules applying with low probability in overly coarse environments or rules being learned redundantly in overly fine environments.",
        "In this experiment, we show that our model can be used to select between various topologies of phylogenies.",
        "We first presented to the algorithm the universally accepted evolutionary tree corresponding to the evolution of Latin into Spanish, Portuguese and Italian (Topology 2 in Figure 1).",
        "We estimated the log-likelihood L* of the data under this topology.",
        "Next, we estimated the log-likelihood L under two defective topologies (*Topology 3 and *Topology 4).",
        "We recorded the log-likelihood ratio L* – L after the last iteration of EM.",
        "Note that the two likelihoods are comparable since the complexity of the two models is the same.",
        "We obtained a ratio of L* – L = – 4458 – ( – 4766) = 307 for Topology 2 versus *Topology 3, and – 4877 – ( – 5125)= 248 for Topology 2 versus *Topology 4 (the experimental setup is described in Table 1).",
        "As one would hope, this log-likelihood ratio is positive in both cases, indicating that the system prefers the true topology over the wrong ones.",
        "While it may seem, at the first glance, that this result is limited in scope, knowing the relative arrangement of all groups of four nodes is actually sufficient for constructing a full-fledged phylogenetic tree.",
        "Indeed, quartet-based methods, which have been very popular in the computational biology community, are precisely based on this fact (Erdos et al., 1996).",
        "There is a rich literature on this subject and approximate algorithms exist which are robust to misclassification of a subset of quartets (Wu et al., 2007).",
        "This section summarizes the values of the parameters we used in these experiments, their interpretation, and the effect of setting them to other values.",
        "The Dirichlet prior on the parameters can be interpreted as adding pseudocounts to the corresponding edits.",
        "It is an important way of infusing parsimony into the model by setting the prior of the self-substitution parameters much higher than that of the other parameters.",
        "We used 6.0 as the prior on the self-substitution parameters, and for all environments, 1.1 was divided uniformly across the other edits.",
        "As long as the prior on self-substitution is kept within this rough order of magnitude, varying them has a limited effect on our results.",
        "We also initialized the parameters with values that encourage self-substitutions.",
        "Again, the results were robust to perturbation of initialization as long as the value for self-substitution dominates the other parameters.",
        "The experiments used two natural classes for vowels (rounded and unrounded), and six natural classes for consonants, based on the place of articulation (alveolar, bilabial, labiodental, palatal, postalveolar, and velar).",
        "We conducted experiments to evaluate the effect of using different natural classes and found that finer ones can help if enough data is used for training.",
        "We defer the meticulous study of the optimal granularity to future work, as it would be a more interesting experiment under a loglinear model.",
        "In such a model, contexts of different granularities can coexist, whereas such coexistence is not recognized by the current model, giving rise to many duplicate rules.",
        "We estimated the bigram phoneme model on the words in the root languages that were not heldout.",
        "Just as in machine translation, the language model was found to contribute significantly to reconstruction performance.",
        "We tried to increase the weight of the language model by exponentiating it to a power, as is often done in NLP applications, but we did not find that it had any significant impact on performance.",
        "In the reconstruction experiments, when the data was not reachable by the model, the word used in the initialization was used as the prediction, and the evolution of these words were ignored when re-estimating the parameters.",
        "Words were initialized by picking at random, for each unobserved node, an observed node's corresponding word."
