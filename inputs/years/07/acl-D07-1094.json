        "Continuous density hidden Markov models (HMMs) underlie most automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems in some form.",
        "While the basic algorithms for HMM learning and inference are quite general, acoustic models of speech standardly employ rich speech-specific structures to improve performance.",
        "For example, it is well known that a monophone HMM with one state per phone is too coarse an approximation to the true articulatory and acoustic process.",
        "The HMM state space is therefore refined in several ways.",
        "To model phone-internal dynamics, phones are split into beginning, middle, and end subphones (Jelinek, 1976).",
        "To model cross-phone coarticulation, the states of the HMM are refined by splitting the phones into context-dependent tri-phones.",
        "These states are then re-clustered (Odell, 1995) and the parameters of their observation distributions are tied back together (Young and Woodland, 1994).",
        "Finally, to model complex emission densities, states emit mixtures of multivariate Gaussians.",
        "This standard structure is shown schematically in Figure 1.",
        "While this rich structure is phonetically well-motivated and empirically successful, so much structural bias may be unnecessary, or even harmful.",
        "For example in the domain of syntactic parsing with probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs), a surprising recent result is that automatically induced grammar refinements can outperform sophisticated methods which exploit substantial manually articulated structure (Petrov et al., 2006).",
        "In this paper, we consider a much more automatic, data-driven approach to learning HMM structure for acoustic modeling, analagous to the approach taken by Petrov et al.",
        "(2006) for learning PCFGs.",
        "We start with a minimal monophone HMM in which there is a single state for each (context-independent) phone.",
        "Moreover, the emission model for each state is a single multivariate Gaussian (over the standard MFCC acoustic features).",
        "We then iteratively refine this minimal HMM through state splitting, adding complexity as needed.",
        "States in the refined HMMs are always substates of the original HMM and are therefore each identified with a unique base phone.",
        "States are split, estimated, and (perhaps) merged, based on a likelihood criterion.",
        "Our model never allows explicit Gaussian mixtures, though substates may develop similar distributions and thereby emulate such mixtures.",
        "In principle, discarding the traditional structure can either help or hurt the model.",
        "Incorrect prior splits can needlessly fragment training data and incorrect prior tying can limit the model's expressivity.",

        "The dependence of subphones across phones in our model is not shown, while the context clustering in the standard model is shown only schematically.",
        "we show that our automatic approach outperforms classic systems on the task of phone recognition on the TIMIT data set.",
        "In particular, it outperforms standard state-tied triphone models like Young and Woodland (1994), achieving a phone error rate of 26.4% versus 27.7%.",
        "In addition, our approach gives state-of-the-art performance on the task of phone classification on the TIMIT data set, suggesting that our learned structure is particularly effective at modeling phone-internal structure.",
        "Indeed, our error rate of 21.4% is outperformed only by the recent structured margin approach of Sha and Saul (2006).",
        "It remains to be seen whether these positive results on acoustic modeling will facilitate better word recognition rates in a large vocabulary speech recognition system.",
        "We also consider the structures learned by the model.",
        "Subphone structure is learned, similar to, but richer than, standard begin-middle-end structures.",
        "Cross-phone coarticulation is also learned, with classic phonological classes often emerging naturally.",
        "Many aspects of this work are intended to simplify rather than further articulate the acoustic process.",
        "It should therefore be clear that the basic techniques of splitting, merging, and learning using EM are not in themselves new for ASR.",
        "Nor is the basic latent induction method new (Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Petrov et al., 2006).",
        "What is novel in this paper is (1) the construction of an automatic system for acoustic modeling, with substantially streamlined structure, (2) the investigation of variational inference for such a task, (3) the analysis of the kinds of structures learned by such a system, and (4) the empirical demonstration that such a system is not only competitive with the traditional approach, but can indeed outperform even very recent work on some preliminary measures."

        "In the following, we propose a greatly simplified model that does not impose any manually specified structural constraints.",
        "Instead of specifying structure a priori, we use the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm for HMMs (Baum-Welch) to automatically induce the structure in a way that maximizes data likelihood.",
        "In general, our training data consists of sets of acoustic observation sequences and phone level transcriptions r which specify a sequence of phones from a set of phones Y, but does not label each time frame with a phone.",

        "We now describe this relatively straightforward modification of the EM algorithm.",

        "Our procedure does not require such extensive annotation of the training data and in fact gives better performance when the exact transition point between phones are not pre-specified but learned.",

        "These probabilities can be computed using the standard forward and backward recursions (Rabiner, 1989), except that at each time t, we only consider states st for which n(st) = yt, because we have hand-aligned labels for the observations.",
        "These quantities also allow us to compute the posterior counts necessary for the E-step of the EM algorithm.",
        "One way of inducing arbitrary structural annotations would be to split each HMM state in into m substates, and re-estimate the parameters for the split HMM using EM.",
        "This approach has two major drawbacks: for larger m it is likely to converge to poor local optima, and it allocates substates uniformly across all states, regardless of how much annotation is required for good performance.",
        "To avoid these problems, we apply a hierarchical parameter estimation strategy similar in spirit to the work of Sankar (1998) and Ueda et al.",

        "As a final illustration of the nature of the learned models, Table 3 shows the number of substates allocated to each phone by the split/merge process (the maximum is 32 for this stage) for the case of hand-aligned (left) as well as automatically-aligned (right) phone boundaries.",
        "Interestingly, in the hand-aligned case, the vowels absorb most of the complexity since many consonantal cues are heavily evidenced on adjacent vowels.",
        "However, in the automatically-aligned case, many vowel frames with substantial consontant coloring are reallocated to those adjacent consonants, giving more complex consonants, but comparatively less complex vowels."

        "We have presented a minimalist, automatic approach for building an accurate acoustic model for phonetic classification and recognition.",
        "Our model does not require any a priori phonetic bias or manual specification of structure, but rather induces the structure in an automatic and streamlined fashion.",
        "Starting from a minimal monophone HMM, we automatically learn models that achieve highly competitive performance.",
        "On the TIMIT phone recognition task our model clearly outperforms standard state-tied triphone models like Young and Woodland (1994).",
        "For phone classification, our model",
        "Table 3: Number of substates allocated per phone.",
        "The left column gives the number of substates allocated when training on manually aligned training sequences, while the right column gives the number allocated when we automatically determine phone boundaries.",
        "achieves performance competitive with the state-of-the-art discriminative methods (Sha and Saul, 2006), despite being generative in nature.",
        "This result together with our analysis of the context-dependencies and substructures that are being learned, suggests that our model is particularly well suited for modeling phone-internal structure.",
        "It does, of course remain to be seen if and how these benefits can be scaled to larger systems.",
