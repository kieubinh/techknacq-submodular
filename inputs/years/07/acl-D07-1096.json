        "Previous shared tasks of the Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning (CoNLL) have been devoted to chunking (1999,2000), clause identification (2001), named entity recognition (2002, 2003), and semantic role labeling (2004, 2005).",
        "In 2006 the shared task was multilingual dependency parsing, where participants had to train a single parser on data from thirteen different languages, which enabled a comparison not only of parsing and learning methods, but also of the performance that can be achieved for different languages (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006).",
        "In dependency-based syntactic parsing, the task is to derive a syntactic structure for an input sentence by identifying the syntactic head of each word in the sentence.",
        "This defines a dependency graph, where the nodes are the words of the input sentence and the arcs are the binary relations from head to dependent.",
        "Often, but not always, it is assumed that all words except one have a syntactic head, which means that the graph will be a tree with the single independent word as the root.",
        "In labeled dependency parsing, we additionally require the parser to assign a specific type (or label) to each dependency relation holding between a head word and a dependent word.",
        "In this year's shared task, we continue to explore data-driven methods for multilingual dependency parsing, but we add a new dimension by also introducing the problem of domain adaptation.",
        "The way this was done was by having two separate tracks: a multilingual track using essentially the same setup as last year, but with partly different languages, and a domain adaptation track, where the task was to use machine learning to adapt a parser for a single language to a new domain.",
        "In total, test results were submitted for twenty-three systems in the multilingual track, and ten systems in the domain adaptation track (six of which also participated in the multilingual track).",
        "Not everyone submitted papers describing their system, and some papers describe more than one system (or the same system in both tracks), which explains why there are only (!)",
        "twenty-one papers in the proceedings.",
        "In this paper, we provide task definitions for the two tracks (section 2), describe data sets extracted from available treebanks (section 3), report results for all systems in both tracks (section 4), give an overview of approaches used (section 5), provide a first analysis of the results (section 6), and conclude with some future directions (section 7).",

        "In this section, we provide the task definitions that were used in the two tracks of the CoNLL 2007 Shard Task, the multilingual track and the domain adaptation track, together with some background and motivation for the design choices made.",
        "First of all, we give a brief description of the data format and evaluation metrics, which were common to the two tracks.",
        "The data sets derived from the original treebanks (section 3) were in the same column-based format as for the 2006 shared task (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006).",
        "In this format, sentences are separated by a blank line; a sentence consists of one or more tokens, each one starting on a new line; and a token consists of the following ten fields, separated by a single tab character:",
        "1.",
        "ID: Token counter, starting at 1 for each new sentence.",
        "2.",
        "FORM: Word form or punctuation symbol.",
        "3.",
        "LEMMA: Lemma or stem of word form, or an underscore if not available.",

        "CPOSTAG: Coarse-grained part-of-speech tag, where the tagset depends on the language.",
        "5.",

        "6.",
        "FEATS: Unordered set of syntactic and/or morphological features (depending on the particular language), separated by a vertical bar (|), or an underscore if not available.",
        "7.",
        "HEAD: Head of the current token, which is either a value of ID or zero (0).",
        "Note that, depending on the original treebank annotation, there may be multiple tokens with HEAD=0.",
        "8.",
        "DEPREL: Dependency relation to the HEAD.",
        "The set of dependency relations depends on the particular language.",
        "Note that, depending on the original treebank annotation, the dependency relation when HEAD=0 may be meaningful or simply ROOT.",
        "9.",
        "PHEAD: Projective head of current token, which is either a value of ID or zero (0), or an underscore if not available.",
        "10.",
        "PDEPREL: Dependency relation to the PHEAD, or an underscore if not available.",
        "The PHEAD and PDEPREL were not used at all in this year's data sets (i.e., they always contained underscores) but were maintained for compatibility with last year's data sets.",
        "This means that, in practice, the first six columns can be considered as input to the parser, while the HEAD and DEPREL fields are the output to be produced by the parser.",
        "Labeled training sets contained all ten columns; blind test sets only contained the first six columns; and gold standard test sets (released only after the end of the test period) again contained all ten columns.",
        "All data files were encoded in UTF-8.",
        "The official evaluation metric in both tracks was the labeled attachment score (LAS), i.e., the percentage of tokens for which a system has predicted the correct HEAD and DEPREL, but results were also reported for unlabeled attachment score (UAS), i.e., the percentage of tokens with correct HEAD, and the label accuracy (LA), i.e., the percentage of tokens with correct DEPREL.",
        "One important difference compared to the 2006 shared task is that all tokens were counted as \"scoring tokens\", including in particular all punctuation tokens.",
        "The official evaluation script, eval07.pl, is available from the shared task website.",
        "The multilingual track of the shared task was organized in the same way as the 2006 task, with annotated training and test data from a wide range of languages to be processed with one and the same parsing system.",
        "This system must therefore be able to learn from training data, to generalize to unseen test data, and to handle multiple languages, possibly by adjusting a number of hyper-parameters.",
        "Participants in the multilingual track were expected to submit parsing results for all languages involved.",
        "One of the claimed advantages of dependency parsing, as opposed to parsing based on constituent analysis, is that it extends naturally to languages with free or flexible word order.",
        "This explains the interest in recent years for multilingual evaluation of dependency parsers.",
        "Even before the 2006 shared task, the parsers of Collins (1997) and Charniak (2000), originally developed for English, had been adapted for dependency parsing of Czech, and the parsing methodology proposed by Kudo and Matsumoto (2002) and Yamada and Matsumoto (2003) had been evaluated on both Japanese and English.",
        "The parser of McDonald and Pereira (2006) had been applied to English, Czech and Danish, and the parser of Nivre et al.",
        "(2007) to ten different languages.",
        "But by far the largest evaluation of multilingual dependency parsing systems so far was the 2006 shared task, where nineteen systems were evaluated on data from thirteen languages (Buchholz and",
        "Marsi, 2006).",
        "One of the conclusions from the 2006 shared task was that parsing accuracy differed greatly between languages and that a deeper analysis of the factors involved in this variation was an important problem for future research.",
        "In order to provide an extended empirical foundation for such research, we tried to select the languages and data sets for this year's task based on the following desiderata:",
        "• The selection of languages should be typologically varied and include both new languages and old languages (compared to 2006).",
        "• The creation of the data sets should involve as little conversion as possible from the original treebank annotation, meaning that preference should be given to treebanks with dependency annotation.",
        "The final selection included data from Arabic, Basque, Catalan, Chinese, Czech, English, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, and Turkish.",
        "The treebanks from which the data sets were extracted are described in section 3.",
        "One well known characteristic of data-driven parsing systems is that they typically perform much worse on data that does not come from the training domain (Gildea, 2001).",
        "Due to the large overhead in annotating text with deep syntactic parse trees, the need to adapt parsers from domains with plentiful resources (e.g., news) to domains with little resources is an important problem.",
        "This problem is commonly referred to as domain adaptation, where the goal is to adapt annotated resources from a source domain to a target domain of interest.",
        "Almost all prior work on domain adaptation assumes one of two scenarios.",
        "In the first scenario, there are limited annotated resources available in the target domain, and many studies have shown that this may lead to substantial improvements.",
        "This includes the work of Roark and Bacchiani (2003), Florian et al.",
        "(2004), Chelba and Acero (2004), Daumé and Marcu (2006), and Titov and Henderson (2006).",
        "Of these, Roark and Bacchiani (2003) and Titov and Henderson (2006) deal specifically with syntactic parsing.",
        "The second scenario assumes that there are no annotated resources in the target domain.",
        "This is a more realistic situation and is considerably more difficult.",
        "Recent work by McClosky et al.",
        "(2006) and Blitzer et al.",
        "(2006) have shown that the existence of a large unlabeled corpus in the new domain can be leveraged in adaptation.",
        "For this shared-task, we are assuming the latter setting - no annotated resources in the target domain.",
        "Obtaining adequate annotated syntactic resources for multiple languages is already a challenging problem, which is only exacerbated when these resources must be drawn from multiple and diverse domains.",
        "As a result, the only language that could be feasibly tested in the domain adaptation track was English.",
        "The setup for the domain adaptation track was as follows.",
        "Participants were provided with a large annotated corpus from the source domain, in this case sentences from the Wall Street Journal.",
        "Participants were also provided with data from three different target domains: biomedical abstracts (development data), chemical abstracts (test data 1), and parent-child dialogues (test data 2).",
        "Additionally, a large",
        "Marsi, 2006).",
        "unlabeled corpus for each data set (training, development, test) was provided.",
        "The goal of the task was to use the annotated source data, plus any unlabeled data, to produce a parser that is accurate for each of the test sets from the target domains.",
        "Participants could submit systems in either the \"open\" or \"closed\" class (or both).",
        "The closed class requires a system to use only those resources provided as part of the shared task.",
        "The open class allows a system to use additional resources provided those resources are not drawn from the same domain as the development or test sets.",
        "An example might be a part-of-speech tagger trained on the entire Penn Treebank and not just the subset provided as training data, or a parser that has been hand-crafted or trained on a different training set."

        "The conversion, done by Otakar Smrz, from the original format to the column-based format described in section 2.1 was therefore relatively straightforward, although not all the information in the original annotation could be transfered to the new format.",
        "PADT was one of the treebanks used in the 2006 shared task but then only contained about 54,000 tokens.",
        "Since then, the size of the treebank has more than doubled, with around 112,000 tokens.",
        "In addition, the morphological annotation has been made more informative.",
        "It is also worth noting that the parsing units in this treebank are in many cases larger than conventional sentences, which partly explains the high average number of tokens per \"sentence\" (Buchholz and Basque For Basque, we used the 3LB Basque treebank (Aduriz et al., 2003).",
        "At present, the treebank consists of approximately 3,700 sentences, 334 of which were used as test data.",

        "The original data only contains functions related to the verb, and a function table was used for deriving the remaining syntactic functions.",

        "It was also used in the shared task 2006, but there are two important changes compared to last year.",
        "First, version 2.0 of PDT was used instead of version 1.0, and a conversion script was created by Zdenek Zabokrtsky, using the new XML-based format of PDT 2.0.",
        "Secondly, due to the upper bound on training set size, only sections 1-3 of PDT constitute the training data, which amounts to some 450,000 tokens.",
        "The test data is a small subset of the development test set of PDT.",
        "English For English we used the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank (Marcus et al., 1993).",
        "In particular, we used sections 2-11 for training and a subset of section 23 for testing.",
        "As a preprocessing stage we removed many functions tags from the non-terminals in the phrase structure representation to make the representations more uniform with out-of-domain test sets for the domain adaptation track (see section 3.2).",
        "The resulting data set was then converted to dependency structures using the procedure described in Johansson and Nugues (2007a).",
        "This work was done by Ryan McDonald.",
        "Greek The Greek Dependency Treebank (GDT) (Prokopidis et al., 2005) adopts a dependency structure annotation very similar to those of PDT and PADT, which means that the conversion by Prokopis Prokopidis was relatively straightforward.",

        "This data set is identical to the English training set from the multilingual track (see section 3.1).",
        "For the target domains we used three different labeled data sets.",

        "For languages with non-projective dependencies, graphs therefore need to be projectivized for training and deprojectivized for testing (Hall et al., 2007a; Johansson and Nugues, 2007b; Titov and Henderson, 2007).",

        "This technique is used by Sagae and Tsujii (2007) and in the Nilsson system (Hall et al., 2007a).",
        "It is worth noting that both these systems combine transition-based base parsers with a graph-based method for parser combination, as first described by Sagae and",
        "Lavie (2006).",
        "Data-driven grammar-based parsers, such as Bick",
        "Briscoe (2007), need pre-and post-processing in order to map the dependency graphs provided as training data to a format compatible with the grammar used, and vice versa.",
        "Transition-based parsers build dependency graphs by performing sequences of actions, or transitions.",
        "Both learning and inference is conceptualized in terms of predicting the correct transition based on the current parser state and/or history.",
        "We can further subclassify parsers with respect to the model (or transition system) they adopt, the inference method they use, and the learning method they employ.",
        "The most common model for transition-based parsers is one inspired by shift-reduce parsing, where a parser state contains a stack of partially processed tokens and a queue of remaining input tokens, and where transitions add dependency arcs and perform stack and queue operations.",
        "This type of model is used by the majority of transition-based et al., 2007a; Johansson and Nugues, 2007b; Man-nem, 2007; Titov and Henderson, 2007; Wu et al., 2007).",
        "Sometimes it is combined with an explicit probability model for transition sequences, which may be conditional (Duan et al., 2007) or generative (Titov and Henderson, 2007).",
        "An alternative model is based on the list-based parsing algorithm described by Covington (2001), which iterates over the input tokens in a sequential manner and evaluates for each preceding token whether it can be linked to the current token or not.",
        "This model is used by Marinov (2007) and in component parsers of the Nilsson ensemble system (Hall et al., 2007a).",
        "Finally, two systems use models based on LR parsing (Sagae and Tsujii, 2007; Watson and",
        "Briscoe, 2007).",
        "The most common inference technique in transition-based dependency parsing is greedy deterministic search, guided by a classifier for predicting the next transition given the current parser state and history, processing the tokens of the sentence in sequential left-to-right order (Hall et al., 2007a; Mannem, multiple passes over the input are conducted until no tokens are left unattached (Attardi et al., 2007).",
        "As an alternative to deterministic parsing, several parsers use probabilistic models and maintain a heap or beam of partial transition sequences in order to pick the most probable one at the end of the sentence (Duan et al., 2007; Johansson and Nugues, 2007b; Sagae and Tsujii, 2007; Titov and Henderson, 2007).",
        "One system uses as part of their parsing pipeline a \"neighbor-parser\" that attaches adjacent words and a \"root-parser\" that identifies the root word(s) of a sentence (Wu et al., 2007).",
        "In the case of grammar-based parsers, a classifier is used to disambiguate in cases where the grammar leaves some ambiguity (Schneider et al., 2007; Watson and Briscoe, 2007)",
        "Transition-based parsers either maintain a classifier that predicts the next transition or a global probabilistic model that scores a complete parse.",
        "To train these classifiers and probabilitistic models several approaches were used: SVMs (Duan et al., 2007; Hall et al., 2007a; Sagae and Tsujii, 2007), modified finite Newton SVMs (Wu et al., 2007), maximum entropy models (Sagae and Tsujii, 2007), multiclass averaged perceptron (Attardi et al., 2007) and maximum likelihood estimation (Watson and Briscoe, 2007).",
        "In order to calculate a global score or probability for a transition sequence, two systems used a Markov chain approach (Duan et al., 2007; Sagae and Tsujii, 2007).",
        "Here probabilities from the output of a classifier are multiplied over the whole sequence of actions.",
        "This results in a locally normalized model.",
        "Two other entries used MIRA (Mannem, 2007) or online passive-aggressive learning (Johansson and Nugues, 2007b) to train a globally normalized model.",
        "Titov and Henderson (2007) used an incremental sigmoid Bayesian network to model the probability of a transition sequence and estimated model parameters using neural network learning.",
        "While transition-based parsers use training data to learn a process for deriving dependency graphs, graph-based parsers learn a model of what it means to be a good dependency graph given an input sentence.",
        "They define a scoring or probability function over the set of possible parses.",
        "At learning time they estimate parameters of this function; at parsing time they search for the graph that maximizes this function.",
        "These parsers mainly differ in the type and structure of the scoring function (model), the search algorithm that finds the best parse (inference), and the method to estimate the function's parameters (learning).",
        "The simplest type of model is based on a sum of local attachment scores, which themselves are calculated based on the dot product of a weight vector and a feature representation of the attachment.",
        "This type of scoring function is often referred to as a first-order model.",
        "Several systems participating in this year's shared task used first-order models (Schiehlen and Spranger, 2007; Nguyen et al., 2007; Shimizu and Tjong Kim Sang (2007) cast the same type of arc-based factorization as a weighted constraint satisfaction problem.",
        "Carreras (2007) extends the first-order model to incorporate a sum over scores for pairs of adjacent arcs in the tree, yielding a second-order model.",
        "In contrast to previous work where this was constrained to sibling relations of the dependent (McDonald and Pereira, 2006), here head-grandchild relations can be taken into account.",
        "In all of the above cases the scoring function is decomposed into functions that score local properties (arcs, pairs of adjacent arcs) of the graph.",
        "By contrast, the model of Nakagawa (2007) considers global properties of the graph that can take multiple arcs into account, such as multiple siblings and children of a node.",
        "Searching for the highest scoring graph (usually a tree) in a model depends on the factorization chosen and whether we are looking for projective or non-projective trees.",
        "Maximum spanning tree algorithms can be used for finding the highest scoring non-projective tree in a first-order model (Hall et al., 2007b; Nguyen et al., 2007; Canisius and Tjong Kim Sang, 2007; Shimizu and Nakagawa, 2007), while Eisner's dynamic programming algorithm solves the problem for a first-order factorization in the projective case (Schiehlen and Spranger, 2007).",
        "Carreras (2007) employs his own extension of Eisner's algorithm for the case of projective trees and second-order models that include head-grandparent relations.",
        "The methods presented above are mostly efficient and always exact.",
        "However, for models that take global properties of the tree into account, they cannot be applied.",
        "Instead Nakagawa (2007) uses Gibbs sampling to obtain marginal probabilities of arcs being included in the tree using his global model and then applies a maximum spanning tree algorithm to maximize the sum of the logs of these marginals and return a valid cycle-free parse.",
        "Most of the graph-based parsers were trained using an online inference-based method such as passive-aggressive learning (Nguyen et al., 2007; Schiehlen and Spranger, 2007), averaged perceptron (Carreras, while some systems instead used methods based on maximum conditional likelihood (Nakagawa, 2007;",
        "Hall et al., 2007b).",
        "One way of adapting a learner to a new domain without using any unlabeled data is to only include features that are expected to transfer well (Dredze et al., 2007).",
        "In structural correspondence learning a transformation from features in the source domain to features of the target domain is learnt (Shimizu and Nakagawa, 2007).",
        "The original source features along with their transformed versions are then used to train a discriminative parser.",
        "Dredze et al.",
        "(2007) trained a diverse set of parsers in order to improve cross-domain performance by incorporating their predictions as features for another classifier.",
        "Similarly, two parsers trained with different learners and search directions were used in the co-learning approach of Sagae and Tsujii (2007).",
        "Unlabeled target data was processed with both parsers.",
        "Sentences that both parsers agreed on were then added to the original training data.",
        "This combined data set served as training data for one of the original parsers to produce the final system.",

        "Another technique used was to filter sentences of the out-of-domain corpus based on their similarity to the target domain, as predicted by a classifier (Dredze et al., 2007).",
        "Only if a sentence was judged similar to target domain sentences was it included in the training set.",
        "Bick (2007) used a hybrid approach, where a data-driven parser trained on the labeled training data was given access to the output of a Constraint Grammar parser for English run on the same data.",

        "For Turkish, scores with punctuation also include word-internal dependencies.",
        "produced the most unstable results with respect to LAS is Turkish.",
        "In comparison to last year's languages, the languages involved in the multilingual track this year can be more easily separated into three classes with respect to top scores:",
        "Catalan, Chinese, English, Italian",
        "It is interesting to see that the classes are more easily definable via language characteristics than via characteristics of the data sets.",
        "The split goes across training set size, original data format (constituent vs. dependency), sentence length, percentage of unknown words, number of dependency labels, and ratio of (C)POSTAGS and dependency labels.",
        "The class with the highest top scores contains languages with a rather impoverished morphology.",
        "Medium scores are reached by the two agglutinative languages, Hungarian and Turkish, as well as by Czech.",
        "The most difficult languages are those that combine a relatively free word order with a high degree of inflection.",
        "Based on these characteristics, one would expect to find Czech in the last class.",
        "However, the Czech training set is four times the size of the training set for Arabic, which is the language with the largest training set of the difficult languages.",
        "However, it would be wrong to assume that training set size alone is the deciding factor.",
        "A closer look at table 1 shows that while Basque and Greek in fact have small training data sets, so do Turkish and Italian.",
        "Another factor that may be associated with the above classification is the percentage of new words (PNW) in the test set.",

        "But the PNW for Italian is higher than for Arabic and Greek, and this is also true for the percentage of new lemmas.",
        "Additionally, the highest PNW can be found in Hungarian and Turkish, which reach higher scores than Arabic, Basque, and Greek.",
        "These considerations suggest that highly inflected languages with (relatively) free word order need more training data, a hypothesis that will have to be investigated further.",

        "The combined effect of these changes can probably account for the substantial improvement in parsing accuracy.",
        "For Turkish, the training set grew in size as well, although only by 600 sentences, but part of the improvement for Turkish may also be due to continuing efforts in error correction and consistency checking.",
        "We see that the choice to include punctuation or not makes a large difference for the Turkish scores, since non-final IGs of a word are counted as punctuation (because they have the underscore character as their FORM value), which means that word-internal dependency links are included if punctuation is included.",

        "Despite these characteristics, the top UAS reaches 62.49 and is thus more than 10 percentage points below the top UAS for the chemical data set.",
        "One major reason for this is that auxiliary and main verb dependencies are annotated differently in the CHILDES data than in the WSJ training set.",
        "As a result of this discrepancy, participants were not required to submit results for the CHILDES data.",
        "The best performing system on the CHILDES corpus is an open system (Bick, 2007), but the distance to the top closed system is approximately 1 percentage point.",

      "text": [
        "Two years of dependency parsing in the CoNLL shared task has brought an enormous boost to the development of dependency parsers for multiple languages (and to some extent for multiple domains).",
        "But even though nineteen languages have been covered by almost as many different parsing and learning approaches, we still have only vague ideas about the strengths and weaknesses of different methods for languages with different typological characteristics.",
        "Increasing our knowledge of the multi-causal relationship between language structure, annotation scheme, and parsing and learning methods probably remains the most important direction for future research in this area.",
        "The outputs of all systems for all data sets from the two shared tasks are freely available for research and constitute a potential gold mine for comparative error analysis across languages and systems.",
        "For domain adaptation we have barely scratched the surface so far.",
        "But overcoming the bottleneck of limited annotated resources for specialized domains will be as important for the deployment of human language technology as being able to handle multiple languages in the future.",
        "One result from the domain adaptation track that may seem surprising at first is the fact that closed class systems outperformed open class systems on the chemical abstracts.",
        "However, it seems that the major problem in adapting pre-existing parsers to the new domain was not the domain as such but the mapping from the native output of the parser to the kind of annotation provided in the shared task data sets.",
        "Thus, finding ways of reusing already invested development efforts by adapting the outputs of existing systems to new requirements, without substantial loss in accuracy, seems to be another line of research that may be worth pursuing."
