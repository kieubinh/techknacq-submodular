        "At every parsing step, there are several candidate parsing actions.",

        "As shown in figure 1, the action sequence \"RIGHT- SBJ -> SHIFT -> RIGHT-NMOD -> LEFT OBJ\" constructs the right dependency tree of the example sentence.",
        "Choosing this action sequence among all candidate sequences is the objective of this model.",
        "Firstly, we should define the probability of the dependency tree conditioned on the input sentence.",
        "P(T\\S) =n P(d,\\d0...d-i, S) (1)",
        "Where T denotes the dependency tree, S denotes the original input sentence, d denotes the parsing action at time step .",

        "Note that formula (4) is about the classifier of parsing actions.",
        "It denotes the probability of the parsing action d given the parsing state contextd If we train a classifier that can predict with probability output, then we can compute P(T\\S) by computing the product of the probabilities of parsing actions.",
        "The classifier we use throughout this paper is SVM (Vapnik, 1995).",
        "We adopt Libsvm (Chang and Lin, 2005), which can train multi-class classifier and support training and predicting with probability output (Chang and Lin, 2005).",
        "For this model, the objective is to choose the parsing action sequence that constructs the dependency tree with the maximal probability.",
        "Because this model chooses the most probable sequence, not the most probable parsing action at only one step, it avoids the greedy property of the original deterministic parsers.",
        "We use beam search for the decoding of this model.",
        "We use m to denote the beam size.",
        "Then beam search is carried out as follows.",
        "At every parsing step, all parsing states are ordered (or partially m ordered) according to their probabilities.",

        "Parsing terminates when the first entire dependency tree is constructed.",
        "To obtain a list of n-best parses, we simply continue parsing until either n trees are found, or no further parsing can be fulfilled.",

        "Only m best parsing states resulted by the corresponding actions are kept for every step.",
        "But for the parsing problem, it is reasonable that actions are competing for which phrase should be built.",
        "For dependency syntax, one phrase consists of the head word and all its children.",
        "Based on this motivation, we propose Parsing Action Phrase Model (PAPM), which divides parsing actions into two classes: constructing action and shifting action.",
        "If a phrase is built after an action is performed, the action is called constructing action.",
        "In original Yamada's algorithm, constructing actions are LEFT and RIGHT.",
        "For example, if LEFT is taken, it indicates that the right focus word has found all its children and becomes the head of this new phrase.",
        "Note that one word with no children can also be viewed as a phrase if its dependency on other word is constructed.",
        "In the extended set of parsing actions for labeled parsing, compound actions, which consist of LEFT and RIGHT concatenated by dependency labels, are constructing actions.",
        "If no phrase is built after an action is performed, the action is called shifting action.",
        "Such action is SHIFT.",
        "We denote aj as constructing action and bj as shifting action.",

        "It can be expanded as Ai â bj-k..bj_1aj.",
        "That is, parsing action phrase A is a sequence of parsing actions that constructs the next syntactic phrase.",

        "Note that on the right side of the expansion, only one constructing action is allowed and is always at the last position, while shifting action can occur several times or does not occur at all.",
        "It is parsing action phrases, i.e. sequences of parsing actions, that are competing for which next phrase should be built.",
