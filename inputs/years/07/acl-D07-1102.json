        "Reranking the output of a k-best parser has been shown to improve upon the best results of a state-of-the-art constituency parser (Charniak and Johnson, 2005).",
        "This is primarily due to the ability to incorporate complex structural features that cannot be modeled under a CFG.",
        "Recent work shows that k-best maximum spanning tree (MST) parsing and reranking is also viable (Hall, 2007).",
        "In the current work, we explore the k-best MST parsing paradigm along with a tree-based reranker.",
        "A system using the parsing techniques presented in this paper was entered in the CoNLL 2007 shared task competition (Nivre et al., 2007).",
        "This task evaluated parsing performance on 10 languages: Arabic, Basque,",
        "Catalan, Chinese, Czech, English, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, and Turkish using data originating from a wide variety of dependency treebanks, and transformations of constituency-based treebanks (HajiC et al., 2004; Aduriz et al., 2003; Marti et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2003; Bohmova et al., 2003; Marcus et al., 1993; Johansson and Nugues, 2007; Prokopidis et al., 2005; Csendes et al., 2005; Montemagni et al., 2003;Oflazer et al., 2003).",
        "We show that oracle parse accuracy of the output of our k-best parser is generally higher than the best reported results.",
        "We also present the results of a reranker based on a rich set of structural features, including features explicitly targeted at modeling non-projective configurations.",

        "Unfortunately, by mapping the problem to a graph, we assume that the scores associated with edges are independent, and thus, are limited to edge-factored models.",
        "Edge-factored models are severely limited in their capacity to predict structure.",
        "In fact, they can only directly model parent-child links.",
        "In order to alleviate this, we use a k-best MST parser to generate a set of candidate hypotheses.",
        "Then, we rerank these trees using a model based on rich structural features that model features such as valency, subcategoriza-tion, ancestry relationships, and sibling interactions, as well as features capturing the global structure of dependency trees, aimed primarily at modeling language specific non-projective configurations.",
        "We assign dependency labels to entire trees, rather than predicting the labels during tree construction.",
        "Given that we have a reranking process, we can label the k-best tree hypotheses output from our MST parser, and rerank the labeled trees.",
        "We have explored both labeled and unlabeled reranking.",
        "In the latter case, we simply label the maximal unlabeled tree.",
        "McDonald et al.",
        "(2005) present a technique for training discriminative models for dependency parsing.",
        "The edge-factored models we use for MST parsing are closely related to those described in the previous work, but allow for the efficient computation of normalization factors which are required for first and second-order (gradient-based) training techniques.",
        "We consider two estimation procedures for parent-prediction models.",
        "A parent-prediction model assigns a conditional score s(g\\d) for every parent-child pair (we denote the parent/governor g, and the child/dependent d), where s(g\\d) = s(g,d)/Ylg' s(g',d).",
        "In our work, we compute probabilities p(g\\d) based on conditional log-linear models.",
        "This is an approximation to a generative model that predicts each node once (i.e., nd p(d\\g)).",
        "In the graph-normalized model, we assume that the conditional distributions are independent of one another.",
        "In particular, we find the model parameters that maximize the likelihood of p(g*\\d), where g* is the correct parent in the training data.",
        "We perform the optimization over the entire training set, tying the feature parameters.",
        "In particular, we perform maximum entropy (MaxEnt) estimation over the conditional distribution using second-order gradient descent optimization techniques.",
        "An advantage of the parent-prediction model is that we can frame the estimation problem as that of minimum-error training with a zero-one loss term:",
        "where e G {0,1} is the error term (e is 1 for the correct parent and 0 for all other nodes) and Zd = Ej exp(Xi Xifi(ej,gj, d)) is the normalization constant for node d. Note that the normalization factor considers all graphs with in-degree zero for the root node and in-degree one for other nodes.",
        "At parsing time, of course, our parent predictions are constrained to produce a (non-projective) tree structure.",
        "We can sum over all non-projective spanning trees by taking the determinant of the Kirchhoff matrix of the graph defined above, minus the row and column corresponding to the root node (Smith and Smith, 2007).",
        "Training graph-normalized and tree-normalized models under identical conditions, we find tree normalization wins by 0.5% to 1% absolute dependency accuracy.",
        "Although tree normalization also shows a (smaller) advantage in k-best oracle accuracy, we do not believe it would have a large effect on our reranking results.",
        "The reranker is based on a conditional log-linear model subject to the MaxEnt constraints using the same second-order optimization procedures as the graph-normalized MST models.",
        "The primary difference here is that there is no single correct tree in the set of k candidate parse trees.",
        "Instead, we have k trees that are generated by our k-best parser, each with a score assigned by the parser.",
        "If we are performing labeled reranking, we label each of these hypotheses with l possible labelings, each with a score assigned by the labeler.",
        "As with the parent-prediction, graph-normalized model, we perform minimum-error training.",
        "The optimization is achieved by assuming the oracle-best parse(s) are correct and the remaining hypotheses are incorrect.",
        "Furthermore, the feature values are scaled according to the relative difference between the oracle-best score and the score assigned to the non-oracle-best hypothesis.",
        "Note that any reranker could be used in place of our current model.",
        "We have chosen to keep the reranker model closely related to the MST parsing model so that we can share feature representations and training procedures.",
        "We used the same edge features to train a separate log-linear labeling model.",
        "Each edge feature was conjoined with a potential label, and we then maximized the likelihood of the labeling in the training data.",
        "Since this model is also edge-factored, we can store the labeler scores for each of the n potential edges in the dependency tree.",
        "In the submitted system, we simply extracted the Viterbi predictions of the labeler for the unlabeled trees selected by the reranker.",
        "We also (see below) ran experiments where each entry in the k-best lists input as training data to the reranker was augmented by its l-best la-belings.",
        "We hoped thereby to inject more diversity into the resulting structures.",
        "Our MST models are based on the features described in (Hall, 2007); specifically, we use features based on a dependency nodes' form, lemma, coarse and fine part-of-speech tag, and morphological-string attributes.",
        "Additionally, we use surface-string distance between the parent and child, buckets of features indicating if a particular form/lemma/tag occurred between or next to the parent and child, and a branching feature indicating whether the child is to the left or right of the parent.",
        "Composite features, combining the above features are also included (e.g., a single feature combining branching, parent & child form, parent & child tag).",
        "The tree-based reranker includes the features described in (Hall, 2007) as well as features based on non-projective edge attributes explored in (Havelka, 2007a; Havelka, 2007b).",
        "One set of features models relationships of nodes with their siblings, including valency and subcategorization.",
        "A second set of features models global tree structure and includes features based on a node's ancestors and the depth and size of its subtree.",
        "A third set of features models the interaction of word order and tree structure as manifested on individual edges, i.e., the features model language specific projective and non-projective configurations.",
        "They include edge-based features corresponding to the global constraints of projectivity, planarity and well-nestedness, and for non-projective edges, they furthermore include level type, level signature and ancestor-in-gap features.",
        "All features allow for an arbitrary degree of lexical-ization; in the reported results, the first two sets of features use coarse and fine part-of-speech lexical-izations, while the features in the third set are used in their unlexicalized form due to time limitations."
