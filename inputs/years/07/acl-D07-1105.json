        "Computing consensus translations from the outputs of multiple machine translation engines has become a powerful means to improve translation quality in many machine translation tasks.",
        "Analogous to the ROVER approach in automatic speech recognition (Fiscus, 1997), a composite translation is computed by voting on the translation outputs of multiple machine translation systems.",
        "Depending on how the translations are combined and how the voting scheme is implemented, the composite translation may differ from any of the original hypotheses.",
        "While elementary approaches simply select for each sentence one of the original translations, more sophisticated methods allow for combining translations on a word or a phrase level.",
        "Although system combination could be shown to result in substantial improvements in terms of translation quality (Matusov et al., 2006; Sim et al., 2007), not every possible ensemble of translation outputs has the potential to outperform the primary translation system.",
        "In fact, an adverse combination of translation systems may even deteriorate translation quality.",
        "This holds to a greater extent, when the ensemble of translation outputs contains a significant number of translations produced by low performing but highly correlated systems.",
        "In this paper we present an empirical study on how different ensembles of translation outputs affect performance in system combination.",
        "In particular, we will address the following questions:",
        "• To what extent can translation quality benefit from combining systems developed by multiple research labs?",
        "Despite an increasing number of translation engines, most state-of-the-art systems in statistical machine translation are nowadays based on implementations of the same techniques.",
        "For instance, word alignment models are often trained using the GIZA++ toolkit (Och and Ney, 2003); error minimizing training criteria such as the Minimum Error Rate Training (Och, 2003) are employed in order to learn feature function weights for log-linear models; and translation candidates are produced using phrase-based decoders (Koehn et al., 2003) in combination with n-gram language models (Brants et al., 2007).",
        "All these methods are established as de facto standards and form an integral part of most statistical machine translation systems.",
        "This, however, raises the question as to what extent translation quality can be expected to improve when similarly designed systems are combined.",
        "• How can a set ofdiverse translation systems be built from a single translation engine?",
        "Without having access to different translation",
        "engines, it is desirable to build a large number of diverse translation systems from a single translation engine that are useful in system combination.",
        "The mere use of N-best lists and word lattices is often not effective, because N-best candidates may be highly correlated, thus resulting in small diversity compared to the first best hypothesis.",
        "Therefore, we need a canonical way to build a large pool of diverse translation systems from a single translation engine.",
        "• How can an ensemble of translation outputs be selected from a large pool oftranslation systems?",
        "Once a large pool of translation systems is available, we need an effective means to select a small ensemble of translation outputs for which the combined system outperforms the best individual system.",
        "These questions will be investigated on the basis of three approaches to system combination: (i) an MBR-like candidate selection method based on BLEU correlation matrices, (ii) confusion networks built from word sausages, and (iii) a novel two-pass search algorithm that aims at finding consensus translations by reordering bags of words constituting the consensus hypothesis.",
        "Experiments were performed on two Chinese-English text translation corpora under the conditions of the large data track as defined for the 2006 NIST machine translation evaluation (MT06).",
        "Results are reported for consensus translations built from system outputs provided by MT06 participants as well as systems derived from one ofthe best-ranked translation engines.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we describe three combination methods for computing consensus translations.",
        "In Sections 3.1 and 3.2, we present experimental results on combining system outputs provided by MT06 participants.",
        "Section 3.3 shows how correlation among translation systems affects performance in system combination.",
        "In Section 3.4, we discuss how a single translation engine can be modified in order to produce a large number of diverse translation systems.",
        "First experimental results using a greedy search algorithm to select a small ensemble of translation outputs from a large pool of canonically built translation systems are reported.",
        "A summary presented in Section 4 concludes the paper."

        "System combination in machine translation aims to build a composite translation from system outputs of multiple machine translation engines.",
        "Depending on how the systems are combined and which voting scheme is implemented, the consensus translation may differ from any of the original candidate translations.",
        "In this section, we discuss three approaches to system combination.",
        "The easiest and most straightforward approach to system combination simply returns one of the original candidate translations.",
        "Typically, this selection is made based on translation scores, confidence estimations, language and other models (Nomoto, 2004; Paul et al., 2005).",
        "For many machine translation systems, however, the scores are often not normalized or may even not be available, which makes it difficult to apply this technique.",
        "We therefore propose an alternative method based on \"correlation matrices\" computed from the BLEU performance measure (Papineni et al., 2001).",
        "Let ei,eM denote the outputs of M translation systems, each given as a sequence of words in the target language.",
        "An element of the BLEU correlation matrix B = (by) is defined as the sentence-based BLEU score between a candidate translation ei and a pseudo-reference translation ej (i,j = 1,...,M):",
        "Here, BP denotes the brevity penalty factor with pndesignating the n-gram precisions.",
        "Because the BLEU score is computed on a sentence rather than a corpus-level, n-gram precisions are capped by the maximum over Tyj – r and pn in order to avoid singularities, where |e^ is the length of the candidate translation .",
        "Due to the following properties, B can be interpreted as a correlation matrix, although the term does not hold in a strict mathematical sense: (i) bij € [0,1]; (ii) bij = 1.0 <=> e» = ej; (iii) bij = 0.0 <^^> ei n ej = 0, i.e., bij is zero if and only if none of the words which constitute ei can be found",
        "Note that for non-zero n-gram precisions, pn is always larger than",
        "in ej and vice versa.",
        "The BLEU correlation matrix is in general, however, not symmetric, although in practice, bij bji is typically negligible.",
        "Each translation system m is assigned to a system prior weight wm e [0,1], which reflects the performance of system m relatively to all other translation systems.",
        "If no prior knowledge is available, wm is set to 1 M.",
        "Now, let u> = (wi,wm)T denote a vector of system prior weights and let b1,bM denote the row vectors of the matrix B.",
        "Then the translation system with the highest consensus is given by:",
        "The candidate selection rule in Eq.",
        "(2) has two useful properties:",
        "• The selection does not depend on scored translation outputs; the mere target word sequence is sufficient.",
        "Hence, this technique is also applicable to rule-based translation systems .",
        "• Using the components of the row-vector bm as feature function values for the candidate translation em (m 1, ... , M), the system prior weights u> can easily be trained using the Minimum Error Rate Training described in",
        "(Och, 2003).",
        "Note that the candidate selection rule in Eq.",
        "(2) is equivalent to re-ranking candidate translations according to the Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decision rule (Kumar and Byrne, 2004), provided that the system prior weights are used as estimations of the posterior probabilities pe|f) for a source sentence f. Due to the proximity of this method to the MBR selection rule, we call this combination scheme MBR-like system combination.",
        "ROVER-like combination schemes aim at computing a composite translation by voting on confusion networks that are built from translation outputs of multiple machine translation engines via an iterative application of alignments (Fiscus, 1997).",
        "To accomplish this, one of the original candidate translations, e.g. em, is chosen as the primary translation hypothesis, while all other candidates en n m are aligned with the word sequence of the primary translation.",
        "To limit the costs when aligning a permutation of the primary translation, the alignment metric should allow for small shifts of contiguous word sequences in addition to the standard edit operations deletions, insertions, and substitutions.",
        "These requirements are met by the Translation Edit Rate (TER) (Snover et al., 2006):",
        "TER e e Del Ins Sub Shift (3)",
        "The outcome of the iterated alignments is a word transition network which is also known as word sausage because of the linear sequence of correspondence sets that constitute the network.",
        "Since both the order and the elements ofa correspondence set depend on the choice of the primary translation, each candidate translation is chosen in turn as the primary system.",
        "This results in a total of M word sausages that are combined into a single super network.",
        "The word sequence along the cost-minimizing path defines the composite translation.",
        "To further optimize the word sausages, we replace each system prior weight wm with the 1p-norm over the normalized scalar product between the weight vector u> and the row vector bm:",
        "As I approaches +co, w'm = 1 if and only if system m has the highest consensus among all input systems; otherwise, Wm = 0.",
        "Thus, the word sausages are able to emulate the candidate selection rule described in Section 2.1.",
        "Setting I = 0 yields uniform system prior weights, and setting B to the unity matrix provides the original prior weights vector.",
        "Word sausages which take advantage of the refined system prior weights are denoted by word sausages+.",
        "The basic idea of the two-pass search algorithm is to compute a consensus translation by reordering words that are considered to be constituents of the final consensus translation.",
        "Initially, the two-pass search is given a repository of candidate translations which serve as pseudo references together with a vector of system prior weights.",
        "In the first pass, the algorithm uses a greedy strategy to determine a bag of words which minimizes the position-independent word error rate (PER).",
        "These words are considered to be constituents of the final consensus translation.",
        "The greedy strategy implicitly ranks the constituents, i.e., words selected at the beginning of the first phase reduce the PER the most and are considered to be more important than constituents selected in the end.",
        "The first pass finishes when putting further constituents into the bag of words does not improve the PER.",
        "The list of constituents is then passed to a second search algorithm, which starts with the empty string and then expands all active hypotheses by systematically inserting the next unused word from the list of constituents at different positions in the current hypothesis.",
        "For instance, a partial consensus hypothesis of length l expands into l + 1 new hypotheses of length 1 + 1.",
        "The resulting hypotheses are scored with respect to the TER measure based on the repository of weighted pseudo references.",
        "Low-scoring hypotheses are pruned to keep the space of active hypotheses small.",
        "The algorithm will finish if either no constituents are left or if expanding the set of active hypotheses does not further decrease the TER score.",
        "Optionally, the best consensus hypothesis found by the two-pass search is combined with all input translation systems via the MBR-like combination scheme described in Section 2.1.",
        "This refinement is called two-pass+.",
        "Research on multi-engine machine translation goes back to the early nineties.",
        "In (Robert and Nirenburg, 1994), a semi-automatic approach is described that combines outputs from three translation systems to build a consensus translation.",
        "(Nomoto, 2004) and (Paul et al., 2005) used translation scores, language and other models to select one of the original translations as consensus translation.",
        "(Bangalore et al., 2001) used a multiple string alignment algorithm in order to compute a single confusion network, on which a consensus hypothesis was computed through majority voting.",
        "Because the alignment procedure was based on the Levenshtein distance, it was unable to align translations with significantly different word orders.",
        "(Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005) tried to overcome this problem by using confidence scores and language models in order to rank a collection of synthetic combinations of words extracted from the original translation hypotheses.",
        "Experimental results were only reported for the METEOR metric (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005).",
        "In (Matusov et al., 2006), pairwise word alignments of the original translation hypotheses were estimated for an enhanced statistical alignment model in order",
        "Table 1: Corpus statistics for two Chinese-English text translation sets: ZHEN-05 is a random selection oftest data used in NIST evaluations prior to 2006; ZHEN-06 comprises the NIST portion of the Chinese-English evaluation data used in the 2006 NIST machine translation evaluation.",

        "In this section, we investigate the effect of using non-uniform system weights for the combination of multiple research systems.",
        "Since for each research system, only the first best translation candidate was provided, we used a fivefold cross validation scheme in order to train and evaluate the system prior weights.",
        "For this purpose, all research systems were consistently split into five random partitions of almost equal size.",
        "The partitioning procedure was document preserving, i.e., sentences belonging to the same document were guaranteed to be assigned to the same partition.",

        "Consensus systems were computed for each held out set using the system prior weights estimated on the respective development sets.",

        "System 01 achieved the highest BLEU score on all five constellations of development partitions and is therefore the primary system to which all results in Table 3 compare.",
        "In comparison to uniform weights, consensus translations using trained weights are more robust toward the integration of low performing systems into the combination scheme.",
        "The best combined system obtained with trained system prior weights (01-14) is, however, not significantly better than the best combined system using uniform weights (01-04), for which the 95% confidence interval yields 0.17, 0.66] according to the paired bootstrap re-sampling method.",

        "In a first experiment, we trained approximately 200 systems using different parameter settings in training.",
