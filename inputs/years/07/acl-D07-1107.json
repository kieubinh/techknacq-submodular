        "Defining a discrete inventory of senses for a word is extremely difficult (Kilgarriff, 1997; Hanks, 2000; Palmer et al., 2005).",
        "Perhaps the greatest obstacle is the dynamic nature of sense definition: the correct granularity for word senses depends on the application.",
        "For language learners, a fine-grained set of word senses may help in learning subtle distinctions, while coarsely-defined senses are probably more useful in NLP tasks like information retrieval (Gon-zalo et al., 1998), query expansion (Moldovan and",
        "Mihalcea, 2000), and WSD (Resnik and Yarowsky, 1999; Palmer etal.,2005).",
        "Lexical resources such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) use extremely fine-grained notions of word sense, which carefully capture even minor distinctions between different possible word senses (e.g., the 8 noun senses of bass shown in Figure 1).",
        "Producing sense-clustered inventories of arbitrary sense granularity is thus crucial for tasks which depend on lexical resources like WordNet, and is also important for the task of automatically constructing new WordNet-like taxonomies.",
        "A solution to this problem must also deal with the constraints of the WordNet taxonomy itself; for example when clustering two senses, we need to consider the transitive effects of merging synsets.",
        "The state of the art in sense clustering is insufficient to meet these needs.",
        "Current sense clustering algorithms are generally unsupervised, each relying on a different set of useful features or hand-built rules.",
        "But handwritten rules have little flexibility to produce clusterings of different granularities, and previously proposed methods offer little in the direction of intelligently combining and weighting the many proposed features.",
        "In response to these challenges, we propose a new algorithm for clustering large-scale sense hierarchies like WordNet.",
        "Our algorithm is based on a supervised classifier that learns to make graduated judgments corresponding to the estimated probability that each particular sense pair should be merged.",
        "This classifier is trained on gold standard sense clustering judgments using a diverse feature space.",
        "We are able to use the outputs of our classifier to produce a ranked list of sense merge judgments by merge probability, and from this create sense-clustered inventories of arbitrary sense granularity.",

        "A wide number of manual and automatic techniques have been proposed for clustering sense inventories and mapping between sense inventories of different granularities.",
        "Much work has gone into methods for measuring synset similarity; early work in this direction includes (Dolan, 1994), which attempted to discover sense similarities between dictionary senses.",
        "A variety of synset similarity measures based on properties of WordNet itself have been proposed; nine such measures are discussed in (Pedersen et al., 2004), including gloss-based heuristics (Lesk, 1986; Banerjee and Pedersen, 2003), information-content based measures (Resnik, 1995; Lin, 1998; Jiang and Conrath, 1997), and others.",
        "Other approaches have used specific cues from WordNet structure to inform the construction of semantic rules; for example, (Peters et al., 1998) suggest clustering two senses based on a wide variety of structural cues from WordNet, including if they are twins (if two synsets share more than one word in their synonym list) or if they represent an example of autohyponymy (if one sense is the direct descendant of the other).",
        "(Mihal-cea and Moldovan, 2001) implements six semantic rules, using twin and autohyponym features, in addition to other WordNet-structure-based rules such as whether two synsets share apertainym, antonym, or are clustered together in the same verb group.",
        "A large body of work has attempted to capture corpus-based estimates of word similarity (Pereira et al., 1993; Lin, 1998); however, the lack of large sense-tagged corpora prevent most such techniques from being used effectively to compare different senses of the same word.",
        "Some corpus-based attempts that are capable of estimating similarity between word senses include the topic signatures method; here, (Agirre and Lopez, 2003) collect contexts for a polysemous word based either on sense-tagged corpora or by using a weighted agglomeration of contexts of a polysemous word's monose-mous relatives (i.e., single-sense synsets related by hypernym, hyponym, or other relations) from some large untagged corpus.",
        "Other corpus-based techniques developed specifically for sense clustering include (McCarthy, 2006), which uses a combination of word-to-word distributional similarity combined with the JCN WordNet-based similarity measure, and work by (Chugur et al., 2002) in finding co-occurrences of senses within documents in sense-tagged corpora.",
        "Other attempts have exploited disagreements between WSD systems (Agirre and Lopez, 2003) or between human labelers (Chklovski and Mihalcea, 2003) to create synset similarity measures; while promising, these techniques are severely limited by the performance of the WSD systems or the amount of available labeled data.",
        "Some approaches for clustering have made use of regular patterns of polysemy among words.",
        "(Peters et al., 1998) uses the Cousin relation defined in WordNet 1.5 to cluster hyponyms ofcategorically related noun synsets, e.g., \"container/quantity\" (e.g., for clustering senses of \"cup\" or \"barrel\") or \"organization/construction\" (e.g., for the building and institution senses of \"hospital\" or \"school\"); other approaches based on systematic polysemy include the hand-constructed CORELEX database (Buite-laar, 1998), and automatic attempts to extract patterns of systematic polysemy based on minimal description length principles (Tomuro, 2001).",
        "Another family of approaches has been to use either manually-annotated or automatically-constructed mappings to coarser-grained sense inventories; an attempt at providing coarse-grained sense distinctions for the Senseval-1 exercise included a mapping between WordNet and the Hector lexicon (Palmer et al., 2005).",
        "Other attempts in this vein include mappings between WordNet and PropBank (Palmer et al., 2004) and mappings to Levin classes (Levin, 1993; Palmer et al., 2005).",
        "(Navigli, 2006) presents an automatic approach for mapping between sense inventories; here similarities in gloss definition and structured relations between the two sense inventories are exploited in order to map between WordNet senses and distinctions made within the coarser-grained Oxford English Dictionary.",
        "Other work has attempted to exploit translational equivalences of WordNet senses in other languages, for example using foreign language WordNet interlingual indexes (Gonzalo et al., 1998; Chugur et al., 2002).",

        "In this work we focus on two datasets of hand-labeled sense groupings for WordNet: first, a dataset of sense groupings over nouns, verbs, and adjectives provided as part of the Senseval-2 English lexical sample WSD task (Kilgarriff, 2001), and second, a corpus-driven mapping of nouns and verbs in WordNet 2.1 to the Omega Ontology (Philpot et al., 2005), produced as part of the OntoNotes project (Hovy et al., 2006).",
        "A wide variety of semantic and syntactic criteria were used to produce the Senseval-2 groupings (Palmer et al., 2004; Palmer et al., 2005); this data covers all senses of 411 nouns, 519 verbs, and 257 adjectives, and has been used as gold standard sense clustering data in previous work (Agirre and Lopez, 2003; McCarthy, 2006).",
        "The number of judgments within this data (after mapping to WordNet 2.1) is displayed in Table 1.",
        "Due to a lack of interannotator agreement data for this dataset, (McCarthy, 2006) performed an annotation study using three labelers on a 20-noun subset of the Senseval-2 groupings; the three labelers were given the task of deciding whether the 351 potentially-related sense pairs were \"Related\", \"Unrelated\", or \"Don't Know\".",

        "The OntoNotes dataset covers a smaller set of nouns and verbs, but it has been created with a more rigorous corpus-based iterative annotation process.",
        "For each of the nouns and verbs in question, a 50-sentence sample of instances is annotated using a preliminary set of sense distinctions; if the word sense interannotator agreement for the sample is less than 90%, then the sense distinctions are revised and the sample is re-annotated, and so forth, until an in-terannotator agreement of at least 90% is reached.",
        "We construct a combined gold standard set from these Senseval-2 and OntoNotes groupings, removing disagreements.",
        "The overlap and agreement/disagreement data between the two groupings is given in Table 2; here, for example, the column with ON-True and SF indicates the count of senses that OntoNotes judged as positive examples of sense merging, but that Senseval-2 data did not merge.",

        "Previous attempts at categorizing systematic polysemy patterns within WordNet has resulted in the Cousin feature; we create binary features which indicate whether a synset pair belong to hypernym ancestries indicated by one or more of these Cousin features, and the specific cousin pair(s) involved.",
        "Finally we create sense-specific features, including SenseCount, the total number of senses associated with the shared word between the two synsets with the highest number of senses, and SenseNum, the specific pairing of senses for the shared word with the highest number of senses (which might allow us to learn whether the most frequent sense of a word has a higher chance of having similar derivative senses with lower frequency).",

        "In order to consistently merge two noun senses with different hyper-nym ancestries within WordNet, for example, an algorithm must decide whether to have the new sense inherit both hypernym ancestries, or whether to inherit only one, and if so it must decide which ancestry is more relevant for the merged sense.",

        "In order to evaluate the entire sense-clustered taxonomy, we have employed an evaluation method inspired by Word Sense Disambiguation (this is similar to an evaluation used in Navigli, 2006, however we do not remove monose-mous clusters).",
