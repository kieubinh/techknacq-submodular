        "The features are incorporated into a modified naive Bayes network alongside other features such as part-of-speech of neighboring words, single words in the surrounding context, local collocations, and syntactic patterns.",

        "Natural language tends to be ambiguous.",
        "A word often has more than one meanings depending on the context.",
        "Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is a natural language processing (NLP) task in which the correct meaning (sense) of a word in a given context is to be determined.",
        "Supervised corpus-based approach has been the most successful in WSD to date.",
        "In such an approach, a corpus in which ambiguous words have been annotated with correct senses is first collected.",
        "Knowledge sources, or features, from the context of the annotated word are extracted to form the training data.",
        "A learning algorithm, like the support vector machine (SVM) or naive Bayes, is then applied on the training data to learn the model.",
        "Finally, in testing, the learnt model is applied on the test data to assign the correct sense to any ambiguous word.",
        "The features used in these systems usually include local features, such as part-of-speech (POS) of neighboring words, local collocations , syntactic patterns and global features such as single words in the surrounding context (bag-of-words) (Lee and Ng, 2002).",
        "However, due to the data scarcity problem, these features are usually very sparse in the training data.",
        "There are, on average, 11 and 28 training cases per sense in Senseval 2 and 3 lexical sample task respectively, and 6.5 training cases per sense in the SemCor corpus.",
        "This problem is especially prominent for the bag-of-words feature; more than hundreds of bag-of-words are usually extracted for each training instance and each feature could be drawn from any English word.",
        "A direct consequence is that the global context information, which the bag-of-words feature is supposed to capture, may be poorly represented.",
        "Our approach tries to address this problem by clustering features to relieve the scarcity problem, specifically on the bag-of-words feature.",
        "In the process, we construct topic features, trained using the latent dirichlet allocation (LDA) algorithm.",
        "We train the topic model (Blei et al., 2003) on unlabeled data, clustering the words occurring in the corpus to a predefined number of topics.",
        "We then use the resulting topic model to tag the bag-of-words in the labeled corpus with topic distributions.",
        "We incorporate the distributions, called the topic features, using a simple Bayesian network, modified from naive Bayes model, alongside other features and train the model on the labeled corpus.",
        "The approach gives good performance on both the lexical sample and all-words tasks on Senseval data.",
        "The paper makes mainly two contributions.",
        "First, we are able to show that a feature that efficiently captures the global context information using LDA algorithm can significantly improve the WSD accuracy.",
        "Second, we are able to obtain this feature from unlabeled data, which spares us from any manual labeling work.",
        "We also showcase the potential strength of Bayesian network in the WSD task, obtaining performance that rivals state-of-arts methods."

        "Many WSD systems try to tackle the data scarcity problem.",
        "Unsupervised learning is introduced primarily to deal with the problem, but with limited success (Snyder and Palmer, 2004).",
        "In another approach, the learning algorithm borrows training instances from other senses and effectively increases the training data size.",
        "In (Kohomban and Lee, 2005), the classifier is trained using grouped senses for verbs and nouns according to WordNet top-level synsets and thus effectively pooling training cases across senses within the same synset.",
        "Similarly, (Ando, 2006) exploits data from related tasks, using all labeled examples irrespective of target words for learning each sense using the Alternating Structure Optimization (ASO) algorithm (Ando and Zhang, 2005a; Ando and Zhang, 2005b).",
        "Parallel texts is proposed in (Resnik and Yarowsky, 1997) as potential training data and (Chan and Ng, 2005) has shown that using automatically gathered parallel texts for nouns could significantly increase WSD accuracy, when tested on Senseval-2 English all-words task.",
        "Our approach is somewhat similar to that of using generic language features such as POS tags; the words are tagged with its semantic topic that may be trained from other corpuses."

        "LDA is a probabilistic model for collections of discrete data and has been used in document modeling and text classification.",
        "It can be represented as a three level hierarchical Bayesian model, shown graphically in Figure 1.",
        "Given a corpus consisting of M documents, LDA models each document using a mixture over K topics, which are in turn characterized as distributions over words.",
        "In the generative process of LDA, for each document d we first draw the mixing proportion over topics 9d from a Dirichlet prior with parameters a.",
        "Next, for each of the Nd words wdn in document d, a topic zdn is first drawn from a multinomial distribution with parameters 9d.",
        "Finally wdn is drawn from the topic specific distribution over words.",
        "The probability of a word token w taking on value i given that topic z = j was chosen is parameterized using a matrix P with = p(w = i|z = j).",
        "Integrating out 0d's and zdn's, the probability p(D|a, P) of the corpus is thus:",
        "Unfortunately, it is intractable to directly solve the posterior distribution ofthe hidden variables given a document, namely p(9, z|w, a, P).",
        "However, (Blei et al., 2003) has shown that by introducing a set of variational parameters, 7 and 0, a tight lower bound on the log likelihood of the probability can be found using the following optimization procedure:",
        "7 is the Dirichlet parameter for 0 and the multinomial parameters (01 • • • 0N) are the free variational parameters.",
        "Note here 7 is document specific instead of corpus specific like a. Graphically, it is represented as Figure 2.",
        "The optimizing values of 7 and 0 can be found by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the variational distribution and the true posterior.",
        "For both the lexical sample and all-words tasks, we use the following standard baseline features for comparison.",
        "POS Tags For each training or testing word, w, we include POS tags for P words prior to as well as after w within the same sentence boundary.",
        "We also include the POS tag of w. If there are fewer than P words prior or after w in the same sentence, we denote the corresponding feature as NIL.",
        "Local Collocations Collocation Ci;j refers to the ordered sequence of tokens (words or punctuations) surrounding w. The starting and ending position of the sequence are denoted i and j respectively, where a negative value refers to the token position prior to w. We adopt the same 11 collocation features as (Lee and Ng, 2002), namely C_i_i, CM, C-2,-2, and C1;3.",
        "Bag-of-Words For each training or testing word, w, we get G words prior to as well as after w, within the same document.",
        "These features are position insensitive.",
        "The words we extract are converted back to their morphological root forms.",

        "The exact values of P and G for each task are set according to cross validation result.",

        "The conditional probability p(wi|zj) = Pij is later used to tag the words in the unseen test example with the probability of each topic.",

        "As SVM deals with only observed features, we need to transform b both in the training data and in the testing data.",
        "Compared to (Lee and Ng, 2002), the only difference is that for each training and testing case, we have additional L * K LDA features, since there are L bag-of-words and each has a topic distribution represented by K values."
