        "Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is the task of determining the meaning of an ambiguous word in its context.",
        "It is an important problem in natural language processing (NLP) because effective WSD can improve systems for tasks such as information retrieval, machine translation, and summarization.",
        "In this paper, we develop latent Dirichlet allocation with WordNet (LDAWN), a generative probabilistic topic model for WSD where the sense of the word is a hidden random variable that is inferred from data.",
        "There are two central advantages to this approach.",
        "First, with LDAWN we automatically learn the context in which a word is disambiguated.",
        "Rather than disambiguating at the sentence-level or the document-level, our model uses the other words that share the same hidden topic across many documents.",
        "Second, LDAWN is a fully-fledged generative model.",
        "Generative models are modular and can be easily combined and composed to form more complicated models.",
        "(As a canonical example, the ubiquitous hidden Markov model is a series of mixture models chained together.)",
        "Thus, developing a generative model for WSD gives other generative NLP algorithms a natural way to take advantage of the hidden senses of words.",
        "In general, topic models are statistical models of text that posit a hidden space of topics in which the corpus is embedded (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "Given a corpus, posterior inference in topic models amounts to automatically discovering the underlying themes that permeate the collection.",
        "Topic models have recently been applied to information retrieval (Wei and Croft, 2006), text classification (Blei et al., 2003), and dialogue segmentation (Purver et al., 2006).",
        "While topic models capture the polysemous use of words, they do not carry the explicit notion of sense that is necessary for WSD.",
        "LDAWN extends the topic modeling framework to include a hidden meaning in the word generation process.",
        "In this case, posterior inference discovers both the topics of the corpus and the meanings assigned to each of its words.",
        "After introducing a disambiguation scheme based on probabilistic walks over the WordNet hierarchy (Section 2), we embed the WordNet-Walk in a topic model, where each topic is associated with walks that prefer different neighborhoods of WordNet (Section 2.1).",
        "Then, we describe a Gibbs sampling algorithm for approximate posterior inference that learns the senses and topics that best explain a corpus (Section 3).",
        "Finally, we evaluate our system on real-world WSD data, discuss the properties of the topics and disambiguation accuracy results, and draw connections to other WSD algorithms from the research literature.",

        "The WordNet-Walk is a probabilistic process of word generation that is based on the hyponomy relationship in WordNet (Miller, 1990).",
        "WordNet, a lexical resource designed by psychologists and lexicographers to mimic the semantic organization in the human mind, links \"synsets\" (short for synonym sets) with myriad connections.",
        "The specific relation we're interested in, hyponomy, points from general concepts to more specific ones and is sometimes called the \"is-a\" relationship.",
        "As first described by Abney and Light (1999), we imagine an agent who starts at synset [entity], which points to every noun in WordNet 2.1 by some sequence of hyponomy relations, and then chooses the next node in its random walk from the hyponyms of its current position.",
        "The agent repeats this process until it reaches a leaf node, which corresponds to a single word (each of the synset's words are unique leaves of a synset in our construction).",
        "For an example of all the paths that might generate the word \"colt\" see Figure 1.",
        "The WordNet-Walk is parameterized by a set of distributions over children for each synset s in WordNet, /3s.",
        "The WordNet-Walk has two important properties.",
        "First, it describes a random process for word generation.",

        "Second, the synset that produces each word is a hidden random variable.",
        "Given a word assumed to be generated by a WordNet-Walk, we can use posterior inference to predict which synset produced the word.",

        "In the case of LDAWN, the hidden variables are the parameters of the K WordNet-Walks, the topic assignments of each word in the collection, and the synset path of each word.",
        "In a sense, posterior inference reverses the process described above.",
        "Specifically, given a document collection w\\:D, the full posterior is where the constant of proportionality is the marginal likelihood of the observed data.",
        "Note that by encoding the synset paths as a hidden variable, we have posed the WSD problem as a question of posterior probabilistic inference.",
        "Further note that we have developed an unsupervised model.",
        "No labeled data is needed to disambiguate a corpus.",
        "Learning the posterior distribution amounts to simultaneously decomposing a corpus into topics and its words into their synsets.",
        "The intuition behind LDAWN is that the words in a topic will have similar meanings and thus share paths within WordNet.",
        "For example, WordNet has two senses for the word \"colt;\" one referring to a young male horse and the other to a type of handgun (see Figure 1).",
        "Although we have no a priori way of knowing which of the two paths to favor for a document, we assume that similar concepts will also appear in the document.",
        "Documents with unambiguous nouns such as \"six-shooter\" and \"smoothbore\" would make paths that pass through the synset [firearm, piece, small-arm] more likely than those going through [animal, animate being, beast, brute, creature, fauna] .",
        "In practice, we hope to see a WordNet-Walk that looks like Figure 2, which points to the right sense of cancer for a medical context.",
        "LDAWN is a Bayesian framework, as each variable has a prior distribution.",
        "In particular, the Dirichlet prior for //s, specified by a scaling factor S and a normalized vector as fulfills two functions.",
        "First, as the overall strength of S increases, we place a greater emphasis on the prior.",
        "This is equivalent to the need for balancing as noted by Abney and Light (1999).",
        "The other function that the Dirichlet prior serves is to enable us to encode any information we have about how we suspect the transitions to children nodes will be distributed.",
        "For instance, we might expect that the words associated with a synset will be produced in a way roughly similar to the token probability in a corpus.",
        "For example, even though \"meal\" might refer to both ground cereals or food eaten at a single sitting and \"repast\" exclusively to the latter, the synset [meal, repast, food eaten at a single sitting] still prefers to transition to \"meal\" over \"repast\" given the overall corpus counts (see Figure 1, which shows prior transition probabilities for \"revolver\").",
        "By setting as>i, the prior probability of transitioning from synset s to node i, proportional to the total number of observed tokens in the children of i, we introduce a probabilistic variation on information content (Resnik, 1995).",
        "As in Resnik's definition, this value for non-word nodes is equal to the sum of all the frequencies of hyponym words.",
        "Unlike Resnik, we do not divide frequency among all senses of a word; each sense of a word contributes its full frequency to a."

        "As described above, the problem of WSD corresponds to posterior inference: determining the probability distribution of the hidden variables given observed words and then selecting the synsets of the most likely paths as the correct sense.",
        "Directly computing this posterior distribution, however, is not tractable because of the difficulty of calculating the normalizing constant in Equation 1.",
        "To approximate the posterior, we use Gibbs sampling, which has proven to be a successful approximate inference technique for LDA (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004).",
        "In Gibbs sampling, like all Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, we repeatedly sample from a Markov chain whose stationary distribution is the posterior of interest (Robert and Casella, 2004).",

        "Gibbs sampling reproduces the posterior distribution by repeatedly sampling each hidden variable conditioned on the current state of the other hidden variables and observations.",

        "The second term in Equation 2 is a sum over the probabilities of every path that could have generated the word wu.",
        "In practice, this sum can be computed using a dynamic program for all nodes that have unique parent (i.e. those that can't be reached by more than one path).",
        "Although the probability of a path is specific to the topic, as the transition probabilities for a synset are different across topics, we will omit the topic index in the equation,",
        "Computing the probability of a path requires us to take a product over our estimate of the probability from transitioning from i to j for all nodes i and j in the path A.",
        "The other path assignments within this topic, however, play an important role in shaping the transition probabilities.",
        "From the perspective of a single node i, only paths that pass through that node affect the probability of u also passing through that node.",
        "It's convenient to have an explicit count of all of the paths that transition from i to j in this topic's WordNet-Walk, so we use Ti\"_ju to represent all of the paths that go from i to j in a topic other than the path currently assigned to u.",

        "The next step, once we've selected a topic, is to select a path within that topic.",
        "This requires the computation of the path probabilities as specified in Equation 4 for all of the paths wu can take in the sampled topic and then sampling from the path probabilities.",
        "The Gibbs sampler is essentially a randomized hill climbing algorithm on the posterior likelihood as a function of the configuration of hidden variables.",
        "The numerator of Equation 1 is proportional to that posterior and thus allows us to track the sampler's progress.",

        "In the vast majority of cases, a single synset's high probability is responsible for the words' positions on the list.",
        "Reassuringly, many of the top senses for the present words correspond to the most frequent sense in SemCor.",
        "For example, in Topic 4, the senses for \"space\" and \"function\" correspond to the top senses in SemCor, and while the top sense for \"set\" corresponds to \"an abstract collection of numbers or symbols\" rather than \"a group of the same kind that belong together and are so used,\" it makes sense given the math-based words in the topic.",

        "Another interesting property of topics in LDAWN is that, with higher levels of smoothing, words that don't appear in a corpus (or appear rarely) but are in similar parts of WordNet might have relatively high probability in a topic.",

        "Words such as \"kid,\" \"may,\" \"shear,\" \"coach,\" \"incident,\" \"fence,\" \"bee,\" and (previously used as an example) \"colt\" were all perfectly disambiguated by this method.",
        "Figure 2 shows the WordNet-Walk corresponding to a medical topic that correctly disambiguates \"cancer.\"",
        "Problems arose, however, with highly frequent words, such as \"man\" and \"time\" that have many senses and can occur in many types of documents.",
        "For example, \"man\" can be associated with many possible meanings: island, game equipment, servant, husband, a specific mammal, etc.",
        "Although we know that the \"adult male\" sense should be preferred, the alternative meanings will also be likely if they can be assigned to a topic that shares common paths in WordNet; the documents contain, however, many other places, jobs, and animals which are reasonable explanations (to LDAWN) of how \"man\" was generated.",
        "Unfortunately, \"man\" is such a ubiquitous term that topics, which are derived from the frequency of words within an entire document, are ultimately uninformative about its usage.",
        "While mistakes on these highly frequent terms significantly hurt our accuracy, errors associated with less frequent terms reveal that WordNet's structure is not easily transformed into a probabilistic graph.",
        "For instance, there are two senses of the word \"quarterback,\" a player in American football.",
        "One is position itself and the other is a person playing that position.",
        "While one would expect co-occurrence in sentences such as \"quarterback is a easy position, so our quarterback is happy,\" the paths to both terms share only the root node, thus making it highly unlikely a topic would cover both senses.",
        "Because of WordNet's breadth, rare senses also impact disambiguation.",
        "For example, the metonymical use of \"door\" to represent a whole building as in the phrase \"girl next door\" is under the same parent as sixty other synsets containing \"bridge,\" \"balcony,\" \"body,\" \"arch,\" \"floor,\" and \"corner.\"",
        "Surrounded by such common terms that are also likely to co-occur with the more conventional meanings of door, this very rare sense becomes the preferred disambiguation of \"door.\""

        "Abney and Light's initial probabilistic WSD approach (1999) was further developed into a Bayesian network model by Ciaramita and Johnson (2000), who likewise used the appearance of monosemous terms close to ambiguous ones to \"explain away\" the usage of ambiguous terms in selectional restrictions.",
        "We have adapted these approaches and put them into the context of a topic model.",
        "Recently, other approaches have created ad hoc connections between synsets in WordNet and then considered walks through the newly created graph.",
        "Given the difficulties of using existing connections in WordNet, Mihalcea (2005) proposed creating links between adjacent synsets that might comprise a sentence, initially setting weights to be equal to the Lesk overlap between the pairs, and then using the PageRank algorithm to determine the stationary distribution over synsets.",
        "Yarowsky was one of the first to contend that \"there is one sense for discourse\" (1992).",
        "This has lead to the approaches like that of Magnini (Magnini et al., 2001) that attempt to find the category of a text, select the most appropriate synset, and then assign the selected sense using domain annotation attached to WordNet.",
        "LDAWN is different in that the categories are not an a priori concept that must be painstakingly annotated within WordNet and require no augmentation of WordNet.",
        "This technique could indeed be used with any hierarchy.",
        "Our concepts are the ones that best partition the space of documents and do the best job of describing the distinctions of diction that separate documents from different domains.",
        "Our approach gives a probabilistic method of using information content (Resnik, 1995) as a starting point that can be adjusted to cluster words in a given topic together; this is similar to the Jiang-Conrath similarity measure (1997), which has been used in many applications in addition to disambiguation.",
        "Patwardhan (2003) offers a broad evaluation of similarity measures for WSD.",
        "Our technique for combining the cues of topics and distance in WordNet is adjusted in a way similar in spirit to Buitelaar and Sacaleanu (2001), but we consider the appearance of a single term to be evidence for not just that sense and its immediate neighbors in the hyponomy tree but for all of the sense's children and ancestors.",
        "Like McCarthy (2004), our unsupervised system acquires a single predominant sense for a domain based on a synthesis of information derived from a textual corpus, topics, and WordNet-derived similarity, a probabilistic information content measure.",
        "By adding syntactic information from a thesaurus derived from syntactic features (taken from Lin's automatically generated thesaurus (1998)), McCarthy achieved 48% accuracy in a similar evaluation on SemCor; LDAWN is thus substantially less effective in disambiguation compared to state-of-the-art methods.",
        "This suggests, however, that other methods might be improved by adding topics and that our method might be improved by using more information than word counts."

        "The LDAWN model presented here makes two contributions to research in automatic word sense disambiguation.",
        "First, we demonstrate a method for automatically partitioning a document into topics that includes explicit semantic information.",
        "Second, we show that, at least for one simple model of WSD, embedding a document in probabilistic latent structure, i.e., a \"topic,\" can improve WSD.",
        "There are two avenues of research with LDAWN that we will explore.",
        "First, the statistical nature of this approach allows LDAWN to be used as a component in larger models for other language tasks.",
        "Other probabilistic models of language could insert the ability to query synsets or paths of WordNet.",
        "Similarly, any topic based information retrieval scheme could employ topics that include semantically relevant (but perhaps unobserved) terms.",
        "Incorporating this model in a larger syntactically-aware model, which could benefit from the local context as well as the document level context, is an important component of future research.",
        "Second, the results presented here show a marked improvement in accuracy as more topics are added to the baseline model, although the final result is not comparable to state-of-the-art techniques.",
        "As most errors were attributable to the hyponomy structure of WordNet, incorporating the novel use of topic modeling presented here with a more mature unsupervised WSD algorithm to replace the underlying WordNet-Walk could lead to advances in state-of-the-art unsupervised WSD accuracy."
