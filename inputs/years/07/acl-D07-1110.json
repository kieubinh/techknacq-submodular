        "The task of automatically identifying Multiword Expressions (MWEs) like phrasal verbs (break down) and compound nouns (coffee machine) using statistical measures has been the focus of considerable investigative effort, (e.g. Pearce (2002), Evert and Krenn (2005) and Zhang et al.",
        "(2006)).",
        "Given the heterogeneousness of the different phenomena that are considered to be MWEs, there is no consensus about which method is best suited for which type of MWE, and if there is a single method that can be successfully used for any kind of MWE.",
        "Another difficulty for work on MWE identification is that of the evaluation of the results obtained (Pearce, 2002; Evert and Krenn, 2005), starting from the lack of consensus about a precise definition for MWEs (Villavicencio et al., 2005).",
        "In this paper we investigate some of the issues involved in the evaluation of automatically extracted MWEs, from their extraction to their subsequent use in an NLP task.",
        "In order to do that, we present a discussion of different statistical measures, and the influence that the size and quality of different data sources have.",
        "We then perform a comparison of these measures and discuss whether there is a single measure that has good overall performance for MWEs in general, regardless of their type.",
        "Finally, we perform a qualitative evaluation of the results of adding automatically extracted MWEs to a linguistic resource, taking as basis for the evaluation the approach proposed by Zhang et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "We argue that such results can improve in quality if a more compositional approach to MWE encoding is adopted for the grammar extension.",
        "Having more accurate means of deciding for an appropriate method for identifying and incorporating MWEs is critical for maintaining the quality of linguistic resources for precise NLP.",
        "This paper starts with a discussion of MWEs (§ 2), of their coverage in linguistic resources (§ 3), and of some methods proposed for automatically identifying them (§ 4).",
        "This is followed by a detailed investigation and comparison of measures for MWE identification (§ 5).",
        "After that we present an approach for predicting appropriate lexico-syntactic categories for their inclusion in a linguistic resource, and an evaluation of the results in a parsing task(§ 7).",

        "The term Multiword Expressions has been used to describe expressions for which the syntactic or semantic properties of the whole expression cannot be derived from its parts (Sag et al., 2002), including a large number of related but distinct phenomena, such as phrasal verbs (e.g. come along), nominal compounds (e.g. frying pan), institutionalised phrases (e.g. bread and butter), and many others.",
        "Jackendoff (1997) estimates the number of MWEs in a speaker's lexicon to be comparable to the number of single words.",
        "However, due to their heterogeneous characteristics, MWEs present a tough challenge for both linguistic and computational work (Sag et al., 2002).",
        "For instance, some MWEs are fixed, and do not present internal variation, such as ad hoc, while others allow different degrees of internal variability and modification, such as spill beans (spill several/musical/mountains of beans).",
        "Sag et al.",
        "(2002) discuss two main approaches commonly employed in NLP for treating MWEs: the words-with-spaces approach models an MWE as a single lexical entry and it can adequately capture fixed MWEs like by and large.",
        "A compositional approach treats MWEs by general and compositional methods of linguistic analysis, being able to capture more syntactically flexible MWEs, like rock boat, which cannot be satisfactorily captured by a words-with-spaces approach, since it would require lexical entries to be added for all the possible variations of an MWE (e.g. rock/rocks/rocking this/that/his... boat).",

        "Unfortunately, the construction of these resources is the manual result of human efforts and therefore likely to contain errors of omission and commission (Briscoe and Carroll, 1997).",
        "Furthermore, due to the open-ended and dynamic nature of languages, such linguistic resources are likely to be incomplete, and manual encoding of new entries and constructions is labour-intensive and costly.",

        "In order to do that, one commonly used approach is to employ statistical measures (e.g. Pearce (2002) for collocations and Zhang et al.",

        "For this work in particular, we expect that the relative ordering in frequency for different n-grams is preserved across corpora, in the same domain (e.g. a corpus of chemistry articles).",
        "For, if this is not the case, different conclusions are certain to be drawn from different corpora.",

        "To evaluate the grammar accuracy, we manually checked the parser outputs for the sentences in the sub-corpus which received at least one analysis from the grammar before and after the lexical extension.",
        "Before the lexical extension, 48 sentences are parsed, among which 32 (66.7%) sentences contain at least one correct reading (table 4).",
        "After adding the 21 new lexical entries, 153 sentences are parsed, out of which 124 (81.0%) sentences contain at least one correct reading.",
        "Baldwin et al.",
        "(2004) reported in an earlier study that for BNC data, about 83% of the sentences covered by the ERG have a correct parse.",
        "In our experiment, we observed a much lower accuracy on the sub-corpus of BNC which contains a lot of MWEs.",
        "However, after the lexical extension, the accuracy of the grammar recovers to the normal level.",
        "It is also worth noticing that we did not receive a larger average number of analyses per sentence (table 4), as it was largely balanced by the significant increase of sentences covered by the new lexical entries.",
        "We also found that the disambiguation model as described by",
        "Toutanova et al.",
        "(2002) performed reasonably well, and the best analysis is ranked among top-5 for 66% of the cases, and top-10 for 75%.",
        "All of these indicate that our approach of lexical acquisition for head words of MWEs achieves a significant improvement in grammar coverage without damaging the grammar accuracy.",
        "Optionally, the grammar developers can check the validity of the lexical entries before they are added into the lexicon.",
        "Nonetheless, even a semi-automatic procedure like this can largely reduce the manual work of grammar writers."

        "In this paper we looked at some of the issues involved in the evaluation of the identification of MWEs.",
        "In particular we evaluated the use of three statistical measures for automatically identifying MWEs.",
        "The results suggest that at least two of them (MI and PE) can distinguish MWEs.",
        "In terms of the corpora used, a surprisingly higher level of agreement was found between different corpora (Google and Yahoo) than between two fragments of the same one.",
        "This tells us two lessons.",
        "First that even though Google and Yahoo were not carefully built to be language corpora their sizes compensate for that making them fairly good samples of language usage.",
        "Second, a fraction of a smaller well balanced corpus may not necessarily be as balanced as the whole.",
        "Furthermore, we argued that for precise grammar engineering it is important to perform a careful evaluation of the effects of including automatically acquired MWEs to a grammar.",
        "We looked at the evaluation of the effects in coverage, size of the grammar and accuracy of the parses after adding the MWE-candidates.",
        "We adopted a compositional approach to the encoding of MWEs, using some heuristics to detect the head of an MWE, and this resulted in a smaller grammar than that by Zhang et al.",
        "(2006), still achieving a similar increase in coverage and maintaining a high level of accuracy of parses, comparable to that reported by Baldwin et al.",
        "(2004).",
        "The statistical measures are currently only used in a preprocessing step to filter the non-MWEs for the lexical type predictor.",
        "Alternatively, the statistical outcomes can be incorporated more tightly, i.e. to combine with the lexical type predictor and give confidence scores on the resulting lexical entries.",
