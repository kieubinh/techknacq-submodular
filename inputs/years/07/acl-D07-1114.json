        "The explosive increase in Web communication has attracted increasing interest in technologies for automatically mining personal opinions from Web documents such as product reviews and weblogs.",
        "Such technologies would benefit users who seek reviews on certain consumer products of interest.",
        "Previous approaches to the task of mining a large-scale document collection of customer opinions (or '",
        "Currently, NTT Cyber Space Laboratories, 1-1, Hikarinooka, Yokosuka, Kanagawa, 239-0847 Japan reviews) can be classified into two approaches: Document classification and information extraction.",
        "The former is the task of classifying documents or passages according to their semantic orientation such as positive vs. negative.",
        "This direction has been forming the mainstream of research on opinion-sensitive text processing (Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002, etc.).",
        "The latter, on the other hand, focuses on the task of extracting opinions consisting of information about, for example, 'who feels how about which aspect of what product' from unstructured text data.",
        "In this paper, we refer to this information extraction-oriented task as opinion extraction.",
        "In contrast to sentiment classification, opinion extraction aims at producing richer information and requires an in-depth analysis of opinions, which has only recently been attempted by a growing but still relatively small research community (Yi et al., 2003; Hu and Liu, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005, etc.).",
        "Most previous work on customer opinion extraction assumes the source of information to be customer reviews collected from customer review sites (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Hu and Liu, 2004; Liu et al., 2005).",
        "In contrast, in this paper, we consider the task of extracting customer opinions from unstructured weblog posts.",
        "Compared with extraction from review articles, extraction from weblogs is more challenging because weblog posts tend to exhibit greater diversity in topics, goals, vocabulary, style, etc. and are much more likely to include descriptions irrelevant to the subject in question.",
        "In this paper, we first describe our task setting of opinion extraction.",
        "We conducted a corpus study and investigated the feasibility of the task def-1065 inition by showing the statistics and inter-annotator agreement of our corpus annotation.",
        "Next, we show that the crucial body of the above opinion extraction task can be decomposed into two kinds of relation extraction, i.e. aspect-evaluation relation extraction and aspect-of relation extraction.",
        "For example, the passage 'I went out for lunch at the Deli and ordered a curry with chicken.",
        "It was pretty good'",
        "has an aspect-evaluation relation 'curry with chicken, was good'",
        "and an aspect-of relation 'The Deli, curry with the chicken'.",
        "The former task can be regarded as a special type of predicate-argument structure analysis or semantic role labeling.",
        "The latter, on the other hand, can be regarded as bridging reference resolution (Clark, 1977), which is the task of identifying relations between definite noun phrases and discourse-new entities implicitly related to some previously mentioned entities.",
        "Most of the previous work on customer opinion extraction, however, does not adopt the state-of-the-art techniques in those fields, relying only on simple proximity-based or pattern-based methods.",
        "In this context, this paper empirically shows that incorporating machine learning-based techniques devised for predicate-argument structure analysis and bridging reference resolution improve the performance of both aspect-evaluation and aspect-of relation extraction.",
        "Furthermore, we also show that combining contextual clues with a common co-occurrence statistics-based technique for bridging reference resolution makes a significant improvement on aspect-of relation extraction.",
        "2 Opinion extraction: Task design Our present goal is to build a computational model to extract opinions from Web documents in such a form as: Who feels how on which aspects of which subjects.",
        "Given the passage presented in Figure 1, for example, the opinion we want to extract is: 'the writer feels that the colors of pictures taken with Powershot (product) are beautiful.'",
        "As suggested by this example, we consider it reasonable to start with an assumption that most evaluative opinions can be structured as a frame composed of the following constituents: Opinion holder The person who is making an evaluation.",

        "We say the opinion holder is unspecified if the opinion is mentioned as a rumor.",
        "Subject A named entity (product or company) of a given particular class of interest (e.g. a car model name in the automobile domain).",
        "Aspect A part, member or related object, or an attribute (of a part) of the subject on which the evaluation is made (engine, size, etc.)",
        "Evaluation An evaluative or subjective phrase used to express an evaluation or the opinion holder's mental/emotional attitude (good, poor, powerful, stylish, (I) like, (I) am satisfied, etc.)",
        "According to this typology, the example in Figure 1 has six constituents, the writer (opinion holder), Powershot (subject), pictures (aspect), colors (aspect), beautiful (evaluation), easy to grip (evaluation), and constitute two units of opinions as presented in the right half of the figure.",
        "We call such a unit an opinion unit.",
        "In this paper, we only consider explicitly mentioned evaluative opinions as our targets of extraction, excluding opinions indirectly expressed through, for example, style or language choice from our scope.",
        "Under this assumption, opinion extraction can be defined as a task of filling a fixed number of slots as above for each of the evaluations expressed in a given text collection.",
        "Two issues then immediately arise.",
        "First, it is necessary to make sure that the definition of the opinion units is clear enough for human annotators to be able to carry out the task with sufficient accuracy.",
        "Second, all the slots might not consist of simple expressions in that the filler of an aspect slot may have a hierarchical structure in itself.",
        "For example, 'the leather cover of the seats (of a car)'",
        "refers to a part of a part of a car.",
        "In theory, such a hierarchical chain can be of any length, which 1066 may affect the feasibility of the task.",
        "For tackling these issues, we built a corpus annotated with the above sort of information and investigated the feasibility of the task.",
        "2.1 Corpus study We first collected 116 Japanese weblog posts in the restaurant domain by randomly sampling from a collection of posts classified under the 'gourmet'",
        "category on a major blog site: http://blog.livedoor.com/.",
        "We asked two annotators to annotate them independently of each other following the above specification.",
        "The annotators first identified evaluative phrases, and then for each evaluative phrase judged whether it was concerning a particular subject (i.e. a restaurant) in the given domain.",
        "If judged yes, the annotators filled the opinion holder and subject slots obligatorily.",
        "The annotators filled the aspect slot only when its filler appeared in the document and identified the hierarchical relations between aspects if any (e.g. noodle and its volume).",
        "Note that, if a sentence has two or more evaluations, they have to make one opinion unit for each.",
        "2.1.1 Inter-annotator agreement We investigated the degree of inter-annotator agreement.",
        "In the task of identifying evaluations, one annotator A1 identified 450 evaluations while the other A2 identified 392, and 329 cases of them coincided.",
        "The two annotators did not identify the same number of evaluations, so instead of using kappa statistics, we use the following metric for measuring agreement as Wiebe et al. (2005) do: agr(A1||A2) = # of tags agreed by A1 and A2# of tags annotated by A1 agr(A1||A2) was 0.73 and agr(A2||A1) was 0.83.",
        "The F1 measure of the agreement between the two was therefore 0.79, which indicate that humans can identify evaluation at a reasonable level.",
        "Next, we investigated the inter-annotator agreement of the aspect-evaluation and subject-evaluation relations.",
        "Annotator A1 identified 328 relations, and A2 identified 346 relations.",
        "295 cases coincided, and agr(A2||A1) was 0.90 and agr(A1||A2) was 0.86 (F1 measure was 0.88).",
        "This shows that we obtained high consistency.",
        "Finally, for the subject-aspect and aspect-aspect relations, annotator A1 identified 296 relations, while A2 identified 293, 233 cases of which got agreement.",
        "agr(A2||A1) was 0.79 Table 1: Statistics of opinion-annotated corpus (Restaurant, Automobile, cellular phone and video game) Rest Auto Phone Game articles 1,356 564 481 361 sentences 21,666 14,005 11,638 6,448 # of opinion units 4,267 1,519 1,518 775 Asp-Eval 3,692 943 965 521 I Asp-Asp 1,426 280 296 221 Subj-Asp 2,632 877 850 451 II Subj-Eval 575 576 553 243 Subj-Asp-Eval 2,314 736 768 351 Subj-Asp-Asp-Eval 1,065 175 172 127 other 313 32 25 54 Non-writer op. holder 95 17 22 2 and agr(A1||A2) was 0.80 (F1 measure was 0.79), which show that the human annotators can carry out the task at a reasonable accuracy.",
        "Based on this corpus study, we believe that our definitions of two relations are clear enough for constructing annotated corpus.",
        "2.1.2 Opinion-annotated corpus Based on these results, we collected a larger set of weblog posts in four domains: restaurant, automo-bile, cellular phone and video game.",
        "We then asked annotator A1 to annotate them in the same annotation scheme as above.",
        "The results are summarized in Table 1.",
        "I in the table shows the number of the identified opinion units and relations, and II shows the number of hierarchical chains of aspects.",
        "For example, 'Nokia 6800 has a nice color screen'",
        "is counted as 'Subj-Asp-Eval'",
        "since this example includes a subject 'Nokia 6800', an aspect 'color screen'",
        "and an evaluation 'nice'.",
        "'Other'",
        "indicates the number of the case where the length of hierarchical chains of aspects is three or more.",
        "One observation is that, for all the domains, 90 % of all the opinion units have a hierarchical chain of aspects whose length is two or less.",
        "From this, we can conclude that hierarchical chains longer than two are rare, and the problem is not so complicated, though they can be of any length in theory.",
        "The row of 'Non-writer op(inion) holder'",
        "at the bottom of Table 1 shows the number of opinion units whose opinion holder is not the writer of the weblog.",
        "This result indicates that when an evaluative expression is found, its opinion holder is highly likely to be the writer of the blogs.",
        "Therefore, we put aside the task of filling the opinion holder slot in this paper.",
        "1067 2.2 Related work on task settings of opinion extraction There are several researches on customer opinion extraction.",
        "Hu and Liu (2004) considered the task of extracting 'Aspect, Sentence, Semantic-orientation'",
        "triples in our terminology, where Sentence is the one that includes the Aspect, and Semantic-orientation is either positive or negative.",
        "The notion of Evaluation in our term has also been introduced by previous work (Popescu and Etzioni, 2005; Tateishi et al., 2004; Suzuki et al., 2006; Kobayashi et al., 2005, etc.).",
        "For example, our previous paper (Kobayashi et al., 2005) addresses the task of extracting 'Subject,Aspect,Evaluation'.",
        "However, none of those papers reports on such an extensive corpus study as what we report in this paper.",
        "In addition, in this paper, we consider not only aspect-evaluation relations but also hierarchical chains of subject-aspect and aspect-aspect relations, which has never been addressed in previous work.",
        "Open-domain opinion extraction is another trend of research on opinion extraction, which aims to extract a wider range of opinions from such texts as newspaper articles (Yu and Hatzivassiloglou, 2003; Kim and Hovy, 2004; Wiebe et al., 2005; Choi et al., 2006).",
        "To the best of our knowledge, one of the most extensive corpus studies in this field has been conducted in the MPQA project (Wiebe et al., 2005); while their concerns include the types of opinions we consider, they annotate newspaper articles, which presumably exhibit considerably different characteristics from customer-generated texts.",
        "Though we do not discuss the problem of determining semantic orientation, we assume availability of state-of-the-art methods that perform this task (Suzuki et al., 2006; Takamura et al., 2006, etc.).",
        "The problem of determining semantic orientation will be solved by using these techniques, so we focus on the main issue: Extracting opinion units from given texts.",
        "3 Method for opinion extraction Before designing a model for our opinion extraction task, it is important to note that aspect phrases are open-class expressions and tend to be heavily domain-dependent.",

        "This indicates that evaluation expressions are more likely to be used commonly across different domains compared with aspects.",
        "To prove this assumption, we created a dictionary of evaluation expressions from customer reviews of automobiles (230,000 sentences in total) using the semi-automatic method proposed by Kobayashi et al. (2004).",
        "We expanded the dictionary by hand with external resources including publicly available ordinal thesauri.",

        "3.1 Related work on opinion extraction A common approach to the customer opinion extraction task mainly uses simple proximity-or pattern-based techniques.",
        "For example, Tateishi et al. (2004) implement five syntactic patterns and Popescu et al. (2005) use ten syntactic patterns.",
        "Such an approach is limited in two respects.",
        "First, it assumes the availability of a list of potential aspect expressions as well as evaluation expressions; however creating such a list of aspects for a variety of domains can be prohibitively expensive because of the domain dependency of aspect expressions.",
        "In contrast, our method does not require any aspect lexicon.",
        "Second, their approach lacks the perspective of viewing aspect-evaluation extraction as a specific type of predicate-argument structure analysis, i.e. the task of identifying the arguments of a given predicate in a given text, and fails to benefit from the state-of-the-art techniques of this rapidly growing field.",
        "The syntactic patterns used in their research are analyzed by a dependency parser, how-ever, aspect-evaluation relations appear in diverse syntactic patterns, which cannot be easily captured by a handful of manually devised rules.",
        "An exception is the model reported by Kanayama et al(2004), which uses a component of an existing MT system to identify the 'aspect'",
        "argument of a given 'evaluation'",
        "predicate.",
        "However, the MT component they use is not publicly available, and even if it were, it would be difficult to apply it to tasks in hand due of the opaqueness of its mechanism.",
        "Our approach aims to develop a more generally applicable model of aspect-evaluation extraction.",
        "In open-domain opinion extraction, some approaches use syntactic features obtained from parsed input sentences (Choi et al., 2006; Kim and Hovy, 2006), as is commonly done in semantic role label-ing.",
