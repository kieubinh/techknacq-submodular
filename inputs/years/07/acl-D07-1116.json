        "In Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), all nouns and adjectives have one of three cases: nominative (Nom), accusative (Acc), or genitive (Gen).",
        "What sets case in MSA apart from case in other languages is most saliently the fact that it is usually not marked in the orthography, as it is written using diacritics which are normally omitted.",
        "In fact, in a recent paper on diacritization, Habash and Rambow (2007) report that word error rate drops 9.4% absolute (to 5.5%) if the word-final diacritics (which include case) need not be predicted.",
        "Similar drops have been observed by other researchers (Nelken and Shieber, 2005; Zitouni et al., 2006).",
        "Thus, we can deduce that tagging-based approaches to case identification are limited in their usefulness, and if we need full diacritization for subsequent processing in a natural language processing (NLP) application (say, language modeling for automatic speech recognition (Vergyri and Kirchhoff, 2004)), we need to perform more complex syntactic processing to restore case diacritics.",
        "Options include using the output of a parser in determining case.",
        "An additional motivation for investigating case in Arabic comes from treebanking.",
        "Native speakers of Arabic in fact are native speakers of one of the Arabic dialects, all of which have lost case (Holes, 2004).",
        "They learn MSA in school, and have no native-speaker intuition about case.",
        "Thus, determining case in MSA is a hard problem for everyone, including treebank annotators.",
        "A tool to catch case-related errors in treebanking would be useful.",
        "In this paper, we investigate the problem of determining case of nouns and adjectives in syntactic trees.",
        "We use gold standard trees from the Arabic Treebank (ATB).",
        "We see our work using gold standard trees as a first step towards developing a system for restoring case to the output of a parser.",
        "The complexity of the task justifies an initial investigation based on gold standard trees.",
        "And of course, the use of gold standard trees is justified for our other objective, helping quality control for treebanking.",
        "The study presented in this paper shows the importance of what has been called \"feature engineering\" and the issue of representation for machine learning.",
        "Our initial machine learning experiments use features that can be read off the ATB phrase structure trees in a straightforward manner.",
        "The literature on case in MSA (prescriptive and descriptive sources) reveals that case assignment in Arabic does not always follow standard assumptions about predicate-argument structure, which is what the ATB annotation is based on.",
        "Therefore, we transform the ATB so that the new representation is based entirely on case assignment, not predicate-argument structure.",
        "The features for machine learning that can now be read off from the new representation yield much better results.",
        "Our results show that we can determine case with an error rate of 4.2%.",
        "However, our results would have been impossible without a deeper understanding of the linguistic phenomenon of case and a transformation of the representation oriented towards this phenomenon.",
        "Using either underlying representation, machine learning performs better than handwritten rules.",
        "However, a closer look at the errors made by the machine learning-derived classifier and the handwritten rules reveals that most errors are in fact treebank errors (between 69% and 86% of all errors for the machine learning-derived classifier and the handwritten rules, respectively).",
        "Furthermore, the machine learning classifier agrees more often with treebank errors than the handwritten rules do.",
        "This fact highlights the problem ofmachine learning (garbage in, garbage out), but holds out the prospect for improvement in the machine learning based classifier as the treebank is checked for errors and re-released.",
        "In the next section, we describe all relevant linguistic facts of case in Arabic.",
        "Section 3 details the resources used in this research.",
        "Section 4 describes the preprocessing done to extract the relevant linguistic features from the ATB.",
        "Sections 5 and 6 detail the two systems we compare.",

        "All Arabic nominals (common nouns, proper nouns, adjectives and adverbs) are inflected for case, which has three values in Arabic: nominative (Nom), accusative (Acc) or genitive (Gen).",
        "We know this from case agreement facts, even though the morphology and/or orthography do not necessarily always make the case realization overt.",
        "We discuss morphological and syntactic aspects ofcase in MSA in turn.",
        "The realization of nominal case in Arabic is complicated by its orthography, which uses optional diacritics to indicate short vowel case morphemes, and by its morphology, which does not always distinguish between all cases.",
        "Additionally, case realization in Arabic interacts heavily with the realization of definiteness, leading to different realizations depending on whether the nominal is indefinite, i.e., receiving nunation (^y3), definite through the determiner Al+ (+Jl) or definite through being the governor of an idafa possessive construction (<jL»J).",
        "Most details of this interaction are outside the scope of this paper, but we discuss it as much as it helps clarify issues of case.",
        "Buckley (2004) describes eight different classes of nominal case expression, which we briefly review.",
        "We first discuss the realization of case in morphologically singular nouns (including broken, i.e., irregular, plurals).",
        "Triptotes are the basic class which expresses the three cases in the singular using the three short vowels of Arabic: Nom is i +U, Acc is r +a, and Gen is _ +i.",
        "The corresponding nunated forms for these three diacritics are: i +U for Nom, ; +a for Acc, and _ +1 for Gen. Nominals not ending with Ta Marbuta (5 h) or Alif Hamza (A A') receive an extra Alif in the accusative indefinite case (e.g, Ufcf",
        "kitAbAa 'book' versus <u kfkitAbaha 'writing').",
        "Diptotes are like triptotes except that when they are indefinite, they do not express nunation and they use the r +a suffix for both Acc and Gen.",
        "The class of diptotes is lexically specific.",
        "It includes nominals with specific meanings or morphological patterns (colors, elatives, specific broken plurals, some proper names with Ta Marbuta ending or location names devoid of the definite article).",

        "'All Arabic transliterations are provided in the Habash-Soudi-Buckwalter transliteration scheme (Habash et al., 2007).",

        "J\"i dikray 'memoir').",
        "The indéclinables always use the r +a suffix to express case in the singular and allow for nunation (J^*-* maçnayà 'meaning').",
        "The defective nominals, which are derived from roots with a final radical glide (y or w), look like triptotes except that they collapse Nom and Gen into the Gen form, which also includes loosing their final glide: Je\\3qAD1 (Nom,Gen) versus \\Li>\\3qADiyAa (Acc) 'a judge'.",
        "For the dual and sound plural, the situation is simpler, as there are no lexical exceptions.",
        "The duals and masculine sound plurals express number, case and gender jointly in single morphemes that are identifiable even if undia-critized: jj£>^\"kAtib+uwna 'writersmasC;Pl ' (Nom), jlsK\" kAtib+Ani 'writersmasC;du' (Nom), juajK\" kAtib+atAni 'writersfem,du ' (Nom).",

        "The rest of the columns specify the error types as: system errors, gold POS errors or gold tree errors.",
        "The gold POS and tree errors are treebank errors that misguide our systems.",
        "They represent 69% ofall statistical system errors and 86% of all rule-based system errors.",
        "Gold POS errors represent around 35-40% of all gold errors.",
        "They most commonly include the wrong POS tag or the wrong case.",
        "One example of such errors is the mis-annotation of the Acc case to a Gen for a diptote nominal (which are indistinguishable out of context).",
        "Gold tree errors are primarily errors in the dash-tags used (or missing) in the treebank or attachment errors that are inconsistent with the gold",
        "POS tag.",
        "The rule-based system errors involve various constructions that were not addressed in our study, e.g. flat adjectival phrases or non S constructions at the highest level in a tree (e.g. FRAG or NP).",
        "The majority of the statistical system errors involve agreement decisions and incorrect choice of case despite the presence ofthe dash-tags.",
        "The ratio ofsystem errors for the statistical system is 31% (twice as much as those of the rule-based system s 14%).",
        "Thus, it seems that the statistical system manages to learn some of the erroneous noise in the treebank."

        "• The features relevant for the prediction ofcom-plex linguistic phenomena cannot necessarily be easily read off from the given representation of the data.",
        "Sometimes, due to data sparseness and/or limitations in the machine learning paradigm used, we need to extract features from the available representation in a manner that profoundly changes the representation (as is done in bilexical parsing (Collins, 1997)).",
        "Such transformations require a deep understanding of the linguistic phenomena on the part of the researchers.",
        "• Researchers developing handwritten rules may follow an empirical methodology in natural language processing if they use data sets to develop and test the rules – the only true methodological difference between machine learning and this kind of handwriting of rules",

        "For certain phenomena, machine learning may result in only a small or no improvement in performance over handwritten rules.",
        "• Error analysis remains a crucial part of any empirical work in natural language processing.",
        "Not only does it contribute insight into how the system can be improved, it also reveals problems with the underlying data.",
        "Sometimes the problems are just part of the noise in the data, but sometimes the problems can be fixed.",
        "Annotations on data are not themselves naturally occurring data and thus may be subject to critique.",
        "Note that an error analysis requires a good understanding of the linguistic phenomena and of the data.",
        "Our work was motivated in two ways: to help treebanking, and to develop tools for automatic case determination from unannotated text.",
        "For the first goal, our error analysis has shown that 86% of the errors found by our handwritten rules are in fact treebank errors.",
        "Furthermore, we suspect that the handwritten rules have very few false positives (i.e., cases in which the treebank has been annotated in error but our rules predict exactly that error).",
        "Thus we believe that our tool can serve an important function in improving the treebank annotation.",
        "For our second motivation, the next step will be to adapt our feature extraction to work on the output of parsers, which typically exclude dash-tags.",
        "We note that for many contexts, we do not currently rely on dash-tags but rather identify the relevant structures on our own (such as idafa, tamyiz, and so on).",
        "We suspect that the machine learning-based approach will outperform the handwritten rules, as it can learn typical errors the parser makes.",
        "As the treebank will soon be revised and hand-checked, we will postpone this work until the new release of the treebank, which will allow us to train better parsers as the data will be more consistent."
