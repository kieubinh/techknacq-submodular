        "The CoNLL07 domain adaptation task was created to explore how a parser trained in one domain might be adapted to a new one.",
        "The training data were drawn from the PTB (Marcus et al., 1993) rean-notated with dependency relations (Johansson and Nugues, 2007, hereafter DRs).",
        "The test data were taken from a corpus of biomedical articles (Kulick et al., 2004) and the CHILDES database (Brown, 1973; MacWhinney, 2000) also reannotated with DRs (see Nivre et al., 2007) for further details of the task, annotation format, and evaluation scheme.",
        "The development data consisted of a small amount of annotated and unannotated biomedical and conversational data.",
        "The RASP system (Briscoe et al., 2006) utilizes a manually-developed grammar and outputs grammatical bilexical dependency relations (see Briscoe, 2006 for a detailed description, hereafter GRs).",
        "Watson et al.",
        "(2007) describe a semi-supervised, bootstrapping approach to training the parser which utilizes unlabelled partially-bracketed input with respect to the system derivations.",
        "For the domain adaptation task we retrained RASP by mapping our GR scheme to the DR scheme and annotation format, and used this mapping to select a derivation to train the unlexicalized parse ranking model from the annotated PTB training data.",
        "We also performed similar partially-supervised bootstrapping over the 200 annotated biomedical sentences in the development data.",
        "We then tried unsupervised bootstrapping from the unannotated development data based on these initial models.",
        "As the parser requires input to consist of a sequence of one of 150 CLAWS PoS tags, we also utilize a first-order HMM PoS tagger which has been trained on manually-annotated data from the LOB, BNC and Susanne Corpora (see Briscoe, 2006 for further details).",
        "Accordingly, we submitted our results in the open class."

        "They estimate this probability using the stack-top state sj_1, next input symbol k and next action a».",
        "This probability is conditioned on the type of state sj_1.",

        "The probability of an action is estimated as:",
        "Therefore, normalization is performed over all lookaheads for a state or over each lookahead for the state depending on whether the state is a member of Ss or Sr, respectively.",
        "In addition, Laplace estimation can be used to ensure that all actions in the table are assigned a non-zero probability.",
        "These probabilities are estimated from counts of actions which yield derivations compatible with training data.",
        "We use a confidence-based self-training approach to select derivations compatible with the annotation of the training and development data to train the model.",

        "Here we start from the DR-annotated training data, map it to GRs, and then find the one or more derivations in our grammar which yield GR output consistent with the GRs recovered from the DR scheme.",

        "(2007), we utilize the subset of sentences in the training data for which there is a single derivation consistent with this mapping to build an initial trained parse ranking model.",
        "Then we use this model to rank the derivations consistent with the mapping in the portion of the training data which remains ambiguous given the mapping.",
        "We then train a new model based on counts from these consistent derivations which are weighted in some manner by our confidence in them, given both the degree of remaining ambiguity and also the ranking and/or derivation probabilities provided by the initial model.",
        "Thus, the first and hardest step was to map the DR scheme to our GR scheme.",
        "Issues concerning this mapping are discussed in section 4.",
        "Given this mapping, we determined the subset of sentences in the (PTB) training data for which there was a single derivation in the grammar compatible with the set of mapped GRs.",
        "These derivations were used to create the initial trained model (B) from the uniform model (A).",
        "To evaluate the performance of these and subsequent models, we tested them using our own GR-based evaluation scheme over 560 sentences from our reannotated version of DepBank, a subset of section 23 of the WSJ PTB (see Briscoe & Carroll, 2006).",
        "Table 1 gives the unlabelled precision, recall and microaveraged Fi score of these models over this data.",
        "Model B was used to rerank derivations compatible with the mapped GRs recovered for the PTB training data.",
        "Model C was built from the weighted counts of actions in the initial set of unambiguous data and from the highest-ranked derivations over the training data (i.e. we do not include duplicate counts from the unambiguous data).",
        "Counts were weighted with scores ranging [0 – 1] corresponding to the overall probability of the relevant derivation.",
        "The evaluation shows a steady increase in performance for these successive models.",
        "We also explored other variants of this bootstrapping approach involving use of weighted counts from the top n ranked parses derived from the initial model (see Watson et al., 2007, for details), but none performed better than simply selecting the highest-ranked derivation.",
        "To adapt the trained parser, we used the same technique for the 200 in-domain biomedical sentences (PBIOTB), using Model C to find the highest-ranked parse compatible with the annotation, and derived Model D from the combined counts from this and the previous training data.",
        "We then used Model D to rank the parses for the unannotated in-domain data (PBIOTB unsupervised), and derived Model E from the combined counts from the highest-ranked parses for all of the training and development data.",
        "We then iterated this process two more times over the unannotated datasets (each with an increasing number of examples though increasingly less relevant to the test data).",
        "The performance over our out-of-domain PTB-derived test data remains approximately the same for all these models.",
        "Therefore, we chose to use Model G for the blind test as it incorporates most information from the indomain data.",

        "The biggest issue for us participating in the shared task was the difficulty of reconciling the DR annotation scheme with our GR scheme, given the often implicit and sometimes radical underlying differences in linguistic assumptions between the schemes.",
        "Firstly, the PoS tagsets are different and ours contains three times the number of tags.",
        "Given that the grammar uses these tags as preterminal categories, this puts us at a disadvantage in mapping the annotated training and development data to optimal input to train the (semi-)supervised models.",
        "Secondly, there are 17 main types of GR relation and a total of 46 distinctions when GR subtypes are taken into account - for instance the GR ncsubj has two subtypes depending on whether the surface subject is the underlying object of a passive clause.",
        "The DR scheme has far fewer distinctions creating similar difficulties when creating optimal (semi-)supervised training data.",
        "Thirdly, the topology of the dependency graphs is often significantly different because of reversed head-dependent bilexical relations and their knock-on effects - for instance, the DR AUX relation treats the (leftmost) auxiliary as head and modifiers of the verb group attach to the leftmost auxiliary, while the GR scheme treats the main verb as (semantic) head and modifiers of the verb group attach to it.",
        "Fourthly, the treatment of punctuation is very different.",
        "The DR scheme includes punctuation markers in DRs which attach to the root of the subgraph over which they have scope.",
        "By contrast, the GR scheme does not output punctuation marks directly but follows Nunberg's (1990) linguistic analysis of punctuation as delimiting and typing text units or adjuncts (at constituent boundaries).",
        "Thus the GR scheme includes text (adjunct) relations and treats punctuation marks as indicators of such relations for instance, for the example The subject GRs - nc-subj, xsubj and csubj - all have subtypes., RASP outputs the GR (ta dash GRs and) indicating that the dash-delimited parenthetical is a text adjunct of GRs with head and, while the DR scheme gives (DEP GRs and), and two (P and -) relations corresponding to each dash mark.",

        "In training and adapting we found that bootstrapping based on unlabelled dependencies worked better in all cases than utilizing the labelled mapping we derived.",
