        "The ultimate goal of them is to design ideal multilingual and domain portable dependency parsing systems.",
        "To accomplish the multilingual and domain adaptation tasks, we present a three-pass parsing model based on a shift-reducing algorithm (Ya-mada and Matsumoto, 2003; Chang et al., 2006), namely, neighbor parsing, root relation parsing, and shift-reduce parsing.",
        "Our method favors examining the \"un-parsed\" tokens, which incrementally shrink.",
        "At the beginning, the parsing direction is mainly determined by the amount of unparsed tokens in the sentence with either forward or backward parse.",
        "In this step, the projective parsing method can be used to evaluate most of the non-projective Treebank datasets.",
        "Once the direction is determined, the pseudo-projectivize transformation algorithm (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005) converts most non-projective training data into projective and decodes the parsed text into non-projective.",
        "Hereafter, both neighbor-parser and root-parser were trained to discovery additional features for the downstream shift-reduce parse model.",
        "We found that the two additional features could improve the performance.",

        "Those two parsers provide very useful additional features for downstream shift-reduce parser.",
        "The experimental results also demonstrated that the use of the two components did improve results for the selected languages.",
        "In the error-analysis, we also observed that for some languages, parameter tuning and feature selection is very important for system performance.",
        "In the future, we plan to report the actual performance with replacing the MFN-SVM by the polynomial kernel SVM.",
        "In our pilot study, the use of approximate-polynomial kernel (Wu et al., 2007) outperforms the linear kernel SVM in Chinese and Arabic.",
        "Also, we are investigating how to convert the shift-reduce parser into approximate N-best parser efficiently.",
        "In this way, the parse reranking algorithm can be adopted to further improve the performance."
