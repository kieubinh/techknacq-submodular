        "Measures must be taken to increase and secure the consistency of linguistic annotations, if analyses and applications are not to suffer from low data quality.",
        "Because a multitude of factors may be responsible for inadequate reliability, a method is needed that is able to simultaneously consider a variety of probable factors and indicate those that are mainly responsible for low reliability in a given case.",
        "Generalizability Theory, or G-Theory (Cronbach et al.",
        "1972), is a methodological framework specifically designed for this purpose.",
        "Because it is not restricted to any type of data or study design, it can be of great use in any kind of manual annotation project that needs to systematically identify sources of annotator disagreement.",

      "text": [
        "Reliability in G-Theory is defined by the amount of variation or variance observed in annotations; the lower the total variance in the data, the higher is its reliability.",
        "G-Theory further assumes that data reliability is influenced by several independent factors or facets, which are, individually as well as in interaction, responsible for the observed variation.",
        "Sources of variation might be idiosyncratic behaviors of individual annotators or external influences like alterations in the tools used for annotations, increasing time pressure, removal or adding of rewards, or changes in the annotation scheme.",
        "Each of these influences can lead to systematic changes in an annotator's behavior and so to higher disagreement among annotators.",
        "According to G-Theory each possible facet, annotator, tools, rewards, and so on, will have its own independent impact on the quality, that is, reliability, of annotations.",
        "The task of a G-study is to isolate the influence of single facets and determine the degree of their impact.",
        "The main distinction with respect to G-study designs is the choice between a crossed and a (partially) nested design.",
        "In crossed designs measurements are obtained for each possible combination of facet values.",
        "Given two facets, items and coders, each individual item (phrase, phone, gesture, etc.)",
        "is annotated by all possible coders, so that each value of the item facet is measured on every value of the coders facet.",
        "Nested designs, in contrast, only measure a subset of possible combinations of facet values, for instance, when limited resources determine that only some of the coders annotate the same objects on more than one occasion.",
        "In general, fully crossed designs require a higher number of observations, but also provide more information.",
        "To obtain a full picture of possible influences crossed designs should therefore be preferred.",
        "For a detailed discussion of G-study designs, including unbalanced designs or missing data, and random and fixed facets, see, for example, Brennan (2001).",
        "In fully crossed designs the total variance in the data is a result of individual facets as well as their interactions.",
        "Because G-Theory assumes independence of facets, effects of components are additive.",
        "Given three facets a, b,c, the total variance o(Xabc) therefore is calculated as where o refers to variance and the subscripts to the name of one or more facets.",
        "The subscript e in the last variance component denotes error variance.",
        "In nested designs some facets cannot be determined as independent terms due to their confounding with other facets.",
        "For instance, in a nested design with three factors a, b, c, different",
        "2 This definition of reliability differs from the traditional true-score-model of classical reliability theory (Spearman 1904) and can be considered a modern approach to the question of consistency or 'dependability' of data measurement.",
        "A discussion of the conceptual differences is beyond the scope of this article.",
        "Information on this topic may be found in Thompson (2002) or Matt (2001).",
        "values of c may be associated with different values of b.",
        "Here the effect for c will be confounded both with bc and the residual term abc,e so that no independent term for the c facet can be obtained.",
        "Instead of the seven variance components in the crossed design only five variance components can be calculated, again stressing the fact that nested designs provide less information than fully crossed designs",
        "For information on the mathematical foundation of G-Theory and the derivation of estimates see Cronbach et al.",
        "(1972) and Brennan (2001).",
        "Based on the assumption that the total variance is a sum of single variance components, the total variance is 100%.",
        "The relative magnitude of each component with respect to the total variance is an indicator of the individual contribution of this component with respect to overall (un)reliability.",
        "A facet explaining 60% of the total variance would thus be considered a major source of variation in contrast to a minor facet explaining only 5% of the variance.",
        "For instance, given that the coder facet is the largest facet, variation can be explained through systematic differences in the annotation behavior of individual coders â€“ for example, annotators differ in their tendency to set prosodic boundaries in utterances leading to systematic differences in the number of boundaries placed.",
        "In this case retraining of annotators to reach a more comparable behavior would be advisable.",
        "Ahighschema component indicates that there is systematic variation in the use of categories, whereas a high coder-schema interaction indicates systematic differences in annotators' use of these categories; for example, coders annotating rhetorical (RST) relations could differ in the frequency with which they use individual relations such as 'background', 'concession', 'evidence', and so forth, pointing to possible problems with the interpretation of rhetorical relations and their application.",
        "Variation mainly due to the item facet indicates that certain materials are harder to annotate than others.",
        "Such a result would imply retraining or elimination of overly difficult material.",
        "In consequence, the identification of distinct sources of variation should lead to specifically designed steps for improvement."

        "As an illustration for the application of G-Theory we reanalyzed data provided by Shriberg and Lof (1991), who studied the accuracy of broad and narrow phonetic transcriptions.",

        "Data in Set A were given as agreement percentages.",
        "Our G-study results are shown in Table 1.",
        "Traditionally, reliability concerns focus on disagreements among individual annotators assuming that variation is due to incommensurable annotator behavior.",
        "In our case, however, the team facet explains only a very small percentage of variance both as an individual factor and in interaction with other factors.",
        "This suggests that the four annotation teams are comparable in their annotation quality.",

        "Our G-study therefore reveals that unreliability in Shriberg and Lof's data is caused not by idiosyncrasies of individuals, but due to the characteristics of the task, namely, granularity and scheme.",
        "Having identified the critical facets, it might now be interesting to look at the values of these facets that are especially prone to produce disagreement.",
        "Because we operated with agreement data, this information can be easily obtained from the data entered into the analysis.",
        "Because neither team nor material are major sources for variance, we only have to examine the values for granularity and consonants.",
        "Due to the same reason we can base the comparison on mean values over teams and material types.",
        "For the granularity facet we find overall lower agreement in narrow transcriptions (64.15%) compared to broad transcriptions (89.46%).",
        "On the consonant facet we can differentiate critical phonemes such as /S/or/J/ from uncritical ones (e.g., /j/, /b/).",
        "Interpreting the CG-interaction in this light, disagreement on consonants in narrow transcriptions seems to be comparably higher than in broad transcriptions.",
        "Implications from this study would be that the selection of annotators and the training of annotation teams are successful in producing comparable results.",
        "For high reliability, however, transcriptions should be done on a broad level with specific training for difficult consonants and some special care for material from articulation tests (see CGM-interaction)."

        "In planning and conducting a G-study some deliberation is necessary to achieve interpretable results.",
        "Foremost, the overall quality of the G-study depends on the choice of factors that completely and accurately represent the situation of the annotators.",
        "As it is quite easy to overlook relevant but rather inconspicuous factors like minor changes in the annotation tool or increasing time pressure due to upcoming project deadlines, the choice of correct facets relies heavily on the experience and knowledge of the researcher.",

        "Theoretically, the number of facets that can be included in a G-study is unlimited.",
        "Having more than four or five facets in one study might make the final interpretation overly complex, however.",
