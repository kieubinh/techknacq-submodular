        "Possible applications of confidence measures include:",
        "• marking words with low confidence as potential errors for post-editing",
        "• improving translation prediction accuracy in TransType-style interactive machine translation (Gandrabur and Foster 2003; Ueffing and Ney 2005a)",
        "• combining output from different machine translation systems: Hypotheses with low confidence can be discarded before selecting one of the system translations (Akiba et al. 2004), or the word confidence scores can be used in the generation of new hypotheses from the output of different systems (Jayaraman and Lavie 2005), or the sentence confidence value can be employed for reranking (Blatz et al. 2003).",
        "The article is organized as follows: In Section 2, we briefly review the statistical approach to machine translation.",
        "The phrase-based translation system, which serves as the basis for one of the direct confidence measures, will be presented.",
        "Section 3 gives an overview of related work on confidence estimation for machine translation.",

        "In this work, we set up a probabilistic framework for the computation of word posterior probabilities for machine translation.",
        "Within this framework, different concepts of word posterior probabilities were defined and analyzed.",
        "Several approaches to the calculation of word posterior probabilities were investigated and compared: system-based methods that explore information provided by the SMT system that generated the translations, and direct model-based methods that make use of statistical (translation) models.",
        "The use of word posterior probabilities as confidence measures was studied, including their application in a rescoring scenario.",
        "The proposed confidence measures were systematically evaluated on different translation tasks and different language pairs.",
        "On all corpora, the best methods developed here reduce the confidence error rate significantly (at the 1% level).",
        "The direct confidence measures were also successfully applied to output from a non-statistical MT system.",
        "The results of the experiments can be summarized as follows:",
        "• The performance of the confidence measures depends heavily on the word error measure that defines the reference tags.",
        "Naturally, the word posterior probabilities derived from Bayes risk for this word error measure discriminate best.",
        "For WER, this is the approach based on the Levenshtein alignment, and for PER this is the method that considers the counts of the words.",
        "• The direct phrase-based confidence measures perform very well on the restricted domain of the TransType2 corpora consisting of technical manuals.",
        "There, they outperform all other measures.",
        "However, this is",
        "Uefing and not the case for data from domains that are basically unrestricted, such as the EPPS and NIST corpora.",
        "There, the system-based measures discriminate better for reference tags given by WER.",
        "For PER-based confidence estimation, the direct phrase-based confidence measure and the count-based confidence measure calculated over N-best lists show the best performance.",
        "• The confidence measures based on IBM model 1 normally perform worse than the system-based or direct phrase-based methods.",
        "The reason for this is that the IBM model 1 is a very simple model that does not consider the context of a target word at all.",
        "• The combination of several different word posterior probabilities into one confidence measure yields better confidence estimation performance than the best single feature.",
        "However, the word posterior probabilities proposed here proved to be strong standalone features (see also experiments reported in Blatz et al.",
        "[2003]).",
        "• Rescoring with confidence measures was shown to improve translation quality.",
        "The SMT system investigated here was the one that was ranked first in the TC-STAR evaluation campaign in March 2005.",
        "It was consistently improved through rescoring with confidence measures."
