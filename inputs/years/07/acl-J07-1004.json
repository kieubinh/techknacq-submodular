        "Decisive factors in this increase of interest are an unprecedented growth in the amount of digital information available, an explosion of growth in the use of computers for communications, and the increasing number of users that have access to all this information.",
        "These circumstances have fostered research into information systems that can facilitate the localization, retrieval, and manipulation of these enormous quantities of data.",

        "Work in QA since the early stages of AI has led to systems that respond to questions using the knowledge encoded in databases as an information source.",
        "Obviously, these systems can only provide answers concerning the information previously encoded in the database.",
        "The benefit of this approach is that having a conceptual model of the application domain represented in the database structure allows the use of advanced techniques such as theorem proving and deep reasoning in order to address complex information needs.",

        "Whereas structured knowledge-based QA systems are well adapted to applications managing complex queries in a very structured information environment, the kind of research developed in TREC, CLEF, and NTCIR is probably better suited to broad-purpose generic applications dealing with simple factual questions such as World Wide Web-based question answering.",

        "Two examples of early question-answering systems are BASEBALL and LUNAR.",
        "BASEBALL answered questions about baseball games played in the American league over one season (Green et al.",
        "1961), and LUNAR answered questions about the analysis of rock samples from the Apollo moon missions (Woods 1997).",
        "Both systems were very successful in their chosen domains.",
        "In particular, LUNAR was demonstrated at a lunar science convention in 1971, where it was able to answer 90% of questions posed by geologists without prior instructions with regard to the allowable phrasing (Hirschman and Gaizauskas 2001).",
        "Both LUNAR and BASEBALL are examples of what have been described as natural language interfaces to databases, that is, their source of information was a database that contained the relevant information about the topic.",
        "The user's question was converted into a database query, and the database output was given as the answer.",
        "The very specific nature of the domains enabled the construction of appropriately comprehensive databases, and a domain-specific question analysis that enabled a mapping from the meaning of the user's question onto the corresponding database query.",
        "LUNAR and BASEBALL are only two of the most salient examples of early work on question answering, but there were many other such systems.",
        "Simmons's (1965) survey described a variety of early QA systems.",
        "Most of these focused on restricted domains by developing a database of knowledge and providing a natural language interface.",
        "Still,",
        "Molla and",
        "many of these early systems (including LUNAR and BASEBALL) were no more than \"toy systems\" that focused on very limited domains.",
        "Those early systems that used a corpus of text as the inherent information source typically processed small volumes of text and would rely on a human to disambiguate the corpus sentences or convert them to a simplified version of English.",
        "During the 1970s and 1980s there was intensive research on the development of theoretical bases for computational linguistics.",
        "This research prompted the development of QA systems on domains that were more complex than those of the earlier systems.",
        "The main goal of this research was to use QA as an application framework within which general NLP theories could be tested.",
        "This work culminated in large and ambitious projects such as the Berkeley Unix Consultant (Wilensky et al.",
        "1994).",
        "The Berkeley Unix Consultant project (UC) used the domain of the UNIX operating system to develop a help system that combined research in planning, reasoning, natural language processing, and knowledge representation.",
        "The user's question was analyzed and a meaning representation corresponding to the question was encoded in a knowledge representation formalism.",
        "Then, UC hypothesized the actual information needs of the user by consulting the user model and applying goal analysis.",
        "The answer was tailored to the user's expertise and goals.",
        "The sample dialogues provided were certainly impressive.",
        "However, no transcripts of real-world dialogues were provided and therefore it cannot be determined whether the methods and theories developed in UC were robust enough for practical use.",
        "Most of the early work attempted to implement QA systems from the early perspective of AI or computational linguistics.",
        "As noted earlier, due to the limitations of the time, question answering focused on restricted domains.",
        "A turning point was reached in 1999, with the introduction of the QA track in the TREC (Voorhees 1999).",
        "The popularity of the QA track in TREC has enabled research on QA from an IR perspective.",
        "From the IR community's point of view, the task of question answering is reduced to the task of finding the text that contains the answer to the question and extracting the answer.",
        "Text documents are viewed as a source of unstructured information that is structured by indexing it.",
        "Indexing the documents makes it feasible to locate the fragments that are closely related to the question terms by applying term-matching techniques.",
        "A consequence of this new perspective is the application of domain-independent methods, allowing what has been called open-domain question-answering.",
        "This approach is largely used in current QA systems.",
        "It is beyond the scope of this article to survey the techniques and systems used in open-domain QA; the interested reader is referred to the proceedings of TREC, which are available on-line.",
        "Instead, in the subsequent sections we will review current approaches to question answering in restricted domains.",

        "Consequently, different restricted domains benefit from different QA techniques.",
        "Some domains are particularly appropriate for the development of question answering systems.",
        "Minock (2005) lists three desiderata for a restricted",
        "4 http://trec.nist.gov.",
        "domain within the context of World Wide Web-based question answering – that is, question answering that relies on documents taken from the World Wide Web as the main source for finding answers.",
        "According to Minock, a restricted domain must meet the following desiderata:",
        "1.",
        "It should be circumscribed.",
        "2.",
        "It should be complex.",
        "3.",
        "It should be practical.",
        "The same desiderata apply, with some modifications, to restricted domains on question answering that is not World Wide Web-based.",
        "Minock's original description of a circumscribed domain is motivated by the user's need to know what to expect of the World Wide Web-based QA system at hand and to know what questions are appropriate to the domain at hand.",
        "An example of a domain that would fare low in this desideratum is that of current events, because the user might have difficulty in ascertaining what questions can be asked.",
        "An example of a good domain according to this desideratum would be a science domain such as astronomy or chemistry.",
        "If the QA system is not World Wide Web-based and, furthermore, is intended for use within a corporation, however, users do not face the problem of wondering what questions are appropriate.",
        "Rather, a more important motivation for a circumscribed domain is the need for clearly defined knowledge sources.",
        "The range of techniques used in a restricted domain should not need to use extensive knowledge from outside the chosen domain.",
        "Rather, a domain that has authoritative and comprehensive resources is to be preferred.",
        "Examples of resources include actual databases containing the required information.",
        "It is natural to assume that the more restricted the domain is and the more circumscribed it is, the more possible it is to obtain such comprehensive databases.",
        "For more complex domains, useful resources are terminology databases and domain ontologies.",
        "An added value is the existence of well-accepted terminology and ontology standards.",
        "A domain should be complex enough to warrant the use of a QA system.",
        "This may seem an obvious statement, but it is important to bear in mind that, in a desire to find a domain that is fully circumscribed, one might attempt to develop a QA system in a domain where a simple list of facts or a FAQ would be sufficient to satisfy the user's need for information.",
        "There is no need for a QA system in such domains.",
        "Developing a system for a simple domain does not advance research in any significant area.",
        "Such domains are to be left to those who are more interested in capitalizing on current research advances to develop practical applications, rather than extending current research boundaries.",
        "In general, the more complex a domain is, the more interesting it becomes for the researcher and the more useful it presumably is to the user.",
        "There is a balance to be achieved between the need for a complex domain and that of a circumscribed domain, because these two desiderata are in conflict.",
        "At some point, if a domain is complex enough, it becomes difficult to manage and there is a",
        "Molla and",
        "higher probability of requiring resources belonging to other domains; in other words, the domain becomes less circumscribed.",
        "Practicality is an important desideratum to consider when developing a QA system.",
        "The domain should be of use to a relatively large group of people.",
        "Otherwise one risks wasting effort on a system that nobody would use, such as for an artificially constructed toy domain.",
        "The choice of domain affects the kind of users to target.",
        "Therefore, for each domain it is important to determine the kinds of questions asked in the specific domain (question style and terminology used are two important factors to consider), the sort of information that is most commonly requested, and the level of detail expected in the answers."

        "A well-known method used in open-domain QA is derived from redundancy-based techniques.",
        "These techniques were first discussed by Brill et al.",
        "(2001), who observed that, as the size of the text corpus increases, it becomes more likely that the answer to a specific question can be found with data-intensive methods that do not require a complex language model.",

        "',itiseasier to find the answer in John Wilkes Booth killed Abraham Lincoln than in John Wilkes Booth is perhaps America's most infamous assassin.",
        "He is best known for having fired the bullet that ended Abraham Lincoln's life.",
        "Redundancy-based techniques are likely to have a weaker impact in restricted-domain QA, especially in the case of domains with relatively small corpora.",
        "Domains with relatively small corpora will naturally have relatively fewer sentences that contain the answer.",
        "In those domains it becomes important to use sophisticated language processing techniques, including the resolution of inferences, if necessary, to find the answer.",
        "The haystack of a restricted domain is relatively small, but it also has fewer needles.",
        "Note that, if the size of the corpus is relatively small, it becomes possible to apply complex NLP techniques to the complete corpus off-line.",
        "Nowadays it is possible to parse the entire corpus used in the QA track of TREC and to extract all its named entities.",
        "It is therefore feasible to parse and extract the named entities of corpora of restricted domains.",
        "The actual domain provides a specific context to the question-answering process.",
        "Consequently the set of senses available to words is typically a subset of all the available senses.",
        "The impact of word-sense disambiguation is possibly reduced in RDQA, though it should be noted that some words would still have several senses available and therefore word-sense disambiguation still plays a role.",
        "We are not aware of any studies on the impact of word-sense disambiguation on restricted domains and certainly this area is worth exploring.",
        "The kinds of questions asked in a restricted domain are naturally different from those asked in an open domain.",
        "Users of a restricted domain, and especially users who are experts in the domain, will use specific terminology and will pose rather technical questions that require very specific answers.",
        "Questions asked by such users are much more complex than those of casual users of open-domain QA systems.",
        "This is certainly the case in the medical domain, as the articles included in this special section show convincingly.",
        "The challenges related to solving those questions are certainly worth the effort in pursuing research in RDQA.",

        "The type of information available for a particular domain is intrinsically related to the complexity of the domain and the particular needs of the domain users.",
        "Hence, domain knowledge representation can range from simple lists of specialized entities and terms to high-level ontologies where all the domain knowledge is unambiguously represented.",
        "Within computer science, an ontology is usually defined as a formal explicit description of concepts in the domain of discourse, together with their attributes, roles, restrictions, and other defining features (Noy and McGuinness 2001).",
        "The relations between the concepts are also expressed formally.",
        "The two most common relations shown in an ontology are subclass (\"is a subtype of\") and instance (\"is an instance of\"), but other relations can be included, such as meronymy (\"part of\") and, in the case of WordNet (Fellbaum 1998), entailment.",
        "For the purposes of this article, we will refer to all the possible domain knowledge representations as ontological resources.",
        "Generally, domains that are complex, circumscribed, and practical are likely to have available ontological resources that can be used to quick-start QA research and development.",
        "These resources are typically developed for the domain users to help them categorize the domain knowledge and agree on notational standards, and to help them retrieve information using conventional information retrieval applications.",
        "There are ontologies that are designed without a specific domain in mind.",
        "These are referred here as open-domain ontologies.",

        "Open-domain ontologies are too coarse-grained.",
        "Restricted domains, and especially technical domains, abound in terms that are specific to the domain and largely unknown in other domains.",

        "Consequently, open-domain ontologies will need to be complemented with terminology lists or local ontologies.",
        "Open-domain ontologies are too fine-grained.",
        "Open-domain ontologies that map words to concepts, as is the case with WordNet, face the problem of polysemous words, that is, words with multiple meanings.",

        "On the other hand, the known methodological proposals (Minock 2005) are so general that they could be used to design any kind of information system.",

        "These points are related to the analysis and modeling of the domain information and the selection of the appropriate technology required by the QA system.",
        "They can be listed as follows:",
        "• domain query system analysis",

        "The kinds of questions in a restricted domain may vary from general open-domain factoid and definition questions to very special kinds of questions that depend on the selected domain.",
        "Domain knowledge selection: The amount and type of authoritative knowledge available for computational treatment is especially variable across different domains.",
        "For instance, there are plenty of resources for biomedical (Zweigenbaum 2003) or technical related domains, whereas, on the other hand, less popular domains (such as the legal domain) have minimal elaborated knowledge but have the advantage of enormous quantities of raw text.",
        "Domain information can be represented in different formats: from unstructured plain text documents to semi-structured (e.g., templates, SGML annotated text) or highly structured knowledge encoded in large databases and authoritative ontologies.",
        "Selecting the appropriate domain knowledge resources in each particular case is an important aspect in the design of an RDQA.",
        "Domain knowledge acquisition and representation: Using the domain knowledge for QA purposes requires the definition of an internal representation model that allows the integration or combination of the different information sources available for the domain.",
        "The complexity of the representation model used will be proportional to the complexity of the information sources needed for encoding domain knowledge.",
        "The model selected for domain knowledge representation will also determine the kind of operational processes and reasoning techniques allowed in the domain.",
        "System interface design: In order to obtain a natural mode of communication between users and the system, the interaction needs to be tailored according to the domain characteristics and the user requirements.",

        "Nevertheless, as current natural language processing technologies do not allow the automatic translation of natural language text into a fully unambiguous content representation, NL interfaces may be sometimes substituted by template-like interfaces or unambiguous formal outputs (only useful for expert users) when exact knowledge understanding and representation is required.",

        "It therefore becomes possible to develop complete systems that can be used without the need for any time-consuming training on the methods required to formulate questions or to interpret the system results.",

        "A clear example is the UC project developed in the 1980s.",
        "By reducing the research space it becomes possible to focus on solving complex problems that would not be attempted if the main drive was to produce a system that works in an open-domain fashion.",
        "Applicability to current needs: General and broad scope systems are not effective in domains restricted to the interests of different kind of users: from employees in institutions and companies trying to find information in manuals and procedures, to professionals in specialized domains like law, medicine, biology, mechanics, programming, and so on.",
        "Notice that professionals in each of these areas require different types of information in their daily activities (e.g., there is a considerable difference between looking for general information on the Internet as opposed to looking for the empty weight of a wing of the Airbus A319 in a technical manual).",
        "A major difference between open-domain question answering and restricted-domain question answering is the existence of domain-dependent information that can be used to improve the accuracy of the system.",
        "Much of the focus of this article has been on forms of tapping information from these resources.",
        "Some domains are more appropriate for developing question answering systems than others.",
        "A domain must be circumscribed enough so that a comprehensive ontological resource can be built for the domain.",
