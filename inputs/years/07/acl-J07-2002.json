        "Vector space models of word co-occurrence have proved a useful framework for representing lexical meaning in a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as word sense discrimination (Schütze 1998) and ranking (McCarthy et al.",

        "These models have also been popular in cognitive science and figure prominently in several studies simulating human behavior.",
        "Examples include similarity judgments (McDonald 2000), semantic priming (Lund and Burgess 1996; Landauer and Dumais 1997; Lowe and McDonald 2000; McDonald and Brew 2004), and text comprehension (Landauer and Dumais 1997; Foltz, Kintsch, and Landauer 1998).",
        "The popularity of vector-based models in both fields lies in their ability to represent word meaning simply by using distributional statistics.",
        "The central assumption here is that the context surrounding a given word provides important information about its meaning (Harris 1968).",

The value of each vector element is a function of the number of times each c, occurs within a window of size n before or after t in a large corpus.",
        "In their simplest incarnation, semantic space models treat context as a set of unordered words, without even taking parts of speech into account (e.g., to drink and adr,nkare represented by a single vector).",
        "In fact, with the exception of function words (e.g., the, down), which are often removed, it is often assumed that all context words within a certain distance from the target word are semantically relevant.",
        "Because no linguistic knowledge is taken into account, the construction of semantic space models is straightforward and language-independent – all that is needed is a segmented corpus of written or spoken text.",
        "However, the assumption that contextual information contributes indiscriminately to a word's meaning is clearly a simplification.",
        "There is ample evidence demonstrating that syntactic relations across and within sentences are crucial for sentence and discourse processing (West and Stanovich 1986; Neville et al.",

        "Furthermore, much research in lexical semantics hypothesizes that the behavior of words, particularly with respect to the expression and interpretation of their arguments, is to a large extent determined by their meaning (Fillmore 1965; Green 1974; Jackendoff 1983; Talmy 1985; Gropen et al.",
        "1989; Pinker 1989; Levin 1993; Goldberg 1995).",

        "In these semantic space models, contexts are defined over words bearing a syntactic relationship to the target words of interest.",
        "This makes semantic spaces more flexible; different types of contexts can be selected; words do not have to co-occur within a small, fixed word window; and word order or argument structure differences can be naturally mirrored in the semantic space.",
        "This article proposes a general framework for semantic space models which conceptualizes context in terms of syntactic relations.",
        "We introduce an algorithm for constructing semantic space models from texts annotated with syntactic information (specifically dependency relations) and illustrate how different model classes can be derived from this linguistically rich representation.",
        "Our guiding hypothesis is that syntactic structure in general and argument structure in particular is a close reflection of lexical meaning (Levin 1993).",
        "We thus model meaning by quantifying the degree to which words are attested in similar syntactic environments.",
        "The expressive power of our framework stems from three novel parameters which guide model construction.",

        "The second parameter allows us to weigh the relative importance of different syntactic relations.",

        "We evaluate our framework on tasks relevant for cognitive science and NLP.",
        "We start by simulating semantic priming, a phenomenon that has received much attention in computational psycholinguistics and is typically modeled using word-based semantic spaces (Landauer and Dumais 1997; McDonald and Brew 2004).",

        "Specifically, we evaluate the performance of our model on synonym questions from the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL).",
        "These are routinely used as a testbed for assessing how well vector-based models capture lexical knowledge (Landauer and Dumais 1997; Turney 2001; Sahlgren 2006).",

        "Our contributions are threefold: a novel framework for semantic spaces that incorporates syntactic information in the form of dependency relations and generalizes previous syntax-based vector-based models; an application of this framework to a wide range of tasks relevant to cognitive modeling and NLP; and an empirical comparison of our dependency-based models against state-of-the-art word-based models.",

        "Usually, the dimensionality of the matrix is restricted to a relatively small number.",
        "A popular choice is the k most frequent words (minus the stop words) in a corpus, typically 1002,000 (McDonald 2000; Levy and Bullinaria 2001).",

        "Functions such as mutual information or the log-likelihood ratio are often applied to factor out co-occurrences due to chance.",

        "SVD can be thought of as a means of inferring latent structure in distributional data, while making sparse matrices more informative.",
        "For the rest of this article, we will ignore V and other statistical transformations and concentrate primarily on ways of inducing structure from grammatical and syntactic information.",
        "To illustrate this definition, we construct a word-based semantic space for the target words T = {lorry, carry, sweet,fruit}, using as our corpus the following sentence: A lorry might carry sweet apples.",

        "Our syntactically enriched models retain the simplicity of word co-occurrence models while allowing for the role of syntactic structure to influence the representation of the semantic space.",
        "The resulting vectors have a higher degree of linguistic",
        "Padó and",
        "plausibility – it is not mere lexical association that accounts for the meaning of words but rather their lexical and syntactic dependencies.",
        "Arguably, this property holds great promise for languages less configurational than English.",
        "A prediction that we intend to test in the future is that syntax-based semantic space models should be able to represent meaning more adequately than traditional word-based models for languages that allow constituent scrambling (e.g., German) or have free word order (e.g., Czech).",
        "It remains to be seen whether our models can capture the wide range of data that traditional and LSA-based models have accounted for.",
        "Possible future experiments include mediated priming (Lowe and McDonald 2000) and multiple priming (McDonald and Brew 2004), intelligent tutoring (Kanejiya, Kumar, and Prasad 2003), and coherence rating (Foltz, Kintsch, and Landauer 1998).",
        "A number of NLP tasks could also benefit from the framework presented in this article.",
        "Examples include word sense discrimination (Lin 1998a; Schütze 1998), automatic thesaurus construction (Grefenstette 1994; Curran and Moens 2002), automatic clustering, lexicon acquisition, and in general similarity-based approaches to NLP.",
        "In what follows we present the context selection functions we used in our experiments.",
        "These are encoded as non-lexicalized path templates and are distributed as part of the software package that implements our dependency-based semantic space framework (see Section 3.7 for details).",
        "Each context selection function cont is represented by a set of path templates, Temp(cont).",
        "Each path template directly corresponds to a path label sequence.",
        "Path templates are denoted by a comma-separated sequence of one or more edge labels; each edge label is a colon-separated triple POS1:relation:POS2 (see Definition 1).",
        "The semantics of a set of path templates Temp(c) is as follows: For a target word t and a context selection function c, the context of t consists of all paths nt (i.e., all paths anchored at t) so that there is a path template temp £ Temp(c) that matches the label sequence l(nt).",
