        "Crucially, GRE algorithms only use properties whose denotations are part of the common knowledge of writer and reader.",
        "These algorithms are typically designed in such a way that generation is performed quickly (e.g., their worst-case running time tends to be linear [Dale and Reiter 1995; van Deemter 2002]) but the processing effort of the reader is not taken into account.",
        "Some algorithms do make a point of generating descriptions that are as brief as possible (Dale 1989), and this can be argued to make interpretation easier.",
        "As we have seen, however, in relation to Examples (1a-c), brevity can make resolution difficult.",
        "For concreteness, let us focus on one of the best-known algorithms in this area.",
        "The Incremental Algorithm (Dale and Reiter 1995) starts by arranging attributes in a list, after which they are considered one by one, to see if any of their values contributes something to the description, by removing \"distractors\" (i.e., objects other than the referent); if an attribute (e.g., COLOR) can contribute something, then a suitable value (e.g., RED) for this attribute is selected as part of the description.",
        "This is repeated incrementally until the logical conjunction of all selected attribute-value combinations results in a unique identification of the referent.",
        "There is no backtracking, and this is what keeps the complexity of the algorithm linear; it is also what causes the algorithm to sometimes express a property P even when properties that are added later make P logically redundant.",
        "2 A good example of a description failing this requirement occurs in Get off one stop before I do, in an exchange between two people who have just met, as a description of where the hearer should get off the bus (Appelt 1985, cited in Dale and Reiter 1995).",
        ", van Deemter, and Masthoff",
        "Suppose a referring expression identifies its referent uniquely.",

        "To exemplify the first factor, suppose you are queuing up for a concert and want to explain to a friend that a girl further ahead in the queue has his ticket.",
        "Color is an attribute that speakers like to use, even if it leads to logical redundancy (Pechmann 1989).",
        "This might be done by describing the referent as the girl in a yellow dress, or as the girl with green eyes, for example.",
        "But arguably, the first property contributes more towards your friend's search, because the color of a person's eyes may not leap out at him from afar.",
        "In the Incremental Algorithm, the fact that DRESS COLOR is more useful than EYE COLOR could be tackled by letting it precede EYE COLOR in the list of attributes.",
        "As a consequence, EYE COLOR would only be considered if the referent cannot be identified uniquely without using a combination of more preferred attributes, including DRESS COLOR.",
        "Arguably, this is exactly as it should be, and it shows much of what is good about the Incremental Algorithm.",
        "It is not so obvious, however, how the algorithm should deal with the second of the two possible obstacles to resolution: the size and structure of the domain."

      "text": [
        "In this section we shall introduce a class of domains (Section 3.1) and a class of problems for resolution that can arise when objects in these domains are identified using a distinguishing description (Section 3.2).",
        "Section 4 will relate these problems to a simple model of the resolution process and propose a remedy, which consists of generating logically redundant descriptions (in two different ways).",
        "Sections 5 and 6 provide examples of putting our ideas to the test: first, by investigating what kind of description is preferred by subjects who are given the choice (Section 5); then, more elaborately, by investigating the effect of redundant descriptions on readers (Section 6).",
        "Existing work on GRE tends to focus on fairly simple domains, dominated by one-place properties.",
        "When relations (i.e., two-place properties) are taken into account at all (e.g., Dale and Haddock 1991; Krahmer and Theune 2002), the motivating examples are kept so small that it is reasonable to assume that speaker and hearer know all the relevant facts in advance.",
        "Consequently, search is not much of an issue (i.e., resolution is easy): The hearer can identify the referent by simply intersecting the denotations of the properties in the description, for example, intersecting the set of girls with the set of individuals who wear a yellow dress (both in the domain).",
        "Although such simplifications permit the study of many aspects of reference, other aspects come to the fore when larger, and subtly structured, domains are considered.",
        "Interesting questions arise, for example, when a large domain is hierarchically ordered.",
        "For the purpose of this article, we consider a domain to be hierarchically ordered if its inhabitants can be structured like a tree in which everything that belongs to a given node n belongs to at most one of n's children, and everything that belongs to one of n's children belongs to n. Examples include countries divided into provinces, which, in turn, may be divided into regions, and so on; years into months, then into weeks, and then into days; documents into chapters, then sections, then subsections; buildings into floors, then rooms.",
        "Clearly, hierarchies are among our favorite ways of structuring the world.",
        "A crucial question, in all such cases, is what knowledge is shared between speaker and hearer at utterance time.",
        "Later on (most explicitly in Section 6), we shall focus on more realistic situations but, to get the idea, it will be useful to think about the extreme case where, before the start of resolution (i.e., before consulting the \"knowledge in the world,\" as opposed to the hearer's \"knowledge in the head\" [Norman 1988]), the hearer knows nothing about the domain.",
        "When the utterance is made, the hearer's blindfold is removed, so to speak, and resolution can start.",
        "No similar assumption about the speaker is made: We assume that the speaker knows everything about the domain, and that he knows that the hearer can achieve the same knowledge.",
        "Many of our examples will be drawn from a simple model of a University campus, structured into buildings and rooms; the intended referent will often be a library located in one of the rooms.",
        "The location of the library is not known to the hearer, but it is known to the speaker.",
        "Each domain entity r will be associated with a TYPE (e.g., the type 'room'), and with some additional attributes such as its ROOM NUMBER or NAME, and we will assume that it is always possible to distinguish r from its siblings in the tree structure by using one or more of these properties.",
        "(For example, ROOM NUMBER = 120 identifies a room uniquely within a given building; BUILDINGNAME = Watts identifies a building within the university.)",
        "This is a useful assumption, because without it, the existence of a distinguishing description cannot be guaranteed.",
        "The kinds of referring expression that we are interested in (see Section 5 for motivation) take the form of a list where x1 = r is the referent of the referring expression and, for every j > 1, xj is an ancestor (not necessarily the parent) of xj_1 in the domain D. For every j, Pj is a set of properties that jointly identify xj within xj+1 or, if j = n, within the whole domain.",
        "The reference the library in room 120 ofCockcroft building, for example, is modeled as",

        "The expression is logically sufficient (i.e., there is only one room labeled 140 in the entire university).",
        "But, intuitively speaking, the expression creates an expectation that the referent may be found nearby, within the Watts building, whereas, in fact, a match can only be found in another building.",
        "In a case like this, we will speak of Lack of Orientation (LO).",
        "Even more confusion might occur if another library was added to our example, for instance in Watts 110, whereas the intended referent was the other library (i.e., in room 120 Cockcroft).",
        "In this case, Example (2c) would misfire, of course.",
        "The expression (2b), however, would succeed, by mutually using two parts of the description (the library and room 120) to identify another: There are two libraries, and two rooms numbered 120, but there is only one pair (a, b) such that a is a library and b is a room numbered 120, with a located in b.",

        "The difference is not trivial, because (ii), for example, might be viewed as having the unwanted implicature that there is more than one library in the Watts building (Robert Dale, personal communication, August 2005.)",
        "mutual identification are unproblematic in small, transparent, domains where search is not an issue, but in large hierarchical domains, they are awkward (see the Conclusion).",
        "For, like Example (2d), (2b) would force a reader to search through an unnecessarily large part of the domain; worse even, the search \"path\" that the reader is likely to follow leads via an obstacle (namely, room 120 Watts) that matches a part of the description, although not being the intended referent of the relevant part of the description (i.e., room 120 Cockcroft).",
        "Confusion could easily result.",

        "In our University domain, let x be room 140 of Cockcroft, then SCOPE(x, ROOM NUMBER) is the subtree rooted in Cockcroft, because within Cockcroft, all room numbers are unique, whereas at the level of the entire university (the next level up), this is not the case (even though the room number 140 itself happens to be unique at that level).",

        "Thus, in the example domain, ScOPEGROUP(x,ROOM NUMBER), where x is any room in Cockcroft, is the set of all the rooms in Cockcroft.",
        "TYPE is kept constant in the definition of SCOPEGROUP because it tends to be the only non-structural attribute that is used to identify domain objects (i.e., the only attribute that is not intended for designating a node of the domain tree).",
        "Non-structural attributes will be assumed to be unproblematic, operating like a filter on the set of possible referents.",
        "For example, a reader of the description the library in room 110 will only be looking for libraries (although they might be looking for them in the wrong building).",
        "5 A well-known example is the description the bowl on the table, in a domain that contains several tables and several bowls, but only one bowl on a table (Dale and Haddock 1991).",

        "Calling such y an obstacle, there are two types of obstacle: the obstacles for which all the properties in Pn are true (these are perhaps the worst kind, because they can be mistaken for the intended referent), and the ones for which this is not the case.",
        "If only obstacles of the latter kind arise then we will speak of Lack of Orientation (LO).",
        "If there is at least one obstacle of the former, more serious kind, we will speak of Dead End (DE).",

        "Because hierarchies involve relations, the first algorithm that comes to mind is the one proposed by Dale and Haddock (1991).",
        "Essentially, this algorithm combines one-and two-place predicates, until a combination is found that pins down the target referent.",
        "A standard example involves a domain containing two tables and two bowls, although only one of the two tables has a bowl on it.",
        "In this situation, the combination {bowl(x), on(x, y), table(y)} identifies x (and y as well), because only one value of x can verify the three predicates, and this justifies the description the bowl on the table.Now consider Figure 2, with one additional library in room 110 of the Watts building.",
        "Here the combination {library(x), in(x,y), room(y), roomnumber(y) = 120} identifies x (and y too), because no other library is located in a room with room number 120 (and no other room numbered 120 contains a library).",
        "Thus, the standard approach to relational descriptions allows precisely the kinds of situation that we have described as DE.",
        "Henceforth, we shall describe this as the Minimal Description (MD) approach to reference because, in the situations of interest, it uses the minimum number of properties by which the referent can be distinguished.",
        "Another option would be to treat a relation like \"being in room 120\" as a one-place property of the library, and to use the Incremental Algorithm (Dale and Reiter 1995) to generate the descriptions in question.",
        "This, however, would not produce results that are interestingly different from MD.",
        "Suppose, for example, that the TYPE attribute is most preferred (i.e., considered first by the algorithm), with values such as 'library', 'room', and so on.",

        "In other words, the same description would be generated by this algorithm as by Dale and Haddock (1991) and, once, again, the infamous LO and DE would occur.",
        "Choosing a preference order in which building names are preferred over room numbers would produce the library in Cockcroft.",

        "For example, let's return to the situation depicted in Figure 1, from Section 3.1, where there is only one library in the whole university.",
        "A reference to r = library would be realized by FI as the library in room 120 in Cockcroft.",
        "By using SL, however, the same description would be realized simply as the library, because the SCOPE of the attribute TYPE is the whole domain tree [more precisely, ScOPE(LIBRARY,ROOM NUMBER)= D] because there is only one entity of TYPE 'library' in the domain and hence no other properties are added.",

        "A second explanation for deviating from Ancestral Search is the kind of navigation that we allowed.",
        "Subjects could go directly from, say, Part C in Section 2, to part A in Section 3, without an extra navigation step to go into Section 3.",
        "In fact, it may even be faster to navigate to another section than within the current one, depending on the position of the mouse pointer.",
        "(This contrasts with the university domain, where one could not go directly from room 120 in Watts building to room 140 in Cockcroft building without first having to walk between the buildings.)",
        "It should be noted that this problem may be more pronounced after the first navigation action has been made.",
        "For instance, if one clicks on Part A in Section 2, then the mouse pointer is about as close to Part C in Section 1 as to Part C in Section 2.",
        "To explore this idea, we looked at the four documents in which a description of the form picture 5 was given.",
        "In 83 cases, subjects who complied with Ancestral Search for the first navigation action needed to perform a second action; in 77% of these cases, they also complied with Ancestral Search in the second action.",
        "Now in as many as 68% of the cases in which they did not comply, they clicked on the closest link in an adjacent section (e.g., Part A of the next section after having first clicked on Part C).",
        "This confirms our suspicion that the lack of effort required to deviate may have been a reason for deviation.",
        "With hindsight, we should probably have made the distance between the relevant sections larger."

      "text": [
        "This article has discussed generation strategies that facilitate resolution of a referring expression by adding logically redundant properties.",
        "We have shown that this can be of crucial importance, especially in large domains, where minimally distinguishing descriptions can sometimes be completely useless (witness, e.g., Example [1c]).",
        "Two algorithms for generating logically redundant references along the lines described in this article have been implemented.",
        "The experiments reported in the previous sections indicate that these algorithms are fundamentally on the right track.",
        "We recently learned of an interesting series of experiments that investigate the role of logically redundant properties in referring expressions (Arts 2004).",
        "One of the outcomes of these experiments was that certain types of logically redundant information almost consistently led to accelerated resolution.",
        "This was particularly true for information concerning the location of an object.",
        "For example, a logically minimal description like the white button on the left took readers longer to resolve than a redundant one like the white button at the top left (our emphasis).",
        "It is interesting to note that these results were obtained in situations where neither LO nor DE could occur.",
        "This article has described an alternative to classical algorithms for GRE.",
        "Suppose you are designing an NLG system and want to give it a GRE component; how do you know whether to use the new algorithm, instead of one of its predecessors?",
        "Redundancy has a role to play in different kinds of situations (see the Introduction of this article), but our algorithms focus on a class of cases that we believe to be particularly widespread, namely where the domain is hierarchical in the sense of Section 3.",
        "Because hierarchies involve relations, let us once again compare the predictions made by our algorithms with those made by Dale and Haddock (1991).",
        "Suppose their description the bowl on the table was said when there are two tables and two bowls, while (only) the table furthest away from the hearer has a bowl on it.",
        "FI and SL, by contrast, would generate something redundant like the bowl on the faraway table.",
        "Which of the two descriptions is best?",
        "The answer is that it depends on the situation: When all the relevant facts are available to the reader without effort (e.g., all the domain objects are visible at a glance) then Dale and Haddock's minimal descriptions are fine, but when search is required, the kind of \"studied\" redundancy embodied in FI and SL becomes necessary.",
        "Consider the example again.",
        "If the tables and bowls are visible at a glance, then resolving the DE-inducing description the bowl on the table is unproblematic, because there is nothing here to discover: The crucial part of the domain is directly available, and no search is needed.",
        "Consequently, it is superfluous to say anything about the location of the table.",
        "But suppose we are in a huge room, where it is not obvious for the hearer what is on each table.",
        "In this situation, the bowl on the table would be a rather unhelpful description, compared to the bowl on the faraway table (or the bowl on the table in the corner), as would be consistent with our algorithms.",
        "(The example can be made more dramatic by hiding the table with the bowl on it in another room.)",
        "What this example highlights is the distinction between the things that speaker and hearer know when a referring expression is uttered, and the things they can discover.",
        "It is in the latter case that search becomes an issue.",
        "We have shown how this idea can be made precise and incorporated into a GRE algorithm, and we have demonstrated that this can improve the generated descriptions from the perspective of the hearer.",
        "Recent work in psycholinguistics, focusing on spontaneous speech in dialogue, has shown that speakers and hearers often act as if they are completely oblivious of the epistemic limitations of their interlocutors, even when these limitations have been made perfectly obvious to them (e.g., Keysar, Lin, and Barr 2003).",
        "These widely known results have caused some researchers to expect language users to behave with unbridled descriptive \"egocentricity\" in all situations.",
        "The first of our two experiments suggests that human writers (as opposed, perhaps, to speakers) can be highly altruistic in their descriptions of objects.",
        "The second experiment demonstrates how descriptive altruism can benefit readers.",
        "By exploring the benefits for the hearer (in terms of the effort required for identifying the referent), we have not only shown that it can be good to add logically redundant information to a referring expression; we have arguably also shed some light on the reason why redundant descriptions are sometimes preferred.",
        "By counting the number of clicks that subjects need in order to find the referent, and relating these to predictions stemming from our Ancestral Search model, we believe that we have achieved a degree of insight into the \"resolution\" processes in the head of the reader, not unlike the way in which insights in human language processing can be produced by eye-tracking experiments.",
        "It would be interesting to see whether the ideas discussed here can be confirmed using such a more entrenched psycholinguistic paradigm."
