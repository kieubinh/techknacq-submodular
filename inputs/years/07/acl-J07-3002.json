        "We find this lack of correlation between previous word alignment quality metrics and BLEU counterintuitive, because we and other researchers have measured this correlation in the context of building SMT systems that have benefited from using the BLEU metric in improving performance in open evaluations such as the NIST evaluations.",

        "The gold standard word alignment sets we use have been manually annotated using links between words showing translational correspondence.",
        "Links which must be present in a hypothesized alignment are called Sure links.",
        "Some of the alignment sets also have links which are not Sure links but are Possible links (Och and Ney 2003).",
        "Possible links which are not Sure may be present but need not be present.",
        "We evaluate the translation performance of SMT systems by translating a held-out translation test set and measuring the BLEU score of our hypothesized translations against one or more reference translations.",
        "We also have an additional held-out translation set, the development set, which is employed by the MT system to train the weights of its log-linear model to maximize BLEU (Och 2003).",
        "We work with data sets for three different language pairs, examining French to English, Arabic to English, and Romanian to English translation tasks.",
        "The training data for the French/English data set is taken from the LDC Canadian Hansard data set, from which the word aligned data (presented in Och and Ney 2003) was also taken.",

        "We used a separate Canadian Hansard data set (released by ISI) as the source of the translation test set and development set.",
        "We evaluate two different tasks using this data, a medium task where 1/8 of the data (8.4 million English words) is used as the fixed bitext, and a large task where all of the data is used as the fixed bitext.",
        "The 484 sentences in the gold standard word alignments have 4,376 Sure links and 19,222 Possible links.",

        "However, many knowledge sources do not vary with the final word alignment, such as rescoring with IBM Model 1, n-gram language models, and the length penalty.",

        "We have observed in the past that generative models used for statistical word alignment create alignments of increasing quality as they are exposed to more data.",
        "The intuition behind this is simple; as more co-occurrences of source and target words are observed, the word alignments are better.",
        "If we wish to increase the quality of a word alignment, we allow the alignment process access to extra data, which is used only during the alignment process and then removed.",
        "If we wish to decrease the quality of a word alignment, we divide the bitext into pieces and align the pieces independently of one another, finally concatenating the results together.",

        "We evaluate our approaches using these heuristics because we would like to account for alignments generated in different fashions.",
        "These three heuristics were used as the baselines in virtually all recent work on automatic word alignment, and most of the best SMT systems use these techniques as well.",
        "When applying the union symmetrization heuristic, we take the transitive closure of the bipartite graph created, which results in fully connected components indicating translational correspondence.",
        "Each of the presented alignments are equivalent from a translational correspondence perspective and the first two will be mapped to the third",

        "We then apply the symmetrization heuristics to these pairs.",

        "Because of this, it is possible to maximize AER by favoring precision over recall, which can be done by simply guessing very few alignment links.",

        "We have presented an empirical study of the use of simple evaluation metrics based on gold standard alignment of a small number of sentences to predict machine translation performance.",
        "Based on our experiments we can now draw the following conclusions:",

        "When S C P, AER does not share the important property of F-Measure that unequal precision and recall are penalized, making it easy to obtain good AER scores by simply guessing fewer alignment links.",
        "As a result AER is a misleading metric that should no longer be used.",
        "2.",
        "Good correlation was obtained for the medium French and Arabic data sets, the large Arabic data set, and the small Romanian data set.",
        "We have explained most of the effect of alignment quality on these sets, and if we are given the F-Measure of a hypothesized word alignment for the bitext, we can make a reasonable prediction as to what the resulting BLEU score will be.",
        "3.",
        "We have only partially explained the effect of alignment quality on BLEU for the large French data set, and further investigation is warranted.",
        "4.",
        "We recommend using the Blinker guidelines as a starting point for new alignment annotation efforts, and that Sure-only annotation be used.",
        "If a larger gold standard is available and was already annotated using the Sure versus Possible distinction, this is likely to have only slightly worse results.",
        "Although we have addressed measuring alignment quality for phrasal SMT, similar work is now required to see how to measure alignment quality for other settings of machine translation and for other tasks.",
        "For an evaluation campaign the organizers should pick a specific task, such as improving phrasal SMT, and calculate an appropriate a to be used.",
        "Individual researchers working on the same phrasal SMT tasks as those reported here (or on very similar tasks) could use the values of a we calculated.",
        "Our work invalidates some of the conclusions of recent alignment work which presented only evaluations based on metrics like AER or balanced F-Measure, and explains the lack of correlation in the few works which presented both such a metric and final MT results.",
        "A good example of the former are our own results (Fraser and Marcu 2005).",
        "The work presented there had the highest balanced F-Measure scores for the Romanian/English WPT05 shared task, but based on the findings here it is possible that a different algorithm tuned for the correct criterion would have had better MT performance.",
        "Other work includes many papers working on alignment models where words are allowed to participate in a maximum of one link.",
        "These models generally have higher precision and lower recall than IBM Model 4 symmetrized using the \"Refined\" or \"Union\" heuristics.",
        "Recall that in Section 3.1 we showed that AER is broken in a way that favors precision.",
        "It is therefore likely that the results reported in these papers are affected by the AER bias and that the corresponding improvements in AER score do not correlate with increases in phrasal SMT performance.",
        "We suggest comparing alignment algorithms by measuring performance in an identified final task such as machine translation.",
        "F-Measure with an appropriate setting of a will be useful during the development process of new alignment models, or as a maximization criterion for discriminative training of alignment models (Cherry and Lin 2003; Ayan, Dorr, and Monz 2005; Ittycheriah and Roukos 2005; Liu, Liu, and Lin 2005; Fraser and Marcu 2006; Lacoste-Julien et al.",
