        "There has been a great deal of recent research into word sense disambiguation, particularly since the inception of the Senseval evaluation exercises.",
        "Because a word often has more than one meaning, resolving word sense ambiguity could benefit applications that need some level of semantic interpretation of language input.",
        "A major problem is that the accuracy of word sense disambiguation systems is strongly dependent on the quantity of manually sense-tagged data available, and even the best systems, when tagging every word token in a document, perform little better than a simple heuristic that guesses the first, or predominant, sense of a word in all contexts.",
        "The success ofthis heuristic is due to the skewed nature ofword sense distributions.",
        "Data for the heuristic can come from either dictionaries or a sample of sense-tagged data.",
        "However, there is a limited supply of the latter, and the sense distributions and predominant sense of a word can depend on the domain or source of a document.",
        "(The first sense of \"star\" for example would be different in the popular press and scientific journals).",
        "In this article, we expand on a previously proposed method for determining the predominant sense of a word automatically from raw text.",
        "We look at a number of different data sources and parameterizations of the method, using evaluation results and error analyses to identify where the method performs well and also where it does not.",
        "In particular, we find that the method does not work as well for verbs and adverbs as nouns and adjectives, but produces more accurate predominant sense information than the widely used SemCor corpus for nouns with low coverage in that corpus.",
        "We further show that the method is able to adapt successfully to domains when using domain specific corpora as input and where the input can either be hand-labeled for domain or automatically classified."

        "In word sense disambiguation, the \"first sense\" heuristic (choosing the first, or predominant sense of a word) is used by most state-of-the-art systems as a back-off method when information from the context is not sufficient to make a more informed choice.",
        "In this article, we present an in-depth study of a method for automatically acquiring predominant senses for words from raw text (McCarthy et al. 2004a).",
        "The method uses distributionally similar words listed as \"nearest neighbors\" in automatically acquired thesauruses (e.g., Lin 1998a), and takes advantage of the observation that the more prevalent a sense of a word, the more neighbors will relate to that sense, and the higher their distributional similarity scores will be.",
        "The senses of a word are defined in a sense inventory.",
        "We use WordNet (Fellbaum 1998) because this is widely used, is publicly available, and has plenty of gold-standard evaluation data available (Miller et al. 1993; Cotton et al. 2001; Preiss and Yarowsky 2001; Mihalcea and Edmonds 2004).",
        "The distributional strength of the neighbors is associated with the senses of a word using a measure of semantic similarity which relies on the relationships between word senses, such as hyponyms (available in an inventory such as WordNet) or overlap in the definitions of word senses (available in most dictionaries), or both.",
        "In this article we provide a detailed discussion and quantitative analysis of the motivation behind the first sense heuristic, and a full description of our method.",
        "We extend previously reported work in a number of different directions:",
        "We evaluate the method on all parts of speech (PoS) on SemCor (Miller et al. 1993).",
        "Previous experiments (McCarthy et al. 2004c) evaluated only nouns on SemCor, or all PoS but only on the Senseval-2 (Cotton et al. 2001) and Senseval-3 (Mihalcea and Edmonds 2004) data.",
        "The evaluation on all PoS is much more extensive because the SemCor corpus is composed of 220,000 words in contrast to the 6 documents in the Senseval-2 and 3 English all words data (10,000 words).",
        "• We compare two WordNet similarity measures in our evaluation on nouns, and also contrast performance using two publicly available thesauruses, both produced from the same NEWSWIRE corpus, but one derived using a proximity-based approach and the other using dependency relations from a parser.",
        "It turns out that the results from the proximity-based thesaurus are comparable to those from the dependency-based thesaurus; this is encouraging for applying the method to languages without sophisticated analysis tools.",
        "• We manually analyze a sample of errors from the SemCor evaluation.",
        "A small number of errors can be traced back to inherent shortcomings of our method, but the main source of error is due to noise from related senses.",
        "This is a common problem for all WSD systems (Ide and Wilks 2006) but one which is only recently starting to be addressed by the WSD community (Navigli, Litkowski, and Hargraves 2007).",
        "• One motivation for an automatic method for acquiring predominant senses is that there will always be words for which there are insufficient data available in manually sense-tagged resources.",
        "We compare the performance of our automatic method with the first sense heuristic derived from SemCor on nouns in the Senseval-2 data.",
        "We find that the",
        "automatic method outperforms the one obtained from manual annotations in SemCor for nouns with fewer than five occurrences in SemCor.",
        "• Aside from the lack of coverage of manually annotated data, there is a need for first sense heuristics to be specific to domain.",
        "We explore the potential for applying the method with domain-specific text for all PoS in an experiment using a gold-standard domain-specific resource (Magnini and Cavaglia 2000) which we have used previously only with nouns.",
        "We show that although there is a little mileage to be had from domain-specific first sense heuristics for verbs, nouns benefit greatly from domain-specific training.",
        "• In previous work (Koeling, McCarthy, and Carroll 2005) we produced manually sense-annotated domain-specific test corpora for a lexical sample, and demonstrated that predominant senses acquired (from hand-classified corpora) in the same domain as the test data outperformed the SemCor first sense.",
        "We further this exploration by contrasting with results from training on automatically categorized text from the English Gigaword Corpus and show that the results are comparable to those using hand-classified domain data.",
        "The article is organized as follows.",
        "In the next section we motivate the use of predominant sense information in WSD systems and the need for acquiring this information automatically.",
        "In Section 3 we give an overview of related work in WSD, focusing on the acquisition of prior sense distributions and domain-specific sense information.",
        "Section 4 describes our acquisition method.",
        "Section 5 describes the experimental setup for the work reported in this article.",
        "Section 6 describes four experiments.",
        "The first evaluates the first sense heuristic using predominant sense information acquired for all PoS on SemCor; for nouns we compare two semantic similarity methods and three different types of distributional thesaurus.",
        "We also report an error analysis for all PoS of our method.",
        "The second experiment compares the performance of the automatic method to the manually produced data in SemCor, on nouns in the Senseval-2 data, looking particularly at nouns which have a low frequency in SemCor.",
        "The third uses corpora in restricted domains and the subject field code gold standard of Magnini and Cavaglia (2000) to investigate the potential for domain-specific rankings for different PoS.",
        "The fourth compares results when we train and test on domain-specific corpora, where the training data is (1) manually categorized for domain and from the same corpus as the test data, and (2) where the training data is harvested automatically from another corpus which is categorized automatically.",
        "Finally, we conclude (Section 7) and discuss directions for future work (Section 8)."

      "text": [
        "The problem of disambiguating the meanings of words in text has received much attention recently, particularly since the inception of the Senseval evaluation exercises (Kilgarriff and Palmer 2000; Preiss and Yarowsky 2001; Mihalcea and Edmonds 2004).",
        "One of the standard Senseval tasks (the \"all words\" task) is to tag each open class word with one of its senses, as listed in a dictionary or thesaurus such as WordNet (Fellbaum 1998).",
        "The most accurate word sense disambiguation (WSD) systems use supervised machine learning approaches (Stevenson and Wilks 2001), trained on text which has been sense tagged by hand.",
        "However, the performance of these systems is strongly dependent on the quantity of training data available (Yarowsky and Florian 2002), and manually sense-annotated text is extremely costly to produce (Kilgarriff 1998).",
        "The largest all words sense tagged corpus is SemCor, which is 220,000 words taken from 103 passages, each of about 2,000 words, from the Brown corpus (Francis and Kucera 1979) and the complete text of a 19th-century American novel, The Red Badge of Courage, which totals 45,600 words (Landes, Leacock, and Tengi 1998).",
        "Approximately half of the words in this corpus are open-class words (nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs) and these have been linked to WordNet senses by human taggers using a software interface.",
        "The shortage of training data due to the high costs of tagging texts has motivated research into unsupervised methods for WSD.",
        "But in the English all-words tasks in Senseval-2 and Senseval-3 (Snyder and Palmer 2004), systems that did not make use of hand-tagged data (in some form or other) performed substantially worse than those that did.",
        "Table 1 summarizes the situation.",
        "It gives the precision and recall of the best two supervised (S) and unsupervised (U) systems for the English all words and English lexical sample for Senseval-2 and -3, along with the first sense baseline (FS) reported by the task organizers.",
        "This is a simple application of the \"first sense\" heuristic – that is, using the most common sense of a word for every instance of it in the test corpus, regardless of context.",
        "Although contextual WSD is of course preferable, the baseline is a very powerful one and unsupervised systems find it surprisingly hard to beat (indeed, some of the systems that report themselves as unsupervised actually make some use of a manually obtained first-sense heuristic).",
        "Considering both precision and recall, only 5 of 26 systems in the Senseval-3 English all-words task beat the first sense heuristic as derived from SemCor (61.5%), and then by only a few percentage points (the top system scoring 65% precision and recall) despite using hand-tagged training data available from SemCor and previous Senseval data sets, large sets of contextual features, and sophisticated machine learning algorithms.",
        "The performance of WSD systems, at least for all-words tasks, seems to have plateaued at a level just above the first sense heuristic (Snyder and Palmer 2004).",
        "This is due to the shortage of training data and the often fine granularity of sense distinctions.",
        "Ide and Wilks (2006) argue that it is best to concentrate effort on distinctions which are useful for applications and where systems can be confident of high precision.",
        "In cases where systems are less confident, but word senses, rather than words, are needed, the first sense heuristic is a powerful back-off strategy.",
        "This strategy is dependent on information provided in dictionaries.",
        "Two dictionaries that have been used by English WSD systems are the Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English (LDOCE) (Procter",
        "1 We rank the systems by the recall scores, because this is the accuracy over the entire test set regardless of how many items were attempted.",
        "2 Note that the classification of systems as unsupervised is not straightforward.",
        "Systems reported as unsupervised in the Senseval proceedings sometimes make use of some manual annotations.",
        "For example, the top scoring system that reported itself unsupervised in the Senseval-3 lexical sample task used manually sense-tagged training data for constructing glosses.",
        "3 The verb lexical sample was done as a separate exercise for Senseval-2, and for brevity we have not included the results from this task.",
        "4 The all-words task organizers used the first sense as listed in WordNet.",
        "This is based on the SemCor first sense because WordNet senses are ordered according to the frequency data in SemCor.",
        "However, where senses are not found in WordNet, the ordering is arbitrarily determined as a function of the \"grind\" program (see http://uordnet.princeton.edu/man/grind.1WN.htm).",
        "The lexical sample task organizers state that they use the \"most frequent sense\" but do not stipulate if this is taken from WordNet, or directly from SemCor.",
        "5 This figure is the arithmetic mean of two published estimates (Snyder and Palmer 2004), the difference being due to the treatment of multiwords."

        "The act of sending a message sense is overtaken by the gears sense because the credit from shared distributional neighbors is split between it and the communication sense.",
        "neighbors There are not many neighbors related to the sense.",
        "There can be various reasons for this, such as the sense having restricted contexts of occurrence or only a small number of near synonyms existing for the sense.",
        "An example of this is the adjective live where the SemCor FS unrecorded sense seems to occur in the BNC corpus more than the alive sense; there are plenty of grammatical relations pertaining to this sense, but there are few distributional neighbors near in meaning to unrecorded.",
        "spurious similarity The WordNet similarity scores were misled by spurious relationships to neighbors; this can occur in dense areas such as the \"physical object\" region of the noun hyponym hierarchy.",
        "An example of this is the verb tap which has neighbors push and press which are related to the AUTO FS (solicit) as well as the SemCor FS (strike lightly).",
        "The results of the error analysis are shown in Table 11.",
        "The analysis shows that differences between the training (BNC) and testing (SemCor) corpora are not a major source of error.",
        "Although SemCor itself (the released files from the Brown corpus comprising only 200,000 words) is not large enough to build a thesaurus with entries for a reasonable portion of the words, we did build a thesaurus from the entire Brown corpus (1 million words) to see the effect of corpus data.",
        "The results are compared to those from the BNC in Table 12 on the set of words which had thesaurus entries in the Brown data (to make the results more comparable, because the corpora are of such different sizes).",
        "We also show the average results for 10 random selections of a 1 million word random sample of the BNC.",
        "To do this we randomly selected 90th of the tuples.",
        "The differences in the WSDsc for the BNC 90 sample and the Brown corpus are significant (p < .01 on the x), but the differences in PSacc are not significant.",
        "Although the entire BNC produced better results than the Brown data, this is undoubtedly due to the difference in size of the corpus.",
        "Taking a comparably sized sample, the results are slightly better from Brown which is the corpus from which SemCor is taken.",
        "For nouns, it was apparent that in two cases less-prevalent senses were receiving a higher ranking simply because the credit for some neighbors associated with another meaning was split between related senses (error type competing).",
        "This was not observed for other parts of speech, possibly because the AUTO FS was rarely unrelated to the SemCor FS.",
        "There were some problems arising from spurious similarity.",
        "One possible source of such problems is due to the ambiguity of the neighbor; in the future we will look at reducing this source of error by removing neighbors which have a value for sx in Equation (2) which is not the same as that preferred by the other senses of the target word (w).",
        "For adverbs, all the cases that were categorized as spurious similarity were also noted to be related to the SemCor FS, though they were not categorized as related as this was not considered the primary cause of the error.",
        "The analysis was hardest for verbs.",
        "Verbs are on average highly polysemous, and often have senses that are related.",
        "Furthermore, the structure of the WordNet verb tro-ponym hierarchy is very shallow compared to the noun hyponymy hierarchy, so there",
        "23 The closest neighbors to the adjective live are adult, forthcoming, lively, solo, excellent, stuffed, living, dead, and australian weekly.",

        "SemCor results for Nouns using jcn.",
        "Thesaurus PSacc%% WSDsc % are more possibilities for spurious similarities from overlap of glosses.",
        "So, although we tried to identify the main problem source, for verbs the problems usually arose from a combination of factors and the relatedness of the senses was usually one of these.",
        "Relatedness of senses and fine-grained distinctions are major sources of error.",
        "There have been various attempts to group WordNet senses both manually and automatically (Agirre and Lopez de Lacalle 2003; McCarthy 2006; Palmer, Dang, and Fellbaum 2007).",
        "Indeed, McCarthy demonstrated that distributional and semantic similarity can be used for relating word senses and that such methods increase accuracy of first sense heuristics, including the automatic method proposed here.",
        "WSD is improved with coarser-grained inventories but ultimately, performance depends on the application.",
        "For example, the noun bar has 11 senses in WordNet 1.6.",
        "These include the pub sense as well as the counter sense and these are related to a certain extent.",
        "One might want to group them when acquiring predominant senses, but there may be situations where they should be distinguished.",
        "For example, if one were to ask a robot to \"go to the bar\" one would hope it could use the context to go get the drinks rather than replying that it is already there!",
        "Even in cases where fine-grained distinctions are ultimately required, it may be helpful to have a coarse-grained prior and then use contextual features to tease apart subtle sense distinctions.",
        "From our error analysis, the problem of semantically isolated senses (identified as neighbors) was not a major source of error, but still causes some problems.",
        "One possible remedy might be to identify these cases by looking for neighbors which relate strongly to a sense which none of the other neighbors relate to and weighting the contribution from these neighbors more.",
        "This may however give rise to further errors because of the noise introduced by focusing on individual neighbors.",

        "6.2 Experiment 2: Frequency and the SemCor First Sense Heuristic",
        "In the previous section we described an evaluation of the accuracy of automatically acquired predominant sense information.",
        "We carried out the evaluation with respect to SemCor in order to have as much test data as possible.",
        "To obtain reasonably reliable gold-standard first-sense data and first-sense heuristic upper bounds, we limited the evaluation to words occurring at least three times in SemCor.",
        "Clearly this scenario is unrealistic.",
        "For many words, and particularly for nouns, there is very little or no data in SemCor; Table 2 shows that 81.9% of nouns (excluding multiwords) listed in WordNet do not occur at all in SemCor.",
        "Thus, even for English, which has substantial manually sense-tagged resources, coverage is severely limited for many words.",
        "For a more realistic comparison of automatic and manual heuristics, we therefore now change to a different test corpus, the Senseval-2 English all-words task data set.",
        "We focus on nouns and evaluate using all words regardless of their frequencies in SemCor.",
        "We examine the effect of frequency in SemCor on performance of a SemCor-derived heuristic in comparison to results from our automatic method on the same words.",
        "Our hypothesis is that although automatically acquired predominant sense information may not outperform first-sense data obtained from a hand-tagged resource over all words in a text, the information may well be more accurate for low frequency items.",
        "We use a mapping between different WordNet versions (Daude, Padro, and Rigau 2000) to obtain the Senseval-2 all words noun data (originally distributed with 1.7 sense numbers) with 1.6 sense numbers.",
        "As well as examining the performance of our method in contrast to the SemCor heuristic, we calculate an upper bound for this using the first sense heuristic from the Senseval-2 all-words data itself.",
        "This is obtained for nouns with two or more occurrences in the Senseval-2 data and where one sense occurs more than any of the others.",
        "We calculate type, precision, and recall, using this Senseval-2 first-sense as the gold standard.",
        "The recall measure is the same as PSacc described previously, except that we include items which do not have entries in the thesaurus, scoring them incorrect.",
        "Precision only includes items where there is a sense ranked higher than any other for that word with the prevalence score, that is, it does not include items with a joint automatic ranking.",
        "We also calculate token precision and recall (WSD).",
        "These measures relate to WSDsc, but again, recall includes words not in the thesaurus which are scored incorrect, and precision does not include items with a joint automatic ranking.",
        "We also separately compute WSD precision for words not in SemCor (NISC).",
        "The results are shown in Table 13.",
        "The automatically acquired predominant sense results (the first six lines of results in the table) are approaching the SemCor-derived results (third line from the bottom of the table).",
        "The NISC results are particularly encouraging, but with the caveat that there are only 17 such words in the data.",
        "The precision for these items is higher than the",
        "25 This mapping is available at http://uuu.lsi.upc.es/~nlp/tools/mapping.html.",
        "26 Note that these figures are lower than those of McCarthy et al.",
        "(2004a) in a similar experiment because the evaluation here is only on polysemous words.",
        "Evaluating predominant sense information for polysemous nouns on the Senseval-2 all-words task data.",
        "Type WSD/token overall figure.",
        "This is because the nouns involved are less frequent so tend to be less polysemous and consequently have a higher random baseline.",
        "There are a few nouns that are not in the automatic ranking, but this is due to the fact that neighbors were not collected for these nouns in the thesaurus because of tagging or parser errors or the particular set of grammatical relations used.",
        "It should be possible to extend the range of grammatical relations, or use proximity-based relations, so that neighbors can be obtained in these cases.",
        "It would also be possible to assign some credit in the case of joint top ranked senses to increase coverage.",
        "Looking at Table 13 in more detail, it seems to be the case that although the BNC thesaurus does well in identifying the first sense of a word (the type results), the PROX and DEP thesauruses from the NEWSWIRE corpus return better WSD results when used with the jcn measure.",
        "This is possibly because jcn works well for more frequent items due to its incorporation of frequency information, and the NEWSWIRE corpus has more data for frequent words, although coverage is not as good as the BNC as seen by the bigger differences in precision and recall and the figures in Table 8.",
        "The lower coverage may be due to the narrower domain and genre of the NEWSWIRE corpus, though spelling and capitalization differences probably also account for some differences.",
        "Table 14 shows results on the Senseval-2 nouns for the best similarity measure and thesaurus combinations in Table 13 for nouns at or below various frequencies in SemCor.",
        "(The differences between the DEP and PROX thesauruses are negligible at frequencies of 10 or below, so for those we report only the results for DEP.)",
        "As we anticipated, for low frequency words the automatic methods do give more accurate predominant sense information than SemCor.",
        "The low number of test items at frequency five or less means that results for jcn with the BNC thesaurus are not significantly better when compared with SemCor (p = .05); however the lesk WSD results are significantly better (p <.01 for the < 1 threshold and p <.05 for the < 5 threshold).",
        "On the whole, we see that the automatic method, using either jcn or lesk and any of the three thesauruses, tend to give better results than SemCor on nouns which have low coverage in SemCor.",

        "In this article we have argued that information on the predominant sense of words is important, and that it is desirable to be able to infer this automatically from unlabeled text.",
        "We presented a number of evaluations investigating various facets of a previously proposed method for automatically acquiring this information (McCarthy et al.",
        "2004a).",
        "The evaluations extend ones in previous publications in a number of ways: they use larger, balanced test data sets, and they compare alternative semantic similarity scores and distributional thesauruses derived from different corpora and based on different kinds of relations.",
        "We also looked in detail at areas where the method performs well and also where it does not, and carried out a manual error analysis to identify the types of mistakes it makes.",
        "Our main results are:",
        "• The predominant sense acquisition method produces promising results overall for all open class parts of speech, when evaluated on SemCor, a large balanced corpus.",
        "• The highest accuracies are for nouns and adjectives; overall accuracy for verbs is lower, but they have the lowest random baseline; adverbs have the lowest average polysemy but gains over the random baseline are lower than for other PoS.",
        "• Using a thesaurus computed from proximity-based relations produces almost as good results as using an otherwise identical one computed from syntactic dependency-based relations.",
        "• Lesk's semantic similarity score (Banerjee and Pedersen 2002, lesk) produces particularly good results for nouns which have low corpus frequencies; Jiang and Conrath's (1997, jcn) score does well on higher frequency words.",
        "• For low frequency nouns in SemCor, the method, using any combination of automatically acquired thesaurus and semantic similarity score that we tried, produces more accurate predominant sense information than SemCor.",
        "In particular, for nouns with a frequency of five or less (12.9% of the polysemous nouns in the Senseval-2 data) it outperforms the SemCor first sense heuristic.",
        "As the threshold is increased, the SemCor first sense",
        "31 The lesk score has wider applicability than jcn since it can be applied to all parts of speech.",
        "It can also be used with any sense inventory which has textual definitions for its senses even if the inventory does not contain WordNet-like semantic relations.",
        "heuristic becomes more competitive, but some of the automatic methods are still outperforming it for nouns occurring 20 or fewer times in SemCor.",
        "• Nouns show a stronger tendency for domain-specific meanings than other parts of speech, but predominant senses for verbs acquired automatically with respect to domain-specific corpora also correlate with the appropriate domain labeling for those senses.",
        "• Predominant senses acquired using domain-specific corpora outperform thosefromSemCorinaWSD task, for a selection of nouns, using corpora consisting of either hand-classified or automatically-classified documents."
