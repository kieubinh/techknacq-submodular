        "(2005) have also described how reviewing decisions is critical to the reuse of meeting recordings.",
        "For example, a new engineer who just get assigned to a project will need to know what major decisions have been made in previous meetings.",
        "Unless all decisions are recorded in meeting minutes or annotated in the speech recordings, it is difficult to locate the decision points by the browsing and playback utilities alone.",
        "Banerjee and Rudnicky (2005) have shown that it is easier for users to retrieve the information they seek if the meeting record includes information about topic segmentation, speaker role, and meeting state (e.g., discussion, presentation, briefing).",
        "To assist users in identifying or revisiting decisions in meeting archives, our goal is to automatically identify the dialogue acts and segments where decisions are made.",
        "Because reviewing decisions is indispensable in collaborative work, automatic decision detection is expected to lend support to computerassisted meeting tracking and understanding (e.g., assisting in the fulfilment of the decisions made in the meetings) and the development of group information management applications (e.g., constructing group memory)."

        "Spontaneous face-to-face dialogues in meetings violate many assumptions made by techniques previously developed for broadcast news (e.g., TDT and TRECVID), telephone conversations (e.g., Switchboard), and human-computer dialogues (e.g., DARPA Communicator).",
        "In order to develop techniques for understanding multiparty dialogues, smart meeting rooms have been built at several institutes to record large corpora of meetings in natural contexts, including CMU (Waibel et al., 2001), LDC (Cieri et al., 2002), NIST (Garofolo et al., 2004), ICSI (Janin et al., 2003), and in the context of the IM2/M4 project (Marchand-Mailet, 2003).",
        "More recently, scenario-based meetings, in which participants are assigned to different roles and given specific tasks, have been recorded in the context of the CALO project (the Y2 Scenario Data) (CALO, 2003) and the AMI project (Carletta et al., 2005).",
        "The availability of meeting corpora has enabled researchers to begin to develop descriptive models of meeting discussions.",
        "Some researchers are modelling the dynamics of the meeting, exploiting dialogue models previously proposed for dialogue management.",
        "For example, Niekrasz et al.",
        "(2005) use the Issue-Based Information System (IBIS) model (Kunz and Ritte, 1970) to incorporate the history of dialogue moves into the Multi-Modal Discourse (MMD) ontology.",
        "Other researchers are modelling the content of the meeting using the type of structures proposed in work on argumentation.",
        "For example, Rienks et al.",

        "(2003) propose a schema to model different argumentation acts (e.g., accept, request, reject) and their organization and synchronization.",
        "Decisions are often seen as a by-product ofthese models.",

        "(2005) and Wrede and Shriberg (2003) automatically identify the level of emotion in meeting spurts (e.g., group level of interest, hot spots).",
        "Other researchers have developed models for detecting agreement and disagreement in meetings, using models that combine lexical features with prosodic features (e.g., pause, duration, F0, speech rate) (Hillard et al., 2003) and structural information (e.g., the previous and following speaker) (Galley et al., 2004).",
        "More recently, Purver et al.",
        "(2006) have tackled the problem of detecting one type of decision, namely action items, which embody the transfer of group responsibility.",
        "However, no prior work has addressed the problem ofau-tomatically identifying decision-making units more generally in multiparty meetings.",

      "text": [
        "Our aim is to develop models for automatically detecting segments of conversation that contain decisions directly from the audio recordings and transcripts of the meetings, and to identify the feature combinations that are most effective for this task.",
        "Meetings can be viewed at different levels of granularity.",
        "In this study, we first consider how to detect the dialogue acts that contain decision-related information (DM DAs).",
        "Since it is often difficult to interpret a decision without knowing the current topic of discussion, we are also interested in detecting decision-making segments at a coarser level of granularity: topic segments.",
        "The task of automatic decision detection can therefore be divided into two subtasks: detecting DM DAs and detecting decision-making topic segments (DM Segments).",
        "In this study we propose to first empirically identify the features that are most characteristic of decision-making dialogue acts and then computationally integrate the characteristic features to locate the DM DAs in meeting archives.",
        "For the latter task, previous research on automatic meeting understanding and tracking has commonly utilized a classification framework, in which variants of generative and conditional models are computed directly from data.",
        "In this study, we use a Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) classifier to combine the decision characteristic features to predict DM DAs and DM Segments.",
        "In this study, we use a set of 50 scenario-driven meetings (approximately 37,400 dialogue acts) that have been segmented into dialogue acts and annotated with decision information in the AMI meeting corpus.",
        "These meetings are driven by a scenario, wherein four participants play the role of Project Manager, Marketing Expert, Industrial Designer, and User Interface Designer in a design team in a series of four meetings.",
        "Each series of meeting recordings uses four distinctive speakers different from other series.",
        "The corpus includes manual transcripts for all meetings.",
        "It also comes with individual sound files recorded by close-talking head-mounted microphones and cross-talking sound files recorded by desktop microphones.",
        "In fact, it is difficult to determine whether a dialogue act contains information relevant to any decision point without knowing what decisions have been made in the meeting.",
        "Therefore, in this study DM DAs are annotated in a two-phase process: First, annotators are asked to browse through the meeting record and write an abstractive summary directed to the project manager about the decisions that have been made in the meeting.",
        "Next, another group of three annotators are asked to produce extractive summaries by selecting a subset (around 10%) of dialogue acts which form a summary of this meeting for the absent manager to understand what has transpired in the meeting.",
        "Finally, this group of annotators are asked to go through the extractive dialogue acts one by one and judge whether they support any of the sentences in the decision section of the abstractive summary; if a dialogue act is related to any sentence in the decision section, a \"decision link\" from the dialogue act to the decision sentence is added.",
        "For those extracted dialogue acts that do not have any closely related sentence, the annotators are not obligated to specify a link.",
        "We then label the dialogue acts that have one or more decision links as DM DAs.",
        "In the 50 meetings we used for the experiments, the annotators have on average found four decisions per meeting and specified around two decision links to each sentence in the decision summary section.",
        "Overall, 554 out of 37,400 dialogue acts have been annotated as DM DAs, accounting for 1.4% of all dialogue acts in the data set and 12.7% of the orginal extractive summary (which is consisted of the extracted dialogue acts).",
        "An earlier analysis has established the intercoder reliability of the two-phase process at the level of kappa ranging from 0.5 to 0.8.",
        "In this round of experiment, for each meeting in the 50-meeting dataset we randomly choose the DM DA annotation of one annotator as the sourec of its ground truth data.",
        "Topic segmentation has also been annotated for the AMI meeting corpus.",
        "Annotators had the freedom to mark a topic as subordinated (down to two levels) wherever appropriate.",
        "As the AMI meetings are scenario-driven, annotators are expected to find that most topics recur.",
        "Therefore, they are given a standard set of topic descriptions that can be used as labels for each identified topic segment.",
        "Annotators will only add a new label if they cannot find a match in the standard set.",
        "The AMI scenario meetings contain around 14 topic segments per meeting.",
        "Each segment lasts on average 44 dialogue acts long and contains two DM DAs.",
        "DM Segments are operationalized as topic segments that contain one or more DM DAs.",
        "Overall, 198 out of 623 (31.78%) topic segments in the 50-meeting dataset are DM Segments.",
        "As the meetings we use are driven by a predetermined agenda, we expect to find that interlocutors are more likely to reach decisions when certain topics are brought up.",
        "Analysis shows that some topics are indeed more likely to contain decisions than others.",
        "For example, 80% of the segments labelled as Costing and 58% of those labelled Budget are DM Segments, whereas only 7% of the Existing Product segments and none of the Trend-Watching segments are DM Segments.",
        "Functional segments, such as Chitchat, Opening and Closing, almost never include decisions.",
        "To provide a qualitative account of the effect of different feature types on the task of automatic decision detection, we have conducted empirical analysis on four major types of features: lexical, prosodic, contextual and topical features.",
        "Previous research has studied lexical differences (i.e., occurrence counts of N-grams) between various aspects of speech, such as topics (Hsueh and Moore, 2006), speaker gender (Boulis and Ostendorf, 2005), and storytelling conversation (Gordon and Ganesan, 2005).",
        "As we expect that lexical differences also exist in DM conversations, we generated language models from the DM Dialogue Acts in the corpus.",
        "The comparison of the language models generated from the DM dialogue Acts and the rest of the conversations shows that some differences exist between the two models: (1) decision making conversations are more likely to contain we than I and You; (2) in decision-making conversations there are more explicit mentions of topical words, such as advanced chips and functional design; (3) in decision-",
        "Table 1 : Prosodie features used in this study.",
        "making conversations, there are fewer negative expressions, such as I don't think and I don't know.",
        "In an exploratory study using unigrams, as well as bigrams and trigrams, we found that using bigrams and trigrams does not improve the accuracy of classifying DM DAs, and therefore we include only unigrams in the set of lexical features in the experiments reported in Section 6.",
        "Functionally, prosodic features, i.e., energy, and fundamental frequency (F0), are indicative of segmentation and saliency.",
        "In this study, we follow Shriberg and Stolcke's (2001) direct modelling approach to manifest prosodic features as duration, pause, speech rate, pitch contour, and energy level.",
        "We utilize the individual sound files provided in the AMI corpus.",
        "To extract prosodic features from the sound files, we use the Snack Sound Toolkit to compute a list of pitch and energy values delimited by frames of 10 ms, using the normalized cross correlation function.",
        "Then we apply a piecewise linearisation procedure to remove the outliers and average the linearised values of the units within the time frame of a word.",
        "Pitch contour of a dialogue act is approximated by measuring the pitch slope at multiple points within the dialogue act, e.g., the first and last 100 and 200 ms.",
        "The rate of speech is calculated as both the number of words spoken per second and the number of syllables per second.",
        "We use Festival's speech synthesis front-end to return phonemes and syllabification information.",
        "An exploratory study has shown the benefits of including immediate prosodic contexts, and thus we also include prosodic features of the immediately preceding and following dialogue acts.",
        "Table 1 contains a list of automatically generated prosodic features used in this study.",
        "From our qualitative analysis, we expect that contextual features specific to the AMI corpus, such as the speaker role (i.e., PM, ME, ID, UID) and meeting type (i.e., kick-off, conceptual design, functional design, detailed design) to be characteristic of the DM DAs.",
        "Analysis shows that (1) participants assigned to the role of PM produce 42.5% of the DM DAs, and (2) participants make relatively fewer decisions in the kick-off meetings.",
        "Analysis has also demonstrated a difference in the type, the reflexivity and the number of addressees, between the DM DAs and the non-DM DAs.",
        "For example, dialogue acts of type inform, suggest, elicit assessment and elicit inform are more likely to be DM DAs.",
        "We have also found that immediately preceding and following dialogue acts are important for identifying DM DAs.",
        "For example, stalls and fragments preceding and fragments following a DM DA are more likely than for non-DM DAs.",

        "This is the first study that aimed to detect segments of the conversation that contain decisions.",
        "We have (1) empirically analyzed the characteristic features of DM dialogue acts, and (2) computational developed models to detect DM dialogue acts and DM topic segments, given the set of characteristic features.",
        "Empirical analysis has provided a qualitative account of the DM-characteristic features, whereas training the computational models on different feature combinations has provided a quantitative account of the effect of different feature types on the task of automatic decision detection.",
        "Empirical analysis has exhibited demonstrable differences",
        "(1) A: but um the feature that we considered for it not getting lost.",
        "(3) B: were talking about that a little bit (5) B: and we think that each of these are so distinctive, that it it's not just like another piece of technology around your house.",
        "(6) B: It's gonna be somewhere that it can be seen.",
        "(7) A: Mm-hmm.",
        "(8) B: So we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be as critical to have the loss (9) D: But if it's like under covers or like in a couch you still can't see it.",
        "(10) A: Okay , that's a fair evaluation.",
        "(11) A: Um we so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now.",
        "in the words (e.g., we), the contextual features (e.g., meeting type, speaker role, dialogue act type), and the topical features.",
        "The experimental results have suggested that (1) the model combining all the available features performs substantially better, achieving 62% and 82% overall accuracy on the task of detecting DM DAs and that of detecting DM Segments, respectively, (2) lexical features are the best indicators for both the task ofdetecting DM DAs and that of detecting DM Segments, and (3) combining topical features is important for improving the precision for the task of detecting DM Segments.",
        "Many of the features used in this study require human intervention, such as manual transcriptions, annotated dialogue act segmentations and labels, annotated topic segmentations and labels, and other types of meeting-specific features.",
        "Our ultimate goal is to identify decisions using automatically induced features.",
        "Therefore, studying the performance degradation when using the automatically generated versions of these features (e.g., ASR words) is essential for developing a fully automated component on detecting decisions immediately after a meeting or even for when a meeting is still in progress.",
        "Another problem that has been pointed out in Section 6 and in Section 7 is the different functional roles of DM dialogue acts in current annotations.",
        "Purver et al.",
        "(2006) have suggested a hierarchical annotation scheme to accommodate the different aspects of action items.",
        "The same technique may be applicable in a more general decision detection task.",
