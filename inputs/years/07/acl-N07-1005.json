        "In machine translation (MT) research, appropriately evaluating the quality of MT results is an important issue.",
        "In recent years, many researchers have tried to automatically evaluate the quality of MT and improve the performance of automatic MT evaluations (Niessen et al., 2000; Akiba et al., 2001; Papineni et al., 2002; NIST, 2002; Leusch et al., 2003; Turian et al., 2003; Babych and Hartley, 2004; Lin and Och, 2004; Banerjee and Lavie, 2005; Gimenez et al., 2005) because improving the performance of automatic MT evaluation is expected to enable us to use and improve MT systems efficiently.",
        "For example, Och reported that the quality of MT results was improved by using automatic MT evaluation measures for the parameter tuning of an MT system (Och, 2003) .",
        "This report shows that the quality of MT results improves as the performance of automatic MT evaluation improves.",
        "MT systems can be ranked if a set of MT results for each system and their reference translations are given.",
        "Usually, about 300 or more sentences are used to automatically rank MT systems (Koehn, 2004) .",
        "However, the quality of a sentence translated by an MT system is difficult to evaluate.",
        "For example, the results of five MTs into Japanese of the sentence \"The percentage of stomach cancer among the workers appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers.\"",
        "are shown in Table 1.",
        "A conventional automatic evaluation method ranks the fifth MT result first although its human subjective evaluation is the lowest.",
        "This is because conventional methods are based on the similarity between a translated sentence and its reference translation, and they give the translated sentence a high score when the two sentences are globally similar to each other in terms of lexical overlap.",
        "However, in the case of the above example,",
        "Original sentence The percentage of stomach cancer among the workers appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers.",
        "Reference translation roudousha no igan no wariai wa , asubesuto roudousha no tame ni saikou to naru youda .",
        "(in Japanese)",
        "the most important thing to maintain a high translation quality is to correctly translate \"for\" into the target language, and it would be difficult to detect the importance just by comparing an MT result and its reference translations even if the number of reference translations is increased.",
        "In general, when translating a given sentence, one or more conditions should be satisfied to maintain a high translation quality.",
        "In this paper, we show that constructing a test set where the conditions that are mainly established from a linguistic point of view are assigned to each test-set sentence in the form of yes/no questions, developing a system that determines an answer to each question, and combining a measure based on the questions and conventional measures enable the evaluation of the quality of a translated sentence more appropriately than using conventional methods.",

        "Two main types of data are used for evaluating MT quality.",

        "We demonstrated that the quality ofa translated sentence can be evaluated more appropriately than by using conventional methods.",
        "That was demonstrated by constructing a test set where the conditions that should be satisfied to maintain a high translation quality are assigned to each test-set sentence in the form of a question, by developing a system that determines an answer to each question, and by combining a measure based on the questions and conventional measures.",
        "We also presented a method for automatically generating sub-goals in the form of yes/no questions and estimating the rate of accomplishment of the sub-goals.",
        "Promising results were obtained.",
        "In the near future, we would like to expand the test set to improve the upper bound obtained by our method.",
        "We are also planning to expand the method and improve the accuracy of the automatic sub-goal generation and determination of the rate of accomplishment of sub-goals.",
        "The sub-goals of a given sentence should be generated by considering the complexity of the sentence and the alignment information between the original source-language sentence and its translation.",
        "Further advanced generation and estimation would give us information about the erroneous parts of MT results and their quality.",
        "We believe that future research would allow us to develop high-quality MT systems by tuning the system parameters based on the automatic MT evaluation measures."
