        "Evaluation has long been a stumbling block in the development of machine translation systems, due to the simple fact that there are many correct translations for a given sentence.",
        "The most commonly used metric, BLEU, correlates well over large test sets with human judgments (Papineni et al., 2002), but does not perform as well on sentence-level evaluation (Blatz et al., 2003).",
        "Later approaches to improve sentence-level evaluation performance can be summarized as falling into four types:",
        "• Metrics based on common loose sequences of MT outputs and references (Lin and Och, 2004; Liu and Gildea, 2006).",
        "Such metrics were",
        "shown to have better fluency evaluation performance than metrics based on n-grams such BLEU and NIST (Doddington, 2002).",
        "• Metrics based on syntactic similarities such as the headword chain metric (HWCM) (Liu and Gildea, 2005).",
        "Such metrics try to improve fluency evaluation performance for MT, but they heavily depend on automatic parsers, which are designed for well-formed sentences and cannot generate robust parse trees for MT outputs.",
        "• Metrics based on word alignment between MT outputs and the references (Banerjee and Lavie,",
        "2005) .",
        "Such metrics do well in adequacy evaluation, but are not as good in fluency evaluation, because of their unigram basis (Liu and Gildea, 2006) .",
        "• Combination of metrics based on machine learning.",
        "Kulesza and Shieber (2004) used SVMs to combine several metrics.",
        "Their method is based on the assumption that higher classification accuracy in discriminating human-from machine-generated translations will yield closer correlation with human judgment.",
        "This assumption may not always hold, particularly when classification is difficult.",
        "Lita et al.",
        "(2005) proposed a log-linear model to combine features, but they only did preliminary experiments based on 2 features.",
        "Following the track of previous work, to improve evaluation performance, one could either propose new metrics, or find more effective ways to combine the metrics.",
        "We explore both approaches.",
        "Much work has been done on computing MT scores based on the pair of MT output/reference, and we aim to investigate whether some other information could be used in the MT evaluation, such as source sentences.",
        "We propose two types of source-sentence related features as well as a feature based on part of speech.",
        "The three new types of feature can be summarized as follows:",
        "• Source-sentence constrained n-gram precision.",
        "Overlapping n-grams between an MT hypothesis and its references do not necessarily indicate correct translation segments, since they could correspond to different parts of the source sentence.",
        "Thus our constrained n-gram precision counts only overlapping n-grams in MT hypothesis and reference which are aligned to the same words in the source sentences.",
        "• Source-sentence reordering agreement.",
        "With the alignment information, we can compare the reorderings of the source sentence in the MT hypothesis and in its references.",
        "Such comparison only considers the aligned positions of the source words in MT hypothesis and references, and thus is oriented towards evaluating the sentence structure.",
        "• Discriminative unigram precision.",
        "We divide the normal n-gram precision into many sub-precisions according to their part of speech (POS).",
        "The division gives us flexibility to train the weights of each sub-precision in frameworks such as SVM and Maximum Correlation Training, which will be introduced later.",
        "The motivation behind such differentiation is that different sub-precisions should have different importance in MT evaluation, e.g., sub-precision of nouns, verbs, and adjectives should be important for evaluating adequacy, and sub-precision in determiners and conjunctions should mean more in evaluating fluency.",
        "Along the direction of feature combination, since indirect weight training using SVMs, based on reducing classification error, cannot always yield good performance, we train the weights by directly optimizing the evaluation performance, i.e., maximizing the correlation with the human judgment.",
        "This type of direct optimization is known as Minimum Error",
        "Rate Training (Och, 2003) in the MT community, and is an essential component in building the state-of-art MT systems.",
        "It would seem logical to apply similar methods to MT evaluation.",
        "What is more, Maximum Correlation Training (MCT) enables us to train the weights based on human fluency judgments and adequacy judgments respectively, and thus makes it possible to make a fluency-oriented or adequacy-oriented metric.",
        "It surpasses previous MT metrics' approach, where a a single metric evaluates both fluency and adequacy.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a brief recap of n-gram precision-based metrics and introduces our three extensions to them; Section 3 introduces MCT for MT evaluation; Section 4 describes the experimental results, and Section 5 gives our conclusion."

      "text": [
        "Since our source-sentence constrained n-gram precision and discriminative unigram precision are both derived from the normal n-gram precision, it is worth describing the original n-gram precision metric, BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002).",
        "For every MT hypothesis, BLEU computes the fraction of n-grams which also appear in the reference sentences, as well as a brevity penalty.",
        "The formula for computing BLEU is shown below:",
        "BLEU = BP ^^^ngr.mec CountcUp{ngram)",
        "N £=i EC £n9WeC Count(ngram')",
        "where C denotes the set of MT hypotheses.",
        "CountciiP(ngram) denotes the clipped number of n-grams in the candidates which also appear in the references.",
        "BP in the above formula denotes the brevity penalty, which is set to 1 if the accumulated length of the MT outputs is longer than the arithmetic mean of the accumulated length of the references, and otherwise is set to the ratio of the two.",
        "For sentence-level evaluation with BLEU, we compute the score based on each pair of MT hypothesis/reference.",
        "Later approaches, as described in Section 1, use different ways to manipulate the morphological similarity between the MT hypothesis and its references.",
        "Most of them, except NIST, consider the words in MT hypothesis as the same, i.e., as long as the words in MT hypothesis appear in the references, they make no difference to the metrics.",
        "NIST computes the n-grams weights as the logarithm of the ratio of the n-gram frequency and its one word lower n-gram frequency.",
        "From our experiments, NIST is not generally better than BLEU, and the reason, we conjecture, is that it differentiates the n-grams too much and the frequency estimated upon the evaluation corpus is not always reliable.",
        "In this section we will describe two other strategies for differentiating the n-grams, one of which uses the alignments with the source sentence as a further constraint, while the other differentiates the n-gram precisions according to POS.",
        "The quality of an MT sentence should be independent of the source sentence given the reference translation, but considering that current metrics are all based on shallow morphological similarity of the MT outputs and the reference, without really understanding the meaning in both sides, the source sentences could have some useful information in differentiating the MT outputs.",
        "Consider the Chinese-English translation example below: Source: wo bu neng zhe me zuo Hypothesis: I must hardly not do this Reference: I must not do this It is clear that the word not in the MT output cannot coexist with the word hardly while maintaining the meaning of the source sentence.",
        "None of the metrics mentioned above can prevent not from being counted in the evaluation, due to the simple reason that they only compute shallow morphological similarity.",
        "Then how could the source sentence help in the example?",
        "If we reveal the alignment of the source sentence with both the reference and the MT output, the Chinese word bu neng would be aligned to must not in the reference and must hardly in the MT output respectively, leaving the word not in the MT output not aligned to any word in the source sentence.",
        "Therefore, if we can somehow find the alignments between the source sentence and the reference/MT output, we could be smarter in selecting the overlapping words to be counted in the for all n-grams wi,wi+n-l in MT hypothesis for all reference sentences do for all n-grams rj,rj+n-l in current reference sentence do val=0; if wi+k equals rj+k AND MTaligniequals REFalignj then",
        "if val > max-val then max-val = val; hit-count += max-val; return MThitOuS^ength X length-VenaltV; metric: only select the words which are aligned to the same source words.",
        "Now the question comes to how to find the alignment of source sentence and MT hypothesis/references, since the evaluation data set usually does not contain alignment information.",
        "Our approach uses GIZA++ to construct the many-to-one alignments between source sentences and the MT hypothesis/references respectively.",
        "GIZA++ could generate many-to-one alignments either from source sentence to the MT hypothesis, in which case every word in MT hypothesis is aligned to a set of (or none) words in the source sentence, or from the reverse direction, in which case every word in MT hypothesis is aligned to exactly one word (or none) word in the source sentence.",
        "In either case, using MTaligni and REFaligni to denote the positions of the words in the source sentences which are aligned to a word in the MT hypothesis and a word in the reference respectively, the algorithm for computing source-sentence constrained n-gram precision of length n is described in Figure 1.",
        "Since source-sentence constrained n-gram precision (SSCN) is a precision-based metric, the variable length-penalty is used to avoid assigning a short MT hypothesis a high score, and is computed in the same way as BLEU.",
        "Note that in the algorithm for computing the precision of n-grams longer than one word, not all words in the n-grams should satisfy the source-sentence constraint.",
        "The reason is that the high order n-grams are already very sparse in the sentence-level evaluation.",
        "To differentiate the SSCNs based on the source-to-MT/Ref (many-to-one) alignments and the MT/Ref-to-source (many-to-one) alignments, we use SSCN1 and SSCN2 to denote them respectively.",
        "Naturally, we could combine the constraint in SSCN1 and SSCN2 by either taking their union (the combined constrained is satisfied if either one is satisfied) or intersecting them (the combined constrained is satisfied if both constraints are satisfied).",
        "We use SSCN_u and SSCN j to denote the SSCN based on unioned constraints and intersected constraints respectively.",
        "We could also apply the stochastic word mapping proposed in SIA (Liu and Gildea, 2006) to replace the hard word matching in Figure 1, and the corresponding metrics are denoted as pSSCNl, pSSCN2, pSSCNLu, pSSCN_i, with the suffixed number denoting different constraints.",
        "Most previous MT metrics concentrate on the cooccurrence of the MT hypothesis words in the references.",
        "Our metrics based on source sentence re-orderings, on the contrary, do not take words identities into account, but rather compute how similarly the source words are reordered in the MT output and the references.",
        "For simplicity, we only consider the pairwise reordering similarity.",
        "That is, for the source word pair wi and Wj, if their aligned positions in the MT hypothesis and a reference are in the same order, we call it a consistent word pair.",
        "Our pairwise reordering similarity (PRS) metric computes the fraction of the consistent word pairs in the source sentence.",
        "Figure 2 gives the formal description of PRS.",
        "SrcMTi and SrcRefk}i denote the aligned position of source word wi in the MT hypothesis and the kth reference respectively, and N denotes the length of the source sentence.",

        "The reason to use the linear combination of the metrics is that the component metrics are usually of the same or similar order of magnitude, and it makes the optimization problem easy to solve.",

        "The data for the experiments are from the MT evaluation workshop at ACL05.",
        "There are seven sets of MT outputs (E09 E11 E12 E14 E15 E17 E22), each of which contains 919 English sentences translated from the same set of Chinese sentences.",
        "There are four references (E01, E02, E03, E04) and two sets of human scores for each MT hypothesis.",
        "Each human score set contains a fluency and an adequacy score, both of which range from 1 to 5.",
        "We create a set of overall human scores by averaging the human fluency and adequacy scores.",
        "For evaluating the automatic metrics, we compute the Pearson's correlation of the automatic scores and the averaged human scores (over the two sets of available human scores), for overall score, fluency, and adequacy.",
        "The alignment between the source sentences and the MT hypothesis/references is computed by GIZA++, which is trained on the combined corpus of the evaluation data and a parallel corpus of Chinese-English newswire text.",
        "The parallel newswire corpus contains around 75,000 sentence pairs, 2,600,000 English words and 2,200,000 Chinese words.",
        "The stochastic word mapping is trained on a French-English parallel corpus containing 700,000 sentence pairs, and, following Liu and Gildea (2005), we only keep the top 100 most similar words for each English word.",

        "The sentence-level Pearson's correlation with human judgment is computed for each MT output, and the averaged results are shown in Table 1.",
        "As a comparison, we also show the results of BLEU, NIST, METEOR, ROUGE, WER, and HWCM.",

        "The results show that the SSCN2 metrics are better than the SSCN1 metrics in adequacy and overall score.",

        "This is directly modeled in the alignment used in SSCN2.",
        "Though we could also get such information from the reverse alignment, as in SSCN1, it is rather an indirect way and could contain more noise.",
        "It is interesting that SSCN1 gets better fluency evaluation results than SSCN2.",
        "The SSCN metrics with the unioned constraint, SSCN_u, by combining the strength of SSCN1 and SSCN2, get even better results in all three aspects.",

        "The two reordering based metrics, PRS and MPR, are not as good as the other testing metrics, in terms of the individual performance.",
        "It should not be surprising since they are totally different kind of metrics, which do not count the overlapping n-grams, but the consistent/monotonic word pair reorderings.",
        "As long as they capture some property of the MT hypothesis, they might be able to boost the performance of the combined metric under the MCT framework.",
        "To test how well MCT works, the following scheme is used: each set of MT outputs is evaluated by MCT, which is trained on the other 6 sets of MT outputs and their corresponding human judgment; the averaged correlation of the 7 sets of MT outputs with the human judgment is taken as the final result.",

        "The most interesting question in this paper is, with all these metrics, how well we can do in the MT evaluation.",
        "To answer the question, we put all the metrics described into the MCT framework and use the combined metric to evaluate the 7 MT outputs.",
        "Note that to speed up the training process, we do not directly use 24 DUPP components, instead, we use the 3 combined DUPP metrics.",
        "With the metrics shown in Table 1, we then have in total 31 metrics.",
        "Table 2 shows the results of the final combined metric.",
        "We can see that MCT trained on fluency, adequacy and overall human judgment get the best results among all the testing metrics in fluency, adequacy and overall evaluation respectively.",
        "We did a t-test with Fisher's z transform for the combined results and the individual results to see how significant the difference is.",
        "The combined results in adequacy and overall are significantly better at 99.5% confidence than the best results of the individual metrics (pSSCN_u(2)), and the combined result in fluency is significantly better at 96.9% confidence than the best individual metric (SIA).",
        "We also give the upper bound for each evaluation aspect by training MCT on the testing MT outputs, e.g., we train MCT on E09 and then use it to evaluate E09.",
        "The upper-bound is the best we can do with the MCT based on linear combination.",
        "Another linear framework, Classification SVM (CSVM), is also used to combine the testing metrics except DUPP.",
        "Since DUPP is based on MCT, to make a neat comparison, we rule out DUPP in the experiments with CSVM.",
        "The testing scheme is the same as MCT, except that we only use 3 references for each MT hypothesis, and the positive samples for training CSVM are computed as the scores of one of the 4 references based on the other 3 references.",
        "The slack parameter of CSVM is chosen so as to maximize the classification accuracy of a heldout set of 800 negative and 800 positive samples, which are randomly selected from the training set.",
        "The results are shown in Table 2.",
        "We can see that MCT, with the same number of reference sentences, is better than CSVM.",
        "Note that the resources required by MCT and CSVM are different.",
        "MCT uses human judgments to adjust the weights, while CSVM needs extra human references to produce positive training samples.",
        "To have a rough idea of how the component metrics contribute to the final performance of MCT, we incrementally add metrics into the MCT in descending order of their overall evaluation performance, with the results shown in Figure 5.",
        "We can see that the performance improves as the number of metrics increases, in a rough sense.",
        "The major improvement happens in the 3rd, 4th, 9th, 14th, and 30th metrics, which are METEOR, SIA, DUPP_a, pSSCN1(1), and PRS.",
        "It is interesting to note that these are not the metrics with the highest individual performance.",
        "Another interesting observation is that there are no two metrics belonging to the same series in the most beneficial metrics, indicating that to get better combined metrics, individual metrics showing different sentence properties are preferred."
