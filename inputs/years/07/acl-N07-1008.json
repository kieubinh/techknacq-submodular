        "While recent phrase-based statistical machine translation (SMT) systems achieve significant improvement over the original source-channel statistical translation models, they 1) use a large inventory of blocks which have significant overlap and 2) limit the use of training to just a few parameters (on the order of ten).",
        "In contrast, we show that our proposed minimalist system (DTM2) achieves equal or better performance by 1) recasting the translation problem in the traditional statistical modeling approach using blocks with no overlap and 2) relying on training most system parameters (on the order of millions or larger).",
        "The new model is a direct translation model (DTM) formulation which allows easy integration of additional/alternative views of both source and target sentences such as segmentation for a source language such as Arabic, part-of-speech of both source and target, etc.",

        "The inventory of blocks in current systems is highly redundant.",
        "We illustrate the redundancy using the example in Table 1 which shows a set of phrases that cover the two-word Arabic fragment \"lljnp Almrkzyp\" whose alignment and translation is shown in Figure 1.",
        "One notices the significant overlap between the various blocks including the fact the output target sequence \"of the central committee\" can be produced in at least two different ways: 1) as 2-4 block \"lljnp Almrkzyp | of the central committee covering the two Arabic words, or 2) by using the 13 block \"Almrkzyp | of the central followed by covering the first Arabic word with the 1-1 block \"lljnp | committee\".",
        "In addition, if one adds one more word to the Arabic fragment in the third position such as the block \" AlSyny | chinese1 the overlap increases significantly and more alternate possibilities are available to produce an output such as the \" of the central chinese committee.1",
        "In this work, we propose to only use 1-n blocks and avoid completely the redundancy obtained by the use of m-n blocks for m > 1 in current phrase-based systems.",
        "We discuss later how by defining appropriate features in the translation model, we capture the important dependencies required for producing n-long fragments for an m-word input sequence including the reordering required to produce more fluent output.",

        "Earlier work in statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1993) is based on the \"noisy-channel\" formulation where where the target language model p( T) is further decomposed as where k is the order of the language model and the translation model p( S| T) has been modeled by a sequence of five models with increasing complexity (Brown et al., 1993).",

        "As discussed earlier, these approaches result in a large overlap between the extracted blocks (longer blocks overlap with all the shorter subcomponents blocks).",
        "Also, slightly restating the advantages of phrase-pairs identified in (Quirk and Menezes, 2006), these blocks are effective at capturing context including the encoding of non-compositional phrase pairs, and capturing local reordering, but they lack variables (e.g. embedding between ne...pas in French), have sparsity problems, and lack a strategy for global reordering.",
        "More recently, (Chiang, 2005) extended phrase-pairs (or blocks) to hierarchical phrase-pairs where a grammar with a single non-terminal allows the embedding of phrases-pairs, to allow for arbitrary embedding and capture global reordering though this approach still has the high overlap problem.",
        "However, in (Quirk and Menezes, 2006), the authors investigate minimum translation units (MTU) which is a refinement over a similar approach by (Banchs et al., 2005) to eliminate the overlap issue.",
        "The MTU approach picks all the minimal blocks subject to the condition that no word alignment link crosses distinct blocks.",
        "They do not have the notion of a block with a variable (a special case of the hierarchical phrase-pairs) that we employ in this work.",
        "They also have a weakness in the parameter estimation method; they rely on an n-gram language model on blocks which inherently requires a large bilingual training data set.",
        "Most recent SMT systems use blocks (i.e. phrase-pairs) with a few real valued \"informative\" features which can be viewed as an indicator of how probable the current translation is.",
        "As discussed in Section 1.2, these features are typically MLE models (e.g. block translation, Model 1, language model, etc.)",
        "whose scores are log-linearly combined using a weight vector, Xf where f is a particular feature.",
        "The Xf are trained using a held-out corpus using maximum BLEU training (Och, 2003).",
        "This method is only practical for a small number of features; typically, the number of features is on the order of 10 to 20.",
        "Recently, there have been several discriminative approaches at training large parameter sets including (Tillmann and Zhang, 2006) and (Liang et al., 2006).",
        "In (Tillmann and Zhang, 2006) the model is optimized to produce a block orientation and the target sentence is used only for computing a sentence level BLEU.",
        "(Liang et al., 2006) demonstrates a discriminatively trained system for machine translation that has the following characteristics: 1) requires a varying update strategy (local vs. bold) depending on whether the reference sentence is \"reachable\" or not, 2) uses sentence level BLEU as a criterion for selecting which output to update towards, and 3) only trains on limited length (5-15 words) sentences.",
        "So both methods fundamentally rely on a prior decoder to produce an \"N-best\" list that is used to find a target (using max BLEU) for the training algorithm.",
        "The methods to produce an \"N-best\" list tend to be not very effective since most alternative translations are minor differences from the highest scoring translation and do not typically include the reference translation (particularly when the system makes a large error).",
        "In this paper, the algorithm trains on all sentences in the test-specific corpus and crucially, the algorithm directly uses the target translation to update the model parameters.",
        "This latter point is a critical difference that contrasts to the major weakness of the work of (Liang et al., 2006) which uses a top-N list of translations to select the maximum BLEU sentence as a target for training (so called local update)."

        "English, the NIST MT06 training data contains 3.7M sentence pairs from the UN from 1993-2002 and 100K sentences pairs from news sources.",
        "This represents the universe of training data, but for each test set we sample this corpus to train efficiently while also observing slight gains in performance.",
        "The training universe is time sorted and the most recent corpora are sampled first.",
        "Then for a given test set, we obtain the first 20 instances of n-grams from the test that occur in the training universe and the resulting sampled sentences then form the training sample.",
        "The contribution of the sampling technique is to produce a smaller training corpus which reduces the computational load; however, the sampling of the universe of sentences can be viewed as test set domain adaptation which improves performance and is not strictly done due to computational limitations.",
        "The 5-gram language model is trained from the English Gigaword corpus and the English portion of the parallel corpus used in the translation model training.",
        "The baseline decoder is a phrase-based decoder that employs nm blocks and uses the same test set specific training corpus described above.",
        "There are 15 individual feature types utilized in the system, but in order to be brief we present the results by feature groups (see Table 3): (a) lexical, (b) lexical context, (c) segmentation, (d) part-of-speech, and (e) coverage features.",
        "The results show improvements with the addition of each feature set, but the part-of-speech features and coverage features are not statistically significant improvements.",
        "The more complex features based on Arabic segmentation and English part-of-speech yield a small improvement of 0.5 BLEU points over the model with only lexical context."

        "An n-gram LM has very low cost for the word 'the' but a rather high cost for content words such as 'conduct'.",
