        "Our experiments demonstrate that the ESP model is significantly better at resolving synonyms than a widely-used distributional similarity metric, the cosine similarity metric (CSM) (Salton and McGill, 1983), and that Resolver is significantly better at resolving synonyms than either of its components, SSM or ESP.",
        "We test these models on a data set of 2.1 million assertions extracted from a Web crawl.",
        "All models ran over all assertions, but compared only those objects or relations that appeared at least 25 times in the data, to give the ESP and CSM models sufficient data for estimating similarity.",
        "However, the models do use strings that appear less than 25 times as features.",
        "In all, the data contains 9,797 distinct object strings and 10,151 distinct relation strings that appear at least 25 times.",
        "We judged the precision of each model by manually labeling all of the clusters that each model outputs.",
        "Judging recall would require inspecting not just the clusters that the system outputs, but the entire data set, to find all of the true clusters.",
        "Because of the size of the data set, we instead estimated recall over a smaller subset of the data.",
        "We took the top 200 most frequent object strings and top 200 most frequent relation strings in the data.",
        "For each one of these high-frequency strings, we manually searched through all strings with frequency over 25 that shared at least one property, as well as all strings that contained one of the keywords in the high-frequency strings or obvious variations of them.",
        "We manually clustered the resulting matches.",
        "The top 200 object strings formed 51 clusters of size greater than one, with an average cluster size of 2.9.",
        "For relations, the top 200 strings and their matches formed 110 clusters with size greater than one, with an average cluster size of 4.9.",
        "We measured the recall of our models by comparing the set of all clusters containing at least one of the high-frequency words against these gold standard clusters.",
        "For our precision and recall measures, we only compare clusters of size two or more, in order to focus on the interesting cases.",
        "Using the term hypothesis cluster for clusters created by one of the models, we define the precision of a model to be the number of elements in all hypothesis clusters which are correct divided by the total number of elements in hypothesis clusters.",
        "An element s is marked correct if a plurality of the elements in s's cluster refer to the same entity as s; we break ties arbitrarily, as they do not affect results.",
        "We define recall as the sum over gold standard clusters of the most number of elements found in a single hypothesis cluster, divided by the total number of elements in gold standard clusters.",
        "For the ESP and SSM models in our experiment, we prevented mutual recursion by clustering relations and objects separately.",
        "Only the full Resolver system uses mutual recursion.",
        "For the CSM model, we create for each distinct string a row vector, with each column representing a property.",
        "Ifthat property applies to the string, we set the value of that column to the inverse frequency of the property and zero otherwise.",
        "CSM finds the cosine of the angle between the vectors for each pair of strings, and merges the best pairs that score above threshold.",
        "Each model requires a threshold parameter to determine which scores are suitable for merging.",
        "For these experiments we arbitrarily chose a threshold of 3 for the ESP model (that is, the data needs to be 3 times more likely given the merged cluster than the unmerged clusters in order to perform the merge) and chose thresholds for the other models by hand so that the difference between them and ESP would be roughly even between precision and recall, although for relations it was harder to improve the recall.",
        "It is an important item for future work to be able to estimate these thresholds and perhaps other parameters of our models from unlabeled data, but the chosen parameters worked well enough for the experiments.",
        "Table 1 shows the precision and recall of our models.",
        "ESP significantly outperforms CSM on both object and relation clustering.",
        "CSM had particular trouble with lower-frequency strings, judging far too many of them to be co-referential on too little evidence.",
        "If the threshold for clustering using CSM is increased, however, the recall begins to approach zero.",
        "ESP and CSM make predictions based on a very noisy signal.",
        "\"Canada,\" for example, shares more properties with \"United States\" in our data than \"U.S.\" does, even though \"Canada\" appears less often than \"U.S.\" The results show that both models perform below the SSM model on its own for object merging, and both perform slightly better than SSM on relations because of SSM's poor recall.",
        "We found a significant improvement in both pre-",
        "Table 1: Comparison of the cosine similarity metric (CSM), Resolver components (SSM and ESP), and the Resolver system.",
        "Bold indicates the score is significantly different from the score in the row above at p < 0.05 using the chi-squared test with one degree of freedom.",
        "Using the same test, Resolver is also significantly different from ESP and CSM in recall on objects, and from CSM and SSM in recall on relations.",
        "Resolver's F1 on objects is a 19% increase over SSM's F1.",
        "Resolver's F1 on relations is a 28% increase over SSM's F1.",
        "cision and recall when using a combined model over using SSM alone.",
        "Resolver's F1 is 19% higher than SSM's on objects, and 28% higher on relations.",
        "In a separate experiment we found that mutual recursion provides mixed results.",
        "A combination of SSM and ESP without mutual recursion had a precision of 0.76 and recall of 0.59 on objects, and a precision of 0.91 and recall of 0.35 on relations.",
        "Mutual recursion increased recall and decreased precision for both objects and relations.",
        "None of the differences were statistically significant, however.",
        "There is clearly room for improvement on the SR task.",
        "Except for the problem of confusing similar and identical pairs (see section 5), error analysis shows that most of Resolver's mistakes are because of two kinds of errors:",
        "1.",
        "Extraction errors.",
        "For example, \"US News\" gets extracted separately from \"World Report\", and then Resolver clusters them together because they share almost all of the same properties.",
        "2.",
        "Multiple word senses.",
        "For example, there are two President Bushes; also, there are many terms like \"President\" and \"Army\" that can refer to many different entities.",
        "The extensions to Resolver attempt to address the confusion between similar and identical pairs.",
        "Experiments with the extensions, using the same datasets and metrics as above, demonstrate that the Function Filter (FF) and the Coordination-Phrase Filter (CPF) boost Resolver's performance.",
        "FF requires as input the set of functional and one-to-one relations in the data.",
        "Table 2 contains a samis capital of is capital city of named after was named after headquartered in is headquartered in",
        "Table 2: A sample of the set of functions used by the Function Filter.",
        "Table 3: Comparison of object merging results for the Resolver system, Resolver plus Function Filtering (Re-solver+FF), Resolver plus Coordination-Phrase Filtering (Resolver+CPF), and Resolver plus both types of filtering (Resolver+FF+CPF).",
        "Bold indicates the score is significantly different from Resolver's score at p < 0.05 using the chi-squared test with one degree of freedom.",
        "Re-solver+CPF's F1 on objects is a 28% increase over SSM's F1, and a 7% increase over Resolver's F1.",
        "pling of the manually-selected functions used in our experiment.",
        "Automatically discovering such functions from extractions has been addressed in AnaMaria Popescu's dissertation (Popescu, 2007), and we did not attempt to duplicate this effort in Resolver.",
        "Table 3 contains the results of our experiments.",
        "With coordination-phrase filtering, Resolver's F1 is 28% higher than SSM's on objects, and 6% higher than Resolver's F1 without filtering.",
        "While function filtering is a promising idea, FF provides a smaller benefit than CPF on this dataset, and the merges that it prevents are, with a few exceptions, a subset of the merges prevented by CPF.",
        "This is in part due to the limited number of functions available in the data.",
        "In addition to outperforming FF on this dataset, CPF has the added advantage that it does not require additional input, like a set of functions.",

        "We have shown that the unsupervised and scalable Resolver system is able to find clusters of co-referential object names in extracted relations with a precision of 78% and a recall of 68% with the aid of coordination-phrase filtering, and can find clusters of co-referential relation names with precision of 90% and recall of 35%.",
        "We have demonstrated significant improvements over using simple similarity metrics for this task by employing a novel probabilistic model of coreference.",
