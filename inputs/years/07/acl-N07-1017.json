        "Relation extraction is a fundamental step in many natural language processing applications such as learning ontologies from texts (Buitelaar et al., 2005) and Question Answering (Paşca and Harabagiu, 2001).",
        "The most common approach for acquiring concepts, instances and relations is to harvest semantic knowledge from texts.",
        "These techniques have been largely explored and today they achieve reasonable accuracy.",
        "Harvested lexical resources, such as concept lists (Pantel and Lin, 2002), facts (Etzioni et al., 2002) and semantic relations (Pantel and Pen-nacchiotti, 2006) could be then successfully used in different frameworks and applications.",
        "The state of the art technology for relation extraction primarily relies on pattern-based approaches (Snow et al., 2006).",
        "These techniques are based on the recognition of the typical patterns that express a particular relation in text (e.g. \"X such as Y\" usually expresses an is-a relation).",
        "Yet, text-based algorithms for relation extraction, in particular pattern-based algorithms, still suffer from a number of limitations due to complexities of natural language, some of which we describe below.",
        "Irrelevant relations.",
        "These are valid relations that are not of interest in the domain at hand.",
        "For example, in a political domain, \"Condoleezza Rice is a football fan\" is not as relevant as \"Condoleezza Rice is the Secretary of State of the United States\".",
        "Irrelevant relations are ubiquitous, and affect ontology reliability, if used to populate it, as the relation drives the wrong type of ontological knowledge.",
        "Erroneous or false relations.",
        "These are particularly harmful, since they directly affect algorithm precision.",
        "A pattern-based relation extraction algorithm is particularly likely to extract erroneous relations if it uses generic patterns, which are defined in (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006) as broad coverage, noisy patterns with high recall and low precision (e.g. \"X of Y\" for part-of relation).",
        "Harvesting algorithms either ignore generic patterns (Hearst, 1992) (affecting system recall) or use manually supervised filtering approaches (Girju et al., 2006) or use completely unsupervised Web-filtering methods (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006).",
        "Yet, these methods still do not sufficiently mitigate the problem of erroneous relations.",
        "Background knowledge.",
        "Another aspect that makes relation harvesting difficult is related to the nature of semantic relations: relations among entities are mostly paradigmatic (de Saussure, 1922), and are usually established in absentia (i.e., they are not made explicit in text).",
        "According to Eco's position (Eco, 1979), the background knowledge (e.g. \"persons are humans\") is often assumed by the writer, and thus is not explicitly mentioned in text.",
        "In some cases, such widely-known relations can be captured by distributional similarity techniques but not by pattern-based approaches.",
        "Metaphorical language.",
        "Even when paradigmatic relations are explicitly expressed in texts, it can be very difficult to distinguish between facts and metaphoric usage (e.g. the expression \"My mind is a pearl\" occurs 17 times on the Web, but it is clear that mind is not a pearl, at least from an ontological perspective).",
        "The considerations above outline some of the difficulties of taking a purely lexico-syntactic approach to relation extraction.",
        "Pragmatic issues (background knowledge and metaphorical language) and ontological issues (irrelevant relation) can not be solved at the syntactic level.",
        "Also, erroneous relations can always arise.",
        "These considerations lead us to the intuition that extraction can benefit from imposing some additional constraints.",
        "In this paper, we integrate Espresso with a lexical distribution technique modeling semantic coherence through semantic domains (Magnini et al., 2002).",
        "These are defined as common discourse topics which demonstrate lexical coherence, such as Economics or Politics.",
        "We explore whether semantic domains can provide the needed additional constraints to mitigate the acceptance of erroneous relations.",
        "At the lexical level, semantic domains identify clusters of (domain) paradigmatically related terms.",
        "We believe that the main advantage of adopting semantic domains in relation extraction is that relations are established mainly among terms in the same Domain, while concepts belonging to different fields are mostly unrelated (Gliozzo, 2005), as described in Section 2.",
        "For example, in a chemistry domain, an is-a will tend to relate only terms of that domain (e.g., nitrogen is-a element), while out-of-domain relations are likely to be erroneous e.g., driver is-a element.",
        "By integrating pattern-based and distributional approaches we aim to capture the two characteristic properties of semantic relations:",
        "• Syntagmatic properties: if two terms X and Y are in a given relation, they tend to co-occur in texts, and are mostly connected by specific lexical-syntactic patterns (e.g., the patter \"X is a Y\" connects terms in is-a relations).",
        "This aspect is captured using a pattern-based approach.",
        "• Domain properties: if a semantic relation among two terms X and Y holds, both X and Y should belong to the same semantic domain (i.e. they are semantically coherent), where semantic domains are sets of terms characterized by very similar distributional properties in a (possibly domain specific) corpus.",
        "In Section 2, we develop the concept of semantic domain and an automatic acquisition procedure based on Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and we provide empirical evidence of the connection between relation extraction and domain modelling.",
        "Section 3 describes the Espresso system.",
        "Section 4 concerns our integration of semantic domains and Espresso.",
        "In Section 5, we evaluate the impact of our LSA domain restriction module on improving a state of the art relation extraction system.",

        "in the literature, semantic domains have been inferred from corpora by adopting term clustering methodologies (Gliozzo, 2005), and have been used for several NLP tasks, such as Text categorization and ontology Learning (Gliozzo, 2006).",
        "Semantic domains can be described by Domain putational model for semantic domains, that represents domain information at the term level, by defining a set of term clusters.",
        "Each cluster represents a Semantic Domain, i.e. a set of terms that often co-occur in texts having similar topics.",
        "A DM is represented by a k x kk rectangular matrix D, containing the domain relevance for each term with respect to each domain, as illustrated in Table 1.",
        "DMs can be acquired from texts in a completely unsupervised way by exploiting a lexical coherence assumption.",
        "To this end, term clustering algorithms can be used with each cluster representing a Semantic Domain.",
        "The degree of association among terms and clusters, estimated by the learning algorithm, provides a domain relevance function.",
        "For our experiments we adopted a clustering strategy based on LSA (Deerwester et al., 1990), following the methodology described in (Gliozzo, 2005).",
        "The input of the LSA process is a term-by-document matrix T reporting the term frequencies in the whole corpus for each term.",
        "The matrix is decomposed by means of a Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), identifying the principal components of T. This operation is done off-line, and can be efficiently performed on large corpora.",
        "SVD decomposes T into three matrixes T ~ VS^ UT where is the diagonal k x k matrix containing the highest kk ^ k eigenvalues of T on the diagonal, and all the remaining elements are 0.",
        "The parameter k!",
        "is the dimensionality of the domain and can be fixed in advance.",
        "Under this setting we define the domain matrix DLSA as where IN is a diagonal matrix such that iN = ,1^ and wi is the ith row of the matrix V^jSk'.",
        "Once a DM has been defined by the matrix D, the Domain Space is a kk dimensional space, in which both texts and terms are associated to Domain Vectors (DVs), i.e. vectors representing their domain relevancies with respect to each domain.",
        "The DV t'i for the term ti G V is the ith row of D, where V = [ti,t2,... ,tk} is the vocabulary of the corpus.",
        "The domain similarity (d(ti, tj) among terms is then estimated by the cosine among their corresponding DVs in the Domain Space, defined as follows:",
        "Domain Similarity",
        "The main advantage of adopting semantic domains for relation extraction is that they allow us to impose a domain restriction on the set of candidate pairs of related terms.",
        "In fact, semantic relations can be established mainly among terms in the same Semantic Domain, while concepts belonging to different fields are mostly unrelated.",
        "To show the validity of the domain restriction we conducted a preliminary experiment, contrasting the probability for two words to be related in WordNet (Magnini and Cavaglia, 2000) with their domain similarity, measured in the Domain Space induced from the British National Corpus.",
        "In particular, for each couple of words, we estimated the domain similarity, and we collected word pairs in sets characterized by different ranges of similarity (e.g. all the pairs between 0.8 and 0.9).",
        "Then we estimated the probability of each couple of words in different sets to be linked by a semantic relation in WordNet, such as synonymy, hyperonymy, co-hyponymy and domain in WordNet Domains (Magnini et al., 2002).",
        "Results in Figure 1 show a monotonic crescent relation between these two quantities.",
        "In particular the probability for two words to be related tends to 0 when their similarity is negative (i.e., they are not domain related), supporting the basic hypothesis of this work.",

        "Espresso (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006) is a corpus-based general purpose, broad, and accurate relation extraction algorithm requiring minimal supervision, whose core is based on the framework adopted in (Hearst, 1992).",
        "Espresso introduces two main innovations that guarantee high performance: (i) a principled measure for estimating the reliability of relational patterns and instances; (ii) an algorithm for exploiting generic patterns.",
        "Generic patterns are broad coverage noisy patterns (high recall and low precision), e.g. \"X of Y\" for the part-of relation.",
        "As underlined in the introduction, previous algorithms either required significant manual work to make use of generic patterns, or simply ignore them.",
        "Espresso exploits an unsupervised Web-based filtering method to detect generic patterns and to distinguish their correct and incorrect instances.",
        "Given a specific relation (e.g. is-a) and a POS-tagged corpus, Espresso takes as input few seed instances (e.g. nitrogen is-a element) or seed surface patterns (e.g. X/NN such/JJ as/IN Y/NN).",

        "For each instance in input, the sentences containing it are first retrieved and then generalized, by replacing term expressions with a terminological label using regular expressions on the POS-tags.",
        "This generalization allows to ease the problem of data sparseness in small corpora.",

        "rn is formally defined as the average strength of association between a pattern p and each input instance i in I, weighted by the reliability rL of the instance i (described later):",

        "Instance Extraction, Ranking, Selection.",
        "Espresso extracts from the corpus the set of instances I matching the patterns in P. In this phase generic patterns are detected, and their instances are filtered, using a technique described in detail in (Pantel and Pennacchiotti, 2006).",
        "Instances are then ranked using a reliability measure rt, similar to that adopted for patterns.",
        "A reliable instance should be highly associated with as many reliable patterns as possible:",
        "Finally, the best scoring instances are selected for the following iteration.",
        "If the number of extracted instances is too low (as often happens in small corpora) Espresso enters an expansion phase, in which instances are expanded by using web based and syntactic techniques.",

        "According to the structural view (de Saussure, 1922), both aspects contribute to determine the linguistic value (i.e. the meaning) of words: the meaning of lexical constituents is determined by a complex network of semantic relations among words.",
        "This suggests that relation extraction can benefit from accounting for both syntagmatic and domain aspects at the same time.",
        "To demonstrate the validity of this claim we can explore many different integration schemata.",
        "For example we can restrict the search space (i.e. the set of candidate instances) to the set of all those terms belonging to the same domain.",
        "Another possibility is to exploit a similarity metric for domain relatedness to re-rank the output instances I of Espresso, hoping that the top ranked ones will mostly be those which are correct.",
        "One advantage of this latter methodology is that it can be applied to the output of any relation extraction system without any modification to the system itself.",
        "In addition, this methodology can be evaluated by adopting standard Information Retrieval (IR) measures, such as mean average precision (see Section 5).",
        "Because of these advantages, we decided to adopt the re-ranking procedure.",
        "The procedure is defined as follows: each instance extracted by Espresso is assigned a Domain Similarity score fd(X, Y) estimated in the domain space according to Equation 2; a higher score is then assigned to the instances that tend to co-occur in the same documents in the corpus.",
