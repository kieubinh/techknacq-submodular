        "Research on semantic annotation has focused primarily on word sense disambiguation (WSD), i.e., the task of determining the appropriate sense for each instance of a polysemous word out of a set of senses defined for the word in some lexicon.",
        "Much less work has been done on semantic classification of unknown words, i.e., words that are not listed in the lexicon.",
        "However, real texts typically contain a large number of unknown words.",
        "Successful classification of unknown words is not only useful for lexical acquisition, but also necessary for natural language processing (NLP) tasks that require semantic annotation.",
        "This paper addresses the problem of classifying Chinese unknown words into fine-grained semantic categories defined in a Chinese thesaurus, Cilin (Mei et al., 1984).",
        "This thesaurus classifies over 70,000 words into 12 major categories, including human (A), concrete object (B), time and space (C), abstract object (D), attributes (E), actions (F), mental activities (G), activities (H), physical states (I), relations (J), auxiliaries (K), and honorifics (L).",
        "The 12 major categories are further divided into 94 medium categories, which in turn are subdivided into 1428 small categories.",
        "Each small category contains synonyms that are close in meaning.",
        "For example, under the major category d, the medium category Dm groups all words that refer to institutions, and the small category Dm05 groups all words that refer to educational institutions, e.g., xuexiao 'school'.",
        "Unknown word classification involves a much larger search space than WSD.",
        "In classifying words into small categories in Cilin, the search space for a polysemous known word consists of all the categories the word belongs to, but that for an unknown word consists of all the 1428 small categories.",
        "Research on WSD has concentrated on using contextual information, which may be limited for infrequent unknown words.",
        "On the other hand, Chinese characters carry semantic information that is useful for predicting the semantic properties of the words containing them.",
        "We present three novel knowledge-based models that capture the relationship between the semantic categories of an unknown word and those of its component characters in three different ways, and combine two of them with a corpus-based model that uses contextual information to classify unknown words.",
        "Experiments show that the combined knowledge-based model achieves an accuracy of 61.6% for classifying unknown words into small categories in Cilin, but the use of contextual information does not further improve performance.",

        "This section describes three novel knowledge-based models for semantic classification of Chinese unknown words, including an overlapping-character model, a character-category association model, and a rule-based model.",
        "These models model the relationship between the semantic category of an unknown word and those of its component characters in three different ways.",
        "The baseline model predicts the category of an unknown word by counting the number of overlapping characters between the unknown word and the member words in each category.",
        "As words in the same category are similar in meaning and the meaning of a Chinese word is generally the composition of the meanings of its characters, it is common for words in the same category to share one or more character.",
        "This model tests the hypothesis that speakers draw upon the repertoire of characters that relate to a concept when creating new words to realize it.",
        "For each semantic category in Cilin, the set of unique characters in its member words are extracted, and the number of times each character occurs in word-initial, word-middle, and wordfinal positions is recorded.",
        "With this information, we develop two variants of the baseline model, which differ from each other in terms of whether it takes into consideration the positions in which the characters occur in words.",
        "In variant 1, the score of a category is the sum of the number of occurrences of each character of the target word in the category, as in (1), where tj denotes a category, w denotes the target word, ci denotes the ith character in w, n is the length of w, and f(c) is the frequency of Ci in tj.",
        "In variant 2, the score of a category is the sum of the number of occurrences of each character of the unknown word in the category in its corresponding position, as in (2), where pj denotes the position of cj in w, which could be word-initial, word-middle, or word-final, and f(cj,pj) denotes the frequency of cj in position pj in tj.",
        "In each variant, the category with the maximum score for a target word is proposed as the category of the word.",
        "The relationship between the semantic category of an unknown word and those of its component characters can also be captured in a more sophisticated way using information-theoretical models.",
        "We use two statistical measures, mutual information and x, to compute character-category associations and word-category associations.",
        "Chen (2004) used the x measure to compute character-character and word-word associations, but not word-category associations.",
        "We use word-category associations to directly predict the semantic categories of unknown words.",
        "The mutual information and x measures are calculated as in (3) and (4), where Asso(c,tj) denotes the association between a character c and a semantic category j, and P(X) and f(X) denote the probability and frequency of X respectively.",
        "Once the character-category associations are calculated, the association between a word w and a category tj, Asso(w,tj), can be calculated as the sum of the weighted associations between each of the word's characters and the category, as in (6), where ci denotes the ith character of w, |w| denotes the length of w, and Xi denotes the weight of Asso(ci,tj).",
        "The A's add up to 1.",
        "The weights are determined empirically based on the positions of the characters in the word.",
        "As in variant 2 of the baseline model, the character-category association model can also be made sensitive to the positions in which the characters occur in the words.",
        "To this end, we first need to compute the position-sensitive associations between a category and a character in the word-initial, word-middle, and word-final positions separately.",
        "The position-sensitive association between an unknown word and a category can then be computed as the sum of the weighted position-sensitive associations between each of its characters and the category.",
        "Once the word-category associations are computed, we can propose the highest ranked category or a ranked list of categories for each unknown word.",
        "The third knowledge-based model uses linguistic rules to classify unknown words based on the syntactic and semantic categories of their component characters.",
        "Rule-based models have not been used for this task before.",
        "However, there are some regularities in the relationship between the semantic categories of unknown words and those of their component characters that can be captured in a more direct and effective way by linguistic rules than by statistical models.",
        "A separate set of rules are developed for words of different lengths.",
        "Rules are initially developed based on knowledge about Chinese word formation, and are then refined by examining the development data.",
        "In general, the complete rule set takes a few hours to develop.",
        "The rule in (7) is developed for bisyllabic unknown words.",
        "This rule proposes the common category of a bisyllabic word's two characters as its category.",
        "It is especially useful for words with a parallel structure, i.e., words whose two characters have the same meaning and syntactic category, e.g., iftim tanta 'collapse', where W\\ tan and ifa ta both mean 'collapse' and share the category Id05.",
        "The thresholds for fA and fB are determined empirically and are both set to 1 if AB is a noun and to 0 and 3 respectively otherwise.",
        "(7) For a bisyllabic word AB, if A and B share a category c\"', let fA and fB denote the number of times A and B occur in word-initial and word-final positions in c respectively.",
        "If fA and fB both surpass the predetermined thresholds, propose c for AB.",
        "A number of rules are developed for trisyllabic words.",
        "While most rules in the model are general, the first rule in this set is rather specific, as it handles words with three specific prefixes, da 'big', <h xiao 'little', and ^ lao 'old', which usually do not change the category of the root word.",
        "The other four rules again utilize the categories of the unknown word's component characters.",
        "The rules in (8b) and (8c) are similar to the rule in (7).",
        "The ones in (8d) and (8e) search for neighbor words with a similar structure as the target word.",
        "Eligible neighbors have a common morpheme with the target word in the same position and a second morpheme that shares a category with the second morpheme of the target word.",
        "For example, an eligible neighbor for ffifftief tuTxiao-shang 'sales-man' is fftHfie) xiaoshdu-shang 'distribut-or'.",
        "These two words share the morpheme l shang 'businessman' in the word-final position, and the morphemes fflfft tuTxiao 'to market' and fftHf xiaoshdu 'distribute' share the category He03.",
        "The rule in (8d) therefore applies in this case.",
        "(8) For a trisyllabic word ABC:",
        "a.",
        "If A equals da 'big', <h xiao 'little', or ^ lao 'old', propose the category of AB for ABC if C is the diminutive suffix J L er or the category of BC for ABC otherwise.",

        "If A and BC share a category c, propose c for ABC.",
        "c. If AB and C share a category c, propose c for",

        "e. If there is a word XBC such that X and A share a category, propose the category of XBC for ABC.",
        "The rules for four-character words are given in (9).",
        "Like the rules in (8d) and (8e), these rules also search for neighbors of the target word.",
        "(9) For a four-character word ABCD:",
        "a.",
        "If there is a word XYZD/YZD such that XYZ/YZ and ABC share a category, propose the category of XYZ/YZ for ABCD.",
        "b.",
        "If there is a word ABCX such that X and D share a category, propose the category of ABCX for ABCD.",
        "c. If there is a word XYCD such that XY and AB share a category, propose the category of XYCD for ABCD.",

        "The knowledge-based models described above classify unknown words using information about the syntactic and semantic categories of their component characters.",
        "Another useful source of information is the context in which unknown words occur.",
        "While contextual information is the primary source of information used in WSD research and has been used for acquiring semantic lexicons and classifying unknown words in other languages (e.g., Roark and Charniak 1998; Ciaramita 2003; Curran 2005), it has been used in only one previous study on semantic classification of Chinese unknown words (Chen and Lin, 2000).",
        "Part of the goal of this study is to investigate whether and how these two different sources of information can be combined to improve performance on semantic classification of Chinese unknown words.",
        "To this end, we first use the knowledge-based models to propose a list of five candidate categories for the target word, then extract a generalized context for each category in Cilin from a corpus, and finally compute the similarity between the context of the target word and the generalized context of each of its candidate categories.",
        "Comparing the context of the target word with generalized contexts of categories instead of contexts of individual words alleviates the data-sparseness problem, as infrequent words have limited contextual information.",
        "Limiting the search space for each target word to the top five candidate categories reduces the computational cost that comes with the full search space.",
        "A generalized context for each semantic category is built from the contexts of its member words.",
        "This is done based on the assumption that as the words in the same category have the same or similar meaning, they tend to occur in similar contexts.",
        "In terms of context extraction and representation, we need to consider four factors.",
        "Member Words The issue here is whether to include the contexts of polysemous member words in building the generalized context of a category.",
        "Including these contexts without discrimination introduces noise.",
        "To measure the effect of such noise, we build two versions of generalized context for each category, one using contexts of unambiguous member words only, and the other using contexts of all member words.",
        "Context Words There are two issues in selecting words for context representation.",
        "First, words that contribute little information to the discrimination of meaning of other words, including conjunctions, numerals, auxiliaries, and non-Chinese sequences, are excluded.",
        "Second, to model the effect of frequency on the context words' contribution to meaning discrimination, we use two sets of context words: one consists of the 1000 most frequent words in the corpus; the other consists of all words in the corpus.",
        "Window Size For WSD, both topical context and microcontext have been used (Ide and Veronis 1998).",
        "Topical context includes substantive words that co-occur with the target word within a larger window, whereas microcontext includes words in a small window around the target word.",
        "We experiment with topical context and microcontext with window sizes of 100 and 6 respectively (i.e., 50 and 3 words to the left and right of the target word respectively).",
        "Context Representation We represent the context of a category as a vector <wh w2, wn>, where n is the total number of context words, and wi is the weight of the ith context word.",
        "To arrive at this representation, we first record the number of times each context word occurs within a specified window of each member word of a category in the corpus as a vector <fu f2, fn>, where fi is the number of times the ith context word co-occurs with a member word of the category.",
        "We then compute the weight of a context word w in context c, W(w, c), using mutual information and t-test, which were reported by Weeds and Weir (2005) to perform the best on a pseudo-disambiguation task.",
        "These weight functions are computed as in (10) and (11), where N denotes the size of the corpus.",
        "We compute the similarity between the context vectors of the unknown word and its candidate categories using cosirne.",
        "Trhe cosirne of two n-dimensional vectors x and y, cos( x , y), is computed as in (12), where xi and yi denote the weight of the ith context word in x and y."

        "2002) and the extended Cilin released by the Information Retrieval Lab at Harbin Institute of Technology.",
        "The corpus contains all the articles published in January, 1999 in People's Daily, a major newspaper in China.",
        "It contains over 1.12 million tokens and is word-segmented and POS-tagged.",
        "Table 1 summarizes the distribution of words in Cilin.",
        "Of the 76,029 words in Cilin, 35,151 are found in the Contemporary Chinese Corpus.",
        "We classify words into the third-level categories in the extended Cilin, which are equivalent to the small categories in the original Cilin.",
        "The development and test sets consist of 3,000 words each, which are randomly selected from the subset of words in Cilin that are two to four characters long, that have occurred in the Contemporary Chinese Corpus, and that are tagged as nouns, verbs, or adjectives in the corpus.",
        "The words in the development and test sets are also controlled for frequency, with 1/3 of them occurring 1-3 times, 3-6 times, and 7 or more times in the corpus respectively.",
        "As Chen (2004) noted, excluding all the words in the development and test data in the testing stage worsens the data-sparseness problem for knowledge-based models, as some categories have few member words, and some characters appear in few words in some categories.",
        "To alleviate this problem, the remove-one method is used for testing the knowledge-based models.",
        "In other words, the models are retrained for each test word using information about all the words in Cilin except the test word.",
        "The corpus-based model is trained once using the training data only, as the data-sparseness problem is alleviated by using generalized contexts of categories.",
        "Finally, if a word is polysemous, it is considered to have been correctly classified if the proposed category is one of its categories.",
        "Tables 2 and 3 summarize the results of the baseline model in terms of the accuracy of its best guess and best five guesses respectively.",
        "The columns labeled \"Non-filtered\" report results where all categories are considered for each unknown word, and the ones labeled \"POSfiltered\" report results where only the categories that agree with the POS category of the unknown word are considered.",
        "In the latter case, if the target word is a noun, only the small categories under major categories AD are considered; otherwise, only those under major categories EL are considered.",
        "The results show that using POS information about the unknown word to filter categories improves performance.",
        "Variant 2 performs better when only the best guess is considered, indicating that it is useful to model the effect of position on a character's contribution to word meaning in this case.",
        "However, it is not helpful to be sensitive to character position when the best five guesses are considered.",
        "In this model, only categories that agree with the POS category of the unknown word and that share at least one character with the unknown word are considered.",
        "These filtering steps significantly reduce the search space for this model.",
        "We discussed three parameters of the model in Section 2.2, including the statistical measure, the sensitivity to character position in computing character-category associations, and the weights of the associations between categories and characters in different positions.",
        "In addition, the computation of the character-category associations can be sensitive or insensitive to the POS categories of the words containing the characters.",
        "In the POS-sensitive way, associations are computed among nouns (words in categories A-D) and non-nouns (words in categories E-L) separately, whereas in the POS-insensitive way, they are computed using all the words.",
        "Tables 4 and 5 summarize the results of the character-category association model in terms of the accuracy of its best guess and best five guesses respectively.",

        "We presented three knowledge-based models and a corpus-based model for classifying Chinese unknown words into fine-grained categories in the Chinese thesaurus Cilin, a task important for lexical acquisition and NLP applications that require semantic annotation.",
        "The knowledge-based models use information about the categories of the unknown words' component characters, while the corpus-based model uses contextual information.",
        "By combining the character-category association and rule-based models, we achieved an accuracy of 61.6%.",
        "The corpus-based model did not improve performance.",
        "Several avenues can be taken for further research.",
        "First, additional resources, such as bilingual dictionaries, morphological analyzers, parallel corpora, and larger corpora with richer linguistic annotation may prove useful for improving both the knowledge-based and corpus-based models.",
        "Second, we only explored one way to combine the knowledge-based and corpus-based models.",
        "Future work may explore alternative ways to combine these models to make better use of contextual information."
