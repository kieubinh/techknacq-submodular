        "Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications benefit from the availability of large amounts of annotated data.",
        "However, such data is often scarce, particularly for non-mainstream languages.",
        "Semi-supervised learning addresses this problem by combining large amounts of unlabeled data with a small set of labeled data in order to learn a classification function.",
        "One class of semi-supervised learning algorithms that has recently attracted increased interest is graph-based learning.",
        "Graph-based techniques represent labeled and unlabeled data points as nodes in a graph with weighted edges encoding the similarity of pairs of samples.",
        "Various techniques are then available for transferring class labels from the labeled to the unlabeled data points.",
        "These approaches have shown good performance in cases where the data is characterized by an underlying manifold structure and samples are judged to be similar by local similarity measures.",
        "However, the question of how to best construct the graph forming the basis of the learning procedure is still an under-investigated research problem.",
        "NLP learning tasks present additional problems since they often rely on discrete or heterogeneous feature spaces for which standard similarity measures (such as Euclidean or cosine distance) are suboptimal.",
        "We propose a two-pass data-driven technique for graph construction in the framework of label propagation (Zhu, 2005).",
        "First, we use a supervised classifier trained on the labeled subset to transform the initial feature space (consisting of e.g. lexical, contextual, or syntactic features) into a continuous representation in the form of soft label predictions.",
        "This representation is then used as a basis for measuring similarity among samples that determines the structure of the graph used for the second, semi-supervised learning step.",
        "It is important to note that, rather than simply cascading the supervised and the semi-supervised learner, we optimize the combination with respect to the properties required of the graph.",
        "We present several techniques for such optimization, including regularization of the first-pass classifier, biasing by class priors, and linear combination of classifier predictions with known features.",
        "The proposed approach is evaluated on a lexicon learning task using the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus, and on the SENSEVAL-3 word sense disambiguation task.",

        "It is important that the distance measure is locally accurate, i.e. nodes connected by an edge with a high weight should have the same label.",
        "The global distance is less relevant since label information will be propagated from labeled points through the entire space.",

        "In NLP, label propagation has been used for word sense disambiguation (Niu et al., 2005), document classification (Zhu, 2005), sentiment analysis (Goldberg and Zhu, 2006), and relation extraction (Chen etal., 2006).",
        "One of the main problems in LP, as well as other graph-based learning techniques, is how to best construct the graph.",
        "Currently, graph construction \"is more of an art than science\" (Zhu, 2005).",
        "Typically, edge weights are derived from a simple Euclidean or cosine distance measure, regardless of the nature of the underlying features.",
        "Edges are then established either by connecting all nodes, by applying a single global threshold to the edge weights, or by connecting each node to its k nearest neighbors according to the edge weights.",
        "This procedure is often suboptimal: Euclidean distance relies on a model of normally distributed i.i.d.",
        "random variables; cosine distance likewise assumes that the different feature vector dimensions are uncorrelated.",
        "However, many applications, particularly in NLP, rely on feature spaces with correlated dimensions.",
        "Moreover, features may have different ranges and different types (e.g. continuous, binary, multi-valued), which entails the need for normalization, binning, or scaling.",
        "Finally, common distance measures do not take advantage of domain knowledge that might be available.",
        "Some attempts have been made at improving the standard method of graph construction.",
        "For instance, in a face identification task (Balcan et al., 2005), domain knowledge was used to identify three different edge sets based on time, color and face features, associating a different hyperparameter with each.",

        "Our choice of this task is motivated by our long-term goal of applying this technique to lexicon acquisition for resource-poor languages: POS lexicons are one of the most basic language resources, which enable subsequent training of taggers, chun-kers, etc.",
        "We assume that a small set ofwords can be reliably annotated, and that POS-sets for the remaining words can be inferred by semi-supervised learning.",
        "Rather than choosing a genuinely resource-poor language for this task, we use the English Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus and artificially limit the size of the labeled set.",
        "This is because the WSJ corpus is widely obtainable and allows easy replication of our experiments.",

        "In order to avoid experimental bias, we run all experiments on five different randomly chosen labeled subsets and report averages and standard deviations.",
        "Due to the random sampling of the data it is possible that some labels never occur in the training set or only occur once.",
        "We train our classifiers only on those labels that occur at least twice, which results in 60-63 classes.",
        "Labels not present in the training set will therefore not be hypothesized and are guaranteed to be errors.",

        "The static parameters of the MLP (learning rate, regularization rate, and number of hidden units) were optimized for the LP step by 5-fold cross-validation on the training data.",
        "This process is important because overspecialization is detrimental to the combined system: an overspecialized first-pass classifier may output very confident but wrong predictions for unseen patterns, thus placing such samples at large distances from all correctly labeled samples.",
        "A strongly regularized neural network, by contrast, will output smoother probability distributions for unseen patterns.",
