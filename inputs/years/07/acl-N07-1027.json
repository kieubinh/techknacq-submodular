        "As the early TRECs have found (Voorhees and Tice, 1999), locating a passage that contains an answer is considerably easier than pinpointing the exact answer.",
        "Thus, real-world user preferences may erode the advantage that QA has over IR techniques such as passage retrieval, e.g., (Zobel et al., 1995; Tellex et al., 2003).",
        "Second, the focus of question answering research has shifted away from isolated factoid questions to more complex information needs embedded within a broader context (e.g., a user scenario).",
        "Since 2004, the main task at the TREC QA tracks has consisted of question series organized around topics (called \"targets\") – which can be people, organizations, entities, or events (Voorhees, 2004; Voorhees, 2005).",
        "Questions in a series inquire about different facets of a target, but are themselves either factoid or list questions.",

        "See Table 1 for examples of question series.",
        "Separately, NIST has been exploring other types of complex information needs, for example, the relationship task in TREC 2005 and the ciQA (complex, interactive Question Answering) task in TREC 2006 (Dang et al., 2006).",
        "One shared feature of these complex questions is that they cannot be answered by simple named entities.",
        "Answers usually span passages, which makes the task very similar to the query-focused summarization task in DUC (Dang, 2005).",
        "On these tasks, it is unclear whether QA systems actually outperform baseline IR methods.",

        "Since Lin et al.",
        "(2003) suggest that users prefer answers situated within some sort of context, we projected these exact answers onto their source sentences.",

        "Below, we describe the implementation of such a metric.",

        "Thus, for this series, we obtain a recall of 0.5 at 105 characters and 1.0 at 235 characters.",
        "Finally, we must devise a method for aggregating across different question series to factor out variations.",
        "We accomplish this through interpolation, much in the same way that precision-recall curves are plotted in IR experiments.",
        "First, all lengths are interpolated to their nearest larger fifty character increment.",
        "In our case, they are 150 and 250.",
        "Once this is accomplished for each question series, we can directly average across all question series at each length increment.",
        "Plotting these points gives us a recall-by-length performance curve.",

        "The \"knee\" in some of the curves indicate approximately the length of the original system output (recall that the baseline Lucene run was appended to each TREC run to produce responses of equal lengths).",
        "For reference, official factoid scores of the same runs are shown in Table 2.",
        "Results from TREC 2004 are striking: while the top three systems appear to outperform the baseline IR run, it is unclear if the median system is better than Lucene, especially at longer response lengths.",

        "We modified the POURPRE scoring script to return only the nugget recall (of vital nuggets only).",
        "Formally, systems' responses to \"other\" questions consist of unordered sets of answer strings.",

        "Since these answer strings are for the most part sentences, results are comparable to the factoid series experiments.",

        "Computing POURPRE recall at different response lengths yielded an uninterpolated data series for each topic.",

        "It can be argued that quantitative evaluation is the single most important driver for advancing the state of the art in language processing technology today.",
        "As a result, evaluation metrics and methodologies need to be carefully considered to insure that they provide proper guidance to researchers.",
        "Along these lines, this paper makes two arguments: that recall curves better capture aspects of complex QA tasks than the existing TREC evaluation metrics; and that this novel evaluation framework allows us to explore the relationship between QA and IR technology in a manner not possible before.",
        "We see several advantages to the evaluation framework introduced here, beyond those already discussed in Sections 2 and 3.",
        "Previously, QA and IR techniques were not directly comparable since they returned different response units.",
        "To make evaluation even more complex, different types of questions (e.g., factoid vs. \"other\") require different metrics – in TREC, these incomparable values were then aggregated based on arbitrary weights to produce a final composite score.",
        "By noting similarities between factoid answers and nuggets, we were able to develop a unified evaluation framework for factoid and \"other\" questions.",
        "By emphasizing the similarities between complex QA and summarization, it becomes possible to compare QA and IR technology directly – this work provides a point of reference much in the same way that IR-based sentence extraction has served as a starting point for summarization research, e.g., (Goldstein et al., 1999).",
        "In addition, characterizing system performance in terms of recall curves allows researchers to compare the effectiveness of systems under different task models.",
        "Measuring recall at short response lengths might reflect time-constrained scenarios, e.g., producing an action-oriented report with a 30-minute deadline.",
        "Measuring recall at longer response lengths might correspond to in-depth research, e.g., writing a summary article due by the end of the day.",
        "Recall curves are able to capture potential system tradeoffs that might otherwise be hidden in singlepoint metrics.",
        "Beyond answering a straightforward question, the results of our experiments yield insights about the relationship between QA and IR technology.",
        "Most question answering systems today employ a two-stage architecture: IR techniques are first used to select a candidate set of documents (or alternatively, passages, sentences, etc.",
        "), which is then analyzed by more sophisticated NLP techniques.",
        "For factoids, analysis usually involves named-entity recognition using some sort of answer type ontology; for \"other\" questions, analysis typically includes filtering for definitions based on surface patterns and other features.",
        "The evaluation framework described in this paper is able to isolate the performance contribution of this second NLP stage – which corresponds to the difference between the baseline IR and QA recall curves.",
        "For factoid questions, NLP technology provides a lot of added value: the set of techniques developed for pinpointing exact answers allows users to acquire information more quickly than they otherwise could with an IR system (shown by Figure 1).",
        "The added value of NLP techniques for answering \"other\" questions is less clear – in many instances, those techniques do not appear to be contributing much (shown by Figure 2).",
        "Whereas factoid QA technology is relatively mature, researchers have made less progress in developing general techniques for answering complex questions.",
        "Our experiments also illuminate when exactly QA works.",
        "For short responses, there is little difference between QA and IR, or between all QA systems for that matter, since it is difficult to cram much information into a short response with current (extractive) technology.",
        "For extremely long responses, the advantages provided by the best QA systems are relatively small, since there's an upper limit to their accuracy (and researchers have yet to develop a good backoff strategy).",
        "In the middle range of response lengths is where QA technology really shines – where a user can much more effectively gather knowledge using a QA system.",
        "Based on the results presented here, we suggest two future directions for the field of question answering.",
        "First, we believe there is a need to focus on answer generation.",
        "High-precision answer extraction alone isn't sufficient to address users' complex information needs – information nuggets must be synthesized and presented for efficient human consumption.",
        "The coherence and fluency of system responses should be factored into the evaluation methodology as well.",
        "In this regard, QA researchers have much to learn from the summarization community, which has already grappled with these issues.",
        "Second, more effort is required to developed task-based QA evaluations.",
        "The \"goodness\" of answers can only be quantified with respect to a task – examples range from winning a game show (Clarke et al., 2001) to intelligence gathering (Small et al., 2004).",
        "It is impossible to assess the real-world impact of QA technology without considering how such systems will be used to solve human problems.",
