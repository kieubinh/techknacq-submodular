        "Query expansion has long been a focus of information retrieval research.",
        "Given an arbitrary short query, the goal was to find and include additional related and suitably-weighted terms to the original query to produce a more effective version.",
        "In this paper we focus on a complementary problem - query re-writing.",
        "Given a long query we explore whether there is utility in modifying it to a more concise version such that the original information need is still expressed.",
        "The Y!Q beta search engine allows users to select large portions of text from documents and issue them as queries.",
        "The search engine is designed to encourage users to submit long queries such as this example from the web site \"I need to know the gas mileage for my Audi A8 2004 model\".",
        "The motivation for encouraging this type of querying is that longer queries would provide more information in the form of context (Kraft et al., 2006), and this additional information could be leveraged to provide a better search experience.",
        "However, handling such long queries is a challenge.",
        "The use of all the terms from the user's input can rapidly narrow down the set of matching documents, especially if a boolean retrieval model is adopted.",
        "While one would expect the underlying retrieval model to appropriately assign weights to different terms in the query and return only relevant content, it is widely acknowledged that models fail due to a variety of reasons (Harman and Buckley, 2004), and are not suited to tackle every possible query.",
        "Recently, there has been great interest in personalized search (Teevan et al., 2005), where the query is modified based on a user's profile.",
        "The profile usually consists of documents previously viewed, web sites recently visited, email correspondence and so on.",
        "Common procedures for using this large amount of information usually involve creating huge query vectors with some sort of term-weighting mechanism to favor different portions of the profile.",
        "The queries used in the TREC ad-hoc tracks consist of title, description and narrative sections, of progressively increasing length.",
        "The title, of length ranging from a single term to four terms is considered a concise query, while the description is considered a longer version ofthe title expressing the same information need.",
        "Almost all research on the TREC ad-hoc retrieval track reports results using only the title portion as the query, and a combination of the title and description as a separate query.",
        "Most reported results show that the latter is more effective than the former, though in the case of some hard collections the opposite is true.",
        "However, as we shall show later, there is tremendous scope for improvement.",
        "Formulating a shorter query from the description can lead to significant improvements in performance.",
        "In the light of the above, we believe there is great utility in creating query-rewriting mechanisms for handling long queries.",
        "This paper is organized in the following way.",
        "We start with some examples and explore ways by which we can create concise high-quality reformulations of long queries in Section 2.",
        "We describe our baseline system in Section 3 and motivate our investigations with experiments in Section 4.",
        "Since automatic methods have shortfalls, we present a procedure in Section 5 to involve users in selecting a good shorter query from a small selection of alternatives.",
        "We report and discuss the results of this approach in Section 6.",
        "Related work is presented in Section 7.",

        "A related problem addressed by (Cronen-Townsend et al., 2002) was determining query quality.",
        "This is known to be a very hard problem, and various efforts (Carmel et al., 2006; Vinay et al., 2006) have been made towards formalizing and understanding it.",
        "Previous work (Shapiro and Taksa, 2003) in the web environment attempted to convert a user's natural language query into one suited for use with web search engines.",
        "However, the focus was on merging the results from using different sub-queries, and not selection of a single sub-query.",
        "Our approach of rewriting queries could be compared to query reformulation, wherein a user follows up a query with successive reformulations of the original.",
        "In the web environment, studies have shown that most users still enter only one or two queries, and conduct limited query reformulation (Spink et al., 2002).",
        "We hypothesize that the techniques we have developed will be well-suited for search engines like Ask Jeeves where 50% of the queries are in question format (Spink and Ozmultu, 2002).",
        "More experimentation in the Web domain is required to substantiate this.",
