        "The task of coreference resolution involves imposing a partition on a set of entity mentions in a document, where each partition corresponds to some entity in an underlying discourse model.",
        "Most work treats coreference resolution as a binary classification task in which each decision is made in a pairwise fashion, independently ofthe others (McCarthy and Lehnert, 1995; Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002b; Morton, 2000; Kehler et al., 2004).",
        "There are two major drawbacks with most systems that make pairwise coreference decisions.",
        "The first is that identification of anaphora is done implicitly as part of the coreference resolution.",
        "Two common types of errors with these systems are cases where: (i) the system mistakenly identifies an antecedent for non-anaphoric mentions, and (ii) the system does not try to resolve an actual anaphoric mention.",
        "To reduce such errors, Ng and Cardie (2002a) and Ng (2004) use an anaphoricity classifier which has the sole task of saying whether or not any antecedents should be identified for each mention-as a filter for their coreference system.",
        "They achieve higher performance by doing so; however, their setup uses the two classifiers in a cascade.",
        "This requires careful determination of an anaphoric-ity threshold in order to not remove too many mentions from consideration (Ng, 2004).",
        "This sensitivity is unsurprising, given that the tasks are co-dependent.",
        "The second problem is that most coreference systems make each decision independently of previous ones in a greedy fashion (McCallum and Wellner, 2004).",
        "Clearly, the determination of membership of a particular mention into a partition should be conditioned on how well it matches the entity as a whole.",
        "Since independence between decisions is an unwarranted assumption for the task, models that consider a more global context are likely to be more appropriate.",
        "Recent work has examined such models; Luo et al.",
        "(2004) using Bell trees, and McCallum and Wellner (2004) using conditional random fields, and Ng (2005) using rerankers.",
        "In this paper, we propose to recast the task of coreference resolution as an optimization problem, namely an integer linear programming (ILP) problem.",
        "This framework has several properties that make it highly suitable for addressing the two aforementioned problems.",
        "The first is that it can utilize existing classifiers; ILP performs global inference based on their output rather than formulating a new inference procedure for solving the basic task.",
        "Second, the ILP approach supports inference over multiple classifiers, without having to fiddle with special parameterization.",
        "Third, it is much more efficient than conditional random fields, especially when long-distance features are utilized (Roth and Yih, 2005).",
        "Finally, it is straightforward to create categorical global constraints with ILP; this is done in a declarative manner using inequalities on the assignments to indicator variables.",
        "This paper focuses on the first problem, and proposes to model anaphoricity determination and coreference resolution as a joint task, wherein the decisions made by each locally trained model are mutually constrained.",
        "The presentation of the ILP model proceeds in two steps.",
        "In the first, intermediary step, we simply use ILP to find a global assignment based on decisions made by the corefer-ence classifier alone.",
        "The resulting assignment is one that maximally agrees with the decisions of the classifier, that is, where all and only the links predicted to be coreferential are used for constructing the chains.",
        "This is in contrast with the usual clustering algorithms, in which a unique antecedent is typically picked for each anaphor (e.g., the most probable or the most recent).",
        "The second step provides the joint formulation: the coreference classifier is now combined with an anaphoricity classifier and constraints are added to ensure that the ultimate coreference and anaphoricity decisions are mutually consistent.",
        "Both of these formulations achieve significant performance gains over the base classifier.",
        "Specifically, the joint model achieves f score improvements of 3.7-5.3% on three datasets.",
        "We begin by presenting the basic coreference classifier and anaphoricity classifier and their performance, including an upperbound that shows the limitation of using them in a cascade.",
        "We then give the details of our ILP formulations and evaluate their performance with respect to each other and the base classifier."

        "The classification approach tackles coreference in two steps by: (i) estimating the probability, PC(coREF|(i, j)), of having a coreferential outcome given a pair of mentions ), and (ii) applying a selection algorithm that will single out a unique candidate out of the subset of candidates i for which the probability Pc(coREF|(i, j)) reaches a particular value (typically .5).",
        "We use a maximum entropy model for the coreference classifier.",
        "Such models are well-suited for coreference, because they are able to handle many different, potentially overlapping learning features without making independence assumptions.",

        "We use a Gaussian prior with a variance of 1000 – no attempt was made to optimize this value.",
        "Training instances for the coreference classifier are constructed based on pairs of mentions of the form (i, j), where j and i are the descriptions for an anaphor and one of its candidate antecedents, respectively.",
        "Each such pair is assigned either a label coref (i.e. a positive instance) or a label -coref (i.e. a negative instance) depending on whether or not the two mentions corefer.",
        "In generating the training data, we followed the method of (Soon et al., 2001) creating for each anaphor: (i) a positive instance for the pair (i, j) where i is the closest antecedent for j, and (ii) a negative instance for each pair (i, k) where k intervenes between i and j.",
        "once trained, the classifier is used to create a set of coreferential links for each test document; these links in turn define a partition over the entire set of mentions.",

        "al.",
        "(2001) system, this is done by pairing each mention j with each preceding mention i.",

        "(2001) use \"Closest-First\" selection: that is, the process terminates as soon as an antecedent (i.e., a test instance with probability > .5) is found or the beginning of the text is reached.",
        "Another option is to pick the antecedent with the best overall probability (Ng and Cardie, 2002b).",
        "Our features for the coreference classifier fall into three main categories: (i) features ofthe anaphor, (ii) features of antecedent mention, and (iii) relational features (i.e., features that describe properties which hold between the two mentions, e.g. distance).",
        "This feature set is similar (though not equivalent) to that used by Ng and Cardie (2002a).",

        "ILP uses separate local classifiers which are learned without knowledge of the output constraints and are then integrated into a larger inference task.",
        "CRFs estimate a global model that directly uses the constraints of the domain.",
        "This involves heavy computations which cause CRFs to generally be slow and inefficient (even using dynamic programming).",
        "Again, the results presented in McCallum and wellner (2004) are hard to compare with our own results.",
        "They only consider proper names, and they only tackled the task of identifying the correct antecedent only for mentions which have a true antecedent.",
        "A third global approach is offered by Ng (2005), who proposes a global reranking over partitions generated by different coreference systems.",
        "This approach proceeds by first generating 54 candidate partitions, which are each generated by a different system.",
        "These different coreference systems are obtained as combinations over three different learners (C4.5, Ripper, and Maxent), three sampling methods, two feature sets (Soon et al., 2001; Ng and Cardie, 2002b), and three clustering algorithms (Best-First, Closest-First, and aggressive-merge).",
        "The features used by the reranker are of two types: (i) partition-based features which are here simple functions of the local features, and (ii) method-based features which simply identify the coreference system used for generating the given partition.",
        "Although this approach leads to significant gains on the both the MUC and the ACE datasets, it has some weaknesses.",
        "Most importantly, the different systems employed for generating the different partitions are all instances of the local classification approach, and they all use very similar features.",
        "This renders them likely to make the same types of errors.",
        "The ILP approach could in fact be integrated with these other approaches, potentially realizing the advantages of multiple global systems, with ILP conducting their interactions."

        "we have provided two ILP formulations for resolving coreference and demonstrated their superiority to a pairwise classifier that makes its coreference assignments greedily.",
        "In particular, we have also shown that ILP provides a natural means to express the use of both anaphoricity classification and coreference classification in a single system, and that doing so provides even further performance improvements, specifically f-score improvements of 5.3%, 4.9%, and 3.7% over the base coreference classifier on the ACE datasets.",
        "with ILP, it is not necessary to carefully control the anaphoricity threshold.",
        "This is in stark contrast to systems which use the anaphoricity classifier as a filter for the coreference classifier in a cascade setup.",

        "The ILP objective function incorporates the probabilities produced by both classifiers as weights on variables that indicate the ILP assignments for those tasks.",
        "The indicator variables associated with those assignments allow several constraints between the tasks to be straightforwardly stated to ensure consistency to the assignments.",
        "We thus achieve large improvements with a simple formulation and no fuss.",
        "ILP solutions are also obtained very quickly for the objective functions and constraints we use.",
        "In future work, we will explore the use of global constraints, similar to those used by (Barzilay and Lapata, 2006) to improve both precision and recall.",
        "For example, we expect transitivity constraints over coreference pairs, as well as constraints on the entire partition (e.g., the number of entities in the document), to help considerably.",
        "We will also consider linguistic constraints (e.g., restrictions on pronouns) in order to improve precision."
