        "It is becoming widely accepted that the standard search interface, consisting of a query box and a list of retrieved items, is inadequate for navigation and exploration in large information collections such as online catalogs, digital libraries, and museum image collections.",
        "Instead, user interfaces which organize and group retrieval results have been shown to be helpful for and preferred by users over the straight results-list model when engaged in exploratory tasks (Yee et al., 2003; Pratt et al., 1999; Kaki, 2005).",
        "In particular, a representation known as hierarchical faceted metadata is gaining great traction within the information architecture and enterprise search communities (Yee et al., 2003; Weinberger, 2005).",
        "A considerable impediment to the wider adoption of collection navigation via metadata in general, and hierarchical faceted metadata in particular, is the need to create the metadata hierarchies and assign the appropriate category labels to the information items.",
        "Usually, metadata category structures are manually created by information architects (Rosenfeld and Morville, 2002).",
        "While manually created metadata is considered of high quality, it is costly in terms of time and effort to produce, which makes it difficult to scale and keep up with the vast amounts of new content being produced.",
        "In this paper, we describe Castanet, an algorithm that makes considerable progress in automating faceted metadata creation.",
        "Castanet creates domain-specific overlays on top of a large general-purpose lexical database, producing surprisingly good results in a matter of minutes for a wide range of subject matter.",
        "In the next section we elaborate on the notion of hierarchical faceted metadata and show how it can be used in interfaces for navigation of information collections.",
        "Section 3 describes other algorithms for inducing category structure from textual descriptions.",
        "Section 4 describes the Castanet algorithm, Section 5 describes the results of an evaluation with information architects, and Section 6 draws conclusions and discusses future work."

      "text": [
        "A hierarchical faceted metadata system (HFC) creates a set of category hierarchies, each of which corresponds to a different facet (dimension or type).",
        "The main application of hierarchical faceted metadata is in user interfaces for browsing and navigating collections of like items.",
        "In the case of a recipe collection, for example, facets may consist of dish type (salad, appetizer), ingredients such as fruits (apricot, apple), vegetables (broccoli, cabbage), meat (beef, fish), preparation method (fry, bake, etc.",
        "), calorie count, and so on.",
        "Decomposing the description into independent categories allows users to move through large information spaces in a flexible manner.",
        "The category metadata guides the user toward possible choices, and organizes the results of keyword searches, allowing users to both refine and expand the current query, while maintaining a consistent representation of the collection's structure.",
        "This use of metadata should be integrated with free-text search, allowing the user to follow links, then add search terms, then follow more links, without interrupting the interaction flow.",
        "Usability studies have shown that, when incorporated into a properly-designed user interface, hierarchical faceted metadata provides a flexible, intuitive way to explore a large collection of items that enhances feelings of discovery without inducing a feeling of being lost (Yee et al., 2003).",
        "Note that the HFC representation is intermediate in complexity between that of a monolithic hierarchy and a full-blown ontology.",
        "HFC does not capture relations and inferences that are essential for some applications.",
        "For example, faceted metadata can express that an image contains a hat and a man and a tree, and perhaps a wearing activity, but does not indicate who is wearing what.",
        "This relative simplicity of representation suggests that automatically inferring facet hierarchies may be easier than the full ontology inference problem."

        "Both Castanet and the Baseline fare well, with Castanet doing somewhat better.",
        "85% of the Castanet evaluators said yes or definitely yes to using it, compared to 74% for the Baseline.",
        "Only one participant said \"no\" to Castanet but \"yes\" to the Baseline, suggesting that both kinds of information are useful for information architects.",
        "The comparison algorithms did poorly.",
        "Subsumption received 38% answering \"yes\" or \"definitely yes\" to the question about likelihood of use.",
        "LDA was rejected by all participants.",
        "A t-test (after converting responses to a 1-4 scale) shows that Castanet obtains significantly better scores than LDA (t = 7.88 > 2.75) and Subsumption (t = 4.50 > 2.75), for p = 0.005.",
        "The differences between Castanet and the Baseline are not significant.",
        "Table 2 shows the average responses to the questions (i) Overall, these are categories meaningful; (ii) Overall, these categories describe the collection in a systematic way; (iii) These categories capture the important concepts.)",
        "They were scored as 1= Strongly disagree, 2 = Disagree Somewhat, 3 = Agree Somewhat, and 4 = Strongly agree.",
        "Castanet's score was about 35% higher than Subsumption's, and about 50% higher than LDA's.",
        "Participants were asked to scrutinize the top-level categories and assess whether they would add categories, remove some, merge or rename some.",
        "The ratings were again converted to a four point scale (no changes = 4, change one or two = 3, change a few = 2, change many = 1).",
        "Table 3 shows the results.",
        "Castanet scores as well as or better than the others on all measures except Rename; Subsumption scores slightly higher on this measure, and does well on Split as well, but very poorly on Remove, reflecting the fact that it produces well-named categories at the top level, but too many at too fine a granularity.",
        "Participants were also asked to examine two subcategories in detail.",
        "Table 4 shows results averaged across the two subcategories for number of categories to add, remove, promote, move, and how well the subcategories matched their expectations.",
        "Castanet performs especially well on this last measure (2.5 versus 1.5 and 1.7).",
        "Participants generally did not suggest moves or promotions.",
        "Thus on all measures, we see Castanet outperforming the other state-of-the-art algorithms.",
        "Note that we did not explicitly evaluate the \"facetedness\" of the category systems, as we thought this would be too difficult for the participants to do.",
        "We feel the questions about the coherence, systematicity, and coverage of the category systems captured this to some degree.",

        "We have presented an algorithm called Castanet that creates hierarchical faceted metadata using WordNet and Wordnet Domains.",
        "A questionnaire revealed that 85% information architects thought it was likely to be useful, compared to 0% for LDA and 38% for Subsumption.",
        "Although not discussed here, we have successfully applied the algorithm to other domains including biomedical journal titles and art history image descriptions, and to another lexical hierarchy, MeSH.",
        "Although quite useful \"out of the box,\" the algorithm could benefit by several improvements and additions.",
        "The processing of the terms should recognize spelling variations (such as aging vs. ageing) and morphological variations.",
        "Verbs and adjectives are often quite important for a collection (e.g., stir-fry for cooking) and should be included, but with caution.",
        "Some terms should be allowed to occur with more than one sense if this is required by the dataset (and some in more than one facet even with the same sense, as seen in the brain example).",
        "Currently if a term is in a document it is assumed to use the sense assigned in the facet hierarchies; this is often incorrect, and so terms should be disambiguated within the text before automatic category assignment is done.",
        "And finally, WordNet is not exhaustive and some mechanism is needed to improve coverage for unknown terms.",
