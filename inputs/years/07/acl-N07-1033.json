        "We propose that SVM training can in general incorporate annotator rationales as follows.",
        "From the rationale annotations on a positive example xj, we will construct one or more \"not-quite-as-positive\" contrast examples vtj.",

        "The intuition is that the correct model should be less sure of a positive classification on the contrast example Vjjj than on the original example x£i, because vtj lacks evidence that the annotator found significant.",
        "We can translate this intuition into additional constraints on the correct model, i.e., on the weight vector w. In addition to the usual SVM constraint on positive examples that W • xj > 1, we also want (for each j) that W • xi – W • vtj > //, where // > 0 controls the size of the desired margin between original and contrast examples.",
        "An ordinary soft-margin SVM chooses W and £ to minimize subject to the constraints where xj is a training example, yi e { – 1, +1} is its desired classification, and {i is a slack variable that allows training example xl to miss satisfying the margin constraint if necessary.",
        "The parameter C > 0 controls the cost of taking such slack, and should generally be lower for noisier or less linearly separable datasets.",
        "We add the contrast constraints where – jj is one of the contrast examples constructed from example xj, and {ij > 0 is an associated slack variable.",
        "Just as these extra constraints have their own margin //, their slack variables have",

        "There is one subtlety.",
        "To allow a biased hyperplane, we use the usual trick of prepending a 1 element to each training example.",
        "Thus we require W • (1, xl) > 1 – {i (which makes w0 play the role of a bias term).",
