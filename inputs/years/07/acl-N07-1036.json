        "Many interesting research questions remain.",
        "During human machine conversation, how is eye gaze aligned with speech production?",
        "How reliable is eye gaze for attention prediction?",
        "Are there any other factors such as interface design and visual properties that will affect eye gaze behavior and therefore attention prediction?",
        "The answers to these questions will affect how eye gaze should be appropriately modeled and used for language processing.",
        "Eye-tracking systems are no longer bulky, stationary systems that prevent natural human machine communication.",
        "Recently developed display mounted gaze-tracking systems (e.g., Tobii) are completely non-intrusive, can tolerate head motion, and provide high tracking quality.",
        "These features have been demonstrated in several successful applications (Duchowski, 2002).",
        "Integrating eye tracking with conversational interfaces is no longer beyond reach.",
        "We believe it is time to conduct systematic investigations and fully explore the additional channel provided by eye gaze in improving robustness of human machine conversation."
