        "In the recent past, there has been a focus on information management from scientiic literature.",
        "In the genetics domain, for instance, information extraction of genes and gene-protein interactions helps geneticists scan large amounts of information (e.g., as explored in the TREC Genomics track (Hersh et al., 2004)).",
        "Elsewhere, citation indexes (Garfield, 1979) provide biblio-metric data about the frequency with which particular papers are cited.",
        "The success of citation indexers such as CiteSeer (Giles et al., 1998) and Google Scholar relies on the robust detection of formal citations in arbitrary text.",
        "In bibliographic information retrieval, anchor text, i.e., the context of a citation can be used to characterise (index) the cited paper using terms outside of that paper (Bradshaw, 2003); O'Connor (1982) presents an approach for identifying the area around citations where the text focuses on that citation.",
        "And automatic citation classii-cation (Nanba and Okumura, 1999; Teufel et al., 2006) determines the function that a citation plays in the discourse.",
        "For such information access and retrieval purposes, the relevance of a citation within a paper is often crucial.",
        "One can estimate how important a citation is by simply counting how often it occurs in the paper.",
        "But as Kim and Webber (2006) argue, this ignores many expressions in text which refer to the cited author's work but which are not as easy to recognise as citations.",
        "They address the resolution of instances of the third person personal pronoun \"they\" in astronomy papers: it can either refer to a citation or to some entities that are part of research within the paper (e.g., planets or galaxies).",
        "Several applications should proit in principle from detecting connections between referring expressions and citations.",
        "For instance, in citation function clas-siication, the task is to ind out if a citation is described as flawed or as useful.",
        "Consider:",
        "Most computational models of discourse are based primarily on an analysis of the intentions of the speakers [Cohen and Perrault, 1979][Allen and Perrault, 1980][Grosz and Sidner, 1986]WEAK.",
        "The speaker will form intentions based on his goals and then act on these intentions, producing utterances.",
        "The hearer will then reconstruct a model of the speaker's intentions upon hearing the utterance.",
        "This approach has many strong points, but does not provide a very satisfactory account of the adherence to discourse conventions in dialogue.",
        "The three citations above are described as flawed (detectable by \"does not provide a very satisfactory account\"), and thus receive the label Weak.",
        "However, in order to detect this, one must first realise that \"this approach\" refers to the three cited papers.",
        "A contrasting hypothesis could be that the citations are used (thus deserving the label Use; the cue phrase \"based on\" might make us think so (as in the context \"our work is based on\").",
        "This, however, can be ruled out if we know that \"the speaker\" is not referring to some aspect of the current paper."

        "We define an attribution task where possible referents are members of the reference list (i.e., each cited paper), the Current-Paper, and a back-off category No-Specific-Paper for markables that are not attributable to any specific paper(s).",
        "Our markables are as follows: all definite descriptions (e.g., \"the hearer\", and including demonstrative noun phrases such as \"these intentions\"), all \"work\" nouns, and all pronouns (possessive, personal and demonstrative); c.f., underlined strings in the above example.",
        "Our notion of attribution link encompasses two relations:",
        "1.",
        "Anaphoric: The referents are entire research papers, or the papers' authors",
        "2.",
        "Subpart: The referents are some component of an approach/argument/claim in the research paper",
        "There are two tasks: attributing a linguistic expression to the right paper (including the current paper) - a task we call scientific attribution - and deciding whether or not the expression is anaphoric to the entirety of the paper, or just to some subpart of it.",
        "Kim and Webber (2006) solve the problem of distinguishing between these relations for one case.",
        "They decide whether the pronoun \"they\" anaphorically refers to the authors of a cited paper, or whether it refers to some entity that is discussed in (a subpart of) a paper (e.g., \"galaxies\").",
        "In this paper, we tackle the other problem of scientific attribution.",
        "We do not distinguish between the two types of links stated above, but only identify which ci-tation(s) a linguistic expression is attributable to.",
        "For tasks of interest to us, it is not enough to only consider anaphoric references to entire papers; authors often make statements comparing/using/criticising aspects or subparts of cited work.",
        "We therefore consider a far wider range of markables than Kim and Webber's single pronoun \"they\".",
        "Our attribution task differs from the traditional anaphora resolution task in that we have a fixed list of possible referents (the reference list items, Current-Paper or No-Specific-Paper) that are known upfront.",
        "Also, we do not form co-reference chains; we attribute a referring expression directly to one or more referents.",
        "Ours is therefore a multi-label classification task, where the citations, Current-Paper and No-Specific-Paper are the labels, and where one or more labels are assigned to each markable.",
        "We evaluate intrinsically by comparing to human-annotated attribution, and extrinsically by showing that automatically acquired knowledge about scientific attribution improves performance on a discourse classification task – Argumentative Zoning (Teufel and Moens, 2002), where sentences are labelled as one of {Own, Other, Background, Textual, Aim, Basis, Contrast} according to their role in the author's argument.",
        "We describe our data in §3 and methodology in §4, discuss evaluation metrics in §5, and evaluate intrinsically in §6 and extrinsically in §7.",
        "We used data from the CmpLg (Computation and Language archive; 320 conference articles in computational linguistics).",
        "The articles are in XML format.",
        "We produced an annotated corpus (10 articles, 4290 data points, i.e., markables) based on written guidelines.",
        "The task was found to be quite intuitive by our annotators, and this was reflected in high agreement - Krippendorff's alpha of more than 0.8 (2 annotators, 3 papers, 1429 data points) on the attribution task.",
        "The distribution of classes was, as expected, quite skewed: 69% of markables are attributable to",
        "Current-Paper, 7% to no specific paper and 24% to specific references (on average, 1.7 per reference).",

        "• Linguistic features include (complex) tense, voice, and presence of an auxiliary.",
        "• Citation features detect properties of formal citations in text, such as the occurrence of authors' names in text, the position of a citation in text, and whether the citation is a self citation (i.e., includes any of the authors of the paper itself).",
