        "The study of semantic similarity between words has been an integral part of natural language processing and information retrieval for many years.",
        "Semantic similarity measures are vital for various applications in natural language processing such as word sense disambiguation (Resnik, 1999), language modeling (Rosenfield, 1996), synonym extraction (Lin, 1998a) and automatic thesaurus extraction (Curran, 2002).",
        "Pre-compiled taxonomies such as WordNet and text corpora have been used in previous work on semantic similarity (Lin, 1998a; Resnik, 1995; Jiang and Conrath, 1998; Lin, 1998b).",
        "However, semantic similarity between words change over time as new senses and associations ofwords are constantly created.",
        "One major issue behind taxonomies and corpora oriented approaches is that they might not necessarily capture similarity between proper names such as named entities (e.g., personal names, location names, product names) and the new uses of existing words.",
        "For example, apple is frequently associated with computers on the Web but this sense of apple is not listed in the WordNet.",
        "Maintaining an up-to-date taxonomy of all the new words and new usages of existing words is costly if not impossible.",
        "The Web can be regarded as a large-scale, dynamic corpus of text.",
        "Regarding the Web as a live corpus has become an active research topic recently.",
        "Simple, unsupervised models have shown to perform better when n-gram counts are obtained from the Web rather than from a large corpus (Keller and Lapata, 2003; Lapata and Keller, 2005).",
        "Resnik and Smith (2003) extract bilingual sentences from the Web to create parallel corpora for machine translation.",
        "Turney (2001) defines a point wise mutual information (PMI-IR) measure using the number of hits returned by a Web search engine to recognize synonyms.",
        "Matsuo et.",
        "al, (2006b) follows a similar approach to measure the similarity between words and apply their method in a graph-based word clustering algorithm.",
        "Due to the huge number of documents and the high growth rate of the Web, it is difficult to directly analyze each individual document separately.",
        "Search engines provide an efficient interface to this vast information.",
        "Page counts and snippets are two useful information sources provided by most Web search engines.",
        "Page count of a query is the number of pages that contain the query words .",
        "A snippet is a brief window of text extracted by a search engine around the query term in a document.",
        "Snippets provide useful information about the immediate context of the query term.",
        "This paper proposes a Web-based semantic similarity metric which combines page counts and snippets using support vector machines.",
        "We extract lexico-syntactic patterns from snippets.",
        "For example, X is a Y indicates there is a high semantic similarity between X and Y.",
        "Automatically extracted lexico-syntactic patterns have been successfully employed in various term extraction tasks (Hearst, 1992).",
        "Our contributions are summarized as follows:",
        "• We propose a lexico-syntactic patterns-based approach to compute semantic similarity using snippets obtained from a Web search engine.",
        "• We integrate different Web-based similarity scores using WordNet synsets and support vector machines to create a robust semantic similarity measure.",
        "The integrated measure outperforms all existing Web-based semantic similarity measures in a benchmark dataset and a named entity clustering task.",

        "Given a taxonomy of concepts, a straightforward method for calculating similarity between two words (concepts) is to find the length of the shortest path connecting the two words in the taxonomy (Rada et al., 1989).",
        "If a word is polysemous (i.e., having more than one sense) then multiple paths may exist between the two words.",
        "In such cases only the shortest path between any two senses of the words is considered for the calculation of similarity.",
        "A problem frequently acknowledged with this approach is that it relies on the notion that all links in the taxonomy represent uniform distances.",
        "Resnik (1995) proposes a similarity measure based on information content.",
        "He defines the similarity between two concepts C1 and C2 in the taxonomy as the maximum of the information content of all concepts C that subsume both Ci and C2.",
        "Then the similarity between two words are defined as the maximum of the similarity between any concepts that the words belong to.",
        "He uses WordNet as the taxonomy and information content is calculated using the Brown corpus.",
        "Li et al., (2003) combines structural semantic information from a lexical taxonomy and information content from a corpus in a non-linear model.",
        "They propose a similarity measure that uses shortest path length, depth and local density in a taxonomy.",
        "Their experiments using WordNet and the Brown corpus reports a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.8914 on the Miller and Charles' (1998) benchmark dataset.",
        "They do not evaluate their method on similarities between named entities.",
        "Recently, some work has been carried out on measuring semantic similarity using web content.",
        "Matsuo et al., (2006a) propose the use of Web hits for the extraction of communities on the Web.",
        "They measure the association between two personal names using the overlap coefficient, calculated based on the number of Web hits for each individual name and their conjunction.",
        "Sahami et al., (2006) measure semantic similarity between two queries using the snippets returned for those queries by a search engine.",
        "For each query, they collect snippets from a search engine and represent each snippet as a TF-IDF weighted term vector.",
        "Each vector is L2 normalized and the centroid of the set of vectors is computed.",
        "Semantic similarity between two queries is then defined as the inner product between the corresponding centroid vectors.",
        "They do not compare their similarity measure with taxonomy based similarity measures.",
        "checking model to compute semantic similarity between words.",
        "For two words P and Q, they collect snippets for each word from a web search engine.",
        "Then they count the number of occurrences of word P in the snippets for word Q and the number of occurrences of word Q in the snippets for word P. These values are combined non-linearly to compute the similarity between P and Q.",
        "This method heavily depends on the search engine's ranking algorithm.",
        "Although two words P and Q may be very similar, there is no reason to believe that one can find Q in the snippets for P, or vice versa.",
        "This observation is confirmed by the experimental results in their paper which reports 0 similarity scores for many pairs of words in the Miller and Charles (1998) data set."

Likewise, we define WebOverlap coefficient,",

        "Although estimating the number of documents indexed by a search engine (Bar-Yossef and Gurevich, 2006) is an interesting task itself, it is beyond the scope of this work.",
        "In this work, we set N = 10 according to the number of indexed pages reported by Google.",
        "Page counts-based similarity measures do not consider the relative distance between P and Q in a page or the length of the page.",

        "For example, from the previous snippet we extract the pattern, X is the largest X.",
        "In order to leverage the pattern extraction process, we randomly select 5000 pairs of synonymous nouns from WordNet synsets.",
        "We ignore the nouns which do not have synonyms in the WordNet.",
        "For nouns with more than one sense, we select synonyms from its dominant sense.",
        "For each pair of synonyms (P, Q), we query Google for \"P\" AND \"Q\" and download the snippets.",
        "Let us call this collection of snippets as the positive corpus.",
        "We apply the above mentioned n-gram based pattern extraction procedure and count the frequency of each valid pattern in the positive corpus.",
        "Pattern extraction algorithm described in step 1 yields 4, 562, 471 unique patterns.",
        "80%of these patterns occur less than 10 times in the positive corpus.",
        "It is impossible to learn with such a large number of sparse patterns.",
        "Moreover, some patterns might occur purely randomly in a snippet and are not good indicators of semantic similarity.",
        "To measure the reliability of a pattern as an indicator of semantic similarity we employ the following procedure.",
