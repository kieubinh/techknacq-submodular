        "When composing a text, a writer can access a thesaurus to retrieve words that are similar to a given target word, when there is a need to avoid repeating the same word, or when the word does not seem to be the best choice in the context.",
        "Our intelligent thesaurus is an interactive application that presents the user with a list of alternative words (near-synonyms), and, unlike standard thesauri, it orders the choices by their suitability to the writing context.",
        "We investigate how the collocational properties of near-synonyms can help with choosing the best words.",
        "This problem is difficult because the near-synonyms have senses that are very close to each other, and therefore they occur in similar contexts; we need to capture the subtle differences specific to each near-synonym.",
        "Our thesaurus brings up only alternatives that have the same part-of-speech with the target word.",
        "The choices could come from various inventories of near-synonyms or similar words, for example the Roget thesaurus (Roget, 1852), dictionaries of synonyms (Hayakawa, 1994), or clusters acquired from corpora (Lin, 1998).",
        "In this paper we focus on the task of automatically selecting the best near-synonym that should be used in a particular context.",
        "The natural way to validate an algorithm for this task would be to ask human readers to evaluate the quality of the algorithm's output, but this kind of evaluation would be very laborious.",
        "Instead, we validate the algorithms by deleting selected words from sample sentences, to see whether the algorithms can restore the missing words.",
        "That is, we create a lexical gap and evaluate the ability of the algorithms to fill the gap.",
        "Two examples are presented in Figure 1.",
        "All the near-synonyms of the original word, including the word itself, become the choices in the solution set (see the figure for two examples of solution sets).",
        "The task is to automatically fill the gap with the best choice in the particular context.",
        "We present a method of scoring the choices.",
        "The highest scoring near-synonym will be chosen.",
        "In order to evaluate how well our method works we consider that the only correct solution is the original word.",
        "This will cause our evaluation scores to underestimate the performance, as more than one choice will sometimes be a perfect",

        "Moreover, what we consider to be the best choice is the typical usage in the corpus, but it may vary from writer to writer.",
        "Nonetheless, it is a convenient way of producing test data.",
        "The statistical method that we propose here is based on semantic coherence scores (based on mutual information) of each candidate with the words in the context.",
        "We explore how far such a method can go when using the Web as a corpus.",
        "We estimate the counts by using the Waterloo MultiText system (Clarke and Terra, 2003b) with a corpus of about one terabyte of text collected by a Web crawler.",
        "We also propose a method that uses collocations and anti-collocations, and a supervised method that uses words and mutual information scores as featured for machine learning."

        "Our near-synonyms have senses that are very close to each other.",

        "It is based on the mutual information scores between a near-synonym and the content words in the context (we filter out the stopwords).",
        "The pointwise mutual information (PMI) between two words x and y compares the probability of observing the two words together (their joint probability) to the probabilities of observing x and y independently (the probability of occurring together by chance) (Church and Hanks, 1991): PMI(x, y) = log p(x,y)",
        "The probabilities can be approximated by: P(x) = C(x)/N, P(y) = C(y)/N, P(x,y) = C(x,y)/N, where C denotes frequency counts and N is the total number of words in the corpus.",
        "Therefore: PMI(x,y) = log2 c^yciyy), where N can be ignored in comparisons.",

        "We also experimented with the same formula when the sum is replaced with maximum to see whether a particular word in the context has higher influence than the sum of all contributions (though the sum worked better).",
        "Because we are using the Waterloo terabyte corpus and we issue queries to its search engine, we have several possibilities of computing the frequency counts.",
        "C(x,y) can be the number of cooccurrences of x and y when y immediately follows x, or the distance between x and y can be up to q.",
        "We call q the query frame size.",
        "The tool for accessing the corpus allows us to use various values for q.",
        "The search engine also allows us to approximate words counts with document counts.",
        "If the counts C(x), C(y), and C(x,y) are approximated as the number of document in which they appear, we obtain the PMI-IR formula (Turney, 2001).",
        "The queries we need to send to the search engine are the same but they are restricted to document counts: C(x) is the number of document in which x occurs; C(x, y) is the number of documents in which x is followed by y in a frame of size q.",
