        "In order to fully understand a piece of text, we must understand its temporal structure.",
        "The first step toward such an understanding is identifying explicit references to time.",
        "We focus on the task of automatically annotating temporal expressions (or timexes) – both identifying them in text and interpreting them to determine what times they refer to.",
        "Timex annotation is more than normalizing date expressions.",
        "First, time consists of more than calendar dates and clock times – it also includes points of finer and coarser granularity, durations, and sets of times.",
        "Second, the expressions that refer to time are not just full date and time expressions – they may be underspecified, ambiguous, and anaphoric.",
        "Building a system for the full timex identification and interpretation task can be tedious, requiring a great deal of manual effort.",
        "The 2004 Temporal Expression Recognition and Normalization (TERN) evaluation evaluated systems on two tasks: timex recognition (identification) alone and recognition and normalization (interpretation) together.",
        "All the full-task systems were rule-based systems; the top performing full-task system uses in excess of one thousand hand-crafted rules, which probe words and their contexts in order to both identify timexes and to assemble information necessary to interpret them (Negri and Marseglia, 2004).",
        "By contrast, machine learned systems dominated the recognition-only task and even achieved slightly better recognition scores than their rule-based counterparts.",
        "We seek to demonstrate that a timex annotation system that performs both recognition and normalization need not be a tangle of rules that serve double duty for identification and interpretation and that mix up context-dependent and context-independent processing.",
        "We propose a novel architecture that clearly separates syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic processing and factors out context-dependent from context-independent processing.",
        "Factoring out context-dependent disambiguation into separate classification tasks introduces the opportunity for using machine learning, which supports our main goal: building a portable, trainable timex annotation system in which the role of hand-crafted rules is minimized.",
        "The system we present here (available from http://ilps.science.uva.nl/ Resources/timextag/) achieves the goal of making use of only a small set of hand-crafted, context-independent rules to achieve state-of-the-art normalization performance.",
        "In the following section, we define what a timex is.",
        "We give an overview of our system architecture in §3 and describe the components in §4 – 7.",

        "Temporal semantics receives a great deal of attention in the semantics literature (cf. (Mani et al., 2005)), but the focus is generally on verbal semantics (i.e., tense and aspect).",
        "In determining what a timex is and how one should be normalized, we simply follow the TIDES TIMEX2 standard for timex annotation (Ferro et al., 2004).",
        "According to this standard, timexes are phrases or words that refer to times, where times may be points or durations, or sets of points or durations.",
        "Points are more than just in-stanteous moments in time – a point may also be a time with some duration, as long as it spans a single unit of some temporal granularity.",
        "Whether a timex refers to a point or a duration is a question of perspective rather than of ontology.",
        "A point-referring timex such as October 18, 2006 refers to an interval of one day as an atom at the granularity of a day.",
        "A duration-referring timex such as the whole day may refer to the same temporal interval, but it focuses on the durative nature of this interval.",
        "In addition to specifying which phrases are timexes, the TIMEX2 standard also provides a set of attributes for normalizing these timexes.",
        "We focus on the VAL attribute, which takes values that are an extension of the ISO-8601 standard for representing time (ISO, 1997).",
        "TIMEX2 VAL attributes can take one of three basic types of values: Points are expressed as a string matching the pattern dddd-dd-ddTdd:dd:dd.d+, where d indicates a digit.",
        "Such a string is to be interpreted as year-month-dateThour:minute:seconds, and may be truncated from the right, indicating points of coarser granularity.",
        "Any place may be filled with a placeholder X, which indicates an unknown or vague value, and there are also a handful of token values (character strings) for seasons and parts of the day which may substitute for months and times.",
        "There is also an alternate week-based format dddd-Wdd-d, interpreted as year-Wweek number-day of the week.",
        "Durations are expressed as a string matching the pattern Pd+u or PTd+u, where d+ indicates one or more digits and u indicates a unit token (such as Y for years).",
        "A placeholder X may be used instead of a number to indicate vagueness.",
        "Vague points: past_ref, present_ref, future_ref.",
        "The other attribute which we address in this paper is the boolean-valued SET attribute; a SET timex is one that refers to a recurring time.",
        "The remaining attributes are MOD, ANCHORVAL, and AN-CHORJDIR; our system produces values for these attributes, but we do not address them in this paper.",
        "The TIMEX2 annotation standard has been used to create several manually annotated corpora.",
        "For the experiments we present in this paper, we use the corpora annotated for the TERN 2004 evaluation (Ferro, 2004).",
        "These consist of a training set of 511 documents of newswire and broadcast news transcripts, with 5326 TIMEX2s, and a test set of 192 similar documents, with 1828 TIMEX2s."

        "Semantic class disambiguation is the first point at which context dependence enters into timex interpretation.",

        "The machine learned classifier for this task is described in §5.",
        "Based on the class assigned by the semantic class classifier, the semantic composition component (C) generates (underspecified) semantic representations using class-specific, context-independent rules.",
        "The rules we use are simple pattern-matching rules that map lexical items or sequences of lexical items within a timex to semantic representations.",
        "We describe the semantic composition component in §6.",

        "Timexes that refer to specific points are the only exception.",
        "While some point timexes are fully qualified, and thus also directly normalizable, many need to be anchored to another time in context in order to be fully normalized.",
        "Thus, context dependence again enters the timex interpretation process, and now in two ways.",
        "One is obvious: these referential timexes, which need a temporal anchor, have to find it in context.",
        "This task requires a reference resolution process (E), which is described in §7.1.",
        "The second ambiguity regards the relation between a referential timex and its anchor.",
        "Referential timexes, like anaphoric definites, relate to their anchors through a bridging relation, which is determined primarily by the content of the timex – e.g., two years later refers to a point two years after its anchor.",
        "For some referential timexes, though, the direction of the relation (before or after the anchor) is not specified.",
        "The machine learned classifier (D) resolves this ambiguity; see §7.2.",
        "For referential timexes, final normalization (F) is a straightforward combination of semantic representation, temporal anchor, and direction class.",

        "This module also determines the document time-stamp for referential timexes by using a few heuristics to choose from among multiple timestamps or a date from the document text, if necessary.",

        "Generally, machine learned timex recognition systems reduce the task of identifying a timex phrase to one of classifying individual words by using (some variant of) B-I-O tagging, in which each word is tagged as (B)eginning, (I)nside, or (O)utside a timex phrase.",
        "Such a tagging scheme is not inherently sensitive to syntactic constituency and not well-suited to identifying nested timexes (but cf. (Hacioglu et al., 2005)).",
        "Considering that syntactic parsers are readily available, we have explored several ways of leveraging parse information in recognition, although we describe here only the method we use for experiments later in this paper.",

        "We restrict classification to the following phrase types and lexical categories (based on (Ferro et al., 2004, §5)): NP, order to identify candidate phrases and to extract parse-based features, we parse the TEXT elements of our documents with the Charniak parser (Char-niak, 2000).",
        "Because of both parser and annotator errors, only 90.2% of the timexes in the training data align exactly with a parse, which gives an estimated upper-bound on recall using this method.",
