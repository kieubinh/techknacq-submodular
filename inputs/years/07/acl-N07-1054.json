In model building, features are extracted from these instances; M&E extract a single feature, namely the frequency of token pairs derived from taking the cartesian product of Wi = {w1...wn} x W2 = each span pair instance (Wi,W2 ) G I ; these pair frequencies are tallied for each RSR into a frequency table Fr.",

        "Sometimes the latter type are marked by paragraph boundaries, but these are unreliable markers since they may be used quite differently by different authors.",
        "Instead, we take the approach of adding topic segment boundary markers to our corpus, which we can then integrate into our RSR extraction patterns.",
        "In the case of NoRel, our assumption in our original patterns is that the presence of at least three intervening sentences is a sufficient heuristic for finding spans which are not joined by one of the other RSRs; we add the constraint that sentences in a NoRel relation be in distinct topical segments, we can increase model quality.",
        "Conversely, for two-sentence Cause and Contrast instances, we add the constraint that there must not be an intervening topic segment boundary between the two sentences.",
        "Before applying these segment-augmented patterns, we must add boundary markers to our corpus.",
        "While the concept of a topic segment can be defined at various granularities, we take a goal-oriented view and aim to identify segments with a mean length of approximately four sentences, reasoning that these will be long enough to exclude some candidate NoRel instances, yet short enough to exclude a non-trivial number of Contrasts and Cause instances.",
        "We use an automatic topic segmentation tool, LCSeg (Galley et al., 2003) setting parameters so that the derived segments are of the approximate desired length.",
        "Using these parameters, LC-Seg produces topic segments with a mean length of 3.51 sentences over Gigaword, as opposed to 1.54 sentences for paragraph boundaries.",
        "Using a simple metric that assumes \"correct\" segment boundaries always occur at paragraph boundaries, LCSeg achieves 76% precision.",

        "To evaluate the classifiers built on the segment-constrained instances, we can essentially follow the same protocol as in our Parameter Optimization experiments.",
        "However, we must choose whether to use a held-out test set taken from the segment-constrained instances (\"Auto-S\") or the same test set as used to evaluate our parameter optimization, i.e. the (\"Auto\") test set from unsegmented training data.",

        "On the unsegmented test data, the segment-trained classifiers are best in two of three cases, but the overall accurate-inaccurate improvement does not achieve statistical significance.",

        "We evaluate this against the Penn Discourse TreeBank (PDTB), restricting ourselves to discourse-annotated but and because sentences which match the RSR patterns which are the subject of our syntactic filtering.",
        "Since the PDTB is annotated on the same corpus as Penn Tree-Bank (PTB), we separately evaluate the performance of our heuristics using gold-standard PTB parses (\"PDTB-Gold\") versus the trees generated by Collins' parser (\"PDTB-Prs\").",
        "We extract our test data from the PDTB data corresponding to section 23 of PTB, i.e. the standard testing section, so that the difference between the gold-standard and real parse trees is meaningful.",
        "Section 23 contains 60 annotated instances of but and 52 instances of because which we can use for this purpose.",
        "We define the measurement of accuracy here in terms of wordlevel precision/recall.",
        "That is, the set of words filtered by our heuristics are compared to the \"correct\"",
        "Table 3: Precision/Recall/F-measure of syntactic heuristics under various data sets and settings as described in Section 7.2.",
        "words to cut, i.e. those which the annotated RSR extents exclude.",
        "The results of this analysis are shown in Table 3.",
        "We performed an analysis of our heuristics on Section 24 of the PDTB.",
        "In that section, there are 74 relevant sentences: 20 sentences with because, and 54 sentences with but.",
        "Exactly half of all sentences (37) have no problems in the application of the heuristics (7 because sentences, 30 but sentences).",
        "Among the remaining sentences, the main source of problems is that our heuristics do not always remove matrix clauses with verbs of saying (15 cases total, 8 of which are because sentences).",
        "For the but clauses, our heuristics removed the subject in 12 cases where the PDTB did not do so.",
        "Additionally, the heuristic for but sentences does not correctly identify the second conjunct in five cases (choosing instead a parenthetical, for instance).",
        "In looking at our syntactic heuristics for the Cause relationship, we see that they indeed eliminate the most frequent source of discrepancies with the PDTB, namely the false inclusion of a matrix clause of saying, resulting in 15 out of 20 perfect analyses.",
        "We also evaluate the difference in performance between the PDTB-Gold and PDTB-Prs performance to determine to what extent using a parser (as opposed to the Gold Standard) degrades the performance of our heuristics.",
        "We find that in Section 24, 13 out of 74 sentences contain a parsing error in the relevant aspects, but the effects are typically small and result from well-known parser issues, mainly attachment errors.",
        "As we can see in Table 3, the heuristic performance using an automatic parser degrades only slightly, and as such we can expect an automatic parser to contribute to improving RSR classification (as indeed it does).",
        "Table 4: Classifier accuracy for the Unfiltered (U), Syntactically Filtered (Syn), and POS (P) models described in Section 7.3, over PDTB and Auto test sets.",
        "Baseline in all cases is 50%.",
        "We evaluate the impact of our syntactic heuristics on classification over the Auto and PDTB test sets using the same instance set of 400,000 training instances per relation.",
        "However, each applies different filters to the instances I before computing the frequencies F (all other parameters use the same values; these are set slightly differently than the optimized values discussed earlier because of the smaller training sets).",
        "In addition to an Unfiltered baseline, we evaluate Filtered models obtained with our syntactic heuristics for Cause and Contrast.",
        "To provide an additional point of comparison, we also evaluate the Part-of-Speech based filtering heuristic described by Marcu and Echihabi, which retains only nouns and verbs.",
        "Unlike the other filters, the POS-based filtering is applied to the NoRel instances as well as the Cause and Contrast instances.",
        "Table 4 summarizes the results of the classifying the PDTB and Auto test sets with these different models.",
        "Before we examine the results, we note that the syntactic heuristic cuts a large portion of training data out.",
        "In terms of the total sum of frequencies in Fcause, i.e. the word pairs extracted from all cause instances, the syntactic filtering cuts out nearly half.",
        "With this in mind, we see that while the syntactic filtering achieves slightly lower mean accuracy as compared to the Unfiltered baseline on the Auto test set, the pairs it does keep appear to be used more efficiently (the differences are significant).",
        "Even with this reduced training set, the syntactic heuristic improves performance in two out of three cases on the PDTB test set, including a 2.7 percent improvement for the Cause vs NoRel classifier.",
        "However, due to the small size of the PDTB test set, none of these differences is statistically significant.",
        "We posit that bias in the Auto set may cause this difference in performance across training sets; spans in the Auto set are not true arguments of the relation in the PDTB sense, but nonetheless occur regularly with the cue phrases used in instance mining and thus are more likely to be present in the test set.",
