        "In this section, we formally define the decoding task for selection-and-ordering problems.",
        "First, we introduce our graph representation and show an example of its construction for multidocument summarization.",
        "(An additional example of graph construction for title generation is given in Section 6.)",
        "Then, we discuss the complexity of this task and its connection to classical NP-hard problems.",
        "We represent the set of selection units as the set of vertices V in a weighted directed graph G. The set of edges E represents pairwise ordering scores between all pairs of vertices in V. We also add a special source vertex s and sink vertex t. For each vertex v in V, we add an edge from s to v and an edge from v to t. We then define the set of all vertices as V* = V U {s, t}, and the set of all edges as E* = E U {(s, v) V v G V} U {(v, t) V v G V}.",
        "To simplify the representation, we remove all vertex weights in our graph structure and instead shift the weight for each vertex onto its incoming edges.",
        "For each pair of distinct vertices (v, u) G V, we set the weight of edge ev>u to be the sum of the logarithms of the selection score for u and the pairwise ordering score of (v, u).",
        "We also enhance our graph representation by grouping sets of vertices into equivalence classes.",
        "We introduce these classes to control for redundancy as required in many selection-and-ordering problems.",
        "For instance, in title generation, an equivalence class may consist of morphological variants of the same stem (i.e., examine and examination).",
        "Because a typical title is unlikely to contain more than one word with the same stem, we can only select a single representative from each class.",
        "Our task is now to find the highest weighted acyclic path starting at s and ending at t with k vertices in between, such that no two vertices belong to the same equivalence class.",
        "In multidocument summarization, the vertices in the decoding graph represent sentences from input documents.",
        "The vertices may be organized into equivalence classes that correspond to clusters of sentences conveying similar information.",
        "The edges in the graph represent the combination of the selection and the ordering scores.",
        "The selection scores encode the likelihood of a sentence to be extracted, while pairwise ordering scores capture coherence-based precedence likelihood.",
        "The goal of the decoder is to find the sequence of k non-redundant sentences that optimize both the selection and the ordering scores.",
        "Finding an acyclic path with the highest weight will achieve this goal.",
        "Our path-finding problem may seem to be similar to the tractable shortest paths problem.",
        "However, the requirement that the path be long makes it more similar to the the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).",
        "More precisely, our problem is an instance of the prize collecting traveling salesman problem, in which the salesman is required to visit k vertices at best cost (Balas, 1989; Awerbuch et al., 1995).",
        "Since our problem is NP-hard, we might be pessimistic about finding an exact solution.",
        "But our problem has an important feature: the length k of the path we want to find is small relative to the number of vertices n. This feature distinguishes our task from other decoding problems, such as decoding in machine translation (Germann et al., 2001), that are modeled using a standard TSP formulation.",
        "In general, the connection between n and k opens up a new range of solutions.",
        "For example, if we wanted to find the best length-2 path, we could simply try all subsets of 2 vertices in the graph, in all 2 possible orders.",
        "This is a set of only O(n) possibilities, so we can check all to identify the best in polynomial time.",
        "This approach is very limited, however: in general, its runtime of O(nk) for paths of length k makes it prohibitive for all but the smallest values of k. We cannot really hope to avoid the exponential dependence on k, because doing so would give us a fast solution to an NP-hard problem, but there is hope of making the dependence \"less exponential.\"",
        "This is captured by the definition of fixed parameter tractability (Downey and Fellows, 1995).",
        "A problem is fixed parameter tractable if we can make the exponential dependence on the parameter k independent of the polynomial dependence on the problem size n. This is the case for our problem: as we will describe below, an algorithm of Alon et al.",
        "can be used to achieve a running time of roughly O(2kn).",

        "One might hope to solve decoding with a dynamic program (like that for shortest paths) that grows an optimal path one vertex at a time.",
        "The problem is that this dynamic program may grow to include a vertex already on the path, creating a cycle.",
        "One way to prevent this is to remember the vertices used on each partial path, but this creates a dynamic program with too many states to compute efficiently.",
        "Instead, we apply a color coding technique of",
        "Alon et al. (1995).",
        "The basic step of the algorithm consists of randomly coloring the graph vertices with a set of colors of size r, and using dynamic programming to find the optimum length-k path without repeated colors.",
        "(Later, we describe how to determine the number of colors r.) Forbidding repeated colors excludes cycles as required, but remembering only colors on the path requires less state than remembering precisely which vertices are on the path.",
        "Since we color randomly, any single iteration is not guaranteed to find the optimal path; in a given coloring, two vertices along the optimal path may be assigned the same color, in which case the optimal path will never be selected.",
        "Therefore, the whole process is repeated multiple times, increasing the likelihood of finding an optimal path.",
        "Our algorithm is a variant of the original color-coding algorithm (Alon et al., 1995), which was developed to detect the existence of paths of length k in an unweighted graph.",
        "We modify the original algorithm to find the highest weighted path and also to handle equivalence classes of vertices.",
        "In addition, we provide a method for determining the optimal number of colors to use for finding the highest weighted path of length k.",
        "We first describe the dynamic programming algorithm.",
        "Next, we provide a probabilistic bound on the likelihood of finding the optimal solution, and present a method for determining the optimal number of colors for a given value of k.",
        "Dynamic Programming Recall that we began with a weighted directed graph G to which we added artificial start and end vertices s and t. We now posit a coloring of that graph that assigns a color cv to each vertex v aside from s and t. Our dynamic program returns the maximum score path of length k+2 (including the artificial vertices s and t) from s to t with no repeated colors.",
        "Our dynamic program grows colorful paths – paths with at most one vertex of each color.",
        "For a given colorful path, we define the spectrum of a path to be the set of colors (each used exactly once) of nodes on the interior of the path – we exclude the starting vertex (which will always be s) and the ending vertex.",
        "To implement the dynamic program, we maintain a table q[v, S] indexed by a path-ending vertex v and a spectrum S. For vertex v and spectrum S, entry q[v,S] contains the value of the maximum-score colorful path that starts at s, terminates at v, and has spectrum S in its interior.",
        "We initialize the table with length-one paths: q[v, 0] represents the path from s to v, whose spectrum is the empty set since there are no interior vertices.",
        "Its value is set to the score of edge (s, v).",
        "We then iterate the dynamic program k times in order to build paths of length k + 1 starting at s. We observe that the optimum colorful path of length I and spectrum S from s to v must consist of an optimum path from s to u (which will already have been found by the dynamic program) concatenated to the edge (u, v).",
        "When we concatenate (u, v), vertex u becomes an interior vertex of the path, and so its color must not be in the preexisting path's spectrum, but joins the spectrum of the path we build.",
        "It follows",
        "After k iterations, for each vertex v we will have a list of optimal paths from s to v of length k + 1 with all possible spectra.",
        "The optimum length-k + 2 colorful path from s to t must follow the optimum length-k + 1 path of some spectrum to some penultimate vertex v and then proceed to vertex t; we find it by iterating over all such possible spectra and all vertices v to determine argmaxV;Sq[v, S] + w(v, t).",
        "Amplification The algorithm of Alon et al., and the variant we describe, are somewhat peculiar in that the probability of finding the optimal solution in one coloring iteration is quite small.",
        "But this can easily be dealt with using a standard technique called amplification (Motwani and Raghavan, 1995).",
        "Suppose that the algorithm succeeds with small probability p, but that we would like it to succeed with probability 1 – 5 where 5 is very small.",
        "We run the algorithm t = (1/p) ln 1/5 times.",
        "The probability that the algorithm fails every single run is then (1 – p)* < e-pt = 5.",
        "But if the algorithm succeeds on even one run, then we will find the optimum answer (by taking the best of the answers we see).",
        "No matter how many times we run the algorithm, we cannot absolutely guarantee an optimal answer.",
        "However, the chance of failure can easily be driven to negligible levels – achieving, say, a one-in-a-billion chance of failure requires only 20/p iterations by the previous analysis.",
        "Determining the number of colors Suppose that we use r random colors and want to achieve a given failure probability 5.",
        "The probability that the optimal path has no repeated colors is:",
        "By the amplification analysis, the number of trials needed to drive the failure probability to the desired level will be inversely proportional to this quantity.",
        "At the same time, the dynamic programming table at each vertex will have size 2r (indexing on a bit vector of colors used per path), and the runtime of each trial will be proportional to this.",
        "Thus, the running time for the necessary number of trials Tr will be proportional to",
        "What r > k should we choose to minimize this quantity?",
        "To answer, let us consider the ratio:",
        "If this ratio is less than 1, then using r + 1 colors will be faster than using r; otherwise it will be slower.",
        "When r is very close to k, the above equation is tiny, indicating that one should increase r. When r » k, the above equation is huge, indicating one should decrease r. Somewhere in between, the ratio passes through 1, indicating the optimum point where neither increasing nor decreasing r will help.",
        "If we write a = k/r, and consider large k, then converges to 2ea (1 – a).",
        "Solving numerically to find where this is equal to 1, we find a .76804, which yields a running time proportional to approximately (4.5)k.",
        "In practice, rather than using an (approximate) formula for the optimum r, one should simply plug all values of r in the range [k, 2k] into the running-time formula in order to determine the best; doing so takes negligible time."
