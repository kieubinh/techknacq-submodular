        "The REAP tutoring system (Heilman, et al.",
        "2006), aims to provide authentic reading materials of the appropriate difficulty level, in terms of both vocabulary and grammar, for English as a Second Language students.",
        "An automatic measure of readability that incorporated both lexical and grammatical features was thus needed.",
        "For first language (L1) learners (i.e., children learning their native tongue), reading level has been predicted using a variety of techniques, based on models of a student's lexicon, grammatical surface features such as sentence length (Flesch, 1948), or combinations of such features (Schwarm and Ostendorf, 2005).",
        "It was shown by Collins-Thompson and Callan (2004) that a vocabulary-based language modeling approach was effective at predicting the readability of grades 1 to 12 of Web documents of varying length, even with high levels of noise.",
        "Prior work on first language readability by Schwarm and Ostendorf (2005) incorporated grammatical surface features such as parse tree depth and average number of verb phrases.",
        "This work combining grammatical and lexical features was promising, but it was not clear to what extent the grammatical features improved predictions.",
        "Also, discussions with L2 instructors suggest that a more detailed grammatical analysis of texts that examines features such as passive voice and various verb tenses can provide better features with which to predict reading difficulty.",
        "One goal of this work is to show that the use of pedagogically motivated grammatical features (e.g., passive voice, rather than the number of words per sentence) can improve readability measures based on lexical features alone.",
        "One of the differences between L1 and L2 readability is the timeline and processes by which first and second languages are acquired.",
        "First language acquisition begins at infancy, and the primary grammatical structures of the target language are acquired by age four in typically developing children (Bates, 2003).",
        "That is, most grammar is acquired prior to the beginning of a child's formal education.",
        "Therefore, most grammatical features seen at high reading levels such as high school are present with similar frequencies at low reading levels such as grades 1-3 that correspond to elementary school-age children.",
        "It should be noted that sentence length is one grammar-related difference that can be observed as L1 reading level increases.",
        "Sentences are kept short in texts for low L1 reading levels in order to reduce the cognitive load on child readers.",
        "The average sentence length of texts increases with the age and reading level of the intended audience.",
        "This phenomenon has been utilized in early readability measures (Flesch, 1948).",
        "Vocabulary change, however, continues even into adulthood, and has been shown to be a more effective predictor of L1 readability than simpler measures such as sentence length (Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2005).",
        "Second language learners, unlike their L1 counterparts, are still very much in the process of acquiring the grammar of their target language.",
        "In fact, even intermediate and advanced students of second languages, who correspond to higher L2 reading levels, often struggle with the grammatical structures of their target language.",
        "This phenomenon suggests that grammatical features may play a more important role in predicting and measuring L2 readability.",
        "That is not to say, however, that vocabulary cannot be used to predict L2 reading levels.",
        "Second language learners are learning both vocabulary and grammar concurrently, and reading materials for this population are chosen or authored according to both lexical and grammatical complexity.",
        "Therefore, the authors predict that a readability measure for texts intended for second language learners that incorporates both grammatical and lexical features could clearly outperform a measure based on only one of these two types of features.",
        "This paper begins with descriptions of the language modeling and grammar-based prediction systems.",
        "A description of the experiments follows that covers both the evaluation metrics and corpora used.",
        "Experimental results are presented, followed by a discussion of these results, and a summary of the conclusions of this work.",
        "2 Language Model Readability Prediction for First Language Texts",
        "Statistical language modeling exploits patterns of use in language.",
        "To build a statistical model of text, training examples are used to collect statistics such as word frequency and order.",
        "Each training example has a label that tells the model the 'true' category of the example.",
        "In this approach, one statistical model is built for each grade level to be predicted.",
        "The statistical language modeling approach has several advantages over traditional readability formulas, which are usually based on linear regression with two or three variables.",
        "First, a language modeling approach generally gives much better accuracy for Web documents and short passages (Collins-Thompson and Callan, 2004).",
        "Second, language modeling provides a probability distribution across all grade models, not just a single prediction.",
        "Third, language modeling provides more data on the relative difficulty of each word in the document.",
        "This might allow an application, for example, to provide more accurate vocabulary assistance.",
        "The statistical model used for this study is based on a variation of the multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.",
        "For a given text passage T, the semantic difficulty of T relative to a specific grade level Gi is predicted by calculating the likelihood that the words of T were generated from a representative language model of G .",
        "This likelihood is calculated for each of a number of language models, corresponding to reading difficulty levels.",
        "The reading difficulty of the passage is then estimated as the grade level of the language model most likely to have generated the passage T.",
        "The language models employed in this work are simple: they are based on unigrams and assume that the probability of a token is independent of the surrounding tokens.",
        "A unigram language model is simply defined by a list of types (words) and their individual probabilities.",
        "Although this is a weak model, it can be effectively trained from less labeled data than more complex models, such as bigram or trigram models.",
        "Additionally, higher order n-gram models might capture grammatical as well as lexical differences.",
        "The relative contributions of grammatical and lexical features were thus better distinguished by using unigram language models that more exclusively focus on lexical differences.",
        "In this language modeling approach, a generative model is assumed for a passage T, in which a hypothetical author generates the tokens of T by:",

        "3.",
        "Sampling ITI tokens from G/s multinomial word distribution according to the 'na√Øve' assumption that each token is independent of all other tokens in the passage, given the language model G .",
        "These assumptions lead to the following expression for the probability of T being generated by language model G according to a multinomial distribution:",
        "Next, according to Bayes' Theorem:",
        "Substituting (1) into (2), taking logarithms, and simplifying produces:",
        "where V is the list of all types in the passage T, w is a type in V, and C(w) is the number of tokens with type w in T. For simplicity, the factor R represents the contribution of the prior P(G ), and S represents the contribution of the passage length ITI, given the grade level.",
        "Two further assumptions are made to simplify the illustration:",
        "1.",
        "That all grades are equally likely a priori.",
        "where NG is the number of grade levels.",
        "For example, if there are 12 grade levels, then NG = 12.",
        "This allows log R to be ignored.",
        "2.",
        "That all passage lengths (up to a maximum length M) are equally likely.",
        "This allows log S to be ignored.",
        "These may be poor assumptions in a real application, but they can be easily included or excluded in the model as desired.",
        "The log C(w)!",
        "term can also be ignored because it is constant across levels.",
        "Under these conditions, an extremely simple form for the grade likelihood remains.",
        "In order to find which model G maximizes Equation (3), the model which G that maximizes the following equation must be found:",
        "This is straightforward to compute: for each token in the passage T, the log probability of the token according to the language model of G is calculated.",
        "Summing the log probabilities of all tokens produces the overall likelihood of the passage, given the grade.",
        "The grade level with the maximum likelihood is then chosen as the final readability level prediction.",
        "This study employs a slightly more sophisticated extension of this model, in which a sliding window is moved across the text, with a grade prediction being made for each window.",
        "This results in a distribution of grade predictions.",
        "The grade level corresponding to a given percentile of this distribution is chosen as the prediction for the entire document.",
        "The values used in these experiments for the percentile thresholds for L1 and L2 were chosen by accuracy on held-out data.",

        "The following sections describe the approach to predicting readability based on grammatical features.",
        "As with any classifier, two components are required to classify texts by their reading level: first, a definition for and method of identifying features; second, an algorithm for using these features to classify a given text.",

        "Once a document is parsed, the predictor uses Tgrep2 (Rohde, 2005), a tree structure searching tool, to identify instances of the target patterns.",
        "A Tgrep2 pattern defines dominance, sisterhood, precedence, and other relationships between nodes in the parse tree for a sentence.",
        "A pattern can also place constraints on the terminal symbols (e.g., words and punctuation), such that a pattern might require a form of the copula \"be\" to exist in a certain position in the construction.",
        "An example of a TGrep2 search pattern for the progressive verb tense is the following:",
        "A set of 22 relevant grammatical constructions were identified from grammar textbooks for three different ESL levels (Fuchs et al., 2005).",
        "These grammar textbooks had different authors and publishers than the ones used in the evaluation corpora in order to minimize the chance of experimental results not generalizing beyond the specific materials employed in this study.",
        "The ESL levels correspond to the low-intermediate (hereafter, level 3), high-intermediate (level 4), and advanced (level 5) courses at the University of Pittsburgh's English Language Institute.",
        "The constructions identified in these grammar textbooks were then implemented in the form of Tgrep2 patterns.",
        "Searching for this pattern returns sentences in which a verb phrase (VP) dominates an auxiliary verb (whose symbol begins with VB) as well as another verb phrase, which in turn dominates a verb in gerund form (VBG).",

        "The choice of parser is not essential to the approach, although the accuracy of parsing does play a role in successful identification of certain grammatical patterns.",
        "PCFG scores from the parser were also used to filter out some of the ill-formed text present in the test corpora.",
        "The default training set of Penn Treebank (Marcus et al.",
        "1993) was used for the parser because the domain and style of those texts actually matches fairly well with the domain and style of the texts on which a reading level predictor for second language learners might be used.",

        "Additionally, it is straightforward to calculate a confidence measure with which kNN predictions can be combined with predictions from other classifiers ‚Äì in this case with predictions from the unigram language modeling-based approach described above.",
        "A confidence measure was important in this task because it provided a means with which to combine the grammar-based predictions with the predictions from the language modeling-based predictor while maintaining separate models for each type of feature.",
        "These separate models were maintained to better determine the relative contributions of grammatical and lexical features.",
        "A static linear interpolation of predictions using the two approaches led to only minimal reductions of prediction error, likely because predictions from the poorer performing grammar-based classifier were always given the same weight.",
        "However, with the confidence measures, predictions from the grammar-based classifier could be given more weight when the confidence measure was high, and less weight when the measure was low and the predictions were likely to be inaccurate.",
        "The case-dependent interpolation of prediction values allowed for the effective combination of language modeling- and grammar-based predictions.",
        "The confidence measure employed is the proportion of the k most similar training examples, or nearest neighbors, that agree with the final label chosen for a given test document.",
        "For example, if seven of ten neighbors have the same label, then the confidence score will be 0.6.",
        "The interpolated readability prediction value is calculated as follows:",
        "Li = Llm + CkNN * Lgr, where Lm is the language model-based prediction, Lgr is the grammar-based prediction from the kNN algorithm, and CkNN is the confidence value for the kNN prediction.",

        "First, the correlation coefficient evaluated whether the trends of prediction values matched the trends for human-labeled texts.",
        "Second, the mean squared error of prediction values provided a measure of how correct each of the predictors was on average, penalizing more severe errors more heavily.",
        "Mean square error was used rather than simple accuracy (i.e., number correct divided by sample size) because the task of readability prediction is more akin to regression than classification.",
        "Evaluation measures such as accuracy, precision, and recall are thus less meaningful for readability prediction tasks because they do not capture the fact that an error of 4 levels is more costly than an error of a single level.",
        "A ninefold cross-validation was employed.",
        "The data was first split into ten sets.",
        "One set was used as held-out data for selecting the parameter k for the kNN algorithm and the percentile value for the language modeling predictor, and then the remaining nine were used to evaluate the quality of predictions.",
        "Each of these nine was in turn selected as the test set, and the other eight were used as training data.",

        "The results of this work suggest that grammatical features can play a role in predicting reading difficulty levels for both first and second language texts in English.",
        "Although a vocabulary-based language modeling approach outperformed the grammar-based predictor, an interpolated measure using confidence scores for the grammar-based predictions showed improvement over both individual measures.",
        "Also, grammar appears to play a more important role in second language readability than in first language readability.",
        "Ongoing work aims to improve grammar-based readability by reducing noise in training data, automatically creating larger grammar feature sets, and applying more sophisticated modeling techniques."
