        "When the task is learning new vocabulary, a variety of tests have been developed to measure word learning progress.",
        "Some tests, such as multiple-choice selection of a correct synonym or cloze completion, are relatively passive.",
        "In production tests, on the other hand, students are asked to write or say a short phrase or sentence that uses the word being learned, called the target word, in a specified way.",
        "In one important type of production test, called a definition production test, the subject is asked to describe the meaning of the target word, as they understand it at that point in the session.",
        "The use of such tests has typically required a teacher or researcher to manually score each response by judging its similarity in meaning to the reference definition of the target word.",
        "The resulting scores can then be used to analyze how a person's learning of the word responded to different stimuli, such as seeing the word used in context.",

        "In word learning, for example, one important type of assessment is a definition production test, in which subjects are asked to produce a short definition of the word being learned.",

        "This study describes an effective automatic method for scoring free responses to definition production tests.",

        "creasingly important role in the science and prac- Moreover, if the researcher wanted to test a new hypothesis by examining the responses with respect to a different but related definition, the entire set of responses would have to be manually re-scored against the new target.",
        "Second, manual scoring can often be limited in its ability to detect when partial learning has taken place.",
        "This is due to the basic tradeoff between the sophistication of the graded scoring scale, and the ease and consistency with which human judges can use the scale.",
        "For example, it may be that the subject did not learn the complete meaning of a particular target word, but did learn that this target word had negative connotations.",
        "The usual binary or ternary score would provide no or little indication of such effects.",
        "Finally, because manual scoring almost always must be done off-line after the end of the session, it presents an obstacle to our goal of creating learning systems that can adapt quickly, within a single learning session.",
        "This study describes an effective automated method for assessing word learning by scoring free responses to definition production tests.",
        "The method is flexible: it can be used to analyze a response with respect to whatever reference target(s) the teacher or researcher chooses.",
        "Such a test represents a powerful new tool for language learning research.",
        "It is also a compelling application of human language technologies research on semantic similarity, and we review related work for that area in Section 2.",
        "Our probabilistic model for computing text semantic similarity, described in Section 3, can use both corpus-based and knowledge-based resources.",
        "In Section 4 we describe a new dataset of human definition judgments and use it to measure the effectiveness of the model against other measures of text similarity.",

        "The problem of judging a subject response against a target definition is a type of text similarity problem.",
        "Moreover, it is a text semantic similarity task, since we require more than measuring direct word overlap between the two text fragments.",
        "For example, if the definition of the target word ameliorate is to improve something and the subject response is make it better, the response clearly indicates that the subject knows the meaning of the word, and thus should receive a high score, even though the response and the target definition have no words in common.",
        "Because most responses are short (1 - 10 words) our task falls somewhere between word-word similarity and passage similarity.",
        "There is a broad field of existing work in estimating the semantic similarity of individual words.",
        "This field may be roughly divided into two groups.",
        "First, there are corpus-based measures, which use statistics or models derived from a large training collection.",
        "These require little or no human effort to construct, but are limited in the richness of the features they can reliably represent.",
        "Second, there are knowledge-based measures, which rely on specialized resources such as dictionaries, thesauri, experimental data, WordNet, and so on.",
        "Knowledge-based measures tend to be complementary to a corpus-based approach and emphasize precision in favor of recall.",
        "This is discussed further, along with a good general summary of text semantic similarity work, by (Mihalcea et al., 2006).",
        "Because of the fundamental nature of the semantic similarity problem, there are close connections with other areas of human language technologies such as information retrieval (Salton and Lesk, 1971), text alignment in machine translation (Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005), text summarization (Mani and Maybury, 1999), and textual coherence (Foltz et al., 1998).",
        "Educational applications include automated scoring of essays, surveyed in (Valenti et al., 2003), and assessment of short-answer free-response items (Burstein et al., 1999).",
        "As we describe in Section 3, we use a graph to model relations between words to perform a kind of semantic smoothing on the language models of the subject response and target definition before comparing them.",
        "Several types of relation, such as synonymy and co-occurrence, may be combined to model the interactions between terms.",
        "(Cao et al., 2005) also formulated a term dependency model combining multiple term relations in a language modeling framework, applied to information retrieval.",
        "Our graph-based approach may be viewed as a probabilistic variation on the spreading activation concept, originally proposed for word-word semantic similarity by (Quillian, 1967).",
        "Finally, (Mihalcea et al., 2006) describe a text semantic similarity measure that combines word-word similarities between the passages being compared.",
        "Due to limitations in the knowledge-based similarity measures used, semantic similarity is only estimated between words with the same part-of-speech.",
        "Our graph-based approach can relate words of different types and does not have this limitation.",
        "(Mihalcea et al., 2006) also evaluate their method in terms of paraphrase recognition using binary judgments.",
        "We view our task as somewhat different than paraphrase recognition.",
        "First, our task is not symmetric: we do not expect the target definition to be a paraphrase of the subject's free response.",
        "Second, because we seek sensitive measures of learning, we want to distinguish a range of semantic differences beyond a binary yes/no decision."

        "This model incorporated both corpus-based and knowledge-based resources to compute text semantic similarity.",
        "We measured the effectiveness ofboth our method and LSA compared to cosine and random baselines, using a new corpus of human judgments on definition responses from a language learning experiment.",
        "Our method outperformed the tf.idf cosine similarity baseline in ranking quality and in ability to find high-scoring definitions.",
        "Because LSA and our Markov chain method are based on different approaches and resources, it is difficult to draw definitive conclusions about performance differences between the two methods.",
