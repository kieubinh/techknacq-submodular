        "We propose to use a statistical phrase-based machine translation system in a post-editing task: the system takes as input raw machine translation output (from a commercial rule-based MT system), and produces post-edited target-language text.",
        "We report on experiments that were performed on data collected in precisely such a setting: pairs of raw MT output and their manually post-edited versions.",
        "In our evaluation, the output of our automatic post-editing (APE) system is not only better quality than the rule-based MT (both in terms of the BLEU and TER metrics), it is also better than the output of a state-of-the-art phrase-based MT system used in standalone translation mode.",
        "These results indicate that automatic post-editing constitutes a simple and efficient way of combining rule-based and statistical MT technologies."

      "text": [
        "The quality of machine translation (MT) is generally considered insufficient for use in the field without a significant amount of human correction.",
        "In the translation world, the term post-editing is often used to refer to the process of manually correcting MT output.",
        "While the conventional wisdom is that postediting MT is usually not cost-efficient compared to full human translation, there appear to be situations where it is appropriate and even profitable.",
        "Unfortunately, there are few reports in the literature about such experiences (but see Allen (2004) for examples).",
        "One of the characteristics of the post-editing task, as opposed to the revision of human translation for example, is its partly repetitive nature.",
        "Most MT systems invariably produce the same output when confronted with the same input; in particular, this means that they tend to make the same mistakes over and over again, which the post-editors must correct repeatedly.",
        "Batch corrections are sometimes possible when multiple occurrences of the same mistake appear in the same document, but when it is repeated over several documents, or equivalently, when the output of the same machine translation system is handled by multiple post-editors, then the opportunities for factoring corrections become much more complex.",
        "MT users typically try to reduce the post-editing load by customizing their MT systems.",
        "However, in Rule-based Machine Translation (RBMT), which still constitutes the bulk of the current commercial offering, customization is usually restricted to the development of \"user dictionaries\".",
        "Not only is this time-consuming and expensive, it can only fix a subset of the MT system's problems.",
        "The advent of Statistical Machine Translation, and most recently phrase-based approaches (PBMT, see Marcu and Wong (2002), Koehn et al.",
        "(2003)) into the commercial arena seems to hold the promise of a solution to this problem: because the MT system learns directly from existing translations, it can be automatically customized to new domains and tasks.",
        "However, the success of this operation crucially depends on the amount of training data available.",
        "Moreover, the current state of the technology is still insufficient for consistently producing human readable translations.",
        "This state of affairs has prompted some to examine the possibility of automating the post-editing process itself, at least as far as \"repetitive errors\" are concerned.",
        "Allen and Hogan (2000) sketch the outline of such an automated post-editing (APE) system, which would automatically learn post-editing rules from a tri-parallel corpus of source, raw MT and post-edited text.",
        "Elming (2006) suggests using tranformation-based learning to automatically acquire error-correcting rules from such data; however, the proposed method only applies to lexical choice errors.",
        "Knight and Chander (1994) also argue in favor of using a separate APE module, which is then portable across multiple MT systems and language pairs, and suggest that the post-editing task could be performed using statistical machine translation techniques.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, however, this idea has never been implemented.",
        "In this paper, we explore the idea of using a PBMT system as an automated post-editor.",
        "The underlying intuition is simple: if we collect a parallel corpus of raw machine-translation output, along with its human-post-edited counterpart, we can train the system to translate from the former into the latter.",
        "In section 2, we present the case study that motivates our work and the associated data.",
        "In section 3, we describe the phrase-based post-editing model that we use for improving the output of the automatic translation system.",
        "In section 4, we illustrate this on a dataset of moderate size containing job ads and their translation.",
        "With less than 500k words of training material, the phrase-based MT system already outperforms the rule-based MT baseline.",
        "However, a phrase-based post-editing model trained on the output of that baseline outperforms both by a fairly consistent margin.",
        "The resulting BLEU score increases by up to 50% (relative) and the TER is cut by one third."

        "The Canadian government's department of Human Resources and Social Development (HRSDC) maintains a web site called Job Bank, where potential employers can post ads for open positions in Canada.",
        "Over one million ads are posted on Job Bank every year, totalling more than 180 million words.",
        "By virtue of Canada's Official Language Act, HRSDC is under legal obligation to post all ads in both French and English.",
        "In practice, this means that ads submitted in English must be translated into French, and vice-versa.",
        "To address this task, the department has put together a complex setup, involving text databases, translation memories, machine translation and human post-editing.",
        "Employers submit ads to the Job Bank website by means of HTML forms containing \"free text\" data fields.",
        "Some employers do periodical postings of identical ads; the department therefore maintains a database of previously posted ads, along with their translations, and new ads are systematically checked against this database.",
        "The translation of one third of all ads posted on the Job Bank is actually recuperated this way.",
        "Also, employers will often post ads which, while not entirely identical, still contain identical sentences.",
        "The department therefore also maintains a translation memory of individual sentence pairs from previously posted ads; another third of all text is typically found verbatim in this way.",
        "The remaining text is submitted to machine translation, and the output is post-edited by human experts.",
        "Overall, only a third of all submitted text requires human intervention.",
        "This is nevertheless very labour-intensive, as the department tries to ensure that ads are posted at most 24 hours after submission.",
        "The Job Bank currently employs as many as 20 post-editors working full-time, most of whom are junior translators.",
        "HRSDC kindly provided us with a sample of data from the Job Bank.",
        "This corpus consists in a collection of parallel \"blocks\" of textual data.",
        "Each block contains three parts: the source language text, as submitted by the employer, its machine-translation, produced by a commercial rule-based MT system, and its final post-edited version, as posted on the website.",
        "The entire corpus contains less than one million words in each language.",
        "This corresponds to the data processed in less than a week by the Job Bank.",
        "Basic statistics are given in Table 1 (see Section 4.1).",
        "Most blocks contain only one sentence, but some blocks may contain many sentences.",
        "The longest block contains 401 tokens over several sentences.",
        "Overall, blocks are quite short: the median number of tokens per source block is only 9 for French-to-English and 7 for English-to-French.",
        "As a consequence, no effort was made to segment the blocks further for processing.",
        "We evaluated the quality of the Machine Translation contained in the corpus using the Translation",
        "TER counts the number of edit operations, including phrasal shifts, needed to change a hypothesis translation into an adequate and fluent sentence, and normalised by the length of the final sentence.",
        "Note that this closely corresponds to the post-editing operation performed on the Job Bank application.",
        "This motivates the choice of TER as the main metric in our case, although we also report BLEU scores in our experiments.",
        "Note that the emphasis of our work is on reducing the post-edition effort, which is well estimated by TER.",
        "It is not directly on quality so the question of which metric better estimates translation quality is not so relevant here.",
        "for French-to-English and 53.33% for English-to-French.",
        "This means that more than half the words have to be post-edited in some way (delete / substitute / insert / shift).",
        "This apparently harsh result is somewhat mitigated by two factors.",
        "First, the distribution of the block-based TERshows a large disparity in performance, cf.",
        "Figure 1.",
        "About 12% of blocks have a TER higher than 100%: this is because the TER normalises on the length of the references, and if the raw MT output is longer than its post-edited counterpart, then the number of edit operations may be larger than that length.",
        "At the other end of the spectrum, it is also clear that many blocks have low TER.",

        "The second factor is that the TER measures the distance to an adequate and fluent result.",

      "text": [
        "Translation post-editing can be viewed as a simple transformation process, which takes as input raw target-language text coming from a MT system, and produces as output target-language text in which \"errors\" have been corrected.",
        "While the automation of this process can be envisaged in many different ways, the task is not conceptually very different from the translation task itself.",
        "Therefore, there doesn't seem to be any good reason why a machine translation system could not handle the post-editing task.",
        "In particular, given such data as described in Section 2.2, the idea of using a statistical MT system for post-editing is appealing.",
        "Portage is precisely such a system, which we describe here.",
        "Portage is a phrase-based, statistical machine translation system, developed at the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) (Sadat et al., 2005).",
        "A version of the Portage system is made available by the NRC to Canadian universities for research and education purposes.",
        "Like other SMT systems, it learns to translate from existing parallel corpora.",
        "The system translates text in three main phases: preprocessing of raw data into tokens; decoding to produce one or more translation hypotheses; and error-driven rescoring to choose the best final hypothesis.",
        "For languages such as French and English, the first of these phases (tokenization) is mostly a straightforward process; we do not describe it any further here.",
        "Decoding is the central phase in SMT, involving a search for the hypotheses t that have highest probabilities of being translations of the current source sentence s according to a model for P(t|s).",
        "Portage implements a dynamic programming beam search decoding algorithm similar to that of Koehn (2004), in which translation hypotheses are constructed by combining in various ways the target-language part of phrase pairs whose source-language part matches the input.",
        "These phrase pairs come from large phrase tables constructed by collecting matching pairs of contiguous text segments from word-aligned bilingual corpora.",
        "Portage's model for P(t|s) is a log-linear combination of four main components: one or more n-gram target-language models, one or more phrase translation models, a distortion (word-reordering) model, and a sentence-length feature.",
        "The phrase-based translation model is similar to that of Koehn, with the exception that phrase probability estimates P(s|i) are smoothed using the Good-Turing technique (Foster et al., 2006).",
        "The distortion model is also very similar to Koehn's, with the exception of a final cost to account for sentence endings.",
        "Feature function weights in the loglinear model are set using Och's minium error rate algorithm (Och, 2003).",
        "This is essentially an iterative two-step process: for a given set ofsource sentences, generate n-best translation hypotheses, that are representative of the entire decoding search space; then, apply a variant of Powell's algorithm to find weights that optimize the BLEU score over these hypotheses, compared to reference translations.",
        "This process is repeated until the set of translations stabilizes, i.e. no new translations are produced at the decoding step.",
        "To improve raw output from decoding, Portage relies on a rescoring strategy: given a list of n-best translations from the decoder, the system reorders this list, this time using a more elaborate loglinear model, incorporating more feature functions, in addition to those of the decoding model: these typically include IBM-1 and IBM-2 model probabilities (Brown et al., 1993) and an IBM-1-based feature function designed to detect whether any word in one language appears to have been left without satisfactory translation in the other language; all of these feature functions can be used in both language directions, i.e. source-to-target and target-to-source.",
        "In the experiments reported in the next section, the Portage system is used both as a translation and as an APE system.",
        "While we can think of a number of modifications to such a system to better adapt it to the post-editing task (some of which are discussed later on), we have done no such modifications to the system.",
        "In fact, whether the system is used for translation or post-editing, we have used exactly the same translation model configuration and training procedure."

        "Considering that these would normally have been handled by the translation memory component (see the HRSDC workflow description in Section 2.1), we removed those blocks for which the source part was already found in the training set (in either train-1 or train-2), hence their smaller sizes.",
        "In order to check the sensitivity of experimental results to the choice of the train-2 set, we did a run of preliminary experiments using different subsets of 1000 blocks.",

        "In other words, the translation system is apparently already making the best possible use of the training data, and additional layers do not help (but nor do they hurt, interestingly).",
        "However, when the translation system has been trained using distinct data (Portage Hansard + Portage APE experiments), post-editing makes a large difference, comparable to that observed with the rule-based MT output provided with the Job Bank data.",
        "In this case, however, the Portage translation system behaves very poorly in spite of the important size of the training set for this system, much worse in fact than the \"baseline\" system.",

        "As mentioned earlier, Portage allows using multiple phrase translation tables and language models concurrently.",
        "For example, in the current context, we can extract phrase tables and language models from the Job Bank data, as when training the \"Portage Job Bank\" translation system, and then build a Portage translation model using both the Hansard and Job Bank model components.",
        "Loglinear model parameters are then optimized on the Job Bank data, so as to find the model weights that best fit the new domain.",
        "In a straightforward implementation of this idea, we obtained performances almost identical to those of the Portage translation system trained solely on Job Bank data.",
        "Upon closer examination of the model parameters, we observed that Hansard model components (language model, phrase tables, IBM translation models) were systematically attributed negligeable weights.",
        "Again, the amount of training material for the new domain may be critical in chos-ing between alternative adaptation mechanisms."

        "We have proposed using a phrase-based MT system to automatically post-edit the output of another MT system, and have tested this idea with the Portage MT system on the Job Bank data set, a corpus of manually post-edited French-English machine translations.",
        "In our experiments, not only does phrase-based APE significantly improve the quality of the output translations, this approach outperforms a standalone phrase-based translation system.",
        "While these results are very encouraging, the learning curves of Figure 2 suggest that the output quality of the PBMT systems increases faster than that of the APE systems as more data is used for training.",
        "So while the combination strategy clearly performs better with limited amounts of training data, there is reason to believe that, given sufficient training data, it would eventually be outperformed by a direct phrase-based translation strategy.",
        "Of course, this remains to be verified empirically, something which will obviously require more data than is currently available to us.",
        "But this sort of behavior is expectable: while both types of system improve as more training data is used, inevitably some details of the source text will be lost by the front-end MT system, which the APE system will never be able to retrieve.",
        "Ultimately, the APE system will be weighted down by the inherent limitations of the front-end MT system.",
        "One way around this problem would be to modify the APE system so that it not only uses the baseline MT output, but also the source-language input.",
        "In the Portage system, this could be achieved, for example, by introducing feature functions into the log-linear model that relate target-language phrases with the source-language text.",
        "This is one research avenue that we are currently exploring.",
        "Alternatively, we could combine these two inputs differently within Portage: for example, use the source-language text as the primary input, and use the raw MT output as a secondary source.",
        "In this perspective, if we have multiple MT systems available, nothing precludes using all of them as providers of secondary inputs.",
        "In such a setting, the phrase-based system becomes a sort of combination MT system.",
        "We intend to explore such alternatives in the near future as well."
