        "Question answering (QA) systems are emerging as a viable means of obtaining specific information in the face of large availability.",
        "Answer typing is an important part of QA because it allows the system to greatly reduce the number of potential answers, using general knowledge of the answer form for a specific question.",
        "For example, for what, where, and who questions like \"What is the capital of Canada?",
        "\", answer typing can filter the phrases which might be proposed as candidate answers, perhaps only identifying those textual entities known to be cities.",
        "We focus on answer typing for how-questions, a subset of questions which have received little specific attention in the QA community.",
        "Rather than seeking an open-ended noun or verb phrase, how-questions often seek a numerical measurement expressed in terms of a certain kind of unit, as in the following example:",
        "Example 1: \"How heavy is a grizzly bear?\"",
        "An answer typing system might expect answers to include units like kilograms, pounds, or tons.",
        "Entities with inappropriate units, such as feet, meters, or honey pots, would be excluded as candidate answers.",
        "We specifically handle the subset of how-questions that we call how-adjective questions; that is, questions of the form \"How adjective...??\"",
        "such as Example 1.",
        "In particular, we do not address \"how many\" questions, which usually specify the units directly following many, nor \"how much\" questions, which generally seek a monetary value.",
        "Hand-crafting a comprehensive list of units appropriate to many different adjectives is time-consuming and likely to miss important units.",
        "For example, an annotator might miss gigabytes for a measure of \"how large.\"",
        "Instead of compiling a list manually, we propose a means ofautomatically generating lists of appropriate units for a number of real-world questions.",
        "How-adjective questions represent a significant portion of queries sent to search engines; of the 35 million queries in the AOL search query data set (Pass et al., 2006), over 11,000 are of the form \"how adjective..\" - close to one in every three thousand queries.",
        "Of those 11,000 queries, 152 different adjectives are used, ranging from the expected \"how old\" and \"how far\" to the obscure \"how orwellian.\"",
        "This high proportion of queries is especially striking given that search engines provide little support for answering how-adjective questions.",
        "Indeed, most IR systems work by keyword matching.",
        "Entering Example 1 into a search engine returns documents discussing the grizzly's \"heavy fur,\" \"heavy, shaggy coat\" and \"heavy stout body.\"",
        "When faced with such results, a smart search engine user knows to inject answer units into their query to refine their search, perhaps querying \"grizzly pounds.\"",
        "They may also convert their adjective (heavy) to a related concept (weight), for the query \"grizzly weight.\"",
        "Similarly, our approach discovers unit types by first converting the adjective to a related concept, using information in a structured ontology.",
        "For example, \"big\" can be used to obtain \"size,\" and \"tall\" can derive \"height.\"",
        "We then use an online search engine to automatically find units appropriate to the concept, given the assumption that the concept is explicitly measured in terms of specific units, e.g., height can be measured in feet, weight can be measured in pounds, and size can be measured in gigabytes.",
        "By automatically extracting units, we do not require a set of prior questions with associated answers.",
        "Instead, we use actual questions as a source of realistic adjectives only.",
        "This is important because while large sets of existing questions can be obtained (Li and Roth, 2002), there are many fewer questions with available answers.",
        "Our experiments demonstrate that how-question-specific unit lists consistently achieve higher answer identification performance than fixed-type, generalpurpose answer typing (which propose all numerical entities as answer candidates).",
        "Furthermore, our precomputed, automatically-generated unit lists are shown to consistently achieve better performance than baseline systems which derive unit lists at runtime from documents relevant to the answer query, even when such documents are gathered using perfect knowledge of the answer distribution.",
        "The outline of the paper is as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we outline related work.",
        "In Section 3 we provide the framework of our answer-typing model.",
        "Section 4 describes the implementation details of the model.",
        "Section 5 describes our experimental methodology, while Section 6 shows the benefits of using automatic how-question answer-typing.",
        "We conclude with possible directions of future research opened by this novel problem formulation."

        "Answer typing is an important component of any QA system, but varies greatly in the approach taken (Prager et al., 2003; Harabagiu et al., 2005).",
        "Basically, answer typing provides a means of filtering answer candidates as either appropriate or inappropriate to the question.",
        "For example, Li and Roth (2002) assign one of fifty possible types to a question based on features present in the question.",
        "Answer candidates can then be selected from text by finding entities whose type matches that of the input question.",
        "Similarly, Ittycheriah et al.",
        "(2000) assign one of the MUC named-entity types to each input question.",
        "In these fixed-category approaches, how-questions are assigned a fixed type in the same manner as other questions.",
        "For how-questions, this corresponds to a numerical type.",
        "However, retrieving all numerical entities will provide lower answer identification precision than a system that only provides those specified with the expected answer units.",
        "Pinchak and Lin (2006) propose a dynamic answer typing system which computes a unique score for the appropriateness of any word to a particular question.",
        "Unfortunately, their question context-mapping is limited to what, where, and who questions, and thus is not defined for how-questions.",
        "Wu et al.",
        "(2005) handle how-questions differently than other questions.",
        "They use special hand-crafted rules to assign a particular answer target during the answer typing phase.",
        "In this way, they take advantage of the structure inherent in how-questions rather than just treating them as general queries.",
        "However, manually hand-crafting types is costly, and would have to be repeated if the system was moved to a new language or a new query domain.",
        "Our automatic approach does not suffer from this drawback.",
        "Light et al.",
        "(2001) showed that for a small fixed set of answer types, multiple words tagged with the same type will exist even with perfect passage retrieval, sentence retrieval, and type assignment.",
        "For example, Example 1 may be answered with a sentence such as \"bears range in weight from the smaller black bear at 400 pounds to the gigantic grizzly at over 1200 pounds\" in which two answers have appropriate units but only one of which is correct.",
        "We provide results in Section 6 confirming the limits of answer typing at narrowing answer focus, using varying levels of perfect information.",
        "Our approach makes use of the web as a large corpus of useful information.",
        "Exploiting the vast amount of data on the web is part of a growing trend in Natural Language Processing (Keller and Lapata, 2003).",
        "Indeed, many QA systems have been developed using the web (to varying degrees) to assist in finding a correct answer (Brill et al., 2001; Cucerzan and Agichtein, 2005; Radev et al., 2001), as the web is the largest available corpus even if its information can be difficult to harness.",
        "Rather than relying on the web to find the answer to a question, we rely on it as a source of information on appropriate units only.",
        "Should the domain of the question answering system change from general factoid questions, units may be extracted from a smaller, domain-specific corpus."

      "text": [
        "The objective of our model is to create a list of relevant units for an adjective that may be found in a how-question.",
        "We wish to create these lists a priori and off-line so that they are applicable to future questions.",
        "Although the model described here can be applied on-line at the time of question answering, the resources and time required make off-line generation of unit lists the preferred approach.",
        "We wish to automatically learn a mapping",
        "in which is a set of adjectives derived from how-questions and is a set of lists of units associated with these adjectives.",
        "For example, an element of this mapping might be:",
        "high feet, meter, foot, inches, ...",
        "which assigns height measurements to \"how high\" questions.",
        "Inducing this mapping means establishing a connection, or co-occurrence, between each adjective and its units .",
        "In the following subsections, we show how to establish this connection.",
        "In common documents, such as news articles or web pages, the co-occurrence of an adjective and its units may be unlikely.",
        "For example, the cooccurrence between \"heavy\" and \"pounds\" may not be as prevalent as the co-occurrence between \"weight\" and \"pounds.\"",
        "We therefore propose using WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) to expand the how-adjective to a set of related concepts the adjective may be used to describe.",
        "We denote a related concept of as .",
        "In the above example, \"heavy\" can be used to describe a \"weight.\"",
        "Two useful WordNet relations are the attribute relation, in which the adjective is an attribute of the concept, and in cases where no attribute exists, the derivationally-related words.",
        "\"Heavy\" is an attribute of \"weight\" whereas the derivationally-related form is \"heaviness,\" a plausible but less useful concept.",
        "Next we describe how the particular co-occurrence of the related concept r and unit is obtained.",
        "We selected the Google search engine as a source of co-occurrence data due to the large number of indexed documents from which co-occurrence counts can be derived.",
        "To further enhance the quality of co-occurrence data, we search on the specific phrase \" is measured in\" in which is one of the related concepts of .",
        "This allows for the simultaneous discovery of unknown units and the retrieval of their co-occurrence counts.",
        "Sentences in which the pattern occurs are parsed using Minipar (Lin, 1998b) so that we can obtain the word related to \"measured\" via the prepositional in relation.",
        "This allows us to handle sentential constructions that may intervene between \"measured\" and a meaningful unit.",
        "For each unit that is related to \"measured\" via in, we increment the co-occurrence count , thereby collecting frequency counts for each with .",
        "The pattern's precision prevents incidental cooccurrence between a related concept and some unit that may occur simply because of the general topic of the document.",
        "For example, \"size is measured in\" matches \"Size is measured in gigabytes, and performance is measured in milliseconds\".",
        "In this example, the co-occurrence count gigabytes size would be incremented by one, whereas there is no co-occurrence between \"size\" and \"milliseconds.\"",
        "Due to the large amount of data available to Google, we can afford to restrict ourselves to a single pattern and still expect to find meaningful units.",
        "To gather the co-occurrence counts between an adjective a and a unit u, we first expand a to the set of related concepts and then compute:",
        "These frequencies can then be used by the scoring functions described in the following section.",
        "For a given adjective a and a particular unit u with co-occurrence f(u, a), we define two important statistics:",
        "The first equation measures the likelihood of a unit being an answer unit for a how-question with the given adjective .",
        "The second equation measures, for a given unit , how likely a how question with adjective asked the question answered by .",
        "The second measure is particularly useful in cases where a unit co-occurs with a number of different adjectives.",
        "These units are inherently less useful for answer typing.",
        "For example, if the word \"terms\" occurs on the unit list of adjectives such as \"high,\" \"long,\" and \"heavy,\" it may indicate that \"terms\" is not an appropriate measure for any of these concepts, but rather just a word likely to co-occur with nouns that can be measured.",

        "of the unit over all unit lists.",
        "Using these measures, we can create a unit list for an adjective as in which is the score of unit with adjective (either or ) and is some threshold imposed to deal with the amount of noise present in the co-occurrence data.",
        "This threshold allows us to vary the required strength of the association between the unit and the question in order to consider the unit as appropriate to the how-adjective.",
        "In Section 6, we demonstrate this flexibility by showing how answer identification precision and recall can be traded off as desired by the given application.",

      "text": [
        "An initial step in implementing answer typing for how-adjective questions is to decide which adjectives would benefit from types.",
        "WordNet gives a set of all adjectives, but providing answer type units for all these adjectives is unnecessary and potentially misleading.",
        "Many adjectives would clearly never occur in a how-adjective query (i.e., \"how vehicular...?",
        "\"), and even some that do, like the \"how orwellian\" query mentioned above, are difficult to quantify.",
        "For these, a simple search with keyword matching as in typical information retrieval would be preferable.",
        "We have a two-stage process for identifying unit-typable how-adjectives.",
        "First, we examine the AOL query data (Pass et al., 2006) and extract as candidates all 152 adjectives that occur with the pattern \"how adjective is/are/was/were.\"",
        "Second, we filter adjectives that do not have a related concept in WordNet (Section 3.1).",
        "We built unit lists for the 104 adjectives that remained.",
        "Given that both the query database and WordNet may lack information, it is important to consider the coverage of actual how-adjective questions that unit lists collected this way may have.",
        "Reassuringly, experiments have shown 100% coverage of the 96 adjectives in our development and test question set, taken from the TREC QA corpus (see Section 5).",
        "Unfortunately, we found that search results obtained using the pattern described in Section 3.2 do not produce a wide variety of units.",
        "Web pages often do not use a slang term when mentioning the unit of measurement; a search for \"size is measured in gigs\" on Google returns zero pages.",
        "Also, searching with Google's API and obtaining relevant documents can be time consuming, and we must limit the number of pages considered.",
        "Thus, there is strong motivation to expand the list of units obtained from Google by automatically considering similar units.",
        "We gather similar units from an automatically-constructed thesaurus of distributionally similar words (Lin, 1998a).",
        "The similar word expansion can add a term like gigs as a unit for size by virtue of its association with gigabytes, which is on the original list.",
        "Unit similarity can be thought of as a mapping in which is a set of units and is sets of related units.",
        "If is an element of for a particular adjective , the mapping gives us a way to add new words to the unit list for .",
        "For example, the similar word list for \"gigabytes\" might be {GB, megabytes, kilobytes, KB, byte, GHz, gigs... }, which can all be added to the unit list for the adjective \"large.\"",
        "After expanding each element of the unit list for adjective a, we have a new set of units Wa:",
        "where .",
        "For each there is an associated score",
        "that measures how similar is to u.",
        "We define the score of units that do not co-occur on similar word lists to be zero and the similarity of two identical units to be one.",
        "We can then use these scores to assign estimated co-occurrence counts for any unit w in the expanded unit list Wa:",
        "If a unit also occurs in the set of expanded similar units for another another unit , that is, , then the original co-occurrence freby the similarity-weighted frequency of on the expanded unit list of , .",
        "For a given how-adjective question and a document of interest, we use a two-stage process to identify the entities in the document that are suitable answers for the question.",
        "First, the named entity recognizer of Minipar is used to identify all numerical entities in text, labeled as NUM.",
        "Minipar labels times, dates, monetary amounts, and address numbers with types other than NUM and so we can correctly exclude these from consideration.",
        "We then inspect the context of all NUM entities to see if a unit exists on the precomputed unit list for the given how-adjective.",

        "For example, although manual typing remains an option, our approach can at least provide a good set of candidate units to consider.",
        "Furthermore, a similar-word database can expand the list obtained by manual typing.",
        "Finally, users may also wish to rank the manual types in some way, and thus configure the system for a particular level of answer-identification precision/recall.",
        "Our success with these unit lists has encouraged two main directions of future work.",
        "First, we plan to move to a discriminative approach to combining scores and weighting unit features using a small labeled set.",
        "Secondly, we will look at incorporating units into the information retrieval process.",
        "Our motivating example in Section 1 retrieved irrelevant documents when given to a search engine, and this seems to be a general trend in how-question IR.",
        "Less than 60% of the TREC how-questions have a unit of the correct type anywhere in the top ten documents returned by the PRISE IR engine, and less than half correspondingly had a correct answer in the top ten at all.",
        "Making the information retrieval process aware of the desired answer types will be an important future direction of QA research."
