        "The videoOCR technique consists of four important steps: text detection, binarization, frame tracking, and OCR.",
        "The goal of text detection is to locate the text area precisely.",
        "In this paper, we employ the edge-based filtering (Lyu et al., 2005) and slightly modify the coarse-to-fine top-down block segmentation methods (Lienhart and Wernicke, 2002) to find each text component in a frame.",

        "There are three parameters: 1, a1; a2, in our ranking algorithm.",
        "1 controls the weight of the QW_Density(Q, P), while a1; and a2 were set for the power of subsequence length and the distance measurement.",
        "We randomly select 100 questions for parameter validations.",
        "Firstly, we tried to verify the optimal a1 via different settings of the remaining two parameters.",
        "The best a1 is then set to verify a2 via various 1 values.",
        "The optimal 1 is subsequently confirmed through the observed a1 and a2 values.",
        "Figure 5, 6, 7 show the performance evaluations of different settings for the three parameters.",
        "As shown in Figure 5, the optimal settings of (a1=1.25) is obtained when and a2=0.25, and 1=0.75.",
        "When a1 is set more than 1.5, our method quickly decreased.",
        "In this experiment, we also found that large a2 negatively affects the performance.",
        "The small a2 values often lead to better ranking performance.",
        "Thus, in the next experiment, we limited the a2 value in 0.0-3.0.",
        "As seeing in Figure 6, again the abnormal high or zero a2 values give the poor results.",
        "This implies the overweight and no-weight on the distance measurement (equation (7)) is not useful.",
        "Instead, a small a2 value yields to improve the performance.",
        "In our experiment, a2=0.25 is quite effective.",
        "Finally, in Figure 7, we can see that both taking the QW_Density, and QW_Weight into account gives better ranking result, especially QW_Density.",
        "This experiment indicates that the combination of QW_Density and QW_Weight is better than its individual term weighting strategy.",
        "When 1=0.8, the best ranking result (MRR = 0.700) is reached.",
        "Next, we address on the impact of different number of initial retrieved passages using BM-25 ranking models.",
        "Due to the length limitation of this paper, we did not present the experiments over all the compared ranking models, while we left the further results at our web site.",
        "For the three parameters, we select the optimal settings derived from previous experimental results, i.e., 1=0.8, a1=1.25, a2=0.25.",
        "Figure 8 shows the experimental results with different number of initial retrieved passages.",
        "When employing exactly five initial retrieved passages, it can be viewed as the re-ranking improvement over the BM-25 ranking model.",
