        "In addition, since PropBank was designed on a verb-by-verb basis, the argument labels Arg2 - Arg5 get used for very diverse argument roles with inconsistent training instances.",
        "For example, the verb \"make\" uses Arg2 for the \"Material\" argument; but the verb \"multiply\" uses Arg2 for the \"Extent\" argument.",

        "Correctly identifying semantic entities and successfully disambiguating the relations between them and their predicates is an important and necessary step for successful natural language processing applications, such as text summarization, question answering, and machine translation.",
        "For example, in order to determine that question (1a) is answered by sentence (1b), but not by sentence (1c), we must determine the relationships between the relevant verbs (eat and feed) and their arguments.",
        "b.",
        "Recent studies have shown that lobsters primarily feed on live fish, dig for clams, sea urchins, and feed on algae and eel-grass.",
        "c. In the early 20th century, Mainers would only eat lobsters because the fish they caught was too valuable to eat themselves.",
        "An important part of this task is Semantic Role Labeling (SRL), where the goal is to locate the constituents which are arguments of a given verb, and to assign them appropriate semantic roles that describe how they relate to the verb.",
        "Many researchers have investigated applying machine learning to corpus specifically annotated with this task in mind, Prop-Bank, since 2000 (Chen and Rambow, 2003; Gildea and Hockenmaier, 2003; Hacioglu et al., 2003; Mos-chitti, 2004; Yi and Palmer, 2004; Pradhan et al., 2005b; Punyakanok et al., 2005; Toutanova et al., 2005).",
        "For two years, the CoNLL workshop has made this problem the shared task (Carreras and Marquez, 2005).",
        "However, there is still little consensus in the linguistic and NLP communities about what set of role labels are most appropriate.",
        "The Proposition Bank (PropBank) corpus (Palmer et al., 2005) avoids this issue by using theory-agnostic labels (Arg0, Arg1, ..., Arg5), and by defining those labels to have verb-specific meanings.",
        "Under this scheme, PropBank can avoid making any claims about how any one verb's arguments relate to other verbs' arguments, or about general distinctions between verb arguments and adjuncts.",
        "However, there are several limitations to this approach.",
        "The first is that it can be difficult to make inferences and generalizations based on role labels that are only meaningful with respect to a single verb.",
        "Since each role label is verb-specific, we can not confidently determine when two different verbs' arguments have the same role; and since no encoded meaning is associated with each tag, we can not make generalizations across verb classes.",
        "In contrast, the use of a shared set of role labels, such as thematic roles, would facilitate both inferencing and generalization.",
        "The second issue with PropBank's verb-specific approach is that it can make training automatic semantic role labeling (SRL) systems more difficult.",
        "A vast amount of data would be needed to train the verb-specific models that are theoretically mandated by PropBank's design.",
        "Instead, researchers typically build a single model for the numbered arguments (Arg0, Arg1, .",
        ".",
        ".",
        ", Arg5).",
        "This approach works surprisingly well, mainly because an explicit effort was made to use arguments Arg0 and Arg1 consistently across different verbs; and because those two argument labels account for 85% of all arguments.",
        "However, this approach causes the system to conflate different argument types, especially with the highly overloaded arguments Arg2-Arg5.",
        "As a result, these argument labels are quite difficult to learn.",
        "A final difficulty with PropBank's current approach is that it limits SRL system robustness in the face of verb senses, verbs or verb constructions that were not included in the training data, and the training data is all Wall Street Journal corpora.",
        "If a PropBank-trained SRL system encounters a novel verb or verb usage, then there is no way for it to know which role labels are used for which argument types, since role labels are defined so specifically.",
        "This is especially problematic for Arg2-5.",
        "Similarly, PropBank-trained SRL systems can have difficulty generalizing when a known verb is encountered in a novel construction.",
        "These problems can happen quite frequently if the training data comes from a different genre than the test data.",
        "This issue is reflected in the relatively poor performance of most state-of-the-art SRL systems when tested on a novel genre, the Brown corpus, during CoNLL 2005.",
        "For example, the SRL system described in (Pradhan et al., 2005b; Pradhan et al., 2005a) achieves an F-score of 81% when tested on the same genre as it is trained on (WSJ); but that score drops to 68.5% when the same system is tested on a different genre (the Brown corpus).",
        "DARPA-GALE is funding an ongoing effort to PropBank additional genres, but better techniques for generalizing the semantic role labeling task are still needed.",
        "In this paper, we demonstrate an increase in the generality of our semantic role labeling based on a mapping that has been developed between PropBank and another lexical resource, VerbNet.",
        "By taking advantage of VerbNet's more consistent set of labels, we can generate more useful role label annotations with a resulting improvement in SRL performance on novel genres."

        "PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) is an annotation of one million words of the Wall Street Journal portion of the Penn Treebank II (Marcus et al., 1994) with predicate-argument structures for verbs, using semantic role labels for each verb argument.",
        "In order to remain theory neutral, and to increase annotation speed, role labels were defined on a per-verb-sense basis.",
        "Although the same tags were used for all verbs, (namely Arg0, Argl, Arg5), these tags are meant to have a verb-specific meaning.",
        "Thus, the use of a given argument label should be consistent across different uses of that verb, including syntactic alternations.",
        "For example, the Argl (underlined) in \"John broke the window\" is the same window that is annotated as the Argl in \"The window broke\", even though it is the syntactic subject in one sentence and the syntactic object in the other.",
        "However, there is no guarantee that an argument label will be used consistently across different verbs.",
        "For example, the Arg2 label is used to designate the destination of the verb \"bring;\" but the extent of the verb \"rise.\"",
        "Generally, the arguments are simply listed in the order of their prominence for each verb.",
        "However, an explicit effort was made when PropBank was created to use Arg0 for arguments that fulfill Dowty's criteria for \"prototypical agent,\" and Arg1 for arguments that fulfill the criteria for \"prototypical patient.\"",
        "(Dowty, 1991) As a result, these two argument labels are significantly more consistent across verbs than the other three.",

        "The argument list consists of thematic roles (23 in total) and possible selectional restrictions on the arguments expressed using binary predicates.",
        "The syntactic information maps the list of thematic arguments to deep-syntactic arguments (i.e., normalized for voice alternations, and transformations).",
        "The semantic predicates describe the participants during various stages of the event described by the syntactic frame.",
        "The same thematic role can occur in different classes, where it will appear in different predicates, providing a class-specific interpretation of the role.",
        "VerbNet has been extended from the original Levin classes, and now covers 4526 senses for 3769 verbs.",
        "A primary emphasis for VerbNet is the grouping of verbs into classes that have a coherent syntactic and semantic characterization, that will eventually facilitate the acquisition of new class members based on observable syntactic and semantic behavior.",
        "The hierarchical structure and small number of thematic roles is aimed at supporting generalizations.",
        "Because PropBank includes a large corpus of manually annotated predicate-argument data, it can be used to train supervised machine learning algorithms, which can in turn provide PropBank-style annotations for novel or unseen text.",
        "However, as we discussed in the introduction, PropBank's verb-specific role labels are somewhat problematic.",
        "Furthermore, PropBank lacks much of the information that is contained in VerbNet, including information about selectional restrictions, verb semantics, and inter-verb relationships.",
        "We have therefore created a mapping between VerbNet and PropBank (Loper et al., 2007), which will allow us to use the machine learning techniques that have been developed for PropBank annotations to generate more semantically abstract VerbNet representations.",

        "That is the job of the instance classifier, which looks at the word in context, and decides which of the mappings is most appropriate.",
        "In essence, the instance classifier is performing word sense disambiguation, deciding which lexeme from each database is correct for a given occurrence of a word.",
        "In order to train the instance classifier, we semi-automatically annotated each verb in the PropBank corpus with VerbNet class information.",

        "4 Training a SRL system with VerbNet Roles to Achieve Robustness",
        "An important issue for state-of-the-art automatic SRL systems is robustness: although they receive high performance scores when tested on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus, that performance drops significantly when the same systems are tested on a corpus from another genre.",
        "This performance drop reflects the fact that the WSJ corpus is highly specialized, and tends to use genre-specific word senses for many verbs.",
        "The 2005 CoNLL shared task has addressed this issue of robustness by evaluating participating systems on a test set extracted from the Brown corpus, which is very different from the WSJ corpus that was used for training.",
        "The results suggest that there is much work to be done in order to improve system robustness.",
        "One of the reasons that current SRL systems have difficulty deciding which role label to assign to a given argument is that role labels are defined on a per-verb basis.",
        "This is less problematic for Arg0 and Arg1, where a conscious effort was made to be consistent across verbs; but is a significant problem for Args[2-5], which tend to have very verb-specific meanings.",
        "This problem is exacerbated even further on novel genres, where SRL systems are more likely to encounter unseen verbs and uses of arguments that were not encountered in the training data.",
        "By exploiting the mapping between PropBank and VerbNet, we can transform the data to make it more consistent, and to expand the size and variety of the training data.",
        "In particular, we can use the mapping to transform the verb-specific PropBank role labels into the more general thematic role labels that are used by VerbNet.",
