        "Phonological features have received attention as a linguistically-based representation for sub-word information in automatic speech recognition.",
        "These sub-phonetic features allow for a more refined representation of speech by allowing for temporal desyn-chronization between articulators, and help account for some phonological changes common in spontaneous speech, such as devoicing (Kirchhoff, 1999; Livescu, 2005).",
        "A number of methods have been developed for detecting acoustic phonological features and related acoustic landmarks directly from data using Multi-Layer Perceptrons (Kirchhoff, 1999), Support Vector Machines (Hasegawa-Johnson et al., 2005; Sharenborg et al., 2006), or Hidden Markov Models (Li and Lee, 2005).",
        "These techniques typically assume that acoustic phonological feature events are independent for ease ofmodeling.",
        "In one study that broke the independence assumption (Chang et al., 2001), the investigators developed conditional detectors: MLP detectors of acoustic phonological features that are hierarchically dependent on a different phonological class.",
        "In (Ra-jamanohar and Fosler-Lussier, 2005) it was shown that such a conditional training of detectors tended to have correlated frame errors, and that improvements in detection could be obtained by training joint detectors.",
        "For many features, the best detector can be obtained by collapsing MLP phone posteriors into feature classes by marginalizing across phones within a class.",
        "This was shown only for frame-level classification rather than phone recognition.",
        "Posterior estimates of phonological feature classes, as in Table 1, particularly those derived from MLPs, have been used as input to HMMs (Launay et al., 2002), Dynamic Bayesian Networks (DBNs) (Frankel et al., 2004; Livescu, 2005), and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Morris and Fosler-Lussier, 2006).",
        "Here we evaluate phonological feature detectors created from MLP phone posterior estimators (joint feature models) rather than the independently trained MLP feature detectors used in previous work."

        "In NLP applications, the component feature functions Sj and tk are typically realized as binary indicator functions indicating the presence or absence of a feature, but in ASR applications it is more typical to utilize real-valued functions, such as those derived from the sufficient statistics of Gaus-sians (e.g., (Gunawardana et al., 2005)).",
        "We can use posterior estimates of phone classes or phonological feature classes from MLPs as feature functions (inputs) within the CRF model.",
        "A more detailed description of this CRF paradigm can be found in (Morris and Fosler-Lussier, 2006), which shows that the results of phone recognition using CRFs is comparable to that of HMMs or Tandem systems, with fewer constraints being imposed on the model.",
        "State feature functions in our system are defined such that where the MLP output for feature f at time i is NNf (xi).",
        "This allows for an association between a phone 0 and a feature f (even if f is traditionally not associated with 0).",
        "In this study, we experiment with different methods of generating these feature functions.",
        "In various experiments, they are generated by training MLP phone detectors, by evaluating the feature information inherent in the MLP phone posteriors, and by training independent MLPs to detect the various features within the classes described.",
        "The use of CRFs allows us to explore the dependencies among feature classes, as well as the usefulness of phone posteriors versus feature classes as inputs."
