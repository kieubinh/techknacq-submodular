        "The code below is simple to describe (though there are more efficient implementations that avoid unnecessary qsorts).",
        "To find the k-best matches for a particular substring s, we do what we would normally do for standard suffix arrays on lexicographic splits.",

        "The worst case is when the popularity splits always fail, such as when the query string s is not in the corpus.",
        "In this case, we must always check both the popular half and the unpopular half at each split, since the failure to find a lexicographic match in the first tells us nothing about the existence of matches in the second.",
