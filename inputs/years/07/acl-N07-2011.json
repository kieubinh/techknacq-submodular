        "Detecting and adapting to user affect is being explored by many researchers to improve dialogue system quality.",
        "Detection has received much attention (e.g., (Litman and Forbes-Riley, 2004; Lee and Narayanan, 2005)), but less work has been done on adaptation, due to the difficulty of developing responses and applying them at the right time.",
        "Most work on adaptation takes a context-independent approach: use the same type of response after all instances of an affective state.",
        "For example, Liu and Picard (2005)'s health assessment system responds with empathy to all instances of user stress.",
        "Research suggests, however, that it may be more effective to take a context-dependent approach: develop multiple responses for each affective state, whose use depends on the state's context.",
        "E.g., in the tutoring domain, Pon-Barry et al.",
        "(2006) show that human tutors use multiple responses to uncertain student answers, depending on the answer's correctness and prior context.",
        "In the information-seeking domain, it is commonly believed that while an apology is a good default response to user frustration (as in (Klein et al., 2002)), one context requires a different response: after several frustrated user turns, the call should be forwarded to a human operator.",
        "A context-dependent approach to affect adaptation must address 2 issues: in what contexts to adapt, and what responses to use there.",
        "This paper addresses the first issue and targets student uncertainty in our computer tutoring dialogues.",
        "Although our dialogues have a Question-Answer format, our system contains 275 tutor questions.",
        "Treating each question as a context is too labor-intensive for adaptation development and creates a data sparsity issue.",
        "Instead we treat automatically monitorable question properties as contexts.",
        "Here we examine 3 contexts: the dialogue act interpretation, and the discourse structure depth and transition, of the prior tutor question.",
        "We use x to investigate the context dependency of uncertain student answers (correct and incorrect).",
        "Our results show that some contexts are significantly associated with uncertain answers.",
        "Our next step will be to use these significant dependencies to develop system responses to uncertain answers in these contexts.",
        "These responses will be based both on our hypotheses about why uncertainty is associated with these contexts, and on analyses of human tutor responses to uncertain answers in these contexts."
