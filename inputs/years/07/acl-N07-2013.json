        "The Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) is administered to foreign students wishing to enroll in US or Canadian universities.",
        "It aims to measure the extent to which a student has acquired English; thus native speakers should on average perform better on the test regardless of their analytical abilities.",
        "The TOEFL now includes a writing component, and pilot studies were conducted with native as well as non-native speakers.",
        "One of the writing components is an Integrated Writing Task.",
        "Students first read an expository passage, which remains on the screen throughout the task.",
        "Students then hear a segment of a lecture concerning the same topic.",
        "However, the lecture contradicts and complements the information contained in the reading.",
        "The lecture is heard once; students then summarize the lecture and the reading and describe any contradictions between them.",
        "The resulting essays are scored by human raters on a scale of 0 to 5, with 5 being the best possible score.",
        "The highest-scoring essays express ideas from both the lecture and the reading using correct grammar; the lowest-scoring essays rely on only one of the prompts for information and have grammatical problems; and the scores in between show a combination of both types of deficiencies.",
        "The test prompt contained passages about the advantages and disadvantages of working in groups; the reading was 260 words long, the lecture 326 words.",
        "540 non-native speakers and 950 native speakers were tested by ETS in 2004.",
        "ETS also collected essential demographic data such as native language, educational level, etc., for each student.",
        "For later validation, we excluded 1/3 of each set, selected at random, thus involving 363 non-native speakers and 600 native speakers.",
        "Among the non-native speakers, the most common score was 1 (see Fig. 1 for a histogram).",
        "By contrast, native speaker scores centered around 3 and showed a normal-type distribution.",
        "The difference in distributions confirms that the task is effective at separating non-native speakers by skill level, and is easier for native speakers.",
        "The potential sources of difficulty include comprehension of the reading passage, listening ability and memory for the lecture, and the analytical ability to find commonalities and differences between the content of the reading and the lecture."

        "Due to the design of the TOEFL task, the content of the student essays is highly constrained.",
        "The aim of the computational measures is to extract grammatical and stylistic differences between different essays.",
        "We do this by comparing the essays to the reading and lecture prompts.",
        "Our end goal is to determine to what extent speakers diverge from the prompts while retaining the content.",
        "The prediction is that native speakers are much more likely to paraphrase the prompts while keeping the same gist, whereas non-native speakers are likely to either repeat the prompts close to verbatim, or diverge from them in ways that do not preserve the gist.",
        "This intuition conforms to previous studies of native vs. non-native speakers' text summarization (cf. Campbell 1987), although we are not aware of any related computational work.",
        "We begin by measuring lexico-grammatical similarity between each essay and the two prompts.",
        "An essay is represented as a set of features derived from its lexico-grammatical content, as described below.",
        "The resulting comparison measure goes beyond simple word or n-gram overlap by providing a measure of structural similarity as well.",
        "In essence, our method measures to what extent the essay expresses the content of the prompt in the same words, used in the same syntactic positions.",
        "In order to get a measure of syntactic similarity, we relied on Crater (Leacock & Chodorow 2003), an automatic scoring engine developed at ETS.",
        "Crater includes several basic NLP components, including POS tagging, morphological processing, anaphora resolution, and shallow parsing.",
        "The parsing produces tuples for each clause, which describe each verb and its syntactic arguments (1).",
        "(1) CLAUSE: the group spreads responsibility for a decision to all the members TUPLE: verb: spread :subj: the group :obj: responsible :pp.for: for a decide :pp.to: to all Crater does not produce full-sentence trees or prepositional phrase attachment.",
        "However, the tuples are reasonably accurate on non-native input.",
        "Crater produces tuples for each document, often several per sentence.",
        "For the current experiment, we used the main verb, its subject and object.",
        "We then converted each tuple into a set of features, which included the following:",
        "• The verb, subject (pro)noun, and object (pro)noun as individual words;",
        "• All of the words together as a single feature;",
        "• The verb, subject, and object words with their argument roles.",
        "Each document can now be represented as a set of tuple-derived features, or feature vectors.",
        "Two feature vectors derived from tuples can be compared using a cosine measure (Salton 1989).",
        "The closer to 1 the cosine, the more similar the two feature sets.",

        "MSlinear trend/MSwithin-subjects=63 for the reading; F=71 for the lecture at 0.05 significance level).",

        "Overall, for non-native speakers the mean AMC was higher for the reading than for the lecture (0.114 vs. 0.08).",
        "Native speakers, by contrast, showed no significant trends for either the reading or the lecture.",
        "Overall, the average AMCs for the reading and the lecture were comparable (0.08 vs. 0.075).",
        "We know from results of CVA and BLEU analyses that for both groups of speakers, higher-scoring essays are more lexically similar to the prompts.",
        "Thus, the lack of a trend for native speakers must be due to lack of increase in structural similarity between higher-scoring essays and the prompts.",

        "By contrast, native speakers rely on both the reading and the lecture about the same, and show no significant trend across skill levels.",
        "Native speakers seem to deviate more from the structure of the original prompts while keeping the same content, signaling better paraphrasing skills.",
        "While not a direct measure of gist similarity, this technique represents a first step toward detecting paraphrases in written text.",
        "In the immediate future, we plan to extend the set of features to include non-verbatim similarity, such as synonyms and words derived by LSA-type comparison (Landauer et al.",
        "1998).",
        "In addition, the syntactic features will be expanded to include frequent grammatical alternations such as active / passive.",
        "A rather simple measure such as AMC has already revealed differences in population distributions for native vs. non-native speakers.",
        "Extensions of this method can potentially be used to determine if a given essay was written by a native or a non-native speaker.",
        "For instance, a statistical classifier can be trained to distinguish feature sets characteristic for different populations.",
        "Such a classifier can be useful in a number of NLP-related fields, including information extraction, search, and, of course, educational measurement."
