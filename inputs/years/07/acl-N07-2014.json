        "Arabic script consists of two classes of symbols: letters and diacritics.",
        "Letters are always written whereas diacritics are optional: written Arabic can be fully diacritized, it can have some diacritics (to disambiguate certain words), or it can be entirely undiacritized.",
        "There are three types of diacritics: vowel, nunation, and shadda.",
        "Vowel diacritics represent Arabic's three short vowels and the absence of any vowel.",
        "The following are the four vowel-diacritics exemplified in conjunction with the letter b (we use Buckwalter transliteration): Cj ba, Â£",
        "'This research was supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) under Contract No.",
        "HR0011-06-C-0023.",
        "Any opinions, findings and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of DARPA.",
        "bu, bi and bo (no vowel).",
        "Nunation diacritics can only occur in word final positions in nominals (nouns, adjectives and adverbs).",
        "They represent a short vowel followed by an n sound: l| bF, bN and bK.",
        "Nunation is an indicator of nominal indefiniteness.",
        "Shadda is a consonant doubling diacritic: Cj b~.",
        "The shadda can combine with vowel or nunation diacritics: Jj b^u or Cj b^N.",
        "Additional diacritical marks in Arabic include the hamza, which appears in conjunction with a small number of letters (e.g., \\ t, \\ J , ^ ).",
        "Since most Arabic encodings do not consider the hamza a diacritic, but rather a part of the letter (like the dot on the lowercase Roman i or under the Arabic b: ), we do not count it here as part of the diacritic set.",
        "Functionally, diacritics can be split into two different kinds: lexemic diacritics and inflectional diacritics.",
        "Lexemic diacritics distinguish between two lexemes.",
        "For example, the diacritization difference between the lexemes kAtib 'writer' and ^Jj^kAtab 'to correspond' distinguish between the meanings of the word rather than their inflections.",
        "Thus, there are lexemes that look alike when undia-critized but are spelled differently when diacritized.",
        "Note that there are also distinct lexemes that are always spelled the same way, even when diacritized their difference is only a difference in word sense.",
        "Inflectional diacritics distinguish different inflected forms of the same lexeme.",
        "For instance, the final diacritics in cJcf katabtu 'I wrote' and",
        "katabta you wrote' distinguish the person of the subject of the verb.",
        "We further distinguish between two types of inflectional diacritics: variant inflectional diacritics and invariant inflectional diacritics.",
        "The distinction is made with respect to two morphosyntactic features: nominal case and verbal mood.",
        "The variant inflectional diacritics need not always appear at the end of the word.",
        "For instance, the variant inflectional diacritics at the penultimate positions of the following two words distinguish their case: ITkAtibuhu 'his writer [nominative]' and isJfkAtibahu 'his writer [accusative]'."

      "text": [
        "In a previous publication, we described the Morphological Analysis and Disambiguation of Arabic (Mada) system (Habash and Rambow, 2005).",
        "The basic approach used in Mada is inspired by the work of Hajic (2000) for tagging morphologically rich languages, which was extended to Arabic independently by Hajic et al.",
        "(2005).",
        "In this approach, a set of taggers are trained for individual linguistic features which are components of the full morphological tag (such as core part-of-speech, tense, number, and so on).",
        "In Arabic, we have ca.",
        "2,000 to 20,000 morphological tags, depending on how we count.",
        "The Buckwalter Arabic Morphological Analyzer (BAMA) (Buckwalter, 2004) is consulted to produce a list of possible analyses for a word.",
        "BAMA returns, given an undiacritized inflected word form, all possible morphological analyses, including full diacritization for each analysis.",
        "The results of the individual taggers are used to choose among these possible analyses.",
        "The algorithm we proposed in (Habash and Rambow, 2005) for choosing the best BAMA analysis simply counts the number of predicted values for the set of linguistic features in each candidate analysis.",
        "Hajic et al.",
        "(2005), however, weigh the predicted values by their probability or confidence measure.",
        "To our knowledge, no results on diacritization have been previously reported using this particular approach to tagging.",
        "In this paper, we extend our basic Mada system in the following ways: First, we follow Hajic et al.",
        "(2005) in including case, mood, and nunation as features, because of its importance to diacritization.",
        "Second, we replace the YAMCHA (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2003) implementation of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with SVMTool (Gimenez and Marquez, 2004) as our machine learning tool, for reasons of speed, at the cost of a slight decrease in accuracy.",
        "Like Hajic et al.",
        "(2005), we do not use Viterbi decoding.",
        "Finally, we introduce a specialized module for resolving residual ambiguity after the basic tagging is done.",
        "We explain this module in detail next.",
        "We train our classifiers on the exact training set defined by Zitouni et al.",
        "(2006), a subpart of the third segment of the Penn Arabic Treebank (Maamouri et al., 2004) (\"ATB3-Train\", 288,000 words).",
        "We also (reluctantly) follow them in having a single set for development and testing (\"ATB3-Devtest\", 52,000 words), rather than separate development and test sets (as is common), in order to be able to compare our results to theirs.",
        "Up until this point, Mada-D has narrowed the list of possible analyses of a word (supplied by BAMA) down to a small number.",
        "This number can sometimes be greater than one for two reasons: first, the way in which we use the output of the taggers to choose among the analyses may yield a tie among several analyses; second, there may be lexeme-based diacritic ambiguity, and the morphological taggers cannot disambiguate lexemic diacritization.",
        "To address the residual ambiguity, we implemented a second component.",
        "Ideally, this would be (or include) a full word sense disambiguation (WSD) system, but WSD is a hard problem.",
        "Instead, we approximate WSD using standard n-gram language models.",
        "We use two types of data for training: fully diacritized word forms, and data in which we have replaced the inflected word by the diacritized citation form of the lexeme.",
        "Note that this procedure conflates lexemes that differ only in meaning, not in diacritization, as we are not actually interested in WSD for its own sake in this paper.",
        "The training corpus is the same corpus we use for the classifiers, ATB3-Train.",
        "This means that the diacritization and the choice of lexeme are done by hand, but it also means that the training set is quite small by the standards of language models.",
        "We build an open-vocabulary language model with Kneser-Ney smoothing using the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).",
        "We will call the resulting language models XLM-n, where X is \"D\" for the fully diacritized word forms, or \"L\" for the lexeme citation forms, and n is the order of the ngrams (n = 1,2,3).",
        "When all candidate tokens (di-acritized word or lexeme citation form) are unknown (out-of-vocabulary), the language model does not actually make a choice among them.",
        "We then use a diacritization unigram model, and then finally random choice.",
        "In the case of a preceding DLM-n model, this simply amounts to random choice, but in the case of a preceding LLM-n model, the dia-critization model may actually make a non-random choice."

        "However, they train a single tagger using unannotated data and EM, which necessarily leads to a lower performance.",
        "The most salient difference, however, is that they are motivated by the goal of improving automatic speech recognition, and have an acoustic signal parallel to the undiacritized text.",
        "All their experiments use acoustic models.",
        "They show that WER for diacritization decreases by nearly 50% (from 50%) when BAMA is added to the acoustic information, but the tagger does not help.",

        "(2006), we adopt their metric.",
        "We count all words, including numbers and punctuation.",
        "Each letter (or digit) in a word is a potential host for a set of diacritics; we count all diacritics on a single letter as a single binary choice.",
        "So, for example, if we correctly predict a shadda but get the vowel wrong, it counts as a wrong choice.",
        "We approximate non-variant diacritization by removing all diacritics from the final letter (Ignore Last), while counting that letter in the evaluation.",
        "We give diacritic error rate (DER) which tells us for how many letters we incorrectly restored all diacritics, and word error rate (WER), which tells us how many words had at least one DER.",
        "The results are shown in Figure 1.",
        "Going top to bottom, we first see the baseline, Only-DLM-1, which is simply a diacritization unigram model with random choice for unseen words.",

        "We first show results for the diacritization model, with 1-, 2-, and 3-grams.",
        "As we can see, the bigram language model helps slightly.",
        "The next three lines are the three lexeme n-gram models.",
        "Here we see that the unigram model performs worse than the unigram diacritization model, while the bigram and trigram models perform better (the trigram lexeme model is our best result).",
        "We interpret this as meaning that the lexeme model is useful only when context is taken into account, because it is actually performing a rudimentary form of WSD.",
        "We tease apart the contribution of the tagger and of the language model with two further experiments, in the next two lines: using just the lexeme language model (trigrams), and running just the tagger, followed by random choice.",
        "We can see that the tagger alone does as well as the tagger with the unigram lexeme model, while the lexeme model on its own does much worse.",
        "However, as expected, the lexeme model on its own for the Ignore Last measure is much closer to the performance of the tagger on its own.",
        "We conclude from this that the quite simple lexeme model is in fact contributing to the correct choice of the lexemic diacritics.",
        "Finally, we give the results of Zitouni et al.",
        "(2006) on the last line, which we understand to be the best published results currently.",
        "We see that we improve on their results in all categories.",

        "This means that when we make a mistake, it may well affect several diacritics at once, so that the diacritic errors are concentrated in fewer words.",
        "This effect is even stronger when we disregard the final letter (30.4% reduction in WER versus 12.0% reduction in DER), suggesting that singleton errors in words tend to be in the final position (case, mood), as it is often hard for the tagger to determine these features.",
