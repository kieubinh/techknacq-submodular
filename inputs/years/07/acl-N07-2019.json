        "Automatic transcription of multi-party conversations such as meetings is one of the most difficult tasks in automatic speech recognition.",
        "In (Morgan et al., 2003) it is described as an \"ASR-complete\" problem, one that presents unique challenges for every component of a speech recognition system.",
        "Though much of the literature on meeting transcription has focused on the unique acoustic modeling and segmentation problems incurred by meeting transcription, language modeling for meetings is an interesting problem as well.",
        "Though meeting speech is spontaneous in nature, the vocabulary and phrasing in meetings can be very specialized and often highly technical.",
        "Speaking style can vary greatly between speakers, and the discourse structure of multi-party interaction gives rise to cross-speaker effects that are difficult to model with standard N-gram models (Ji and Bilmes, 2004).",
        "Speech in meetings has one crucial advantage over many other transcription tasks, namely that it does not occur in isolation.",
        "Meetings are scheduled and discussed in advance, often via e-mail.",
        "People take notes and create agendas for meetings, and often read directly from electronic presentation materials.",
        "The structure of meetings can be exploited topics can be segmented both temporally and across speakers, and these shifting topics can be modeled as sub-languages.",
        "We examine the effect of leveraging one particular type of external information, namely the written agendas and meeting minutes, and we demonstrate that, by using off-line language model adaptation techniques, these can significantly (p < 0.01) improve language modeling and speech recognition accuracy.",
        "The language in the notes and agendas is very similar to that used by the speakers, hence we consider this to be a form of semi-supervised or implicitly supervised adaptation."

        "The SmartNotes system, described in (Banerjee and Rudnicky, 2007) is a collaborative platform for meeting organization, recording, and note-taking.",
        "As part of our research into meeting segmentation and recognition, we have collected a series of 10 unscripted meetings using SmartNotes.",
        "These meetings themselves are approximately 30 minutes in length (ranging from 1745 to 7208 words) with three regular participants, and consist of discussions and reporting on our ongoing research.",
        "The meetings are structured around the agendas and action items constructed through the SmartNotes interface.",
        "The agenda itself is largely constant from meeting to meeting, while each meeting typically reviews discusses the previous week's action items.",
        "Each participant is equipped with a laptop computer and an individual headset microphone.",
        "Each meeting was manually transcribed and segmented for training and testing purposes.",
        "The transcription includes speaker identification and timing information.",
        "As part of the meeting, participants are encouraged to take notes and define action items.",
        "These are automatically collected on a server along with timestamp information.",
        "In (Banerjee and Rud-nicky, 2007), it was shown that timestamped text of this kind is useful for topic segmentation of meetings.",
        "In this work, we have not attempted to take advantage of the timing information, nor have we attempted to perform any topic segmentation.",
        "Given the small quantity of text available from the notes, we feel that the type of static language model adaptation presented here is most feasible when done at the entire meeting level.",
        "A cache language model (Kuhn and Mori, 1990) may be able to capture the (informally attested) locality effects between notes and speech.",
        "Since the notes are naturalistic text, often containing shorthand, abbreviations, numbers, punctuation, and so forth, we preprocess them by running them through the text-normalization component of the Festival speech synthesis system and extracting the resulting string of individual words.",
        "This yielded an average of 252 words of adaptation data for each of the 10 meetings."

        "In examining the interpolation component of the adaptation method described above, we noticed that the in-house meetings and the ICSI meetings consistently took on the largest interpolation weights.",
        "This is not surprising since both of these corpora are similar to the test meetings.",
        "However, all of the source corpora cover potentially relevant topics, and by interpolating the corpora as single units, we have no way to control the weights given to individual topics within them.",
        "Also, people may use different, but related, words in writing and speaking to describe the same topic, but we are unable to capture these semantic associations between the notes and speech.",
        "To investigate these issues, we conducted several brief experiments using a reduced training corpus consisting of 69 ICSI meetings.",
        "We converted these to a vector-space representation using tf.idf scores and used a deterministic annealing algorithm (Rose, 1998) to create hard clusters of meetings, from each of which we trained a source model for linear interpolation.",
        "We compared these clusters to random uniform partitions of the corpus.",
        "The interpolation weights were trained on the notes, and the models were tested on the meeting transcripts.",
        "Out-of-vocabulary words were not removed from the perplexity calculation.",
        "The results (mean and standard deviation over 10 meetings) are shown in Table 4.",
        "For numbers of clusters between 2 and 42, the annealing-based clusters significantly outperform the random partition.",
        "The perplexity with 42 clusters is also significantly lower (p < 0.01) than the perplexity (256.5 ± 21.5) obtained by training a separate source model for each meeting.",
        "To address the second issue of vocabulary mismatches between notes and speech, we applied probabilistic latent semantic analysis (Hofmann, 1999) to the corpus, and used this to \"expand\" the vocabulary of the notes.",
        "We trained a 32-factor PLSA model on the content words (we used a simple entropy-based pruning to identify these \"content words\") from the ICSI meeting vocabulary.",
        "To adapt the language model, we used the \"folding-in\" procedure described in (Hofmann, 1999), running an iteration of EM over the notes to obtain an adapted unigram distribution.",
        "We then simply updated the unigram probabilities in the language model with these new values and renormalized.",
        "While the results, shown in Table 5, show a statistically significant improvement in perplexity, this adaptation method is is problematic, as it increases the probability mass given to all the words in the PLSA model.",
        "In subsequent results, also shown in Table 5, we found that simply extracting these words from the original unigram distribution and boosting their probabilities by the equivalent amount also reduces perplexity by nearly as much (though the difference from the PLSA model is statistically significant, p = 0.004).",
