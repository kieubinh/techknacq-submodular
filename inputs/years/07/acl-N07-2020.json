        "The official Defense Language Proficiency Test (DLPT) is constructed according to rigorous and well-established principles that have been developed to measure the foreign language proficiency of human language learners in U.S. Department of Defense settings.",
        "In 2004, a variant of that test type was constructed, following the general DLPT design principles, but modified to measure the quality of machine translation.",
        "This test, known as the DLPTstar (Jones et al., 2005), was based on authentic Arabic materials at ILR text difficulty levels 1, 2, and 3, accompanied by constructed-response questions at matching levels.",
        "The ILR level descriptors, used throughout the U.S. government, can be found at the website cited in the list of references.",
        "The text documents were presented in two conditions in English translation: (1) professionally translated into English, and (2) machine translated with state-of-the art MT systems, often quite garbled.",
        "Results showed that native readers of English could generally pass the Levels 1 and 2 questions on the test, but not those at Level 3.",
        "Also, Level 1 comprehension was less than expected, given the low level of the original material.",
        "It was not known whether the weak Level 1 performance was due to systematic deficits in MT performance at Level 1, or whether the materials were simply mismatched to the MT capabilities.",
        "In this paper, we present a new variant of the test, using materials specifically created to test the capabilities of the MT systems.",
        "To guarantee that the MT systems were up to the task of processing the documents, we used the DARPA GALE 2006 evaluation data sets, against which several research sites were testing MT algorithms.",
        "We arbitrarily merged the MT output from three sites.",
        "The ILR difficulty of the documents ranged from Level 2 to Level 3, but the test did not contain any true Level 1 documents.",
        "To compensate for this lack, we constructed questions about Level 1 elements (e.g., personal and place names) in Level 2 and 3 documents.",
        "A standard DLPT would have more variation at Level 1."

      "text": [
        "Earlier work in MT evaluation incorporated an informativeness measure, based on comprehension test answers, in addition to fluency, a measure of output readability without reference to a gold standard, and adequacy, a measure of accuracy with reference to a gold standard translation (White and O'Connell, 1994).",
        "Later MT evaluation found fluency and adequacy to correlate well enough with automatic measures (BLEU), and since comprehension tests are relatively more expensive to create, the informativeness test was not used in later",
        "MT evaluations, such as the ones performed by NIST from 2001-2006.",
        "In other work, task-based evaluation has been used for MT evaluation (Voss and Tate, 2006), which measures human performance on exhaustively extracting 'who', 'when', and 'where' type elements in MT output.",
        "The DLPT-star also uses this type of factual question, particularly for Level 2 documents, but not exhaustively.",
        "Instead, the test focuses on text elements most characteristic of the levels as defined in the ILR scale.",
        "At Level 3, for example, questions may concern abstract concepts or hypotheses found in the documents.",
        "Applying the ILR construct provides Defense Department decision makers with test scores that are readily interpretable."

        "In this paper, we present a new test, based entirely on the DARPA GALE 2006 evaluation data, selecting approximately half of the material for our test.",
        "We selected twenty-four test documents, with balanced coverage across four genres: newswire, newsgroups, broadcast news and talk radio.",
        "Our target was to have at least 2500 words for each genre, which we exceeded slightly with approximately 12,200 words in total for the test.",
        "We began with a random selection of documents and adjusted it for better topic coverage.",
        "We constructed an exhaustive set of questions for each document, approximately 200 questions in total.",
        "The questions ranged in ILR difficulty, from \"0+, 1,1+, 2, 2+ and 3, with Levels 0+, 1 and 1+ combined to a pseudo-level we called L1~, providing four levels of difficulty to be measured.",
        "We divided the questions into two sets, and each individual subject answered questions for one of the sets.",
        "The test itself was constructed by a DLPT testing expert and a senior native-speaking Arabic language instructor, using only the original Arabic documents and the Gold Standard translations.",
        "They had no access to any machine translation output during the test construction or scoring.",
        "In August 2006, we administered the test at MIT to 49 test subjects who responded to announcements for paid experimental subjects.",
        "The subjects read the documents in a Latin square design, meaning that each subject saw each document, but only in one of the two conditions, randomly assigned.",
        "Subjects were allowed 5 hours to complete the test.",
        "Since the questions were divided into two sets for each document, the actual set of 49 subjects yielded approximately 25 \"virtual subjects\" reading the full list of 228 questions.",
        "The mean time spent on testing, not counting breaks or subject orientation, was 2.5 hours; fastest was 1.1 hours, slowest was 3.4 hours.",
        "The subject responses were hand-graded by the two testing experts, following the pre-established answers in the test protocol.",
        "There was no pre-assessment of whether information was preserved or garbled in the MT when designing questions or responses in the test protocol.",
        "The testing experts were provided the reference translations and the original Arabic documents, but not the MT during scoring.",
        "Moreover, test conditions were masked in order to provide a blind assessment.",
        "The two testing experts provided both preliminary and final scores; multiple passes provided an opportunity to clarify the correct answers and to normalize scoring.",
        "The scoring agreement rate was 96% for the final scores."

        "The two text genres score better than the audio genres, which is to be expected because the audio MT condition has more opportunities for error.",
        "Within each modality, the more standard, more structured genre fares better: newswire results are better than newsgroup results, and the more structured genre of broadcast news scores better than the less constrained, less structured conversations present in the talk radio shows.",

        "2005).",
        "The best results are at Level 2; Level 1 does well but not as well as expected.",
        "Thus the test has provided a key finding, which is that MT systems perform more poorly on Level 1, even when the data is matched to their capabilities.",
        "Level 3 is very challenging for the MT condition, and also more difficult in the GS condition.",
        "Using a standard 70 percent passing threshold, responses to questions on all MT documents, except for Level 3, received a passing grade.",
        "To provide a snapshot of the ILR levels: L1 indicates sentence-level comprehensibility, and may include factual local announcements, etc.",
        "; L2 indicates paragraph-level comprehensibility; factual/ concrete, covering a wide spectrum of topics (politics, economy, society, culture, security, science); L3 involves extended discourse comprehensibility; the ability to understand hypotheses, supported opinion, implications, and abstract linguistic formulations, etc.",
        "It was not possible to balance Level 3 documents across genres within the GALE evaluation data; except for those taken from Talk Radio, most documents did not reach that level of complexity.",
