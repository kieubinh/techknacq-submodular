        "DDMs use machine learning to automatically derive a language model from, usually, hand-annotated corpora.",
        "An advantage of the DDMs is their language and tagset independence property.",
        "Their disadvantage is that a tagged corpus is essential for training.",
        "Furthermore, the limited window size used for disambiguation (e.g. three words) can be responsible for some of the tagging errors.",
        "One of the better known statistical data-driven tagger is the TnT tagger (written in C).",
        "The tagger uses a second order (trigram) Hidden Markov model.",
        "The probabilities of the model are estimated from a training corpus using maximum likelihood estimation.",
        "New assignments of part-of-speech (POS) to words is found by optimising the product of lexical probabilities (p(wi\\tj)) and contextual probabilities (p(ti\\ti-\\, U-2)) (where wi and ti are the ith word and tag, respectively).",
        "In contrast to DDMs, LRBMs are developed with the purpose of tagging a specific language using a particular tagset.",
        "The purpose of the rules is, usually, to remove illegitimate tags from words based on context.",
        "The advantage of LRBMs is that they do not rely (to the same extent as DDMs) on the existence of a tagged corpus, and rules can be written to refer to words and tags in the entire sentence.",
        "The construction of a linguistic rule-based tagger, however, has been considered a difficult and time-consuming task (Voutilainen, 1995).",
        "One of the better known LRBMs is the Constraint Grammar (CG) framework (Karlsson et al., 1995), in which both POS and grammatical functions are tagged.",
        "The EngCG-2 tagger, developed over several years and consisting of 3,600 rules, has been shown to obtain high accuracy (Samuelsson and Voutilainen, 1997).",
        "The development time of our LRBM (written in Java; including a tokeniser, IceMorphy and IceTagger) was 7 man-months, which can be considered a short development time for a LRBM.",
        "This is mainly due to the emphasis on using heuristics (see Sect.",
        "4.3) for disambiguation, as opposed to writing a large number of local rules."
