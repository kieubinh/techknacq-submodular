        "Capturing semantic relations between words in a document representation is a difficult problem.",
        "Different approaches tried to overcome the term independence assumption of the bag-of-words representation (Salton and McGill, 1983) for example by using distributional term clusters (Slonim and Tishby, 2000) and expanding the document vectors with synonyms, see (Levow et al., 2005).",
        "Since content words can be combined into semantic classes there has been a considerable interest in low-dimensional term and document representations.",
        "Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Deerwester et al., 1990) is one of the best known dimensionality reduction algorithms.",
        "In the LSA space documents are indexed with latent semantic concepts.",
        "LSA showed large performance improvements over the traditional tf-idf representation on small document collections (Deerwester et al., 1990) but often does not perform well on large heterogeneous collections.",
        "LSA maps all words to low dimensional vectors.",
        "However, the notion of semantic relatedness is defined differently for subsets of the vocabulary.",
        "In addition, the numerical information, abbreviations and the documents' style may be very good indicators of their topic.",
        "However, this information is no longer available after the dimensionality reduction.",
        "We use a hybrid approach to document indexing to address these issues.",
        "We keep the notion of latent semantic concepts and also try to preserve the specifics of the document collection.",
        "We use a low-dimensional representation only for nouns and represent the rest of the document's content as tf-idf vectors.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 discusses our approach.",

        "This section gives the general idea of our approach.",
        "We divide the vocabulary into two sets: nouns and the rest of the vocabulary.",
        "We use a method of spectral embedding, as described below and compute a low-dimensional representation for documents using only the nouns.",
        "We also compute a tf-idfrepresen-tation for documents using the other set of words.",
        "Since we can treat each latent semantic concept in the low-dimensional representation as part ofthe vocabulary, we combine the two vector representations for each document by concatenating them.",
        "Spectral methods comprise a family of algorithms that use a matrix of pairwise similarities S and perform its spectral analysis, such as the eigenvalue decomposition, to embed terms and documents in a low-dimensional vector space.",
        "S = U£UT, where the columns of U are its eigenvectors and £ is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues.",
        "If we have a matrix of pairwise word similarities S, its first k eigenvectors Uk will be used to represent the words in the latent semantic space.",
        "Semantically related words will have high association with the same latent concepts and their corresponding vectors will be similar.",
        "Moreover, the vector similarity between the word vectors will optimally preserve the original similarities (Cox and Cox, 2001).",
        "We use two approaches to compute spectral embedding for nouns.",
        "Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) (Deerwester et al., 1990) and Generalized Latent Semantic Analysis (GLSA) (Matveeva et al., 2005).",
        "For both we used the eigenvalue decomposition as the embedding step.",
        "The difference is in the similarities matrix which we are trying to preserve.",
        "LSA and GLSA begin with a matrix of pairwise term similarities S, compute its eigenvectors U and use the first k of them to represent terms and documents, for details see (Deerwester et al., 1990; Matveeva et al., 2005).",
        "The main difference in our implementation of these algorithms is the matrix of pairwise word similarities.",
        "Since our representation will try to preserve them it is important to have a matrix of similarities which is linguistically motivated.",
        "LSA uses the matrix of pairwise similarities which is based on document vectors.",
        "For two words wi and Wj in the document collection containing n documents dk, the similarity is computed as where tf(wi ,dk) is the term frequency for wi in dk and idf(wi) is the inverse document frequency weight for wi.",
        "LSA is a special case ofspectral embedding restricted to one type of term similarities and dimensionality reduction method.",
        "GLSA (Matveeva et al., 2005) generalizes the idea of latent semantic space.",
        "It proposes to use different types of similarity matrix and spectral embedding methods to compute a latent space which is closer to true semantic similarities.",
        "One way to do so is to use a more appropriate similarities matrix S.",
        "PMI We use point-wise mutual information (PMI) to compute the matrix S. PMI between random variables representing the words wj and Wj is computed as",
        "Thus, for GLSA, S (wj, Wj ) = PMI (wj, Wj ).",
        "Co-occurrence Proximity An advantage of PMI is the notion of proximity.",
        "The co-occurrence statistics for PMI are typically computed using a sliding window.",
        "Thus, PMI will be large only for words that co-occur within a small fixed context.",
        "Our experiments show that this is a better approximation to true semantic similarities.",
        "We have two sets of the vocabulary terms: a set of nouns, N, and the other words, T. We compute tf-idf document vectors indexed with the words in T :",
        "where aj(wt) = tf(wt, dj) * idf (wt).",
