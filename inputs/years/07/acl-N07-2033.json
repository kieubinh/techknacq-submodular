      "text": [
        "Our MSA speech recognition system is based on the Janus Recognition Toolkit JRTk [9] and the IBIS decoder [10].",
        "Before decoding the audio, an automatic segmentation step and a speaker clustering step is performed.",
        "The segmentation step aims at excluding those segments that contain no speech, such as music or background noise.",
        "The remaining segments are clustered into speaker clusters such that all adaptation and normalization steps can be processed on clusters as batches.",
        "From the incoming 16 kHz audio signal we extract for each segment power spectral features using a FFT with a 10ms frame-shift and a 16ms Hamming window.",
        "From these we compute 13 Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) per frame and perform a cepstral mean as well as variance normalization on a cluster basis.",
        "To incorporate dynamic features we concatenate 15 adjacent MFCC frames (±7) and project these 195 dimensional features into a 42 dimensional space using a transform found by linear discriminate analysis (LDA).",
        "We use the context-dependent codebooks as classes for finding the LDA transform [2].",
        "On top of the LDA we apply a single maximum likelihood trained Semi-Tied-Covariance (STC) matrix.",
        "The general decoding setup employs a first pass in which a speaker independent acoustic model without vocal tract length normalization (VTLN) and no adaptation is used.",
        "The hypotheses of a cluster from the first pass are then used to estimate the VTLN warping factors to warp the power spectrum using the maximum likelihood approach described in [8].",
        "After the VTLN factors are found, the same hypotheses are considered to estimate a feature space adaptation (FSA) using a constrained MLLR (CMLLR) transform.",
        "Then a model space adaptation is performed using maximum likelihood linear regression with multiple regression classes.",
        "The regression classes are found through clustering of the Gaussians in the acoustic model.",
        "The second pass decoding uses a speaker adaptive trained * Now with Toshiba Research Europe Ltd, Cambridge, United Kingdom acoustic model, in which the adaptation was performed using a single CMLLR transform per speaker.",
        "For the non-vowelized system, we applied a grapheme-to-phoneme approach to automatically generate the pronunciation dictionary.",
        "For the vowelized system we used the same phoneme set as in the non-vowelized system but extended it with the 3 short vowels, which do not appear in the writing system.",
        "Both systems are 2-pass system as described above and employ Cepstral Mean Normalization (CMN), MLLR, Semi-tied covariance (STC), and Feature space adaptation (FSA).",
        "For the development of context dependent acoustic models we applied an entropy-based polyphone decision tree clustering process using context questions of maximum width ±2, resulting in shared quin-phones.",
        "In addition we included word-boundary tags into the pronunciation dictionary, which can be asked for in the decision tree can ask for word-boundary tags.",
        "The non-vowelized system uses 4000 phonetically-tied quin-phones with a total of 305,000 Gaussians.",
        "The non-vowelized system has 5000 codebooks with a total of 308,000 Gaussians.",
        "In total we used 190 hours for acoustic training.",
        "These consist of 40 hours Broadcast news (BN) from manually transcribed FBIS data, 50 hours BN LDC-TDT4 selected from 85 hours using a slightly supervised approach as described in [3], and 30 hours Broadcast conversation (BC) recorded from Al-jazeera",

        "However, one challenge is that the transcriptions are not complete in that they do not include transcripts of commercials or any news break that may interrupt the show.",
        "In total we recorded 50 hours of Broadcast conversation shows from Al-jazeera and used them in our acoustic model and language model training by performing the following procedures:",
        "• We manually selected shows from Al-jazeera TV",

        "• We added these shows to our LM data with high weight, built a biased LM, and used this LM to decode the recorded shows.",
        "• We aligned the reference (transcripts without time stamps) with the decoder output that may contain speech recognition errors.",
        "• We selected only the portions that are correct; we did not select any portion with number of words less than 3 correct consecutive words.",
        "• Based on the above criteria we finally selected 30 hours out of the total 40 hours recordings.",
        "• We clustered utterances based on BIC criteria approach described in [7].",
        "As a result, we managed to project the time stamp in the original transcript such that it can be used for training.",

        "Since RT04 is broadcast news, we expect even higher gains on broadcast conversational data.",
        "It is worth mentioning that we applied the same slightly supervised approach to the TDT4 data which is a low quality quick transcription.",
        "We selected 50 out of 80 hours and achieved an improvement of 12% relative.",
