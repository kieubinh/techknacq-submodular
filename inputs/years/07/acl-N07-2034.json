        "Finite-state models constitute an important framework both in syntactic pattern recognition and in language processing.",
        "Specifically, stochastic finite-state transducers (SFSTs) have proved to be useful for machine translation tasks within restricted domains; they usually offer high speed during the decoding step and they provide competitive results in terms of error rates (Mohri et al., 2002).",
        "Moreover, SFSTs have proved to be versatile models, which can be easily integrated with other finite-state models (Pereira and Riley, 1997).",
        "The article (Casacuberta and Vidal, 2004) explored an automatic method to learn an SFST from a bilingual set of samples for machine translation purposes, the so-called GIATI (Grammar Inference and Alignments for Transducers Inference).",
        "It described how to learn both the structural and the probabilistic components of an SFST making use of underlying alignment models.",
        "A multi-target SFST is a generalization of standard SFSTs, in such a way that every input string in the source language results in a tuple of output strings each being associated to a different target language.",
        "An extension of GIATI that allowed to infer a multi-target SFST from a multilingual corpus was proposed in (Gonzalez and Casacuberta, 2006).",
        "A syntactic variant of this method (denoted as GI-AMTI) has been used in this work in order to infer the models from training samples as it is summarized in section 3.",
        "On the other hand, speech translation has been already carried out by integrating acoustic models into a SFST (Casacuberta et al., 2004).",
        "Our main goal in this work is to extend and assess these methodologies to accomplish spoken language multi-target translation.",
        "Section 2 deals with this proposal by presenting a new integrated architecture for speech-input multi-target translation.",
        "Under this approach spoken language can be simultaneously decoded and translated into m languages using a unique network.",
        "In section 4, the performance of the system has been experimentally evaluated over a trilingual task which aims to translate TV weather forecast into two languages at the same time."

        "The classical architecture for spoken language multi-target translation involves a speech recognition system in a serial architecture withm decoupled text-to-text translators.",
        "Thus, the whole process involves m + 1 searching stages, a first one for the speech signal transcription into the source language text string, and further m for the source language translation into the m target languages.",
        "If we replaced the m translators by the multi-target SFST, the problem would be reduced to 2 searching stages.",
        "Nevertheless, in this paper we propose a natural way for acoustic models to be integrated in the same network.",
        "As a result, the input speech-signal can be simultaneously decoded and translated into m target languages just in a single searching stage.",
        "Given the acoustic representation (x) of a speech signal, the goal of multi-target speech translation is to find the most likely m target strings (tm); that is, one string (tj) per target language involved (i £ {1,..., m}).",
        "This approach is summarized in eq.",
        "(1), where the hidden variable s can be interpreted as the transcription of the speech signal:",
        "Making use of Bayes' rule, the former expression turns into:",
        "Empirically, there is no loss of generality if we assume that the acoustic signal representation depends only on the source string: i.e., that P(x|tm, s) is independent of tm.",
        "In this sense, eq.",
        "(2) can be rewritten as:",
        "Equation (3) combines a standard acoustic model, P(x|s), and a multi-target translation model, P(tm, s), both of whom can be integrated on the fly during the searching routine.",
        "Nevertheless, the outer maximization is computationally very expensive to search for the optimal tuple of target strings tm in an effective way.",

        "A monotonous segmentation copes with monotonous alignments, that is, j < k => aj < ak following the notation of (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "Each source word is then joined with a target phrase of each language as the corresponding segmentation suggests.",

        "However both languages differs greatly in syntax and in semantics.",
        "The differences in the size of the vocabulary (see Table 1), for instance, are due to the agglutinative nature of the Basque language.",
        "With regard to the speech test, the input consisted of the speech signal recorded by 36 speakers, each one reading out 50 sentences from the test-set in Table 1.",
        "That is, each sentence was read out by at least three speakers.",
        "The input speech resulted in approximately 3.50 hours of audio signal.",
        "Needless to say, the application that we envisage has to be speaker-independent if it is to be realistic.",
        "The experimental setup was as follows: the multitarget SFST was learned from the training set in Table 1 using the GIAMTI algorithm described in section 1; then, the speech test was translated, and the output provided by the system in each language was compared to the corresponding reference sentence.",
        "Additionally, two mono-target SFST were inferred from the same training set with their outputs for the aforementioned test to be taken as baseline.",
        "The expected searching time and the amount of memory that needs to be allocated for a given model are two key parameters to bear in mind in speechinput machine translation applications.",

        "On the other hand, the multi-target approach offers a slightly smaller branching factor than each mono-target approach.",
        "As a result, fewer paths have to be explored with the multi-target approach than with the decoupled one, which means that searching for a translation can be faster.",
