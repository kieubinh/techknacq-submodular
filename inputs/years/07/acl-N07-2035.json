        "Statistical machine translation (SMT) has evolved from the initial word-based translation models to more advanced models that take the context surrounding the words into account.",
        "The so-called phrase-based and N-gram-based models are two examples of these approaches (Zens and Ney, 2004; Marino et al., 2006).",
        "In current state-of-the-art SMT systems, the phrase-based or the N-gram-based models are usually the main features in a log-linear framework, reminiscent of the maximum entropy modeling approach.",
        "Two basic issues differentiate the N-gram-based system from the phrase-based one: the training data is sequentially segmented into bilingual units; and the probability of these units is estimated as a bilingual N-gram language model.",
        "In the phrase-based model, no monotonicity restriction is imposed on the segmentation and the probabilities are normally estimated simply by relative frequencies.",
        "This paper extends the analysis of both systems performed in (Crego et al., 2005a) by additionally performing a manual error analysis of both systems, which were the ones used by UPC and RWTH in the last To-Star evaluation.",
        "Furthermore, we will propose a way to combine both systems in order to improve the quality of translations.",
        "Experiments combining several kinds of MT systems have been presented in (Matusov et al., 2006), based only on the single best output of each system.",
        "Recently, a more straightforward approach of both systems has been performed in (Costa-jussa et al., 2006) which simply selects, for each sentence, one of the provided hypotheses.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "In section 2, we briefly describe the phrase and the N-gram-based baseline systems.",
        "In the next section we present the evaluation framework.",
        "In Section 4 we report a structural comparison performed for both systems and, afterwards, in Section 5, we analyze the errors of both systems.",
        "Finally, in the last two sections we rescore and combine both systems, and the obtained results are discussed."

      "text": [
        "The basic idea of phrase-based translation is to segment the given source sentence into units (here called phrases), then translate each phrase and finally compose the target sentence from these phrase translations.",
        "In order to train these phrase-based models, an alignment between the source and target training sentences is found by using the standard IBM models in both directions (source-to-target and target-to-source) and combining the two obtained alignments.",
        "Given this alignment an extraction of contiguous phrases is carried out, specifically we extract all phrases that fulfill the following restrictions: all source (target) words within the phrase are aligned only to target (source) words within the phrase.",
        "The probability of these phrases is normally estimated by relative frequencies, normally in both directions, which are then combined in a log-linear way.",
        "In contrast with standard phrase-based approaches, the N-gram translation model uses tuples as bilingual units whose probabilities are estimated as an N-gram language model (Marinno et al., 2006).",
        "This model approximates the joint probability between the source and target languages by using N-grams.",
        "Given a word alignment, tuples define a unique and monotonic segmentation of each bilingual sentence, building up a much smaller set of units than with phrases and allowing N-gram estimation to account for the history of the translation process (Marinno et al., 2006).",
        "Both baseline systems are combined in a log-linear way with several additional feature functions: a target language model, a forward and a backward lexicon model and a word bonus are common features for both systems.",
        "The phrase-based system also introduces a phrase bonus model."

        "The corpus consists of the official version of the speeches held in the European Parliament Plenary Sessions (EPPS), as available on the web page of the European Parliament.",
        "Table 1 shows some statistics.",
        "The following tools have been used for building both systems: Word alignments were computed using GIZA++ (Och, 2003), language models were estimated using the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002), decoding was carried out by the free available MARIE decoder (Crego et al., 2005b) and the optimization was performed through an in-house implementation of the simplex method (Nelder and Mead, 1965)."

        "Both approaches aim at improving accuracy by including word context in the model.",

        "Additionally, the number of available translation units is shown, corresponding to number of available phrases for the phrase-based system and 1gram, 2gram and 3gram entries for the N-gram-based system.",
        "Results are computed on the development set.",
        "As it can be seen, the number of translation units is similar in both tasks for both systems (537k ~ 537k for Spanish to English and 594k ~ 651k for English to Spanish) while the time consumed in decoding is clearly higher for the phrase-based system.",
        "This can be explained by the fact that in the phrase-based approach, the same translation can be hypothesized following several segmentations of the input sentence, as phrases appear (and are collected) from multiple segmentations of the training sentence pairs.",
        "In other words, the search graph seems to be overpopulated under the phrase-based approach.",
        "Table 3 shows the effect on translation accuracy regarding the size of the beam in the search.",
        "Results are computed on the test set for the phrase-based and N-gram-based systems.",
        "Results of the N-gram-based system show that decreasing the beam size produces a clear reduction of the accuracy results.",
        "The phrase-based system shows that accuracy results remain very similar under the different settings.",
        "The reason is found on how translation models are used in the search.",
        "In the phrase-based approach, every partial hypothesis is scored uncontextualized, hence, a single score is used for a given partial hypothesis (phrase).",
        "In the N-gram-based approach, the model is intrinsically contextualized, which means that each partial hypothesis (tuple) depends on the preceding sequence of tuples.",
        "Thus, if a bad sequence of tuples (bad scored) is composed of a good initial sequence (well scored), it is placed on top of the first stacks (beam) and may cause the pruning of the rest of hypotheses.",

        "The most remarkable difference when comparing both systems is that the N-gram based system produces a relatively large amount of extra words (approximately 10%), while for the phrase-based system, this is only a minor problem (2% of the errors).",
        "In contrast the phrase-based system has more problems with incorrect translations, that is words for which a human can find a correspondence in the source text, but the translation is incorrect.",
        "Similar conclusions can be drawn for the inverse direction.",
