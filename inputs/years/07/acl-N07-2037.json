        "More recently, there is a significant effort focusing on integrating richer knowledge, such as syntactic parse trees (Huang and Knight, 2006) within the translation process to overcome the limitations of the phrase based models.",
        "The SMT has been formulated as a noisy channel model in which the target language sentence, e is seen as distorted by the channel into the foreign language f:",

        "The overwhelming proportion of the SMT research has been focusing on improving the translation model.",
        "Despite several new studies (Kirchhoff and Yang, 2004; Schwenk et al., 2006), language modeling for SMT has not been receiving much attention.",
        "Currently, the state-of-the-art SMT systems have been using the standard word n-gram models.",

        "associated with the stem.",
        "Hence, it is natural that this leads to rapid vocabulary growth, which is accompanied by worse language model probability estimation due to data sparsity and high Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) rate.",
        "Due to rich morphology, one would suspect that words may not be the best lexical units for Arabic, and perhaps morphological units would be a better choice.",
        "Recently, there have been a number of new methods using the morphological units to represent lexical items (Ghaoui et al., 2005; Xiang et al., 2006; Choueiter et al., 2006).",
        "Factored Language Models (FLMs) (Kirchhoff and Yang, 2004) share the same idea to some extent but here words are decomposed into a number of features and the resulting representation is used in a generalized back-off scheme to improve the robustness of probability estimates for rarely observed word «-grams.",
        "In this study we propose a tree structure called Morphological-Lexical Parse Tree (MLPT) to combine the information provided by a morphological analyzer with the lexical information within a single Joint Morphological-Lexical Language Model (JMLLM).",

        "In this study we use a rule-based morphological segmentation algorithm for Iraqi-Arabic (Afify et.",
        "al., 2006).",
        "This algorithm analyzes a given surface word, and generates one of the four possible segmentations: {stem, pre-fx+stem, suffix+stem, prefx+stem+suffx}.",
        "Here, stem includes those words that do not have any affixes.",
        "We use the longest prefixes (suffixes).",
        "Using finer affixes reduces the n-gram language model span, and leads to poor performance for a fixed n-gram size.",

        "In order to minimize the illegitimate segmentations we employ the following algorithm.",
        "Using the given set of prefixes and suffixes, a word is first blindly chopped to one of the four segmentations mentioned above.",

        "(1) The resulting stem has more than two characters.",
        "(2) The resulting stem is accepted by the Buckwalter morphological analyzer (Buckwalter, 2002).",
        "(3) The resulting stem exists in the original dictionary.",
        "The first rule eliminates many of the illegitimate segmentations.",
        "The second rule ensures that the word is a valid Arabic stem, given that the Buckwalter morphological analyzer covers all words in the Arabic language.",
        "Unfortunately, the fact that the stem is a valid Arabic stem does not always imply that the segmentation is valid.",
        "The third rule, while still not offering such guarantee, simply prefers keeping the word intact if its stem does not occur in the lexicon.",
        "In our implementation we used the following set of prefixes and suffixes for dialectal Iraqi:",
        "• Prefix list: {chAl, bhAl, lhAl, whAl, wbAl, wAl, bAl, hAl, EAl, fAl, Al, cd, ll, b, f, c, d, w}.",

        "These affixes are selected based on our knowledge of their adequacy for dialectal Iraqi Arabic.",
        "In addition, we found in preliminary experiments that keeping the top-N frequent decomposable words intact led to better performance.",
        "A value of N=5000 was experimentally found to work well in practice.",

        "The purpose of morphological analysis is to split a word into its constituting segments.",
        "Hence, a set of segments can form a meaningful lexical unit such as a word.",
        "There may be additional information for words or group of words, such as part-of-speech (POS) tags, syntactic (from parse tree) and semantic information, or morpheme and word attributes.",
        "For example, in Arabic and to a certain extent in French, some words can be masculine/feminine or singular/plural.",
        "All of these information sources can be represented using a what we call-Morphological-Lexical Parse Tree (MLPT).",
        "MLPT is a tree structured joint representation of lexical, morphological, attribute, syntactic and semantic content of the sentence.",
        "An example of a MLPT for an Arabic sentence is shown in Fig. 1.",
        "The leaves of the tree are morphemes that are predicted by the language model.",
        "Each morphological segment has one of the three attributes: {prefix, stem, suffix} as generated by the morphological analysis mentioned in Sec. 2.",
        "Each word can take three sets of attributes: {type, gender, number}.",

        "To compute the joint probability of the morpheme sequence and its MLPT, we use features extracted from MLPT.",

        "Therefore, the information we used from MLPT in Fig. 1 uses everything but the second row that contains lexical attributes (NFS, VFP, NFS, and NMP).",
        "Using the morphological segmentation improves the coverage, for example, splitting the word, as JLj (prefix) and (stem) as in Fig. 1, allows us to decode other combinations of this stem with the prefix and suffix list provided in Sec.2.",
        "These additional combinations certainly cover those words that are not seen in the unsegmented training data.",
        "The first step in building the MaxEnt model is to represent a MLPT as a sequence of morphological segments, morphological attributes, words, and word attributes using a bracket notation.",
        "Converting the MLPT into a text sequence allows us to group the semantically related morphological segments and their attributes.",
        "In this notation, each morphological segment is associated (this association is denoted by \"=\") with an attribute (i.e. prefix/stem/suffix) and the lexical items are represented by opening and closing tokens, [WORD and WORD] respectively.",

        "Given the bracket notation of the text, JMLLM can be trained in two ways with varying degrees of \"tightness of integration\".",

        "A tight integration method would require every token in the bracket representation to be an outcome of the joint model.",
