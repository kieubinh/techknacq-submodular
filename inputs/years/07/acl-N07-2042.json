        "In this paper we use the notion of virtual evidence in a graphical-model based system to reduce the amount of supervisory training data required for sequence learning tasks.",
        "We apply this approach to a TIMIT phone recognition system, and show that our VE-based training scheme can, relative to a baseline trained with the full segmentation, yield similar results with only 15.3% of the frames labeled (keeping the number of utterances fixed)."

        "Current state-of-the-art speech recognizers use thousands of hours of training data, collected from a large number of speakers with various backgrounds in order to make the models more robust.",
        "It is well known that one of the simplest ways of improving the accuracy of a recognizer is to increase the amount of training data.",
        "Moreover, speech recognition systems can benefit from being trained on hand-transcribed data where all the appropriate word level segmentations (i.e., the exact time of the word boundaries) are known.",
        "However, with increasing amounts of raw speech data being made available, it is both time consuming and expensive to accurately segment every word for every given sentence.",
        "Moreover, for languages for which only a small amount of training data is available, it can be expensive and challenging to annotate with precise word transcriptions - the researcher may have no choice but to use partially erroneous training data.",
        "There are a number of different ways to label data used to train a speech recognizer.",
        "First, the most expensive case (from an annotation perspective) is fully supervised training, where both word sequences and time segmentations are completely specified.",
        "A second case is most commonly used in speech recognition systems, where only the word sequences of utterances are given, but their precise segmentations are unknown.",
        "A third case falls under the realm of semi-supervised approaches.",
        "As one possible example, a previously trained recognizer is used to generate transcripts for unlabeled data, which are then used to retrain the recognizer based on some measure of recognizer confidence (Lamel et al., 2002).",
        "The above cases do not exhaust the set of possible training scenarios.",
        "In this paper, we show how the notion of virtual evidence (VE) (Pearl, 1988) may be used to obtain the benefits of data with time segmentations but using only partially labeled data.",
        "Our method lies somewhere between the first and second cases above.",
        "This general framework has been successfully applied in the past to the activity recognition domain (Subramanya et al., 2006).",
        "Here we make use of the TIMIT phone recognition task as an example to show how VE may be used to deal with partially labeled speech training data.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first system to express training uncertainty using VE in the speech domain."

        "We allow skips in each phone model, and At=0, indicates no transition, At=1 implies you transition to the next state, At=2 causes a state to skip (Ht+i = Ht + 2).",
        "As the TIMIT corpus provides phone level segmentations, Pt is observed during training.",
        "However, for reasons that will become clear in the next section, we treat Pt as hidden but make it the parent of a rv Ct, with, p(ct = 1\\pt) = Sit=pt where 1t is obtained from the transcriptions (1t £ Dpt).",
        "The above formulation has exactly the same effect as making Pt observed and setting it equal to 1t (Bilmes, 2004).",
        "Additional details on other CPTs in this model may be found in (Bilmes and Bartels, 2005).",
        "We provide more details on the baseline system in section 4.1.",
        "Our main reason for choosing the TIMIT phone recognition task is that TIMIT includes both sequence and segment transcriptions (something rare",

        "We used CI models primarily for the rapid experimental turnaround time and since it still provides a reasonable test-bed for evaluating new ideas.",
        "We do note, however, that our baseline CI system is competitive with recently published CD systems (Wang and Fosler-Lussier, 2006), albeit which uses many fewer components per mixture (see Section 4.1)."

        "There are number of different ways of choosing these functions.",
        "First, we can set ft(p) = gt(p) = a, a > 0.",

        "Alternatively, other functions could take into account the fact that, in the frames 'close' to t3, it is more likely to be p, whereas in the frames 'close' to t5, it is more likely to be p. This can be represented by using a decreasing function for ft(p) and an increasing function for gt(p) (for example linearly increasing or decreasing with time).",
        "As more frames are dropped around transitions (e.g., as t3 – t2 decreases), we use lesser amounts of labeled data.",
        "In an extreme situation, we can drop all the labels (t3 < t2) to recover the case where only sequence and not segment information is available.",
        "Alternatively, we can have t3 = t2 +1, which means that only one frame is labeled for every phone in an utterance – all other frames of a phone are left un-transcribed.",

        "We tested various cases of VE-based training by varying the amount of \"dropped\" frame labels on either side of the transition (the dropped labels became the unlabeled frames of Figure 2).",
