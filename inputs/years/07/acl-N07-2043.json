        "Customization to specific discourse domains and/or user requirements is one of the greatest challenges for today's Information Extraction (IE) systems.",
        "While demonstrably effective, both rule-based and supervised machine learning approaches to IE customization require a substantial development effort.",
        "For example, Aone and Ramos-Santacruz (2000) present a rule-based IE system which handles 100 types of relations and events.",
        "Building such a system requires the manual construction of numerous extraction patterns supported by customized ontologies.",
        "Soderland (1999) uses supervised learning to induce a set of rules from hand-tagged training examples.",
        "While Sonderland suggests that the human effort can be reduced by interleaving learning and manual annotation activities, the creation of training data remains an onerous task.",
        "To reduce the knowledge engineering burden on the user in constructing and porting an IE system, unsupervised learning has been utilized, e.g. Riloff (1996), Yangarber et al.",
        "(2000), and Sekine (2006).",
        "Banko et al.",
        "(2007) present a self-supervised system that aims to avoid the manual IE customization problem by extracting all possible relations of interest from text.",
        "Stevenson and Greenwood (2005) propose a weakly supervised approach to sentence filtering that uses semantic similarity and bootstrapping to acquire IE patterns.",
        "Stevenson's and Greenwood's approach provides some of the best available results in weakly supervised IE to date, with 0.58 F-measure.",
        "While very good, an F-measure of 0.58 does not provide sufficient reliability to grant use in a production system.",
        "In this paper, we show that it is possible to provide a significant improvement over Stevenson's and Greenwood's results, without increasing resource requirements, by integrating fully-supervised learning techniques within a weakly supervised IE approach.",
        "Our method is modeled on the approach developed by Stevenson and Greenwood (2005) but uses a different technique for ranking candidate patterns.",
        "Stevenson's and Greenwood's algorithm takes as data inputs a small set of initial seed patterns and a corpus of documents, and uses any of several semantic similarity measures (Resnik, 1995; Jiang and Conrath, 1997; Patwardhan et al., 2003) to iteratively identify patterns in the document corpus that bear a strong resemblance to the seed patterns.",
        "After each iteration, the top-ranking candidate patterns are added to the seed patterns and removed from the corpus.",
        "Our approach differs from that of Stevenson and Greenwood in that we use a supervised classifier to rank candidate patterns.",
        "This grants our system greater robustness and flexibility because the weight of classification features can be automatically determined within a supervised classification approach.",
        "In building supervised classifiers to rank candidate patterns at each iteration, we use both positive and negative training examples.",
        "Instead of creating manually annotated training examples, we follow an active learning approach where training examples are automatically chosen by ranking candidate patterns in terms of cosine similarity with the seed patterns.",
        "More specifically, we select patterns that have the lowest similarity with seed patterns to be the negative training examples.",
        "We hypothesized that these negative examples would contain many of the uninformative features occurring throughout the corpus and that using these examples would enable the classifier to determine that these features would not be useful.",
        "The pattern learning approach we propose includes the following steps.",
        "1.",
        "An unannotated corpus is required as input.",
        "For each sentence, a set of features is extracted.",
        "This information becomes Scand, the set of all candidate patterns.",
        "2.",
        "The user defines a set of seed patterns, Sseed.",
        "These patterns contain features expected to be found in a relevant sentence.",
        "3.",
        "The cosine measure is used to determine the distance between the patterns in Sseed and Scand.",
        "The patterns in Scand are then ordered by their lowest distance to a member of Sseed.",
        "4.",
        "The a highest ranked patterns in Scand are added to Spos, the set of positive training examples.",
        "5.",
        "Sseed and Sacc are added to Spos.",
        "Sneg, the set of negative training examples is constructed from P+iteration*y of the lowest ranked patterns in Scand.",
        "Then, a maximum entropy classifier is built using Spos and Sneg as training data.",
        "6.",
        "The classifier is used to score each pattern in Scand.",
        "Scand is then sorted by these scores.",
        "7.",
        "The top 5 patterns in Scand are added to Sacc and removed from Scand.",
        "8.",
        "If a suitable stopping point has been reached, the process ends.",
        "Otherwise, Spos and Sneg are emptied and the process continues at step 6.",
        "We set a to 5, p to 20, y to 15, 5 to 5, and used the following linguistic processing tools: (1) the OpenNLP library (opennlp.sourceforge.net) for sentence splitting and named-entity recognition, and (2) Connexor for syntactic parsing (Tapanainen and Jarvinen, 1997).",
        "For the classifier, we used the OpenNLP MaxEnt implementation (maxent.sourceforge.net) of the maximum entropy classification algorithm (Berger et al.",
        "1996).",
        "We used the MUC-6 data set as the testing ground for our proposed approach.",
        "Stevenson and Greenwood (2005) use subject-verb-object triples for their features.",
        "We use a richer feature set.",
        "Our system can easily accommodate more features because we let the maximum entropy classifier determine the weight for the features.",
        "Stevenson's and Greenwood's approach determines weights using semantic similarity and would require significant changes to take into account various other features, especially those for which a WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) similarity score is not available.",
        "We use single tokens, token combinations, and semantic information to inform our IE pattern extraction system.",
        "Lexical items marked by the named-entity recognition system as PERSON or ORGANIZATION are replaced with 'person' and 'organization', respectively.",
