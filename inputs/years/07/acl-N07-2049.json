        "Pitch reset refers to the speaker's general pitch declination through the course of a speech unit, followed by a reset to a high pitch at the start of next speech unit, as shown in Figure 1(a).",
        "The speech unit may be of different levels of granularity (Tseng et.",
        "al., 2005), such as a speech segment that conveys a central topic (e.g. a news story), a prosodic phrase group (PG) or an utterance.",
        "These units are often separated by pauses.",
        "Pauses and pitch resets were shown to be effective story boundary indicators in English broadcast news segmentation (Shriberg et.",
        "al., 2000; Tur et.",
        "al., 2001).",
        "These previous efforts specifically point out that pause durations are longer and pitch resets are more pronounced at story boundaries, when compared to utterance boundaries in English broadcast news.",
        "However, such story segmentation approaches may be different for a tonal language such as Mandarin Chinese.",
        "The use of similar prosodic features for Chinese news story segmentation deserves further investigation.",
        "The main reason is that Chinese tonal syllables may complicate the expressions of pitch resets.",
        "Chinese syllable tones are expressed acoustically in pitch trajectories, i.e, different tones show different pitch value ranges and trajectory patterns, as shown in Figure 1(b).",
        "Initial work in (Levow, 2004) has shown that Mandarin words at story ending positions show a lower pitch as compared with words at non-story-ending positions.",
        "In this paper, we present a data-oriented study to investigate how the tonality of Mandarin syllables affects pitch resets at utterance and story boundaries.",
        "To alleviate the effects from tonality, we propose to use speaker-and tone-normalized pitch reset with pause duration to separate Mandarin broadcast audio stream into distinct news stories.",

        "We assume that a story boundary must occur at an utterance boundary.",
        "The utterances are separated by labeled pauses in the VOA transcriptions ([P] in Figure 2) and a story may contain various utterances (between 2 to 38 in the corpus).",
        "Therefore, we only investigate pitch resets in inter-syllable regions across two consecutive utterances as shown in Figure 2.",
