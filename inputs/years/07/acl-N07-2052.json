        "Semantic similarity (SS) is typically defined via the lexical relations of synonymy (automobile - car) and hypernymy (vehicle - car), while semantic relatedness (SR) is defined to cover any kind of lexical or functional association that may exist between two words.",
        "Many NLP applications, like sense tagging or spelling correction, require knowledge about semantic relatedness rather than just similarity (Bu-danitsky and Hirst, 2006).",
        "For these tasks, it is not necessary to know the exact type of semantic relation between two words, but rather if they are closely semantically related or not.",
        "This is also true for the work presented herein, which is part of a project on electronic career guidance.",
        "In this domain, it is important to conclude that the words \"baker\" and \"bagel\" are closely related, while the exact type of a semantic relation does not need to be determined.",
        "As we work on German documents, we evaluate a number of SR measures on different German datasets.",
        "We show that the performance of measures strongly depends on the underlying knowledge source.",
        "While WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) models SR, wordnets for other languages, such as the German wordnet GermaNet (Kunze, 2004), contain only few links expressing SR.",
        "Thus, they are not well suited for estimating SR.",
        "Therefore, we apply the Wikipedia category graph as a knowledge source for SR measures.",
        "We show that Wikipedia based SR measures yield better correlation with human judgments on SR datasets than GermaNet measures.",
        "However, using Wikipedia also leads to a performance drop on SS datasets, as knowledge about classical taxonomic relations is not explicitly modeled.",
        "Therefore, we combine GermaNet with Wikipedia, and yield substantial improvements over measures operating on a single knowledge source."

        "Thus, she created a German dataset containing 350 word pairs (Gur350) containing nouns, verbs and adjectives that are connected by classical and non-classical relations (Morris and Hirst, 2004).",
