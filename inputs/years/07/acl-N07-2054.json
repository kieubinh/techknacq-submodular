        "Speech summarization, a technique of extracting key segments that convey the main content from a spoken document or audio document, has become a new area of study in the last few years.",
        "There has been much significant progress made in speech summarization for English or Japanese text and audio sources (Hori and Furui, 2003; Inoue et al., 2004; Koumpis and Renals, 2005; Maskey and Hirschberg, 2003; Maskey and Hirschberg, 2005).",
        "Some research efforts have focused on summarizing Mandarin sources (Chen et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2005), which are dependent on lexical features.",
        "Considering the difficulty in obtaining high quality transcriptions, some researchers proposed speech summarization systems with non-lexical features (Inoue et al., 2004; Koumpis and Renals, 2005; Maskey and Hirschberg, 2003; Maskey and Hirschberg, 2006).",
        "However, there does not exist any empirical study on speech summarization without lexical features for Mandarin Chinese sources.",
        "In this paper, we construct our summarizer with acoustic and structural features, which are independent of lexical features, and compare acoustic and structural features against lexical features as predictors of summary sentences.",
        "In Section 2 we review previous work on broadcast news summarization.",
        "We describe the Mandarin broadcast news corpus on which our system operates in Section 3.",
        "In Section 4 we describe our summarizer and these features used in experiments.",
        "We set up our experiments and evaluate the results in Section 5, followed by our conclusion in Section 6."

        "There have been many research efforts on speech summarization.",
        "Some methods dependent on lexical features are presented (Inoue et al., 2004; Chen 2004) uses statistical methods to identify words to include in a summary, based on linguistic and acous-tic/prosodic features of the Japanese broadcast news transcriptions; while (Chen et al., 2006) proposes the use of probabilistic latent topical information for extractive summarization of Mandarin spoken documents.",
        "(Huang et al., 2005) presents Mandarin spoken document summarization scheme using acoustic, prosodic, and semantic information.",

        "(Maskey and Hirschberg, 2006) focuses on how to use acoustic information alone to help predict sentences to be included in a summary and shows a novel way of using continuous HMMs for summarizing speech documents without transcriptions.",
        "It is advantageous to build speech summarization models without using lexical features: we can summarize speech data without placing a stringent demand on the speech recognition accuracy.",
        "In this paper, we propose one such model on Mandarin broadcast news and compare the effectiveness of acoustic and structural features against lexical features as predictors of summary sentences."

      "text": [
        "Acoustic/prosodic features in speech summarization system are usually extracted from audio data.",
        "Researchers commonly use acoustic/prosodic variation - changes in pitch, intensity, speaking rate - and duration of pause for tagging the important contents of their speeches (Hirschberg, 2002).",
        "We also use these features for predicting summary sentences on Mandarin broadcast news.",
        "Our acoustic feature set contains thirteen features: DurationI, Durationll, SpeakingRate, F0I, F0II, F0III, F0IV, F0V, EI, EII, EIII, EIV and EV.",
        "DurationI is the sentence duration.",
        "DurationII is the average phoneme duration.",
        "General phonetic studies consider that the speaking rate of sentence is reflected in syllable duration.",
        "So we use average syllable duration for representing SpeakingRate.",
        "F0I is F0's minimum value.",
        "F0II is F0's maximum value.",
        "F0III equals to the difference between F0II and F0I.",
        "F0IV is the mean of F0.",
        "F0V is F0 slope.",
        "EI is minimum energy value.",
        "EII is maximum energy value.",
        "EIII equals to the difference between EII and EI.",
        "EIV is the mean of energy value.",
        "EV is energy slope.",
        "We calculate DurationI from the annotated manual transcriptions that align the audio documents.",
        "We then obtain DurationII and SpeakingRate by phonetic forced alignment.",
        "Next we extract F0 features and energy features from audio data by using Praat (Boersma and Weenink, 1996).",
        "Each broadcast news of the 1997 Hub4 Mandarin corpus has similar structure, which starts with an anchor, followed by the formal report of the story by other reporters or interviewees.",
        "Our structural feature set consists of 4 features: Position, TurnI, TurnII and TurnIII.",
        "Position is defined as follows: one news has k sentences, then we set (1 – (0/k)) as Position value of the first sentence in the news, and set (1 – ((i – 1)/k)) as Position value of the ith sentence.",
        "TurnI is defined as follows: one news has m turns, then we set (1 – (0/m)) as TurnI value of the sentences which belong to the first turn's content, and set (1 – ((j – 1)/m)) as TurnI values of the sentences which belong to the jth turn's content.",
        "TurnII is the previous turn s TurnI value.",
        "TurnIII is the next turn s TurnI value.",
        "Most methods for text summarization mainly utilize lexical features.",
        "We are interested in investigating the role of lexical features in comparison to other features.",
        "All reference lexical features are extracted from the manual transcriptions.",
        "Our lexical feature set contains eight features: LenI, LenII, LenIII, NEI, NEII, NEIII, TFIDF and Cosine.",
        "For a sentence, we set the number of words in the sentence as LenI value.",
        "LenII is the previous sentence s LenI value.",
        "LenIII is the next sentence s LenI value.",
        "For a sentence, we set the number of Named Entities in the sentence as the NEI value.",
        "We define the number of Named Entities which appear in the sentence at the first time in a news as NEII value.",
        "NEIII value equals to the ratio of the number of unique Named Entities to the number of all Named Entities.",
        "TFIDF is the product of tf and idf.",
        "tf is the fraction: the numerator is the number of occurrences of the considered word and the denominator is the number of occurrences of all words in a story.",
        "idf is the logarithm of the fraction: the numerator is the total number of sentences in the considered news and the denominator is the number of sentences where the considered word appears.",
        "Cosine means cosine similarity measure between two sentence vectors.",
        "Our summarizer contains the preprocessing stage and the estimating stage.",
        "The preprocessing stage extracts features and normalizes all features by equation (1).",
        "Here, Wj is the original value of feature j which is used to describe sentence i; mean(wj) is the mean value of feature j in our training set or test set; dev(wj) is the standard deviation value of feature j in our training set or test set.",
        "The estimating stage predicts whether each sentence of the broadcast news is in a summary or not.",
        "We use Radial Basis Function(RBF) kernel for constructing SVM classifier as our estimator referring to LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2001), which is a library for support vector machines."
