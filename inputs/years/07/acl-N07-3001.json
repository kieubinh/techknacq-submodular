        "Compounds are semantic units containing at least two content-bearing morphemes.",
        "They function as one word, and are, in many languages, written as one word.",
        "In Swedish newspapers around 10% of the words have been found to be compounds (Hedlund, 2002).",
        "Since a compound has at least two content-bearing morphemes, a great part of the information is contained in the compounds, information which can be essential in retrieving relevant documents.",
        "I will study medical compounds, examining possible ways to expand queries in information retrieval using domain information.",
        "This information will guide the decision of when to include compound parts in search queries.",
        "The hypothesis is that components from the same domain as the compound itself, in this case the medical domain, will increase the effectiveness of the search, while components from other domains or standard language will not."

        "Information retrieval is about storing and organizing documents so that they can be found and retrieved when relevant to an information need (Baeza-Yates, and Ribiero-Neto, 1999).",
        "The words of the documents are stored in indexes.",
        "The user poses a query to the system containing words describing the information need.",
        "Words in the queries are matched against the indexed words.",
        "A ranking function finally ranks the documents in order of calculated relevance.",
        "The better the match, the higher a document is ranked.",
        "The goal of information retrieval is to retrieve as many documents relevant to an information need as possible, high recall, and to have as low proportion of irrelevant documents in the output as possible, high precision.",
        "Query expansion is modification of a query to improve retrieval effectiveness.",
        "This can be done by changing or increasing the term content of a query.",
        "In my work the strategy of expanding queries containing compounds, with selected compound components, is discussed.",
        "The strategy should result in higher recall, since more documents are likely to be retrieved.",
        "There is, however, a risk of lower precision, since irrelevant documents with certainty also will be retrieved.",
        "To minimize the decrease of precision, only components from the same domain as the compound itself will be used.",
        "Here, dealing with medical compounds, the objective is to decide if the components are from the medical domain."

        "A compound is, as mentioned above, a semantic unit with more than one content-bearing morpheme.",
        "In Swedish, compounding is a very productive morphological process.",
        "There is an infinite number of possible compounds, so it is impossible to list them all.",
        "They are also written as one word without the boundary between the parts marked in any way.",
        "Occasional compounds, not lexicalized but constructed when needed, usually have a transparent meaning, where the meaning can be derived from the meaning of the parts.",
        "These are called compositional compounds.",
        "Other compounds, with a meaning that has strayed from the combined meaning of the components, are called non-compositional compounds (Hedlund, 2002).",
        "Non-compositional compounds are often lexicalized with a fixed meaning.",
        "An example of a lexicalized non-compositional compound is tradgard 'tree yard', Swedish for 'garden', not necessarily a garden containing trees.",
        "In information retrieval, compositional and non-compositional compounds are best treated in different ways.",
        "Non-compositional compounds are often found in dictionaries and can be processed as they are.",
        "Using the components in queries would not benefit the result.",
        "If a query contains a compositional compound, the compound components might very well be used to expand the query, since they build up the meaning of the whole.",
        "When expanding queries with compound components, to increase recall, it is important to be aware that this could result in lower precision.",
        "This might be the case if the compound is non-compositional or if the parts are too general or used in other domains.",
        "In Ahlgren (2004) the author gives examples of when decomposition of compounds is useful and when it is not.",
        "For a compound such as fotboll 'foot ball' (soccer), expanding a query with fot and boll would probably result in lower precision.",
        "On the other hand, expanding a query containing the compound narkotikapolitik 'drug politics', with narkotika and politik would probably be more useful.",
        "Documents containing phrases like politik mot narkotika 'politics against drugs' could be retrieved.",
        "Documents containing narkotika or politik alone would also be found.",
        "Here one can speculate that documents containing narkotika have a good chance of being relevant, while the concept politik is broader and could cause retrieval of many irrelevant documents.",
        "My idea is to expand queries containing medical compounds by selecting components that also belong to the medical domain.",
        "Take the compound korsband 'cross band/tape' (cruciate ligament).",
        "Both parts belong to standard language.",
        "Including them would do more harm than good.",
        "In the case of aderbrdcksstrumpa 'varicose-veins stocking' the component aderbrdck seems to be a good candidate for query expansion, unlike strumpa, which belongs to standard language."

        "Medlex was created by adding medical vocabulary to a learner's dictionary, thus a great part of the compounds in Medlex are from the medical domain.",

        "Only one compound had a spurious substring tagged.",
        "One problem in decomposing compounds and using the medically tagged components to expand queries, is that many words that are medical in some meaning or facet are common in standard language.",
        "Even if we know that such a component is used in the medical sense in a query, expanding the query with that component would bring on irrelevant documents.",
        "Examples of words with such properties are hand 'hand' and hjarta 'heart'.",
        "Even though these words are used in medical senses they are also common in standard language, for example in lexicalized compounds or in phrases.",
        "In the tagger run with the decomposed list, most of the 276 words that were tagged as medical, though not used in the medical sense, had as a component one of only 16 basic words.",

        "The first step in my research is thus to create a Swedish medical test collection, the second to test query expansion strategies based on domain information, such as the one described here.",
        "The strategy described could be carried through not only in queries, but also in indexes.",
        "That is, if a document from the medical domain contains a medical compound, the index could contain not only the compound, but also its medical components.",
        "Still, a big challenge will be to work out how to deal with poly-semic and homonymic words and words with medical and non-medical facets."
