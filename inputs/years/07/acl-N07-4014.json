        "The system responds to n-best output from the speech recogniser, maintains multiple concurrent dialogue state hypotheses, and provides a visual display showing how competing hypotheses are ranked.",

        "1 Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes for Dialogue Systems Recent work on statistical models for spoken dialogue systems has argued that Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) provide a principled mathematical framework for modeling the uncertainty inherent in human-machine dialogue (Williams, 2006; Young, 2006; Williams and Young, 2007).",
        "Briefly speaking, POMDPs extend the traditional fully-observable Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework by maintaining a belief state, ie.",
        "a probability distribution over dialogue states.",
        "This enables the dialogue manager to avoid and recover from recognition errors by sharing and shifting probability mass between multiple hypotheses ofthe current dialogue state.",
        "The framework also naturally incorporates n-best lists of multiple recognition hypotheses coming from the speech recogniser.",
        "Due to the vast number ofpossible dialogue states and policies, the use of POMDPs in practical dialogue systems is far from straightforward.",
        "The size of the belief state scales linearly with the number of dialogue states and belief state updates at every turn during a dialogue require all state probabilities to be recomputed.",
        "This is too computationally intensive to be practical with current technology.",
        "Worse than that, the complexity involved in policy optimisation grows exponentially with the number of states and system actions and neither exact nor approximate algorithms exist that provide a tractable solution for systems with thousands of states."
