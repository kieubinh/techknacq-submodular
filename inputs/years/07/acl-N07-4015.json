        "In many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as question answering (QA), summarization, etc., we are faced with the problem of determining the appropriate granularity level for information units in order to conduct appropriate and effective evaluations.",
        "Most commonly, we use sentences to model individual pieces of information.",
        "However, more and more NLP applications require us to define text units smaller than sentences, essentially decomposing sentences into a collection of phrases.",
        "Each phrase carries an independent piece of information that can be used as a standalone unit.",
        "These finer-grained information units are usually referred to as nuggets.",
        "Previous work shows that humans can create nuggets in a relatively straightforward fashion.",
        "A serious problem in manual nugget creation is the inconsistency in human decisions (Lin and Hovy, 2003).",
        "The same nugget will not be marked consistently with the same words when sentences containing multiple instances of it are presented to human annotators.",
        "And if the annotation is performed over an extended period of time, the consistency is even lower.",
        "Given concerns over these issues, we have set out to design an evaluation toolkit to address three tasks in particular: 1) provide a consistent definition of what a nugget is; 2) automate the nugget extraction process systematically; and 3) utilize automatically extracted nuggets for text comparison and aggregation.",
        "The idea of using semantic equivalent nuggets to compare texts is not new.",
        "QA and summarization evaluations (Lin and Demner-Fushman, 2005; Nenkova and Passonneau, 2004) have been carried out by using a set of manually created nuggets and the comparison procedure itself is either automatic using n-gram overlap counting or manually performed.",
        "We envisage the nuggetization process being automated and nugget comparison and aggregation being performed by humans.",
        "It's crucial to still involve humans in the process because recognizing semantic equivalent text units is not a trivial task.",
        "In addition, since nuggets are system-produced and can be imperfect, annotators are allowed to reject and recreate them.",
        "We provide easy-to-use editing functionalities that allow manual overrides.",
        "Record keeping on edits over erroneous nuggets is conducted in the background so that further improvements can be made for nugget extraction."

        "• A nugget is predicated on either an event or an entity.",

        "• the head noun of the entity, or",
        "• the head verb of the event, plus the head noun of its associated entity (if more than one entity is attached to the verb, then its subject).",
        "The content is a coherent single piece of information associated with the anchor.",
        "Each anchor may have several separate contents.",
        "When the nugget contains nested sentences, this definition is applied recursively."

        "Nuggets are extracted by identifying subtrees that are descriptions for entities and events.",
        "For entities, we examine subtrees headed by \"NP\"; for events, subtrees headed by \"VP\" are examined and their corresponding subjects (siblings headed by \"NP\") are investigated as possible entity attachments for the verb phrases.",

        "Record keeping is conducted in the background automatically each time a nugget group is created.",
        "When the annotator changes the content of a nugget group, it indicates that either the system-extracted nuggets are not perfect or a super-nugget is created for the group (see Appendix B and C).",
        "These editing changes are recorded.",
