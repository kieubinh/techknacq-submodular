        "The machine translation task can be viewed as consisting of two subtasks: predicting the collection of words in a translation, and deciding the order of the predicted words.",
        "For some language pairs, such as English and Japanese, the ordering problem is especially hard, because the target word order differs significantly from the source word order.",
        "Previous work has shown that it is useful to model target language order in terms of movement of syntactic constituents in constituency trees (Yamada and Knight, 2001; Galley et al., 2006) or dependency trees (Quirk et al., 2005), which are obtained using a parser trained to determine linguistic constituency.",
        "Alternatively, order is modelled in terms of movement of automatically induced hierarchical structure of sentences (Chiang, 2005; Wu, 1997).",
        "* This research was conducted during the author's internship at Microsoft Research.",
        "The advantages of modeling how a target language syntax tree moves with respect to a source language syntax tree are that (i) we can capture the fact that constituents move as a whole and generally respect the phrasal cohesion constraints (Fox, 2002), and (ii) we can model broad syntactic reordering phenomena, such as subject-verb-object constructions translating into subject-object-verb ones, as is generally the case for English and Japanese.",
        "On the other hand, there is also significant amount of information in the surface strings of the source and target and their alignment.",
        "Many state-of-the-art SMT systems do not use trees and base the ordering decisions on surface phrases (Och and Ney, 2004; Al-Onaizan and Papineni, 2006; Kuhn et al., 2006).",
        "In this paper we develop an order model for machine translation which makes use of both syntactic and surface information.",
        "The framework for our statistical model is as follows.",
        "We assume the existence of a dependency tree for the source sentence, an unordered dependency tree for the target sentence, and a word alignment between the target and source sentences.",
        "Figure 1 (a) shows an example of aligned source and target dependency trees.",
        "Our task is to order the target dependency tree.",
        "We train a statistical model to select the best order of the unordered target dependency tree.",
        "An important advantage of our model is that it is global, and does not decompose the task of ordering a target sentence into a series of local decisions, as in the recently proposed order models for Machine Transition (Al-Onaizan and Papineni, 2006; Xiong et al., 2006; Kuhn et al., 2006).",

        "These N-best lists are generated using approximate search and simpler models, as in the re-ranking approach of (Collins, 2000).",
        "We first evaluate our model on the task of ordering target sentences, given correct (reference) unordered target dependency trees.",
        "Our results show that combining features derived from the source and target dependency trees, distortion surface order-based features (like the distortion used in Pharaoh (Koehn, 2004)) and language model-like features results in a model which significantly outperforms models using only some of the information sources.",

        "The ordering problem in MT can be formulated as the task of ordering a target bag of words, given a source sentence and word alignments between target and source words.",
        "In this work we also assume a source dependency tree and an unordered target dependency tree are given.",
        "Figure 1(a) shows an example.",
        "We build a model that predicts an order of the target dependency tree, which induces an order on the target sentence words.",
        "The dependency tree constrains the possible orders of the target sentence only to the ones that are projective with respect to the tree.",
        "An order of the sentence is projective with respect to the tree if each word and its descendants form a contiguous subsequence in the ordered sentence.",
        "Figure 1(b) shows several orders of the sentence which violate this constraint.",
        "Previous studies have shown that if both the source and target dependency trees represent linguistic constituency, the alignment between subtrees in the two languages is very complex (Wellington et al., 2006).",
        "Thus such parallel trees would be difficult for MT systems to construct in translation.",
        "In this work only the source dependency trees are linguistically motivated and constructed by a parser trained to determine linguistic structure.",
        "The target dependency trees are obtained through projection of the source dependency trees, using the word alignment (we use GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2004)), ensuring better parallelism of the source and target structures.",
        "Our algorithm for obtaining target dependency trees by projection of the source trees via the word alignment is the one used in the MT system of (Quirk et al., 2005).",
        "We describe the algorithm schematically using the example in Figure 1.",
        "Projection of the dependency tree through alignments is not at all straightforward.",
        "One of the reasons of difficulty is that the alignment does not represent an isomorphism between the sentences, i.e. it is very often not a one-to-one and onto mapping.",
        "If the alignment were one-to-one we could define the parent of a word wt in the target to be the target word aligned to the parent of the source word s aligned to wt.",
        "An additional difficulty is that such a definition could result in a non-projective target dependency tree.",
        "The projection algorithm of (Quirk et al., 2005) defines heuristics for each of these problems.",
        "In case of one-to-many alignments, for example, the case of \"constraints\" aligning to the Japanese words for \"restriction\" and \"condition\", the algorithm creates a",
        "'For example, in the first order shown, the descendants of word 6 are not contiguous and thus this order violates the constraint.",
        "subtree in the target rooted at the rightmost of these words and attaches the other word(s) to it.",
        "In case of non-projectivity, the dependency tree is modified by reattaching nodes higher up in the tree.",
        "Such a step is necessary for our example sentence, because the translations of the words \"all\" and \"constraints\" are not contiguous in the target even though they form a constituent in the source.",
        "An important characteristic of the projection algorithm is that all of its heuristics use the correct target word order.",
        "Thus the target dependency trees encode more information than is present in the source dependency trees and alignment.",
        "Our model uses input of the same form when trained/tested on reference sentences and when used in machine translation: a source sentence with a dependency tree, an unordered target sentence with and unordered target dependency tree, and word alignments.",
        "We train our model on reference sentences.",
        "In this setting, the given target dependency tree contains the correct bag of target words according to a reference translation, and is projective with respect to the correct word order of the reference by construction.",
        "We also evaluate our model in this setting; such an evaluation is useful because we can isolate the contribution of an order model, and develop it independently of an MT system.",
        "When translating new sentences it is not possible to derive target dependency trees by the projection algorithm described above.",
        "In this setting, we use target dependency trees constructed by our baseline MT system (described in detail in 6.1).",
        "The system constructs dependency trees of the form shown in Figure 1 for each translation hypothesis.",
