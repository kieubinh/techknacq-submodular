        "Many words have multiple meanings, depending on the context in which they are used.",
        "Word sense disambiguation (WSD) is the task of determining the correct meaning or sense of a word in context.",
        "WSD is regarded as an important research problem and is assumed to be helpful for applications such as machine translation (MT) and information retrieval.",
        "In translation, different senses of a word w in a source language may have different translations in a target language, depending on the particular meaning of w in context.",
        "Hence, the assumption is that in resolving sense ambiguity, a WSD system will be able to help an MT system to determine the correct translation for an ambiguous word.",
        "To determine the correct sense of a word, WSD systems typically use a wide array of features that are not limited to the local context of w, and some of these features may not be used by state-of-the-art statistical MT systems.",
        "To perform translation, state-of-the-art MT systems use a statistical phrase-based approach (Marcu and Wong, 2002; Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney, 2004) by treating phrases as the basic units of translation.",
        "In this approach, a phrase can be any sequence of consecutive words and is not necessarily linguistically meaningful.",
        "Capitalizing on the strength of the phrase-based approach, Chiang (2005) introduced a hierarchical phrase-based statistical MT system, Hiero, which achieves significantly better translation performance than Pharaoh (Koehn, 2004a), which is a state-of-the-art phrase-based statistical MT system.",
        "Recently, some researchers investigated whether performing WSD will help to improve the performance of an MT system.",
        "Carpuat and Wu (2005) integrated the translation predictions from a Chinese WSD system (Carpuat et al., 2004) into a Chinese-English word-based statistical MT system using the ISI ReWrite decoder (Germann, 2003).",
        "Though they acknowledged that directly using English translations as word senses would be ideal, they instead predicted the HowNet sense of a word and then used the English gloss of the HowNet sense as the WSD model's predicted translation.",
        "They did not incorporate their WSD model or its predictions into their translation model; rather, they used the WSD predictions either to constrain the options available to their decoder, or to postedit the output of their decoder.",
        "They reported the negative result that WSD decreased the performance of MT based on their experiments.",
        "In another work (Vickrey et al., 2005), the WSD problem was recast as a word translation task.",
        "The translation choices for a word w were defined as the set of words or phrases aligned to w, as gathered from a word-aligned parallel corpus.",
        "The authors showed that they were able to improve their model's accuracy on two simplified translation tasks: word translation and blank-filling.",
        "Recently, Cabezas and Resnik (2005) experimented with incorporating WSD translations into Pharaoh, a state-of-the-art phrase-based MT system (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "Their WSD system provided additional translations to the phrase table of Pharaoh, which fired a new model feature, so that the decoder could weigh the additional alternative translations against its own.",
        "However, they could not automatically tune the weight of this feature in the same way as the others.",
        "They obtained a relatively small improvement, and no statistical significance test was reported to determine if the improvement was statistically significant.",
        "Note that the experiments in (Carpuat and Wu, 2005) did not use a state-of-the-art MT system, while the experiments in (Vickrey et al., 2005) were not done using a full-fledged MT system and the evaluation was not on how well each source sentence was translated as a whole.",
        "The relatively small improvement reported by Cabezas and Resnik (2005) without a statistical significance test appears to be inconclusive.",
        "Considering the conflicting results reported by prior work, it is not clear whether a WSD system can help to improve the performance of a state-of-the-art statistical MT system.",
        "In this paper, we successfully integrate a state-of-the-art WSD system into the state-of-the-art hierarchical phrase-based MT system, Hiero (Chiang, 2005).",
        "The integration is accomplished by introducing two additional features into the MT model which operate on the existing rules of the grammar, without introducing competing rules.",
        "These features are treated, both in feature-weight tuning and in decoding, on the same footing as the rest of the model, allowing it to weigh the WSD model predictions against other pieces of evidence so as to optimize translation accuracy (as measured by BLEU).",
        "The contribution of our work lies in showing for the first time that integrating a WSD system significantly improves the performance of a state-of-the-art statistical MT system on an actual translation task.",
        "In the next section, we describe our WSD system.",
        "Then, in Section 3, we describe the Hiero MT system and introduce the two new features used to integrate the WSD system into Hiero.",
        "In Section 4, we describe the training data used by the WSD system.",
        "In Section 5, we describe how the WSD translations provided are used by the decoder of the MT system.",
        "In Section 6 and 7, we present and analyze our experimental results, before concluding in Section 8."

        "where X is a non-terminal symbol, 7 (a) is a string of terminal and non-terminal symbols in the source (target) language, and there is a one-to-one correspondence between the non-terminals in 7 and a indicated by co-indexation.",

        "Hiero extracts the synchronous CFG rules automatically from a word-aligned parallel corpus.",
        "To translate a source sentence, the goal is to find its most probable derivation using the extracted grammar rules.",

        "To ensure efficient decoding, the ^i are subject to certain locality restrictions.",
        "Essentially, they should be defined as products of functions defined on isolated synchronous CGF rules; however, it is possible to extend the domain of locality of the features somewhat.",
        "A n-gram language model adds a dependence on (n – 1) neighboring target-side words (Wu, 1996; Chiang, 2007), making decoding much more difficult but still polynomial; in this paper, we add features that depend on the neighboring source-side words, which does not affect decoding complexity at all because the source string is fixed.",
        "In principle we could add features that depend on arbitrary source-side context.",
        "To incorporate WSD into Hiero, we use the translations proposed by the WSD system to help Hiero obtain a better or more probable derivation during the translation of each source sentence.",
        "To achieve this, when a grammar rule R is considered during decoding, and we recognize that some of the terminal symbols (words) in a are also chosen by the WSD system as translations for some terminal symbols (words) in 7, we compute the following features:",

        "When limited to the set of 374 sentences which were judged by the Collins sign-test to have better translations from Hiero+WSD than from Hiero, a higher number (11.14) of proposed translations were used on average.",

        "Table 3 gives a detailed breakdown of these figures according to the number of words in each proposed translation.",
        "For instance, over all the test sentences, the WSD module gave 7087 translations of single-word length, and 77.31% of these translations match their respective reference sentences.",

        "After the experiments in Section 6 were completed, we visually inspected the translation output of Hiero and Hiero+WSD to categorize the ways in which integrating WSD contributes to better translations.",

        "By providing the correct translation of \"unable to obtain\" for \"m /k IXH\", the translation output ofHiero+WSD is more complete.",
        "A second way in which WSD helps is by correcting a previously incorrect translation.",
        "For example, for the Chinese sentence \"... , iSh 1=k H i§- M A S , ...\", the WSD system helps to correct Hiero's original translation by providing the correct translation of \"all ethnic groups\" for the Chinese phrase M\":",

        "We have shown that WSD improves the translation performance of a state-of-the-art hierarchical phrase-based statistical MT system and this improvement is statistically significant.",
        "We have also demonstrated one way to integrate a WSD system into an MT system without introducing any rules that compete against existing rules, and where the feature-weight tuning and decoding place the WSD system on an equal footing with the other model components.",
        "For future work, an immediate step would be for the WSD classifier to provide translations for longer Chinese phrases.",
        "Also, different alternatives could be tried to match the translations provided by the WSD classifier against the chunks of rules.",
        "Finally, besides our proposed approach of integrating WSD into statistical MT via the introduction of two new features, we could explore other alternative ways of integration."
