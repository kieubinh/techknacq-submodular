        "Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is concerned with the identification of the meaning of ambiguous words in context.",
        "For example, among the possible senses of the verb \"run\" are \"to move fast by using one's feet\" and \"to direct or control\".",
        "WSD can be useful for many applications, including information retrieval, information extraction and machine translation.",
        "Sense ambiguity has been recognized as one of the most important obstacles to successful language understanding since the early 1960's and many techniques have been proposed to solve the problem.",
        "Recent approaches focus on the use of various lexical resources and corpus-based techniques in order to avoid the substantial effort required to codify linguistic knowledge.",
        "These approaches have shown good results; particularly those using supervised learning (see Mihalcea et al., 2004 for an overview of state-of-the-art systems).",
        "However, current approaches rely on limited knowledge representation and modeling techniques: traditional machine learning algorithms and attribute-value vectors to represent disambiguation instances.",
        "This has made it difficult to exploit deep knowledge sources in the generation of the disambiguation models, that is, knowledge that goes beyond simple features extracted directly from the corpus, like bags-of-words and collocations, or provided by shallow natural language tools like part-of-speech taggers.",
        "In this paper we present a novel approach for WSD that follows a hybrid strategy, i.e. combines knowledge and corpus-based evidence, and employs a first-order formalism to allow the representation of deep knowledge about disambiguation examples together with a powerful modeling technique to induce theories based on the examples and background knowledge.",
        "This is achieved using Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) (Muggleton, 1991), which has not yet been applied to WSD.",
        "Our hypothesis is that by using a very expressive representation formalism, a range of (shallow and deep) knowledge sources and ILP as learning technique, it is possible to generate models that, when compared to models produced by machine learning algorithms conventionally applied to",
        "WSD, are both more accurate for fine-grained distinctions, and \"interesting\", from a knowledge acquisition point of view (i.e., convey potentially new knowledge that can be easily interpreted by humans).",
        "WSD systems have generally been more successful in the disambiguation of nouns than other grammatical categories (Mihalcea et al., 2004).",
        "A common approach to the disambiguation of nouns has been to consider a wide context around the ambiguous word and treat it as a bag of words or limited set of collocates.",
        "However, disambiguation of verbs generally benefits from more specific knowledge sources, such as the verb's relation to other items in the sentence (for example, by analysing the semantic type of its subject and object).",
        "Consequently, we believe that the disambiguation of verbs is task to which ILP is particularly well-suited.",
        "Therefore, this paper focuses on the disambiguation of verbs, which is an interesting task since much of the previous work on WSD has concentrated on the disambiguation of nouns.",
        "WSD is usually approached as an independent task, however, it has been argued that different applications may have specific requirements (Res-nik and Yarowsky, 1997).",
        "For example, in machine translation, WSD, or translation disambiguation, is responsible for identifying the correct translation for an ambiguous source word.",
        "There is not always a direct relation between the possible senses for a word in a (monolingual) lexicon and its translations to a particular language, so this represents a different task to WSD against a (monolingual) lexicon (Hutchins and Somers, 1992).",
        "Although it has been argued that WSD does not yield better translation quality than a machine translation system alone, it has been recently shown that a WSD module that is developed following specific multilingual requirements can significantly improve the performance of a machine translation system (Carpuat et al., 2006).",
        "This paper focuses on the application of our approach to the translation of verbs in English to Portuguese translation, specifically for a set of 10 mainly light and highly ambiguous verbs.",
        "We also experiment with a monolingual task by using the verbs from Senseval-3 lexical sample task.",
        "We explore knowledge from 12 syntactic, semantic and pragmatic sources.",
        "In principle, the proposed approach could also be applied to any lexical disambiguation task by customizing the sense repository and knowledge sources.",
        "In the remainder of this paper we first present related approaches to WSD and discuss their limitations (Section 2).",
        "We then describe some basic concepts on ILP and our application of this technique to WSD (Section 3).",
        "Finally, we described our experiments and their results (Section 4)."

        "WSD approaches can be classified as (a) knowledge-based approaches, which make use of linguistic knowledge, manually coded or extracted from lexical resources (Agirre and Rigau, 1996; Lesk 1986); (b) corpus-based approaches, which make use of shallow knowledge automatically acquired from corpus and statistical or machine learning algorithms to induce disambiguation models (Yarowsky, 1995; Schütze 1998); and (c) hybrid approaches, which mix characteristics from the two other approaches to automatically acquire disambiguation models from corpus supported by linguistic knowledge (Ng and Lee 1996; Stevenson and Wilks, 2001).",
        "Hybrid approaches can combine advantages from both strategies, potentially yielding accurate and comprehensive systems, particularly when deep knowledge is explored.",
        "Linguistic knowledge is available in electronic resources suitable for practical use, such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), dictionaries and parsers.",
        "However, the use of this information has been hampered by the limitations of the modeling techniques that have been explored so far: using deep sources of domain knowledge is beyond the capabilities of such techniques, which are in general based on attribute-value vector representations.",
        "Attribute-value vectors consist of a set of attributes intended to represent properties of the examples.",
        "Each attribute has a type (its name) and a single value for a given example.",
        "Therefore, attribute-value vectors have the same expressiveness as propositional formalisms, that is, they only allow the representation of atomic propositions and constants.",
        "These are the representations used by most of the machine learning algorithms conventionally employed to WSD, for example Naive Bayes and decision-trees.",
        "First-order logic, a more expressive formalism which is employed by ILP, allows the representation of variables and nary predicates, i.e., relational knowledge.",
        "In the hybrid approaches that have been explored so far, deep knowledge, like selectional preferences, is either preprocessed into a vector representation to accommodate machine learning algorithms, or used in previous steps to filter out possible senses e.g. (Stevenson and Wilks, 2001).",
        "This may cause information to be lost and, in addition, deep knowledge sources cannot interact in the learning process.",
        "As a consequence, the models produced reflect only the shallow knowledge that is provided to the learning algorithm.",
        "Another limitation of attribute-value vectors is the need for a unique representation for all the examples: one attribute is created for every knowledge feature and the same structure is used to characterize all the examples.",
        "This usually results in a very sparse representation of the data, given that values for certain features will not be available for many examples.",
        "The problem of data sparseness increases as more knowledge is exploited and this can cause problems for the machine learning algorithms.",
        "A final disadvantage of attribute-value vectors is that equivalent features may have to be bounded to distinct identifiers.",
        "An example of this occurs when the syntactic relations between words in a sentence are represented by attributes for each possible relation, sentences in which there is more than one instantiation for a particular grammatical role cannot be easily represented.",
        "For example, the sentence \"John and Anna gave Mary a present.\"",
        "contains a coordinate subject and, since each feature requires a unique identifier, two are required (subj1-verb1, subj2-verb1).",
        "These will be treated as two independent pieces of knowledge by the learning algorithm.",
        "First-order formalisms allow a generic predicate to be created for every possible syntactic role, relating two or more elements.",
        "For example has_subject(verb, subject), which could then have two instantiations: has_subject(give, john) and has_subject(give, anna).",
        "Since each example is represented independently from the others, the data sparseness problem is minimized.",
        "Therefore, ILP seems to provide the most general-purpose framework for dealing with such data: it does not suffer from the limitations mentioned above since there are explicit provisions made for the inclusion of background knowledge of any form, and the representation language is powerful enough to capture contextual relationships."

        "It is worth noticing that we experimented with a few relevant parameters for both Aleph and the other learning algorithms.",
        "Values that yielded the best average predictive accuracy in the training sets were assumed to be optimal and used to evaluate the test sets.",
        "Table 3 shows the average accuracy obtained by Aleph in the monolingual task (Senseval-3 verbs with fine-grained sense distinctions and using the evaluation system provided by Senseval).",
        "It also shows the average accuracy of the most frequent sense and accuracies reported on the same set of verbs by the best systems submitted by the sites which participated in this task.",
        "Syntalex-3 (Mohammad and Pedersen, 2004) is based on an ensemble of bagged decision trees with narrow context part-of-speech features and bigrams.",
        "CLaC1 (Lamjiri et al., 2004) uses a Naive Bayes algorithm with a dynamically adjusted context window around the target word.",
        "Finally, MC-WSD (Ciaramita and Johnson, 2004) is a multi-class averaged perceptron classifier using syntactic and narrow context features, with one component trained on the data provided by Senseval and other trained on WordNet glosses.",
        "As we can see in Table 3, results are very encouraging: even without being particularly customized for this monolingual task, the ILP approach significantly outperforms the majority sense baseline and performs as well as the state-of-the-art system reporting results for the same set of verbs.",
        "As with the multilingual task, the models produced contain a small number of rules (from 6, for verbs with a few examples, to 88) and all knowledge sources are used across different rules and verbs.",
        "In general, results from both multilingual and monolingual tasks demonstrate that the hypothesis put forward in Section 1, that ILP's ability to generate expressive rules which combine and integrate a wide range of knowledge sources is beneficial for WSD systems, is correct."

        "We have introduced a new hybrid approach to WSD which uses ILP to combine deep and shallow knowledge sources.",
        "ILP induces expressive disambiguation models which include relations between knowledge sources.",
        "It is an interesting approach to learning which has been considered promising for several applications in natural language processing and has been explored for a few of them, namely POS-tagging, grammar acquisition and semantic parsing (Cussens et al., 1997; Mooney, 1997).",
        "This paper has demonstrated that ILP also yields good results for WSD, in particular for the disambiguation of verbs.",
        "We plan to further evaluate our approach for other sets of words, including other parts-of-speech to allow further comparisons with other approaches.",
        "For example, Dang and Palmer (2005) also use a rich set of features with a traditional learning algorithm (maximum entropy).",
        "Currently, we are evaluating the role of the WSD models for the 10 verbs of the multilingual task in an English-Portuguese statistical machine translation system.",
