        "In natural language, a word often assumes different meanings, and the task of determining the correct meaning, or sense, of a word in different contexts is known as word sense disambiguation (WSD).",
        "To date, the best performing systems in WSD use a corpus-based, supervised learning approach.",
        "With this approach, one would need to collect a text corpus, in which each ambiguous word occurrence is first tagged with its correct sense to serve as training data.",
        "The reliance of supervised WSD systems on annotated corpus raises the important issue of domain dependence.",
        "To investigate this, Escudero et al.",
        "(2000) and Martinez and Agirre (2000) conducted experiments using the DSO corpus, which contains sentences from two different corpora, namely Brown Corpus (BC) and Wall Street Journal (WSJ).",
        "They found that training a WSD system on one part (BC or WSJ) of the DSO corpus, and applying it to the other, can result in an accuracy drop of more than 10%, highlighting the need to perform domain adaptation of WSD systems to new domains.",
        "Escudero et al.",
        "(2000) pointed out that one of the reasons for the drop in accuracy is the difference in sense priors (i.e., the proportions of the different senses of a word) between BC and WSJ.",
        "When the authors assumed they knew the sense priors of each word in BC and WSJ, and adjusted these two datasets such that the proportions of the different senses of each word were the same between BC and WSJ, accuracy improved by 9%.",
        "In this paper, we explore domain adaptation of WSD systems, by adding training examples from the new domain as additional training data to a WSD system.",
        "To reduce the effort required to adapt a WSD system to a new domain, we employ an active learning strategy (Lewis and Gale, 1994) to select examples to annotate from the new domain of interest.",
        "To our knowledge, our work is the first to use active learning for domain adaptation for WSD.",
        "A similar work is the recent research by Chen et al.",
        "(2006), where active learning was used successfully to reduce the annotation effort for WSD of 5 English verbs using coarse-grained evaluation.",
        "In that work, the authors only used active learning to reduce the annotation effort and did not deal with the porting of a WSD system to a new domain.",
        "Domain adaptation is necessary when the training and target domains are different.",
        "In this paper, we perform domain adaptation for WSD of a set of nouns using fine-grained evaluation.",
        "The contribution of our work is not only in showing that active learning can be successfully employed to reduce the annotation effort required for domain adaptation in a fine-grained WSD setting.",
        "More importantly, our main focus and contribution is in showing how we can improve the effectiveness of a basic active learning approach when it is used for domain adaptation.",
        "In particular, we explore the issue of different sense priors across different domains.",
        "Using the sense priors estimated by expectation-maximization (EM), the predominant sense in the new domain is predicted.",
        "Using this predicted predominant sense and adopting a count-merging technique, we improve the effectiveness of the adaptation process.",
        "In the next section, we discuss the choice of corpus and nouns used in our experiments.",
        "We then introduce active learning for domain adaptation, followed by count-merging.",
        "Next, we describe an EM-based algorithm to estimate the sense priors in the new domain.",
        "Performance of domain adaptation using active learning and count-merging is then presented.",
        "Next, we show that by using the predominant sense of the target domain as predicted by the EM-based algorithm, we improve the effectiveness of the adaptation process.",
        "Our empirical results show that for the set of nouns which have different predominant senses between the training and target domains, we are able to reduce the annotation effort by 71%."

        "In this section, we discuss the motivations for choosing the particular corpus and the set ofnouns to conduct our domain adaptation experiments.",
        "The DSO corpus (Ng and Lee, 1996) contains 192,800 annotated examples for 121 nouns and 70 verbs, drawn from BC and WSJ.",
        "While the BC is built as a balanced corpus, containing texts in various categories such as religion, politics, humanities, fiction, etc, the WSJ corpus consists primarily of business and financial news.",
        "Exploiting the difference in coverage between these two corpora, Es-cudero et al.",
        "(2000) separated the DSO corpus into its BC and WSJ parts to investigate the domain dependence of several WSD algorithms.",
        "Following the setup of (Escudero et al., 2000), we similarly made use of the DSO corpus to perform our experiments on domain adaptation.",
        "Among the few currently available manually sense-annotated corpora for WSD, the SEMCOR (SC) corpus (Miller et al., 1994) is the most widely used.",
        "SEMCOR is a subset of BC which is sense-annotated.",
        "Since BC is a balanced corpus, and since performing adaptation from a general corpus to a more specific corpus is a natural scenario, we focus on adapting a WSD system trained on BC to WSJ in this paper.",
        "Henceforth, out-of-domain data will refer to BC examples, and in-domain data will refer to WSJ examples.",
        "The WordNet Domains resource (Magnini and Cavaglia, 2000) assigns domain labels to synsets in WordNet.",
        "Since the focus of the WSJ corpus is on business and financial news, we can make use of WordNet Domains to select the set of nouns having at least one synset labeled with a business or finance related domain label.",
        "This is similar to the approach taken in (Koeling et al., 2005) where they focus on determining the predominant sense of words in corpora drawn from finance versus sports domains.Hence, we select the subset of DSO nouns that have at least one synset labeled with any of these domain labels: commerce, enterprise, money, finance, banking, and economy.",
        "This gives a set of 21 nouns: book, business, center, community, condition, field, figure, house, interest, land, line, money, need, number, order, part, power, society, term, use, value.",
        "For each noun, all the BC examples are used as out-of-domain training data.",
        "One-third of the WSJ examples for each noun are set aside as evaluation",
        "Table 1: The average number of senses in BC and WSJ, average MFS accuracy, average number of BC training, and WSJ adaptation examples per noun.",

        "The row 21 nouns in Table 1 shows some information about these 21 nouns.",
        "For instance, these nouns have an average of 6.7 senses in BC and 6.8 senses in WSJ.",
        "This is slightly higher than the 5.8 senses per verb in (Chen et al., 2006), where the experiments were conducted using coarse-grained evaluation.",
        "Assuming we have access to an \"oracle\" which determines the predominant sense, or most frequent sense (MFS), of each noun in our WSJ test data perfectly, and we assign this most frequent sense to each noun in the test data, we will have achieved an accuracy of 61.1% as shown in the column MFS accuracy of Table 1.",

        "Note that this represents a more effective adaptation process than the basic active learning a approach, which requires 51% adaptation examples.",
