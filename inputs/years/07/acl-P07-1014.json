        "Redundancy is a strikingly common phenomenon that is observed across many natural systems.",
        "This redundancy is present mainly to reduce the risk of the complete loss of information that might occur due to accidental errors (Krakauer and Plotkin, 2002).",
        "Moreover, redundancy is found in every level of granularity of a system.",
        "For instance, in biological systems we find redundancy in the codons (Lesk, 2002), in the genes (Woollard, 2005) and as well in the proteins (Gatlin, 1974).",
        "A linguistic system is also not an exception.",
        "There is for example, a number of words with the same meaning (synonyms) in almost every language of the world.",
        "Similarly, the basic unit of language, the human speech sounds or the phonemes, is also expected to exhibit some sort of a redundancy in the information that it encodes.",
        "In this work, we attempt to mathematically capture the redundancy observed across the sound (more specifically the consonant) inventories of the world's languages.",
        "For this purpose, we present an information theoretic definition of redundancy, which is calculated based on the set of features (Trubetzkoy, 1931) that are used to express the consonants.",
        "An interesting observation is that this quantitative feature-based measure of redundancy is almost an invariance over the consonant inventories of the world's languages.",
        "The observation is important since it can shed enough light on the organization of the consonant inventories, which unlike the vowel inventories, lack a complete and holistic explanation.",
        "The invariance of our measure implies that every inventory tries to be similar in terms of the measure, which leads us to argue that redundancy plays a very important role in shaping the structure of the consonant inventories.",
        "In order to validate this argument we determine the possibility of observing such an invariance if the consonant inventories had evolved by random chance.",
        "We find that the redundancy observed across the randomly generated inventories is substantially different from their real counterparts, which leads us to conclude that the invariance is not just \"by-chance\" and the measure that we define, indeed, largely governs the organizing principles of the consonant inventories.",
        "Interestingly, this redundancy, when measured for the vowel inventories, does not exhibit any similar invariance.",
        "This immediately reveals that the principles that govern the formation of these two types of inventories are quite different in nature.",
        "Such an observation is significant since whether or not these principles are similar/different for the two inventories had been a question giving rise to perennial debate among the past researchers (Trubet-zkoy, 1969/1939; Lindblom and Maddieson, 1988; Boersma, 1998; Clements, 2004).",
        "A possible reason for the observed dichotomy in the behavior of the vowel and consonant inventories with respect to redundancy can be as follows: while the organization of the vowel inventories is known to be governed by a single force - the maximal perceptual contrast (Jakobson, 1941; Liljencrants and Lind-blom, 1972; de Boer, 2000)), consonant inventories are shaped by a complex interplay of several forces (Mukherjee et al., 2006).",
        "The invariance of redundancy, perhaps, reflects some sort of an equilibrium that arises from the interaction of these divergent forces.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "In section 2 we briefly discuss the earlier works in connection to the sound inventories and then systematically build up the quantitative definition of redundancy from the linguistic theories that are already available in the literature.",
        "Section 3 details out the data source necessary for the experiments, describes the baseline for the experiments, reports the experiments performed, and presents the results obtained each time comparing the same with the baseline results.",
        "Finally we conclude in section 4 by summarizing our contributions, pointing out some of the implications of the current work and indicating the possible future directions."

      "text": [
        "Linguistic research has documented a wide range of regularities across the sound systems of the world's languages.",
        "It has been postulated earlier by functional phonologists that such regularities are the consequences of certain general principles like maximal perceptual contrast (Liljencrants and Lindblom, 1972), which is desirable between the phonemes of a language for proper perception of each individual phoneme in a noisy environment, ease of articulation (Lindblom and Maddieson, 1988; de Boer, 2000), which requires that the sound systems of all languages are formed of certain universal (and highly frequent) sounds, and ease of learnability(de Boer, 2000), which is necessary for a speaker to learn the sounds of a language with minimum effort.",
        "In fact, the organization of the vowel inventories (especially those with a smaller size) across languages has been satisfactorily explained in terms of the single principle of maximal perceptual contrast (Jakobson, 1941; Liljencrants and Lindblom, 1972; de Boer, 2000).",
        "On the other hand, in spite of several attempts (Lindblom and Maddieson, 1988; Boersma, 1998; Clements, 2004) the organization of the consonant inventories lacks a satisfactory explanation.",
        "However, one of the earliest observations about the consonant inventories has been that consonants tend to occur in pairs that exhibit strong correlation in terms of their features (Trubetzkoy, 1931).",
        "In order to explain these trends, feature economy was proposed as the organizing principle of the consonant inventories (Martinet, 1955).",
        "According to this principle, languages tend to maximize the combinatorial possibilities of a few distinctive features to generate a large number of consonants.",
        "Stated differently, a given consonant will have a higher than expected chance of occurrence in inventories in which all of its features have distinctively occurred in other consonants.",
        "The idea is illustrated, with an example, through Table 1.",
        "Various attempts have been made in the past to explain the aforementioned trends through linguistic insights (Boersma, 1998; Clements, 2004) mainly establishing their statistical significance.",
        "On the contrary, there has been very little work pertaining to the quantification of feature economy except in (Clements, 2004), where the author defines economy index, which is the ratio of the size of an inventory to the number of features that characterizes the inventory.",
        "However, this definition does not take into account the complexity that is involved in communicating the information about the inventory in terms of its constituent features.",
        "Inspired by the aforementioned studies and the concepts of information theory (Shannon and Weaver, 1949) we try to quantitatively capture the amount of redundancy found across the consonant",
        "Table 1: The table shows four plosives.",
        "Ifa language has in its consonant inventory any three of the four phonemes listed in this table, then there is a higher than average chance that it will also have the fourth phoneme of the table in its inventory.",
        "inventories in terms oftheirconstituentfeatures.",
        "Let us assume that we want to communicate the information about an inventory of size N over a transmission channel.",
        "Ideally, one should require log N bits to do the same (where the logarithm is with respect to base 2).",
        "However, since every natural system is to some extent redundant and languages are no exceptions, the number of bits actually used to encode the information is more than log N. If we assume that the features are boolean in nature, then we can compute the number of bits used by a language to encode the information about its inventory by measuring the entropy as follows.",
        "For an inventory of size N let there be pf consonants for which a particular feature f (where f is assumed to be boolean in nature) is present and f other consonants for which the same is absent.",
        "Thus the probability that a particular consonant chosen uniformly at random from this inventory has the feature f is ^ and the probability that the consonant lacks the feature f is f(=1-^).",
        "If F is the set of all features present in the consonants forming the inventory, then feature entropy FE can be expressed as Fe is therefore the measure of the minimum number of bits that is required to communicate the information about the entire inventory through the transmission channel.",
        "The lower the value of Fe the better it is in terms of the information transmission overhead.",
        "In order to capture the redundancy involved in the encoding we define the term redundancy ratio as follows, which expresses the excess number of bits that is used by the constituent consonants of the inventory in terms of a ratio.",
        "The process of computing the value of RR for a hypothetical consonant inventory is illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "In the following section, we present the experimental setup and also report the experiments which we perform based on the above definition of redundancy.",
        "We subsequently show that redundancy ratio is invariant across the consonant inventories whereas the same is not true in the case of the vowel inventories."

        "Initial studies into the vowel inventories show that for a randomly chosen vowel, its hamming distance from the other vowels in the same inventory varies with the inventory size.",
        "In other words, the error correcting capability of a vowel inventory seems to be dependent on the size of the inventory.",
        "We believe that these results are significant as well as insightful.",
        "Nevertheless, one should be aware of the fact that the formulation of RR heavily banks on the set of features that are used to represent the phonemes.",
        "Unfortunately, there is no consensus on the set of representative features, even though there are numerous suggestions available in the literature.",
        "However, the basic concept ofRR and the process of analysis presented here is independent of the choice of the feature set.",
        "In the current study we have used the binary features provided in UPSID, which could be very well replaced by other representations, including multivalued feature systems; we look forward to do the same as a part of our future work."
