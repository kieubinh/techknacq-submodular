        "The study of Chinese transliteration dates back to the seventh century when Buddhist scriptures were translated into Chinese.",
        "The earliest bit of Chinese translation theory related to transliteration may be the principle of \"Names should follow their bearers, while things should follow Chinese.\"",
        "In other words, names should be transliterated, while things should be translated according to their meanings.",
        "The same theory still holds today.",
        "Transliteration has been practiced in several ways, including phonetic transliteration and phonetic-semantic transliteration.",
        "By phonetic transliteration, we mean rewriting a foreign word in native grapheme such that its original pronunciation is preserved.",
        "For example, London becomes ftilfc /Lun-Dun/ which does not carry any clear connotations.",
        "Phonetic transliteration represents the common practice in transliteration.",
        "Phonetic-semantic transliteration, hereafter referred to as semantic transliteration for short, is an advanced translation technique that is considered as a recommended translation practice for centuries.",
        "It translates a foreign word by preserving both its original pronunciation and meaning.",
        "For example, Xu Guangqi translated geo- in geometry into Chinese as /LH /Ji-He/, which carries the pronunciation of geo- and expresses the meaning of \"a science concerned with measuring the earth\".",
        "Many of the loanwords exist in today's Chinese through semantic transliteration, which has been well received (Hu and Xu, 2003; Hu, 2004) by the people because of many advantages.",
        "Here we just name a few.",
        "(1) It brings in not only the sound, but also the meaning that fills in the semantic blank left by phonetic transliteration.",
        "This also reminds people that it is a loanword and avoids misleading; (2) It provides etymological clues that make it easy to trace back to the root of the words.",
        "For example, a transliterated Japanese name will maintain its Japanese identity in its Chinese appearance; (3) It evokes desirable associations, for example, an English girl's name is transliterated with Chinese characters that have clear feminine association, thus maintaining the gender identity.",
        "Hereafter, Chinese characters are also denoted in Pinyin romanization system, for ease of reference.",
        "Xu Quangqi (1562-1633) translated The Original Manuscript of Geometry to Chinese jointly with Matteo Ricci.",
        "Unfortunately, most of the reported work in the area of machine transliteration has not ventured into semantic transliteration yet.",
        "The Latin-scripted personal names are always assumed to homogeneously follow the English phonic rules in automatic transliteration (Li et al., 2004).",
        "Therefore, the same transliteration model is applied to all the names indiscriminatively.",
        "This assumption degrades the performance of transliteration because each language has its own phonic rule and the Chinese characters to be adopted depend on the following semantic attributes of a foreign name.",
        "(1) Language of origin: An English word is not necessarily of pure English origin.",
        "In English news reports about Asian happenings, an English personal name may have been originated from Chinese, Japanese or Korean.",
        "The language origin affects the phonic rules and the characters to be used in transliteration.",
        "For example, a Japanese name Matsumoto should be transliterated as f£^f /Song-Ben/, instead of 5,^^f£ /Ma-Ci-Mo-Tuo/ as if it were an English name.",
        "(2) Gender association: A given name typically implies a clear gender association in both the source and target languages.",
        "For example, the Chinese transliterations of Alice and Alexandra are MM^ /Ai-Li-Si/ and MltllX /Ya-Li-Shan-Da/ respectively, showing clear feminine and masculine characteristics.",
        "Transliterating Alice as ijlll Sfi /Ai-Li-Si/ is phonetically correct, but semantically inadequate due to an improper gender association.",
        "(3) Surname and given name: The Chinese name system is the original pattern of names in Eastern Asia such as China, Korea and Vietnam, in which a limited number of characters are used for surnames while those for given names are less restrictive.",
        "Even for English names, the character set for given name transliterations are different from that for surnames.",
        "Here are two examples of semantic transliteration for personal names.",
        "George Bush and Yamamoto Akiko are transliterated into ^fyfit U ^Jff and ll^ fff that arouse to the following associations: ^f^u /Qiao-Zhi/ - male given name, English origin; ^fijff /Bu-Shi/ -surname, English origin; lll^ /Shan-Ben/ -surname, Japanese origin; MU^P /Ya-Xi-Zi/ female given name, Japanese origin.",
        "In Section 2, we summarize the related work.",
        "In Section 3, we discuss the linguistic feasibility of semantic transliteration for personal names.",
        "Section 4 formulates a probabilistic model for semantic transliteration.",

        "In general, computational studies of transliteration fall into two categories: transliteration modeling and extraction of transliteration pairs.",
        "In transliteration modeling, transliteration rules are trained from a large, bilingual transliteration lexicon (Lin and Chen, 2002; Oh and Choi, 2005), with the objective of translating unknown words on the fly in an open, general domain.",
        "In the extraction of transliterations, data-driven methods are adopted to extract actual transliteration pairs from a corpus, in an effort to construct a large, up-to-date transliteration lexicon (Kuo et al., 2006; Sproat et al., 2006).",
        "Phonetic transliteration can be considered as an extension to the traditional grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) conversion (Galescu and Allen, 2001), which has been a much-researched topic in the field of speech processing.",
        "If we view the grapheme and phoneme as two symbolic representations of the same word in two different languages, then G2P is a transliteration task by itself.",
        "Although G2P and phonetic transliteration are common in many ways, transliteration has its unique challenges, especially as far as EC transliteration is concerned.",
        "E-C transliteration is the conversion between English graphemes, phonetically associated English letters, and Chinese graphemes, characters which represent ideas or meanings.",
        "As a Chinese transliteration can arouse to certain connotations, the choice of Chinese characters becomes a topic of interest (Xu et al., 2006).",
        "Semantic transliteration can be seen as a subtask of statistical machine translation (SMT) with monotonic word ordering.",
        "By treating a letter/character as a word and a group of letters/characters as a phrase or token unit in SMT, one can easily apply the traditional SMT models, such as the IBM generative model (Brown et al., 1993) or the phrase-based translation model (Crego et al., 2005) to transliteration.",
        "In transliteration, we face similar issues as in SMT, such as lexical mapping and alignment.",
        "However, transliteration is also different from general SMT in many ways.",
        "Unlike SMT where we aim at optimizing the semantic transfer, semantic transliteration needs to maintain the phonetic equivalence as well.",
        "In computational linguistic literature, much effort has been devoted to phonetic transliteration, such as English-Arabic, English-Chinese (Li et al., 2004), English-Japanese (Knight and Graehl, 1998) and English-Korean.",
        "In G2P studies, Font Llitjos and Black (2001) showed how knowledge of language of origin may improve conversion accuracy.",
        "Unfortunately semantic transliteration, which is considered as a good tradition in translation practice (Hu and Xu, 2003; Hu, 2004), has not been adequately addressed computationally in the literature.",
        "Some recent work (Li et al., 2006; Xu et al., 2006) has attempted to introduce preference into a probabilistic framework for selection of Chinese characters in phonetic transliteration.",
        "However, there is neither analytical result nor semantic-motivated transliteration solution being reported."

        "Soft decision refers to the incorporation of the language model scores into the transliteration process to improve the prior knowledge in Bayesian inference.",
        "Overall, both hard and soft decision methods gave similar MRR performance of approximately 0.5750, which was about 17.5% relatively improvement compared to the phonetic transliteration system with 0.4895 MRR.",
        "The hard decision scheme owes its surprisingly good performance to the high detection accuracies (see Table 4).",
        "Table 9: The effect of gender detection schemes on MRR using bigram language models with perfect language information.",
        "Similarly, the effect of various gender detection methods used to obtain the prior information is shown in Table 9.",
        "The language information was assumed known a-priori.",
        "Due to the poorer detection accuracy for the Chinese male given names (see Table 5), hard decision of gender had led to deterioration in MRR performance of the male names compared to the case where no prior information was assumed.",
        "Soft decision of gender yielded further gains of 17.1% and 13.9% relative improvements for male and female given names respectively, over the hard decision method.",
        "Table 10: Overall transliteration performance using bigram language model with various language and gender information.",
        "Finally, Table 10 compares the performance of various semantic transliteration systems using bigram language models.",
        "The baseline phonetic transliteration system yielded 36.87% and 58.39% accuracies at word and character levels respectively; and 0.4895 MRR.",
        "It can be conjectured from the results that semantic transliteration is substantially superior to phonetic transliteration.",
        "In particular, knowing the language information improved the overall MRR performance to 0.5952; and with additional gender information, the best performance of 0.6812 was obtained.",
        "Furthermore, both hard and soft decision of semantic information improved the performance, with the latter being substantially better.",
        "Both the word and character accuracies improvements were consistent and have similar trend to that observed for MRR.",
        "The performance of the semantic transliteration using soft decisions (last row of Table 10) achieved 25.1%, 33.9%, 18.5% relative improvement in MRR, word and character accuracies respectively over that of the phonetic transliteration (first row of Table 10).",
        "In addition, soft decision also presented 5.1%, 4.9% and 3.5% relative improvement over hard decision in MRR, word and character accuracies respectively.",
        "It was found that the performance of the baseline phonetic transliteration may be greatly improved by incorporating semantic information such as the language of origin and gender.",
        "Furthermore, it was found that the soft decision of language and gender outperforms the hard decision approach.",
