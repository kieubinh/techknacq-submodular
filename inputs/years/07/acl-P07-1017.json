        "Machine Translation (MT) quality has improved substantially in recent years due to applying data intensive statistical techniques.",
        "However, state-of-the-art approaches are essentially lexical, considering every surface word or phrase in both the source sentence and the corresponding translation as an independent entity.",
        "A shortcoming of this word-based approach is that it is sensitive to data sparsity.",
        "This is an issue of importance as aligned corpora are an expensive resource, which is not abundantly available for many language pairs.",
        "This is particularly problematic for morphologically rich languages, where word stems are realized in many different surface forms, which exacerbates the sparsity problem.",
        "* This research was conducted during the author's internship at Microsoft Research.",
        "In this paper, we explore an approach in which words are represented as a collection ofmorpholog-ical entities, and use this information to aid in MT for morphologically rich languages.",
        "Our goal is twofold: first, to allow generalization over morphology to alleviate the data sparsity problem in morphology generation.",
        "Second, to model syntactic coherence in the form of morphological agreement in the target language to improve the generation of morphologically rich languages.",
        "So far, this problem has been addressed in a very limited manner in MT, most typically by using a target language model.",
        "In the framework suggested in this paper, we train a model that predicts the inflected forms of a sequence of word stems in a target sentence, given the corresponding source sentence.",
        "We use word and word alignment information, as well as lexical resources that provide morphological information about the words on both the source and target sides.",
        "Given a sentence pair, we also obtain syntactic analysis information for both the source and translated sentences.",
        "We generate the inflected forms of words in the target sentence using all of the available information, using a log-linear model that learns the relevant mapping functions.",
        "As a case study, we focus on the English-Russian and English-Arabic language pairs.",
        "Unlike English, Russian and Arabic have very rich systems of morphology, each with distinct characteristics.",
        "Translating from a morphology-poor to a morphology-rich language is especially challenging since detailed morphological information needs to be decoded from a language that does not encode this information or does so only implicitly (Koehn, 2005).",
        "We believe that these language pairs are representative in this respect and therefore demonstrate the generality of our approach.",
        "There are several contributions of this work.",
        "First, we propose a general approach that shows promise in addressing the challenges of MT into morphologically rich languages.",
        "We show that the use of both syntactic and morphological information improves translation quality.",
        "We also show the utility of source language information in predicting the word forms of the target language.",
        "Finally, we achieve these results with limited morphological resources and training data, suggesting that the approach is generally useful for resource-scarce language pairs."

        "While these features are fairly generic (they are also present in English), note that Russian includes an additional gender (neuter) and Arabic has a distinct number notion for two (dual).",
        "A central dimension of Russian morphology is case marking, realized as suffixation on nouns and nominal modifiers.",
        "The Russian case feature includes six possible values, representing the notions of subject, direct object, location, etc.",
        "In Arabic, like other Semitic languages, word surface forms may include proclitics and enclitics (or prefixes and suffixes as we refer to them in this paper), concatenated to inflected stems.",
        "For nouns, prefixes include conjunctions (wa: \"and\", fa: \"and, so\"), prepositions (bi: \"by, with\", ka: \"like, such as\", li: \"for, to\") and a determiner, and suffixes include possessive pronouns.",
        "Verbal prefixes include conjunction and negation, and suffixes include object pronouns.",
        "Both object and possessive pronouns are captured by an indicator function for its presence or absence, as well as by the features that indicate their person, number and gender.",
        "As can be observed from the table, a large number of surface inflected forms can be generated by the combination of these features, making the morphological generation of these languages a non-trivial task.",
        "Morphologically complex languages also tend to display a rich system of agreements.",
        "In Russian, for example, adjectives agree with head nouns in number, gender and case, and verbs agree with the subject noun in person and number (past tense verbs agree in gender and number).",
        "Arabic has a similarly rich system of agreement, with unique characteristics.",
        "For example, in addition to agreement involving person, number and gender, it also requires a determiner for each word in a definite noun phrase with adjectival modifiers; in a noun compound, a determiner is attached to the last noun in the chain.",
        "Also, non-human subject plural nouns require the verb to be inflected in a singular feminine form.",

        "Table 5 shows the accuracy of predicting word forms for the baseline and proposed models.",
        "We report accuracy only on words that appear in our lexicons.",
        "Thus, punctuation, English words occurring in the target sentence, and words with unknown lemmas are excluded from the evaluation.",
        "The reported accuracy measure therefore abstracts away from the issue of incomplete coverage of the lexicon.",
        "When we encounter these words in the true MT scenario, we will make no predictions about them, and simply leave them unmodified.",
        "In our current experiments, in Russian, 68.2% of all word tokens were in Cyrillic, of which 93.8% were included in our lexicon.",
        "In Arabic, 85.5% of all word tokens were in Arabic characters, of which 99.1% were in our lexicon.",
        "The results in Table 5 show that the suggested models outperform the language model substantially for both languages.",
        "In particular, the contribution of both bilingual and non-lexical features is noteworthy: adding non-lexical features consistently leads to 1.5% to 2% absolute gain in both monolingual and bilingual settings in both language pairs.",
        "We obtain a particularly large gain in the Russian bilingual case, in which the absolute gain is more than 4%, translating to 34% error rate reduction.",
        "Adding bilingual features has a similar effect of gaining about 2% (and 4% for Russian non-lexical) in accuracy over monolingual models.",
        "The overall accuracy is lower in Arabic than in Russian, reflecting the inherent difficulty of the task, as indicated by the random baseline (31.7 in Russian vs. 16.3 in Arabic).",
        "In order to evaluate the effectiveness ofthe model in alleviating the data sparsity problem in morphological generation, we trained inflection prediction models on various subsets of the training data described in Table 3, and tested their accuracy.",
        "The results are given in Figure 2.",
        "We can see that with as few as 5,000 training sentences pairs, the model obtains much better accuracy than the language model, which is trained on data that is larger by a few orders of magnitude.",
        "We also note that the learning curve becomes less steep as we use more training data, suggesting that the models are successfully learning generalizations.",

        "We have also manually examined some representative cases where the proposed model failed to make a correct prediction.",
        "In both Russian and Arabic, a very common pattern was a mistake in predicting the gender (as well as number and person in Arabic) of pronouns.",
        "This may be attributed to the fact that the correct choice of the pronoun requires coreference resolution, which is not available in our model.",
        "A more thorough analysis of the results will be helpful to bring further improvements."

        "We presented a probabilistic framework for morphological generation given aligned sentence pairs, incorporating morpho-syntactic information from both the source and target sentences.",
        "The results, using reference translations, show that the proposed models achieve substantially better accuracy than language models, even with a relatively small amount of training data.",
        "Our models using morpho-syntactic information also outperformed models using only lexical information by a wide margin.",
        "This result is very promising for achieving our ultimate goal of improving MT output by using a specialized model for target language morphological generation.",
        "Though this goal is clearly outside the scope of this paper, we conducted a preliminary experiment where an English-to-Russian MT system was trained on a stemmed version of the aligned data and used to generate stemmed word sequences, which were then inflected using the suggested framework.",
        "This simple integration of the proposed model with the MT system improved the BLEU score by 1.7.",
        "The most obvious next step of our research, therefore, is to further pursue the integration of the proposed model to the end-to-end MT scenario.",
        "There are multiple paths for obtaining further improvements over the results presented here.",
        "These include refinement in feature design, word analysis disambiguation, morphological and syntactic analysis on the source English side (e.g., assigning semantic role tags), to name a few.",
        "Another area of investigation is capturing longer-distance agreement phenomena, which can be done by implementing a global statistical model, or by using features from dependency trees more effectively."
