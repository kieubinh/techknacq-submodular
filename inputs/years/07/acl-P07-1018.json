        "This paper describes a system designed to assist humans in translating expressions that do not necessarily have a literal or compositional equivalent in the target language (TL).",
        "In the spirit of (Kay, 1997), it is intended as a translator's amenuensis \"under the tight control of a human translator ... to help increase his productivity and not to supplant him\".",
        "One area where human translators particularly appreciate assistance is in the translation of expressions from the general lexicon.",
        "Unlike equivalent technical terms, which generally share the same part-of-speech (POS) across languages and are in the ideal case univocal, the contextually appropriate equivalents of general language expressions are often indirect and open to variation.",
        "While the transfer module in RBMT may acceptably under-generate through a many-to-one mapping between source and target expressions, human translators, even in non-literary fields, value legitimate variation.",
        "Thus the French expression il faillit Ã©chouer (lit.",
        ": he faltered to fail) may be variously rendered as he almost/nearly/all but failed; he was on the verge/brink of failing/failure; failure loomed.",
        "All of these translations are indirect in that they involve lexical shifts or POS transformations.",
        "Finding such translations is a hard task that can benefit from automated assistance.",
        "'Mining' such indirect equivalents is difficult, precisely because of the structural mismatch, but also because of the paucity of suitable aligned corpora.",
        "The approach adopted here includes the use of comparable corpora in source and target languages, which are relatively easy to create.",
        "The challenge is to generate a list of usable solutions and to rank them such that the best are at the top.",
        "Thus the present system is unlike SMT (Och and Ney, 2003), where lexical selection is effected by a translation model based on aligned, parallel corpora, but the novel techniques it has developed are exploitable in the SMT paradigm.",
        "It also differs from now traditional uses of comparable corpora for detecting translation equivalents (Rapp, 1999) or extracting terminology (Grefenstette, 2002), which allows a one-to-one correspondence irrespective of the context.",
        "Our system addresses difficulties in expressions in the general lexicon, whose translation is context-dependent.",
        "The structure of the paper is as follows.",
        "In Section 2 we present the method we use for mining translation equivalents.",
        "In Section 3 we present the results of an objective evaluation of the quality of suggestions produced by the system by comparing our output against a parallel corpus.",
        "Finally, in Section 4 we present a subjective evaluation focusing on the integration of the system into the workflow of human translators."

      "heading": "2. Methodology",
      "text": [
        "The software acts as a decision support system for translators.",
        "It integrates different technologies for extracting indirect translation equivalents from large comparable corpora.",
        "In the following subsections we give the user perspective on the system and describe the methodology underlying each of its sub-tasks.",
        "Unlike traditional dictionaries, the system is a dynamic translation resource in that it can successfully find translation equivalents for units which have not been stored in advance, even for idiosyncratic multiword expressions which almost certainly will not figure in a dictionary.",
        "While our system can rectify gaps and omissions in static lexicographical resources, its major advantage is that it is able to cope with an open set of translation problems, searching for translation equivalents in comparable corpora in runtime.",
        "This makes it more than just an extended dictionary.",
        "Contextual descriptors",
        "From the user perspective the system extracts indirect translation equivalents as sets of contextual descriptors - content words that are lexically central in a given sentence, phrase or construction.",
        "The choice of these descriptors may determine the general syntactic perspective of the sentence and the use of supporting lexical items.",
        "Many translation problems arise from the fact that the mapping between such descriptors is not straightforward.",
        "The system is designed to find possible indirect mappings between sets of descriptors and to verify the acceptability of the mapping into the TL.",
        "For example, in the following Russian sentence, the bolded contextual descriptors require indirect translation into English.",
        "ffemu nocew,amm nnoxo ompeMonmupo-eaunue uikojim, e Komopux Hedocmaem caMOSo neodxoduMozo (Children attend badly repaired schools, in which [it] is missing the most necessary) Combining direct translation equivalents of these words (e.g., translations found in the Oxford Russian Dictionary - ORD) may produce a non-natural English sentence, like the literal translation given above.",
        "In such cases human translators usually apply structural and lexical transformations, for instance changing the descriptors' POS and/or replacing them with near-synonyms which fit together in the context of a TL sentence (Munday, 2001: 57-58).",
        "Thus, a structural transformation of",
        "njoxo ompeMonmupoeannue (badly repaired) may give in poor repair while a lexical transformation of nedocmaem caMOSo neodxodwwoeo ([it] is missing the most necessary) gives lacking basic essentials.",
        "Our system models such transformations of the descriptors and checks the consistency of the resulting sets in the TL.",
        "Using the system",
        "Human translators submit queries in the form of one or more SL descriptors which in their opinion may require indirect translation.",
        "When the translators use the system for translating into their native language, the returned descriptors are usually sufficient for them to produce a correct TL construction or phrase around them (even though the descriptors do not always form a naturally sounding expression).",
        "When the translators work into a non-native language, they often find it useful to generate concordances for the returned descriptors to verify their usage within TL constructions.",
        "For example, for the sentence above translators may submit two queries: njoxo ompeMonm-upoeannue (badly repaired) and nedocmaem neodxoduMOSo (missing necessary).",
        "For the first query the system returns a list of descriptor pairs (with information on their frequency in the English corpus) ranked by distributional proximity to the original query, which we explain in Section 2.2.",
        "At the top of the list come:",
        "bad repair = 30 (11.005) bad maintenance = 1_6 (5.301) bad restoration = 0 (5.079) poor repair = 60 (5.026)... Underlined hyperlinks lead translators to actual contexts in the English corpus, e.g., poor repair generates a concordance containing a desirable TL construction which is a structural transformation of the SL query:",
        "in such a poor state of repair bridge in as poor a state of repair as the highways building in poor repair.",
        "dwellings are in poor repair;",
        "Similarly, the result of the second query may give the translators an idea about possible lexical transformation:",
        "missing need = 1_4 (5.035) important missing = 0 (2.930) missing vital = 0 (2.322) lack necessary = 204 (1.982)... essential lack = 86 (0.908)...",
        "The concordance for the last pair of descriptors contains the phrase they lack the three essentials, which illustrates the transformation.",
        "The resulting translation may be the following:",
        "Children attend schools that are in poor repair and lacking basic essentials Thus our system supports translators in making decisions about indirect translation equivalents in a number of ways: it suggests possible structural and lexical transformations for contextual descriptors; it verifies which translation variants co-occur in the TL corpus; and it illustrates the use of the transformed TL lexical descriptors in actual contexts.",
        "We have generalised the method used in our previous study (Sharoff et al., 2006) for extracting equivalents for continuous multiword expressions (MWEs).",
        "Essentially, the method expands the search space for each word and its dictionary translations with entries from automatically computed thesauri, and then checks which combinations are possible in target corpora.",
        "These potential translation equivalents are then ranked by their similarity to the original query and presented to the user.",
        "The range of retrievable equivalents is now extended from a relatively limited range of two-word constructions which mirror POS categories in SL and TL to a much wider set of co-occurring lexical content items, which may appear in a different order, at some distance from each other, and belong to different POS categories.",
        "The method works best for expressions from the general lexicon, which do not have established equivalents, but not yet for terminology.",
        "It relies on a high-quality bilingual dictionary (en-ru ~30k, ru-en ~50K words, combining ORD and the core part of Multitran) and large comparable corpora (~200M En, ~70M Ru) of news texts.",
        "For each of the SL query terms q the system generates its dictionary translation Tr(q) and its similarity class S(q) - a set of words with a similar distribution in a monolingual corpus.",
        "Similarity is measured as the cosine between collocation vectors, whose dimensionality is reduced by SVD using the implementation by Rapp (2004).",
        "The descriptor and each word in the similarity class are then translated into the TL using ORD or the Multitran dictionary, resulting in (Tr(q)u Tr(S(q))}.",
        "On the TL side we also generate similarity classes, but only for dictionary translations of query terms Tr(q) (not for Tr(S(q)), which can make output too noisy).",
        "We refer to the resulting set of TL words as a translation class T.",
        "Translation classes approximate lexical and structural transformations which can potentially be applied to each of the query terms.",
        "Automatically computed similarity classes do not require resources like WordNet, and they are much more suitable for modelling translation transformations, since they often contain a wider range of words of different POS which share the same context, e.g., the similarity class of the word lack contains words such as absence, insufficient, inadequate, lost, shortage, failure, paucity, poor, weakness, inability, need.",
        "This clearly goes beyond the range of traditional thesauri.",
        "For multiword queries, the system performs a consistency check on possible combinations of words from different translation classes.",
        "In particular, it computes the Cartesian product for pairs of translation classes Ti and T2 to generate the set P of word pairs, where each word (wi and w2) comes from a different translation class:",
        "Then the system checks whether each word pair from the set P exists in the database D of discontinuous content word bi-grams which actually co-occur in the TL corpus:",
        "The database contains the set of all bi-grams that occur in the corpus with a frequency > 4 within a window of 5 words (over 9M bigrams for each language).",
        "The bi-grams in D and in P are sorted alphabetically, so their order in the query is not important.",
        "Larger N-grams (N > 2) in queries are split into combinations of bi-grams, which we found to be an optimal solution to the problem of the scarcity of higher order N-grams in the corpus.",
        "Thus, for the query gain significant importance the system generates P j(significant importance), P 2(gain importance), P 3(gain significant) and computes P as:",
        "P' = {(wi,w2,w3)l (wi,w2) eP'i & (wi, w3) eP'2& (w2,w3) eP'3}, which allows the system to find an indirect equivalent nojynumb eecoMoe 3nanenue (lit.",
        ": receive weighty meaning).",
        "Even though P' on average contains about 2% -4% of the theoretically possible number of bi-grams present in P, the returned number of potential translation equivalents may still be large and contain much noise.",
        "Typically there are several hundred elements in P' , of which only a few are really useful for translation.",
        "To make the system usable in practice, i.e., to get useful solutions to appear close to the top (preferably on the first screen of the output), we developed methods of ranking and filtering the returned TL contextual descriptor pairs, which we present in the following sections.",
        "The system ranks the returned list of contextual descriptors by their distributional proximity to the original query, i.e. it uses scores cos(vq, vw) generated for words in similarity classes - the cosine of the angle between the collocation vector for a word and the collocation vector for the query or dictionary translation of the query.",
        "Thus, words whose equivalents show similar usage in a comparable corpus receive the highest scores.",
        "These scores are computed for each individual word in the output, so there are several ways to combine them to weight words in translation classes and word combinations in the returned list of descriptors.",
        "We established experimentally that the best way to combine similarity scores is to multiply weights W(T) computed for each word within its translation class T. The weight W(P'(wiiW2)) for each pair of contextual descriptors (wi, w2)eP' is computed as:",
        "Computing W(T(w), however, is not straightforward either, since some words in similarity classes of different translation equivalents for the query term may be the same, or different words from the similarity class of the original query may have the same translation.",
        "Therefore, a word w within a translation class may have come by several routes simultaneously, and may have done that several times.",
        "For each word w in T there is a possibility that it arrived in T either because it is in Tr(q) or occurs n times in Tr(S(q)) or k times in S(Tr(q)).",
        "We found that the number of occurrences n and k of each word w in each subset gives valuable information for ranking translation candidates.",
        "In our experiments we computed the weight W(T) as the sum of similarity scores which w receives in each of the subsets.",
        "We also discovered that ranking improves if for each query term we compute in addition a larger (and potentially noisy) space of candidates that includes TL similarity classes of translations of the SL similarity class S(Tr(S(q))).",
        "These candidates do not appear in the system output, but they play an important role in ranking the displayed candidates.",
        "The improvement may be due to the fact that this space is much larger, and may better support relevant candidates since there is a greater chance that appropriate indirect equivalents are found several times within SL and TL similarity classes.",
        "The best ranking results were achieved when the original W(T) scores were multiplied by 2 and added to the scores for the newly introduced similarity space S(Tr(S(q))): W(T(w))= 2x(j if weTr(q) ) +",
        "{w | weS(Tr(S(q))) } ) For example, the system gives the following ranking for the indirect translation equivalents of the Russian phrase eecoMoe 3nanenue (lit.",
        ": weighty meaning) - figures in brackets represent W(P') scores for each pair of TL descriptors:",
        "3. measurable value = 6 (2.657)...",
        "The Russian similarity class for eecoMuu (weighty, ponderous) contains: ydedumenbnuu (convincing) (0.469), 3nanuMuu (significant) (0.461), omymuMum (notable) (0.452) dpaMa-munnbiu (dramatic) (0.371).",
        "The equivalent of significant is not at the top of the similarity class of the Russian query, but it appears at the top of the final ranking of pairs in P' , because this hypothesis is supported by elements of the set formed by S(Tr(S(q))); it appears in similarity classes for notable (0.353) and dramatic (0.315), which contributed these values to the W(T) score of significant: W(T(significant)) =",
        "The word dramatic itself is not usable as a translation equivalent in this case, but its similarity class contains the support for relevant candidates, so it can be viewed as useful noise.",
        "On the other hand, the word convincing does not receive such support from the hypothesis space, even though its Russian equivalent is ranked higher in the SL similarity class.",
        "Ranking of translation candidates can be further improved when translators use an option to filter the returned list by certain lexical criteria, e.g., to display only those examples that contain a certain lexical item, or to require one of the items to be a dictionary translation of the query term.",
        "However, lexical filtering is often too restrictive: in many cases translators need to see a number of related words from the same semantic field or subject domain, without knowing the lexical items in advance.",
        "In this section we present the semantic filter, which is based on Russian and English semantic taggers which use the same semantic field taxonomy for both languages.",
        "The semantic filter displays only those items which have specified semantic field tags or tag combinations; it can be applied to one or both words in each translation hypothesis in P' .",
        "The default setting for the semantic filter is the requirement for both words in the resulting TL candidates to contain any of the semantic field tags from a SL query term.",
        "In the next section we present evaluation results for this default setting (which is applied when the user clicks the Semantic Filter button), but human translators have further options - to filter by tags of individual words, to use semantic classes from SL or TL terms, etc.",
        "For example, applying the default semantic filter for the output of the query njoxo ompeMon-mupoeannue (badly repaired) removes the highlighted items from the list:",
        "Items 2 and 7 are generated by the system because good, well and bad are in the same similarity cluster for many words (they often share the same collocations).",
        "The semantic filter removes examples with good and well on the grounds that they do not have any of the tags which come from the word njoxo (badly): in particular, instead of tag A5- (Evaluation: Negative) they have tag A5+ (Evaluation: Positive).",
        "Item 4 is removed on the grounds that the words ompeMonmupoeannuu ( repaired) and maintenance do not have any tags in common - they appear ontologically too far apart from the point of view of the semantic tagger.",
        "The core of the system's multilingual semantic tagging is a knowledge base in which single words and MWEs are mapped to their potential semantic field categories.",
        "Often a lexical item is mapped to multiple semantic categories, reflecting its potential multiple senses.",
        "In such cases, the tags are arranged by the order of likelihood of meanings, with the most prominent first."

        "In the objective evaluation we tested the performance of our system on a selection of indirect translation problems, extracted from a parallel corpus consisting mostly of articles from English and Russian newspapers (118,497 words in the RE direction, 589,055 words in the ER direction).",
        "It has been aligned on the sentence level by JAPA (Langlais et al., 1998), and further on the word level by GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "The intuition behind the objective evaluation experiment is that the capacity of our tool to find indirect translation equivalents in comparable corpora can be compared with the results of automatic alignment of parallel texts used in translation models in SMT: one of the major advantages of the SMT paradigm is its ability to reuse indirect equivalents found in parallel corpora (equivalents that may never come up in hand-crafted dictionaries).",

        "We selected expressions which represented cases of lexical transformations (as illustrated in Section 0), containing at least two content words both in the SL and TL.",
