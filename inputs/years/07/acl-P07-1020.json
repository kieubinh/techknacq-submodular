        "Machine translation can be viewed as consisting of two subproblems: (a) lexical selection, where appropriate target language lexical items are chosen for each source language lexical item and (b) lexical reordering, where the chosen target language lexical items are rearranged to produce a meaningful target language string.",
        "Most of the previous work on statistical machine translation, as exemplified in (Brown et al., 1993), employs word-alignment algorithm (such as GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003)) that provides local associations between source and target words.",
        "The source-to-target word alignments are sometimes augmented with target-to-source word alignments in order to improve precision.",
        "Further, the word-level alignments are extended to phraselevel alignments in order to increase the extent of local associations.",
        "The phrasal associations compile some amount of(local) lexical reordering ofthe target words - those permitted by the size of the phrase.",
        "Most of the state-of-the-art machine translation systems use phrase-level associations in conjunction with a target language model to produce sentences.",
        "There is relatively little emphasis on (global) lexical reordering other than the local reorderings permitted within the phrasal alignments.",
        "A few exceptions are the hierarchical (possibly syntax-based) trans-duction models (Wu, 1997; Alshawi et al., 1998; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Chiang, 2005) and the string transduction models (Kanthak et al., 2005).",
        "In this paper, we present an alternate approach to lexical selection and lexical reordering.",
        "For lexical selection, in contrast to the local approaches of associating target to source words, we associate target words to the entire source sentence.",
        "The intuition is that there may be lexico-syntactic features of the source sentence (not necessarily a single source word) that might trigger the presence of a target word in the target sentence.",
        "Furthermore, it might be difficult to exactly associate a target word to a source word in many situations - (a) when the translations are not exact but paraphrases (b) when the target language does not have one lexical item to express the same concept that is expressed by a source word.",
        "Extending word to phrase alignments attempts to address some of these situations while alleviating the noise in word-level alignments.",
        "As a consequence of this global lexical selection approach, we no longer have a tight association between source and target language words.",
        "The result of lexical selection is simply a bag of words in the target language and the sentence has to be reconstructed using this bag of words.",
        "The words in the bag, however, might be enhanced with rich syntactic information that could aid in reconstructing the target sentence.",

        "For the work reported in this paper, we have used the GIZA++ tool (Och and Ney, 2003) which implements a string-alignment algorithm.",
        "GIZA++ alignment however is asymmetric in that the word mappings are different depending on the direction of alignment - source-to-target or target-to-source.",

        "Additionally, SFSTs can take advantage ofphrasal correlations to improve the computation of the probability P (WS, WT).",
        "The bilanguage representation could result in some source language phrases to be mapped to e (empty target phrase).",

        "Since we represent the translation model as a weighted finite-state transducer (TransFST), the decoding process of translating a new source input (sentence or weighted lattice (Is)) amounts to a transducer composition (o) and selection of the best probability path (BestPath) resulting from the composition and projecting the target sequence",

        "Discriminative training has been used mainly for translation model combination (Och and Ney, 2002) and with the exception of (Wellington et al., 2006; Tillmann and Zhang, 2006), has not been used to directly train parameters of a translation model.",
        "We expect dis-criminatively trained global lexical selection models to outperform generatively trained local lexical selection models as well as provide a framework for incorporating rich morpho-syntactic information.",
        "Statistical machine translation can be formulated as a search for the best target sequence that maximizes P(T\\S), where S is the source sentence and T is the target sentence.",
        "Ideally, P(T\\ S) should be estimated directly to maximize the conditional likelihood on the training data (discriminant model).",

        "Although Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001) train an exponential model at the sequence level, in translation tasks such as ours the computational requirements of training such models are prohibitively expensive.",
        "We investigate two approaches to approximating the string level global classification problem, using different independence assumptions.",
        "A comparison of the two approaches is summarized in Table 1.",
        "In the first approach, we formulate a sequential local classification problem as shown in Equations 7.",
        "This approach is similar to the SFST approach in that it relies on local associations between the source and target words(phrases).",
        "We can use a conditional model (instead of a joint model as before) and the parameters are determined using discriminant training which allows for richer conditioning context.",

        "The sequential lexical choice model described in the previous section treats the selection of a lexical choice for a source word in the local lexical context as a classification task.",
        "The data for training such models is derived from word alignments obtained by e.g. GIZA++.",
        "The decoded target lexical items have to be further reordered, but for closely related languages the reordering could be incorporated into correctly ordered target phrases as discussed previously.",
        "For pairs of languages with radically different word order (e.g. English-Japanese), there needs to be a global reordering of words similar to the case in the SFST-based translation system.",
        "Also, for such differing language pairs, the alignment algorithms such as GIZA++ perform poorly.",
        "These observations prompted us to formulate the lexical choice problem without the need for word alignment information.",
        "We require a sentence aligned corpus as before, but we treat the target sentence as a bag-of-words or BOW assigned to the source sentence.",
        "The goal is, given a source sentence, to estimate the probability that we find a given word in the target sentence.",
        "This is why, instead of producing a target sentence, what we initially obtain is a target bag of words.",
        "Each word in the target vocabulary is detected independently, so we have here a very simple use of binary static classifiers.",

        "The classifier is trained with n-gram features (BOgrams(S)) from the source sentence.",

        "This is known as the 1-vs-other scheme.",
        "The key advantage over the multiclass scheme is that not all classifiers have to reside in memory at the same time during training which allows for parallelization.",
        "Fortunately for the sequential model, we can decompose a multiclass classification problem into separate 1-vs-other problems.",
        "In theory, one has to make an additional independence assumption and the problem statement becomes different.",

        "The excellent results recently obtained with the SEARN algorithm (Daumé et al., 2007) also suggest that binary classifiers, when properly trained and combined, seem to be capable ofmatching more complex structured output approaches.",

        "In previous studies, we found that the best accuracy is achieved with non-linear (or kernel) SVMs, at the expense of a high test time complexity, which is unacceptable for machine translation.",
        "Linear SVMs and regularized Maxent yield similar performance.",
        "In theory, Maxent training, which scales linearly with the number of examples, is faster than SVM training, which scales quadratically with the number of examples.",
        "In our first experiments with lexical choice models, we observed that Maxent slightly outperformed SVMs.",
        "Using a single threshold with SVMs, some classes of words were over-detected.",
        "This suggests that, as theory predicts, SVMs do not properly approximate the posterior probability.",
        "We therefore chose to use Maxent as the best probability approximator.",
        "Traditionally, Maxent is regularized by imposing a Gaussian prior on each weight: this L2 regularization finds the solution with the smallest possible weights.",
        "However, on tasks like machine translation with a very large number of input features, a Lapla-cian L1 regularization that also attempts to maximize the number of zero weights is highly desirable.",
        "A new L1-regularized Maxent algorithms was proposed for density estimation (Dudik et al., 2004) and we adapted it to classification.",
        "We found this algorithm to converge faster than the current state-of-the-art in Maxent training, which is L2-regularized trained parameters is considerably smaller."

        "The BOW approach is promising as it performs reasonably well despite considerable losses in the transfer of information between source and target language.",
        "The first and most obvious loss is about word position.",
        "The only information we currently use to restore the target word position is the target language model.",
        "Information about the grammatical role of a word in the source sentence is completely lost.",
        "The language model might fortuitously recover this information if the sentence with the correct grammatical role for the word happens to be the maximum likelihood sentence in the permutation automaton.",
        "We are currently working toward incorporating syntactic information on the target words so as to be able to recover some of the grammatical role information lost in the classification process.",
        "In preliminary experiments, we have associated the target lexical items with supertag information (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999).",
        "Supertags are labels that provide linear ordering constraints as well as grammatical relation information.",
        "Although associating supertags to target words increases the class set for the classifier, we have noticed that the degradation in the F-score is on the order of 3% across different corpora.",
        "The supertag information can then be exploited in the sentence construction process.",
        "The use of supertags in phrase-based SMT system has been shown to improve results (Hassan et al., 2006).",
        "A less obvious loss is the number of times a word or concept appears in the target sentence.",
        "Function words like \"the\" and \"of can appear many times in an English sentence.",
        "In the model discussed in this paper, we index each occurrence ofthe function word with a counter.",
        "In order to improve this method, we are currently exploring a technique where the function words serve as attributes (e.g. definiteness, tense, case) on the contentful lexical items, thus enriching the lexical item with morpho-syntactic information.",
        "A third issue concerning the BOW model is the problem of synonyms - target words which translate the same source word.",
        "Suppose that in the training data, target words t\\ and t2 are, with equal probability, translations of the same source word.",
        "Then, in the presence of this source word, the probability to detect the corresponding target word, which we assume is 0.8, will be, because of discriminant learning, split equally between t\\ and t2, that is 0.4 and 0.4.",
        "Because of this synonym problem, the BOW threshold 9 has to be set lower than 0.5, which is observed experimentally.",
        "However, if we set the threshold to 0.3, both t\\ and t2 will be detected in the target sentence, and we found this to be a major source of undesirable insertions.",
        "The BOW approach is different from the parsing based approaches (Melamed, 2004; Zhang and Gildea, 2005; Cowan et al., 2006) where the translation model tightly couples the syntactic and lexical items of the two languages.",
        "The decoupling of the two steps in our model has the potential for generating paraphrased sentences not necessarily isomorphic to the structure of the source sentence.",

        "We view machine translation as consisting of lexical selection and lexical reordering steps.",
        "These two steps need not necessarily be sequential and could be tightly integrated.",
        "We have presented the weighted finite-state transducer model of machine translation where lexical choice and a limited amount of lexical reordering are tightly integrated into a single trans-duction.",
        "We have also presented a novel approach to translation where these two steps are loosely coupled and the parameters of the lexical choice model are discriminatively trained using a maximum entropy model.",
        "The lexical reordering model in this approach is achieved using a permutation automaton.",
        "We have evaluated these two approaches on the 2005 and 2006 IWSLT development sets and shown that the techniques scale well to Hansard and UN corpora."
