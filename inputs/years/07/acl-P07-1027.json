        "The task of Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is to identify predicate-argument relationships in natural language texts in a domain-independent fashion.",
        "In recent years, the availability of large human-labeled corpora such as PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) and FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) has made possible a statistical approach of identifying and classifying the arguments of verbs in natural language texts.",
        "A large number of SRL systems have been evaluated and compared on the standard data set in the CoNLL shared tasks (Carreras and Marquez, 2004; Carreras and Marquez, 2005), and many systems have performed reasonably well.",
        "Compared to the previous CoNLL shared tasks (noun phrase bracketing, chunking, clause identification, and named entity recognition), SRL represents a significant step towards processing the semantic content of natural language texts.",
        "Although verbs are probably the most obvious predicates in a sentence, many nouns are also capable of having complex argument structures, often with much more flexibility than its verb counterpart.",
        "For example, compare affect and effect:",
        "[subj Auto prices] [",
        "greatly] [Pred affect] [obj the PPI].",
        "[subj Auto prices] have a [arg – ext big] [Pred effect] [obj on the PPI].",
        "The [pred effect] [subj of auto prices] [obj on the PPI] is [arg – ext big].",
        "[subj The auto prices'] [pred effect] [obj on the PPI] is [arg – ext big].",
        "The arguments of noun predicates can often be more easily omitted compared to the verb predicates:",
        "The [pred effect] [subj of auto prices] is",
        "[arg – ext big].",
        "The [pred effect] [obj on the PPI] is",
        "The [pred effect] is [arg – ext big].",
        "With the recent release of NomBank (Meyers et al., 2004), it becomes possible to apply machine learning techniques to the task.",
        "So far we are aware of only one English NomBank-based SRL system (Jiang and Ng, 2006), which uses the maximum entropy classifier, although similar efforts are reported on the Chinese NomBank by (Xue, 2006) and on FrameNet by (Pradhan et al., 2004) using a small set of hand-selected nominalizations.",
        "Noun predicates also appear in FrameNet semantic role labeling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), and many FrameNet SRL systems are evaluated in Senseval-3 (Litkowski, 2004).",
        "Semantic role labeling of NomBank is a multi-class classification problem by nature.",
        "Using the one-vs-all arrangement, that is, one binary classifier for each possible outcome, the SRL task can be treated as multiple binary classification problems.",
        "In the latter view, we are presented with the opportunity to exploit the common structures of these related problems.",
        "This is known as multi-task learning in the machine learning literature (Caruana, 1997; Ben-David and Schuller, 2003; Evgeniou and Pontil, 2004; Micchelli and Pontil, 2005; Maurer, 2006).",
        "In this paper, we apply Alternating Structure Optimization (ASO) (Ando and Zhang, 2005a) to the semantic role labeling task on NomBank.",
        "ASO is a recently proposed linear multi-task learning algorithm based on empirical risk minimization.",
        "The method requires the use of multiple auxiliary problems, and its effectiveness may vary depending on the specific auxiliary problems used.",
        "ASO has been shown to be effective on the following natural language processing tasks: text categorization, named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, and word sense disambiguation (Ando and Zhang, 2005a; Ando and Zhang, 2005b; Ando, 2006).",
        "This paper makes two significant contributions.",
        "First, we present a novel application of ASO to the SRL task on NomBank.",
        "We explore the effect of different auxiliary problems, and show that learning predictive structures with ASO results in significantly improved SRL accuracy.",
        "Second, we achieve accuracy higher than that reported in (Jiang and Ng, 2006) and advance the state of the art in SRL research.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "We give an overview of NomBank and ASO in Sections 2 and 3 respectively.",
        "The baseline linear classifier is described in detail in Section 4, followed by the description of the ASO classifier in Section 5, where we focus on exploring different auxiliary problems.",
        "We provide discussions in Section 6, present related work in Section 7, and conclude in Section 8."

        "Thus we will probably predict whether hw=to, but not whether hw=trader, since to occurs more frequently than trader as a head word.",
        "In argument identification using gold parse trees, we experiment with predicting three unused features as auxiliary problems: distance (distance between the predicate and the constituent), parent.lsis.hw (head word of the parent constituent's left sister) and parent.rsis.hw (head word of the parent constituent's right sister).",
