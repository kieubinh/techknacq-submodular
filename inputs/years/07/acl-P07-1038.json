        "Automatic assessment of translation quality is a challenging problem because the evaluation task, at its core, is based on subjective human judgments.",
        "Reference-based metrics such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) have rephrased this subjective task as a somewhat more objective question: how closely does the translation resemble sentences that are known to be good translations for the same source?",
        "This approach requires the participation of human translators, who provide the \"gold standard\" reference sentences.",
        "However, keeping humans in the evaluation loop represents a significant expenditure both in terms of time and resources; therefore it is worthwhile to explore ways of reducing the degree of human involvement.",
        "To this end, Gamon et al.",
        "(2005) proposed a learning-based evaluation metric that does not compare against reference translations.",
        "Under a learning framework, the input (i.e., the sentence to be evaluated) is represented as a set of features.",
        "These are measurements that can be extracted from the input sentence (and may be individual metrics themselves).",
        "The learning algorithm combines the features to form a model (a composite evaluation metric) that produces the final score for the input.",
        "Without human references, the features in the model proposed by Gamon et al.",
        "were primarily language model features and linguistic indicators that could be directly derived from the input sentence alone.",
        "Although their initial results were not competitive with standard reference-based metrics, their studies suggested that a referenceless metric may still provide useful information about translation fluency.",
        "However, a potential pitfall is that systems might \"game the metric\" by producing fluent outputs that are not adequate translations of the source.",
        "This paper proposes an alternative approach to evaluate MT outputs without comparing against human references.",
        "While our metrics are also trained, our model consists of different features and is trained under a different learning regime.",
        "Crucially, our model includes features that capture some notions of adequacy by comparing the input against pseudo references: sentences from other MT systems (such as commercial off-the-shelf systems or open sourced research systems).",
        "To improve fluency judgments, the model also includes features that compare the input against target-language \"references\" such as large text corpora and treebanks.",
        "Unlike human translations used by standard reference-based metrics, pseudo references are not \"gold standards\" and can be worse than the sentences being evaluated; therefore, these \"references\" in-and-of themselves are not necessarily informative enough for MT evaluation.",
        "The main insight of our approach is that through regression, the trained metrics can make more nuanced comparisons between the input and pseudo references.",
        "More specifically, our regression objective is to infer a function that maps a feature vector (which measures an input's similarity to the pseudo references) to a score that indicates the quality ofthe input.",
        "This is achieved by optimizing the model's output to correlate against a set of training examples, which are translation sentences labeled with quantitative assessments of their quality by human judges.",
        "Although this approach does incur some human effort, it is primarily for the development of training data, which, ideally, can be amortized over a long period of time.",
        "To determine the feasibility of the proposed approach, we conducted empirical studies that compare our trained metrics against standard reference-based metrics.",
        "We report three main findings.",
        "First, pseudo references are informative comparison points.",
        "Experimental results suggest that a regression-trained metric that compares against pseudo references can have higher correlations with human judgments than applying standard metrics with multiple human references.",
        "Second, the learning model that uses both adequacy and fluency features performed the best, with adequacy being the more important factor.",
        "Third, when the pseudo references are multiple MT systems, the regression-trained metric is predictive even when the input is from a better MT system than those providing the references.",
        "We conjecture that comparing MT outputs against other imperfect translations allows for a more nuanced discrimination of quality."

      "text": [
        "For a formally organized event, such as the annual MT Evaluation sponsored by National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST MT Eval), it may be worthwhile to recruit multiple human translators to translate a few hundred sentences for evaluation references.",
        "However, there are situations in which multiple human references are not practically available (e.g., the source may be of a large quantity, and no human translation exists).",
        "One such instance is translation quality assurance, in which one wishes to identify poor outputs in a large body of machine translated text automatically for human to post-edit.",
        "Another instance is in day-to-day MT research and development, where new test set with multiple references are also hard to come by.",
        "One could work with previous datasets from events such as the NIST MT Evals, but there is a danger of over-fitting.",
        "One also could extract a single reference from parallel corpora, although it is known that automatic metrics are more reliable when comparing against multiple references.",
        "The aim of this work is to develop a trainable automatic metric for evaluation without human references.",
        "This can be seen as a form of confidence estimation on MT outputs (Blatz et al., 2003; Ueffing et al., 2003; Quirk, 2004).",
        "The main distinction is that confidence estimation is typically performed with a particular system in mind, and may rely on system-internal information in estimation.",
        "In this study, we draw on only system-independent indicators so that the resulting metric may be more generally applied.",
        "This allows us to have a clearer picture of the contributing factors as they interact with different types of MT systems.",
        "Also relevant is previous work that applied machine learning approaches to MT evaluation, both with human references (Corston-Oliver et al., 2001; Kulesza and Shieber, 2004; Albrecht and Hwa, 2007; Liu and Gildea, 2007) and without (Gamon et al., 2005).",
        "One motivation for the learning approach is the ease of combining multiple criteria.",
        "Literature in translation evaluation reports a myriad of criteria that people use in their judgments, but it is not clear how these factors should be combined mathematically.",
        "Machine learning offers a principled and unified framework to induce a computational model of human's decision process.",
        "Disparate indicators can be encoded as one or more input features, and the learning algorithm tries to find a mapping from input features to a score that quantifies the input's quality by optimizing the model to match human judgments on training examples.",
        "The framework is attractive because its objective directly captures the goal of MT evaluation: how would a user rate the quality of these translations?",
        "This work differs from previous approaches in two aspects.",
        "One is the representation of the model; our model treats the metric as a distance measure even though there are no human references.",
        "Another is the training of the model.",
        "More so than when human references are available, regression is central to the success of the approach, as it determines how much we can trust the distance measures against each pseudo reference system.",
        "While our model does not use human references directly, its features are adapted from the following distance-based metrics.",
        "The well-known BLEU (Pa-pineni et al., 2002) is based on the number of common n-grams between the translation hypothesis and human reference translations of the same sentence.",
        "Metrics such as ROUGE, Head Word Chain (HWC), METEOR, and other recently proposed methods all offer different ways of comparing machine and human translations.",
        "ROUGE utilizes 'skip n-grams', which allow for matches of sequences of words that are not necessarily adjacent (Lin and Och, 2004a).",
        "METEOR uses the Porter stemmer and synonym-matching via WordNet to calculate recall and precision more accurately (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005).",
        "The HWC metrics compare dependency and constituency trees for both reference and machine translations (Liu and Gildea, 2005)."

      "text": [
        "Reference-based metrics are typically thought of as measurements of \"similarity to good translations\" because human translations are used as references, but in more general terms, they are distance measurements between two sentences.",
        "The distance between a translation hypothesis and an imperfect reference is still somewhat informative.",
        "As a toy example, consider a one-dimensional line segment.",
        "A distance from the endpoint uniquely determines the position of a point.",
        "When the reference location is anywhere else on the line segment, a relative distance to the reference does not uniquely specify a location on the line segment.",
        "However, the position of a point can be uniquely determined if we are given its relative distances to two reference locations.",
        "The problem space for MT evaluation, though more complex, is not dissimilar to the toy scenario.",
        "There are two main differences.",
        "First, we do not know the actual distance function - this is what we are trying to learn.",
        "The distance functions we have at our disposal are all heuristic approximations to the true translational distance function.",
        "Second, unlike human references, whose quality value is assumed to be maximum, the quality of a pseudo reference sentence is not known.",
        "In fact, prior to training, we do not even know the quality of the reference systems.",
        "Although the direct way to calibrate a reference system is to evaluate its outputs, this is not practically ideal, since human judgments would be needed each time we wish to incorporate a new reference system.",
        "Our proposed alternative is to calibrate the reference systems against an existing set of human judgments for a range of outputs from different MT systems.",
        "That is, if many of the reference system's outputs are similar to those MT outputs that received low assessments, we conclude this reference system may not be of high quality.",
        "Thus, if a new translation is found to be similar with this reference system's output, it is more likely for the new translation to also be bad.",
        "Both issues of combining evidences from heuristic distances and calibrating the quality of pseudo reference systems can be addressed by a probabilistic learning model.",
        "In particular, we use regression because its problem formulation fits naturally with the objective of MT evaluations.",
        "In regression learning, we are interested in approximating a function f that maps a multidimensional input vector, x, to a continuous real value, y, such that the error over a set of m training examples, {(xi, yi),..., (xm, ym)}, is minimized according to a loss function.",
        "In the context of MT evaluation, y is the \"true\" quantitative measure of translation quality for an input sentence.",
        "The function f represents a mathematical model of human judgments of translations; an input sentence is represented as a feature vector, x, which contains the information that can be extracted from the input sentence (possibly including comparisons against some reference sentences) that are relevant to computing y.",
        "Determining the set of relevant features for this modeling is ongoing research.",
        "In this work, we consider some of the more widely used metrics as features.",
        "Our full feature vector consists of r x 18 adequacy features, where r is the number of reference systems used, and 26 fluency features:",
        "Adequacy features: These include features derived from BLEU (e.g., n-gram precision, where 1 < n < 5, length ratios), PER, WER, features derived from METEOR (precision, recall, fragmentation), and ROUGE-related features (non-consecutive bigrams with a gap size of g, where 1 < g < 5 and longest common subsequence).",
        "Fluency features: We consider both string-level features such as computing n-gram precision against a target-language corpus as well as several syntax-based features.",
        "We parse each input sentence into a dependency tree and compared aspects of it against a large target-language dependency treebank.",
        "In addition to adapting the idea of Head Word Chains (Liu and Gildea, 2005), we also compared the input sentence's argument structures against the treebank for certain syntactic categories.",
        "Due to the large feature space to explore, we chose to work with support vector regression as the learning algorithm.",
        "As its loss function, support vector regression uses an e-insensitive error function, which allows for errors within a margin of a small positive value, e, to be considered as having zero error (cf. Bishop (2006), pp.339-344).",
        "Like its classification counterpart, this is a kernel-based algorithm that finds sparse solutions so that scores for new test instances are efficiently computed based on a subset of the most informative training examples.",
        "In this work, Gaussian kernels are used.",
        "The cost of regression learning is that it requires training examples that are manually assessed by human judges.",
        "However, compared to the cost of creating new references whenever new (test) sentences are evaluated, the effort of creating human assessment training data is a limited (ideally, one-time) cost.",
        "Moreover, there is already a sizable collection of human assessed data for a range of MT systems through multiple years of the NIST MT Eval efforts.",
        "Our experiments suggest that there is enough assessed data to train the proposed regression model.",
        "Aside from reducing the cost of developing human reference translations, the proposed metric also provides an alternative perspective on automatic MT evaluation that may be informative in its own right.",
        "We conjecture that a metric that compares inputs against a diverse population of differently imperfect sentences may be more discriminative in judging translation systems than solely comparing against gold standards.",
        "That is, two sentences may be considered equally bad from the perspective of a gold standard, but subtle differences between them may become more prominent if they are compared against sentences in their peer group."
