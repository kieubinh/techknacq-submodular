        "Automatic word alignment can be defined as the problem of determining a translational correspondence at word level given a parallel corpus ofaligned sentences.",
        "Most current statistical models (Brown et al., 1993; Vogel et al., 1996; Deng and Byrne, 2005) treat the aligned sentences in the corpus as sequences of tokens that are meant to be words; the goal of the alignment process is to find links between source and target words.",
        "Before applying such aligners, we thus need to segment the sentences into words - a task which can be quite hard for languages such as Chinese for which word boundaries are not orthographically marked.",
        "More importantly, however, this segmentation is often performed in a monolingual context, which makes the word alignment task more difficult since different languages may realize the same concept using varying numbers of words (see e.g. (Wu, 1997)).",
        "Moreover, a segmentation considered to be \"good\" from a monolingual point of view may be unadapted for training alignment models.",
        "Although some statistical alignment models allow for 1-to-n word alignments for those reasons, they rarely question the monolingual tokenization and the basic unit of the alignment process remains the word.",
        "In this paper, we focus on 1-to-n alignments with the goal of simplifying the task of automatic word aligners by packing several consecutive words together when we believe they correspond to a single word in the opposite language; by identifying enough such cases, we reduce the number of 1-to-n alignments, thus making the task of word alignment both easier and more natural.",
        "Our approach consists of using the output from an existing statistical word aligner to obtain a set of candidates for word packing.",
        "We evaluate the reliability of these candidates, using simple metrics based on co-occurence frequencies, similar to those used in associative approaches to word alignment (Kitamura and Matsumoto, 1996; Melamed, 2000; Tiedemann, 2003).",
        "We then modify the segmentation of the sentences in the parallel corpus according to this packing of words; these modified sentences are then given back to the word aligner, which produces new alignments.",
        "We evaluate the validity of our approach by measuring the influence of the alignment process on a Chinese-to-English Machine Translation (MT) task.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we study the case of 1-ton word alignment.",
        "Section 3 introduces an automatic method to pack together groups ofconsecutive words based on the output from a word aligner.",
        "In Section 4, the experimental setting is described.",
        "In Section 5, we evaluate the influence of our method on the alignment process on a Chinese to English MT task, and experimental results are presented.",
        "Section 6 concludes the paper and gives avenues for future work."

        "The same concept can be expressed in different languages using varying numbers of words; for example, a single Chinese word may surface as a compound or a collocation in English.",
        "This is frequent for languages as different as Chinese and English.",
        "To quickly (and approximately) evaluate this phenomenon, we trained the statistical IBM word-alignment model 4 (Brown et al., 1993), using the GIZA++ software (Och and Ney, 2003) for the following language pairs: Chinese-English, Italian-English, and Dutch-English, using the IWSLT-2006 corpus (Takezawa et al., 2002; Paul, 2006) for the first two language pairs, and the Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2005) for the last one.",
        "These asymmetric models produce 1-to-n alignments, with n > 0, in both directions.",
        "Here, it is important to mention that the segmentation of sentences is performed totally independently of the bilingual alignment process, i.e. it is done in a monolingual context.",
        "For European languages, we apply the maximum-entropy based tokenizer of OpenNLP; the Chinese sentences were human segmented (Paul, 2006).",
        "In Table 1, we report the frequencies of the different types of alignments for the various languages and directions.",
        "As expected, the number of 1: n alignments with n = 1 is high for Chinese-English (~ 40%), and significantly higher than for the European languages.",
        "The case of 1-to-n alignments is, therefore, obviously an important issue when dealing with Chinese-English word alignment.",
        "Fertility-based models such as IBM models 3, 4, and 5 allow for alignments between one word and several words (1-to-n or 1: n alignments in what follows), in particular for the reasons specified above.",
        "They can be seen as extensions of the simpler IBM models 1 and 2 (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "Similarly, Deng and Byrne (2005) propose an HMM framework capable of dealing with 1 ton alignment, which is an extension ofthe original model of(Vogel et al., 1996).",
        "However, these models rarely question the monolingual tokenization, i.e. the basic unit of the alignment process is the word.",
        "One alternative to extending the expressivity of one model (and usually its complexity) is to focus on the input representation; in particular, we argue that the alignment process can benefit from a simplification of the input, which consists of trying to reduce the number of 1 ton alignments to consider.",
        "Note that the need to consider segmentation and alignment at the same time is also mentioned in (Tiedemann, 2003), and related issues are reported in (Wu, 1997).",
        "While in this paper, we focus on Chinese-English, the method proposed is applicable to any language pair - even for closely related languages, we expect improvements to be seen.",

        "In this section, we present an automatic method that builds upon the output from an existing automatic word aligner.",
        "More specifically, we (i) use a word aligner to obtain 1 ton alignments, (ii) extract candidates for word packing, (iii) estimate the reliability of these candidates, (iv) replace the groups of words to pack by a single token in the parallel corpus, and (v) reiterate the alignment process using the updated corpus.",
        "The first three steps are performed in both directions, and produce two bilingual dictionaries (source-target and target-source) of groups of words to pack.",
        "In the following, we assume the availability of an automatic word aligner that can output alignments AC_E and AE_C for any sentence pair (cJ,e{) in a parallel corpus.",
        "We also assume that AC_Eand AE_C contain 1: n alignments.",
        "Our method for repacking words is very simple: whenever a single word is aligned with several consecutive words, they are considered candidates for repacking.",

        "The same goes for Ae^c .",

        "We thus additionally evaluate the reliability of the candidates we extract and filter them before inclusion in our bilingual dictionary.",
        "To perform this filtering, we use two simple statistical measures.",
        "In the following, aj = (ci, Ej) denotes a candidate.",
        "The first measure we consider is co-occurrence frequency (COOC(cj, Ej)), i.e. the number of times Cj and Ej co-occur in the bilingual corpus.",
        "This very simple measure is frequently used in associative approaches (Melamed, 1997; Tiedemann, 2003).",

        "'Consequently, if we compare our approach to the problem of collocation identification, we may say that we are more interested in precision than recall (Smadja et al., 1996).",

        "aligner aligns c, and E, when they co-occur.",
        "We also impose that | E, | < k, where k is a fixed integer that may depend on the language pair (between 3 and 5 in practice).",
        "The rationale behind this is that it is very rare to get reliable alignment between one word and k consecutive words when k is high.",
        "The candidates are included in our bilingual dictionary if and only if their measures are above some fixed thresholds tcooc and iac, which allow for the control of the size of the dictionary and the quality of its contents.",
        "Some other measures (including the Dice coefficient) could be considered; however, it has to be noted that we are more interested here in the filtering than in the discovery of alignment, since our method builds upon an existing aligner.",
        "Moreover, we will see that even these simple measures can lead to an improvement of the alignment process in a MT context (cf.",
        "Section 5).",
        "Once the candidates are extracted, we repack the words in the bilingual dictionaries constructed using the method described above; this provides us with an updated training corpus, in which some word sequences have been replaced by a single token.",
        "This update is totally naive: if an entry a, = (c,, E,) is present in the dictionary and matches one sentence pair (cJ,e{) (i.e. c, and E, are respectively contained in cJ and e{), then we replace the sequence of words E, with a single token which becomes a new lexical unit.",
        "Note that this replacement occurs even if no alignment was found between c, and E, for the pair (cJ, e{).",
        "This is motivated by the fact that the filtering described above is quite conservative; we trust the entry a» to be correct.",
        "This update is performed in both directions.",
        "It is then possible to run the word aligner using the updated (simplified) parallel corpus, in order to get new alignments.",
        "By performing a deterministic word packing, we avoid the computation of the fertility parameters associated with fertility-based models.",
        "Word packing can be applied several times: once we have grouped some words together, they become the new basic unit to consider, and we can rerun the same method to get additional groupings.",
        "However, we have not seen in practice much benefit from running it more than twice (few new candidates are extracted after two iterations).",
        "It is also important to note that this process is bilingually motivated and strongly depends on the language pair.",
        "For example, white wine, excuse me, call the police, and cup of (cf.",
        "Figure 1) translate respectively as vin blanc, excusez-moi, appellez la police, and tasse de in French.",
        "Those groupings would not be found for a language pair such as French-English, which is consistent with the fact that they are less useful for French-English than for Chinese-English in a MT perspective.",
