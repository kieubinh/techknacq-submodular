        "E.g., in text-to-text generation (Barzi-lay & McKeown, 2005; Marsi & Krahmer, 2005; Wan et al., 2005), new sentences are fused from dependency structures of input sentences.",
        "The last step of sentence fusion is linearization of the resulting parse.",
        "Even for English, which is a language with fixed word order, this is not a trivial task.",
        "German has a relatively free word order.",
        "This concerns the order of constituents within sentences while the order of words within constituents is relatively rigid.",
        "The grammar only partially prescribes how constituents dependent on the verb should be ordered, and for many clauses each of the n!",
        "possible permutations of n constituents is grammatical.",
        "'Henceforth, we will use this term to refer to constituents dependent on the clausal top node, i.e. a verb, only.",
        "In spite of the permanent interest in German word order in the linguistics community, most studies have limited their scope to the order of verb arguments and few researchers have implemented - and even less evaluated - a generation algorithm.",
        "In this paper, we present an algorithm, which orders not only verb arguments but all kinds of constituents, and evaluate it on a corpus of biographies.",
        "For each parsed sentence in the test set, our maximum-entropy-based algorithm aims at reproducing the order found in the original text.",
        "We investigate the importance of different linguistic factors and suggest an algorithm to constituent ordering which first determines the sentence initial constituent and then orders the remaining ones.",
        "We provide evidence that the task requires language-specific knowledge to achieve better results and point to the most difficult part of it.",
        "Similar to Langkilde & Knight (1998) we utilize statistical methods.",
        "Unlike overgeneration approaches (Varges & Mellish, 2001, inter alia) which select the best of all possible outputs ours is more efficient, because we do not need to generate every permutation."

        "It has been suggested that several factors have an influence on German constituent order.",
        "Apart from the constraints posed by the grammar, information structure, surface form, and discourse status have also been shown to play a role.",
        "It has also been observed that there are preferences for a particular order.",
        "The preferences summarized below have motivated our choice of features:",
        "• constituents in the nominative case precede those in other cases, and dative constituents often precede those in the accusative case (Uszkoreit, 1987; Keller, 2000);",
        "• the verb arguments' order depends on the verb's subcategorization properties (Kurz,",
        "• constituents with a definite article precede those with an indefinite one (Weber & Miiller, 2004);",
        "• pronominalized constituents precede non-pronominalized ones (Kempen & Harbusch,",
        "• animate referents precede inanimate ones (Pap-",
        "• short constituents precede longer ones (Kimball, 1973);",
        "• the preferred topic position is right after the",
        "• the initial position is usually occupied by scene-setting elements and topics (Speyer,",
        "2005) .",
        "• there is a default order based on semantic properties of constituents (Sgall et al., 1986):",
        "Actor < Temporal < SpaceLocative < Means < Addressee < Patient < Source < Destination < Purpose",
        "Note that most of these preferences were identified in corpus studies and experiments with native speakers and concern the order of verb arguments only.",
        "Little has been said so far about how non-arguments should be ordered.",
        "German is a verb second language, i.e., the position of the verb in the main clause is determined exclusively by the grammar and is insensitive to other factors.",
        "Thus, the German main clause is divided into two parts by the finite verb: Vorfeld (VF), which contains exactly one constituent, and Mittelfeld (MF), where the remaining constituents are located.",
        "The subordinate clause normally has only MF.",
        "The VF and MF are marked with brackets in Example 1:",
        "(1) [Außerdem] entwickelte [Lummer eine Apart from that developed Lummer a Quecksilberdampflampe, um Mercury-vapor lamp to monochromatisches Licht herzustellen].",
        "monochrome light produce.",
        "'Apart from that, Lummer developed a Mercury-vapor lamp to produce monochrome light'.",
        "The essential contribution of our study is that we treat preverbal and postverbal parts of the sentence differently.",
        "The sentence-initial position, which in German is the VF, has been shown to be cognitively more prominent than other positions (Gernsbacher & Hargreaves, 1988).",
        "Motivated by the theoretical work by Chafe (1976) and Jacobs (2001), we view the VF as the place for elements which modify the situation described in the sentence, i.e. for so called frame-setting topics (Jacobs, 2001).",
        "For example, temporal or locational constituents, or anaphoric adverbs are good candidates for the VF.",
        "We hypothesize that the reasons which bring a constituent to the VF are different from those which place it, say, to the beginning of the MF, for the order in the MF has been shown to be relatively rigid (Keller, 2000; Kempen & Harbusch, 2004).",
        "Speakers have the freedom of selecting the outgoing point for a sentence.",
        "Once they have selected it, the remaining constituents are arranged in the MF, mainly according to their grammatical properties.",
        "This last observation motivates another hypothesis we make: The cumulation of the properties of a constituent determines its salience.",
        "This salience can be calculated and used for ordering with a simple rule stating that more salient constituents should precede less salient ones.",
        "In this case there is no need to generate all possible orders and rank them.",
        "The best order can be obtained from a random one by sorting.",
        "Our experiments support this view.",
        "A two-step approach, which first selects the best candidate for the VF and then arranges the remaining constituents in the MF with respect to their salience performs better than algorithms which generate the order for a sentence as a whole."

        "Such elements were placed in the VF instead of the subject and caused an error although both variants were equally acceptable.",
        "In other cases the classi-ier could not ind a better candidate but the subject because it could not conclude from the provided features that another constituent would nicely introduce the sentence into the discourse.",
        "Mainly this concerns recognizing information familiar to the reader not by an already mentioned entity, but one which is inferrable from what has been read.",
        "In the MF, many orders had a PP transposed with the direct object.",
        "In some cases the predicted order seemed as good as the correct one.",
        "Often the algorithm failed at identifying verb-speciic preferences:",
        "E.g., some verbs take PPs with the locational meaning as an argument and normally have them right next to them, whereas others do not.",
        "Another frequent error was the wrong placement ofsupericially identical constituents, e.g. two PPs of the same size.",
        "To handle this error, the system needs more spe-ciic semantic information.",
        "Some errors were caused by the parser, which created extra constituents (e.g. false PP or adverb attachment) or confused the subject with the direct verb.",
        "We retrained our system on a corpus of newspaper articles (Telljohann et al., 2003, TiiBa-D/Z) which is manually annotated but encodes no semantic knowledge.",
        "The results for the MF were the same as on the data from Wikipedia.",
        "The results for the VF were much worse (45%) because of the lack of semantic information."

        "We presented a novel approach to ordering constituents in German.",
        "The results indicate that a linguistically-motivated two-step system, which irst selects a constituent for the initial position and then orders the remaining ones, works signiicantly better than approaches which do not make this separation.",
        "Our results also confirm the hypothesis - which has been attested in several corpus studies - that the order in the MF is rather rigid and dependent on grammatical properties.",
        "We have also demonstrated that there is no need to overgenerate to ind the best order.",
        "On a practical side, this inding reduces the amount of work considerably.",
        "Theoretically, it lets us conclude that the relatively ixed order in the MF depends on the salience which can be predicted mainly from grammatical features.",
        "It is much harder to predict which element should be placed in the VF.",
        "We suppose that this dificulty comes from the double function of the initial position which can either introduce the ad-dressation topic, or be the scene-or frame-setting position (Jacobs, 2001).",
