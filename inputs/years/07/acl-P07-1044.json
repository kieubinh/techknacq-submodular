        "We then develop a machine learner based on these, and show that this performs better than the individual parser metrics, approaching a lower bound on human performance.",

      "text": [
        "Intrinsic evaluation of the output of many language technologies can be characterised as having at least two aspects: how well the generated text reflects the source data, whether it be text in another language for machine translation (MT), a natural language generation (NLG) input representation, a document to be summarised, and so on; and how well it conforms to normal human language usage.",
        "These two aspects are often made explicit in approaches to creating the text.",
        "For example, in statistical MT the translation model and the language model are treated separately, characterised as faithfulness and fluency respectively (as in the treatment in Jurafsky and Martin (2000)).",
        "Similarly, the ultrasummarisation model of Witbrock and Mittal (1999) consists of a content model, modelling the probability that a word in the source text will be in the summary, and a language model.",
        "Evaluation methods can be said to fall into two categories: a comparison to gold reference, or an appeal to human judgements.",
        "Automatic evaluation methods carrying out a comparison to gold reference tend to conflate the two aspects of faithfulness and fluency in giving a goodness score for generated output.",
        "Bleu (Papineni et al., 2002) is a canonical example: in matching n-grams in a candidate translation text with those in a reference text, the metric measures faithfulness by counting the matches, and fluency by implicitly using the reference n-grams as a language model.",
        "Often we are interested in knowing the quality of the two aspects separately; many human judgement frameworks ask specifically for separate judgements on elements of the task that correspond to faithfulness and to fluency.",
        "In addition, the need for reference texts for an evaluation metric can be problematic, and intuitively seems unnecessary for characterising an aspect of text quality that is not related to its content source but to the use of language itself.",
        "It is a goal of this paper to provide an automatic evaluation method for fluency alone, without the use of a reference text.",
        "One might consider using a metric based on language model probabilities for sentences: in evaluating a language model on (already existing) test data, a higher probability for a sentence (and lower perplexity over a whole test corpus) indicates better language modelling; perhaps a higher probability might indicate a better sentence.",
        "However, here we are looking at generated sentences, which have been generated using their own language model, rather than human-authored sentences already existing in a test corpus; and so it is not obvious what language model would be an objective assessment ofsentence naturalness.",
        "In the case of evaluating a single system, using the language model that generated the sentence will only confirm that the sentence does fit the language model; in situations such as comparing two systems which each generate text using a different language model, it is not obvious that there is a principled way of deciding on a fair language model.",
        "Quite a different idea was suggested in Wan et al.",
        "(2005), of using the grammatical judgement of a parser to assess fluency, giving a measure independent of the language model used to generate the text.",
        "The idea is that, assuming the parser has been trained on an appropriate corpus, the poor performance of the parser on one sentence relative to another might be an indicator of some degree of ungrammaticality and possibly disfluency.",
        "In that work, however, correlation with human judgements was left uninvestigated.",
        "The goal of this paper is to take this idea and develop it.",
        "In Section 2 we look at some related work on metrics, in particular for NLG.",
        "In Section 3, we verify whether parser outputs can be used as estimators of generated sentence fluency by correlating them with human judgements.",
        "In Section 4, we propose an SVM-based metric using parser outputs as features, and compare its correlation against human judgements with that of the individual parsers.",
        "In Section 5, we investigate the effects on the various metrics from different types of language model for the generated text.",
        "Then in Section 6 we conclude."

        "As a further contrast, the analysis of Coch (1996) was very comprehensive and fine-grained, in a comparison of three text-production techniques: he used 14 human judges, each judging 60 letters (20 per generation system), and required them to assess the letters for correct spelling, good grammar, rhythm and flow, appropriateness of tone, and several other specific characteristics of good text.",

        "There are three parts to verifying the usefulness of parsers as evaluators: choosing the parsers and the metrics derived from them; generating some texts for human and parser evaluation; and, the key part, getting human judgements on these texts and correlating them with parser metrics.",
        "In testing the idea of using parsers to judge fluency, we use three parsers, from which we derive four parser metrics, to investigate the general applicability of the idea.",
        "Those chosen were the Connexor parser, the Collins parser (Collins, 1999), and the Link Grammar parser (Grinberg et al., 1995).",
        "Each produces output that can be taken as representing degree of ungrammaticality, although this output is quite different for each.",
        "Connexor is a commercially available dependency parser that returns head-dependant relations as well as stemming information, part of speech, and so on.",
        "In the case of an ungrammatical sentence, Connexor returns tree fragments, where these fragments are defined by transitive head-dependant relations: for example, for the sentence Everybody likes big cakes do it returns fragments for Everybody likes big cakes and for do.",
        "We expect that the number of fragments should correlate inversely with the quality of a sentence.",
        "For a metric, we normalise this number by the largest number of fragments for a given data set.",
        "(Normalisation matters most for the machine learner in Section 4.)",
        "The Collins parser is a statistical chart parser that aims to maximise the probability of a parse using dynamic programming.",
        "The parse tree produced is annotated with log probabilities, including one for the whole tree.",
        "In the case of ungrammatical sentences, the parser will assign a low probability to any parse, including the most likely one.",
        "We expect that the log probability (becoming more negative as the sentence is less likely) should correlate positively with the quality of a sentence.",
        "For a metric, we normalise this by the most negative value for a given data set.",
        "Like Connexor, the Link Grammar parser returns information about word relationships, forming links, with the proviso that links cannot cross and that in a grammatical sentence all links are indirectly connected.",
        "For an ungrammatical sentence, the parser will delete words until it can produce a parse; the number it deletes is called the 'null count'.",
        "We expect that this should correlate inversely with sentence quality.",
        "For a metric, we normalise this by the sentence length.",
        "In addition, the parser produces another variable possibly of interest.",
        "In generating a parse, the parser produces many candidates and rules some out by a posteriori constraints on valid parses.",
        "In its output the parser returns the number of invalid parses.",
        "For an ungrammatical sentence, this number may be higher; however, there may also be more parses.",
        "For a metric, we normalise this by the total number of parses found for the sentence.",
        "There is no strong intuition about the direction of correlation here, but we investigate it in any case.",
        "To test whether these parsers are able to discriminate sentence-length texts of varying degrees of fluency, we need first to generate texts that we expect will be discriminable in fluency quality ranging from good to very poor.",
        "Below we describe our method for generating text, and then our preliminary check on the discriminability of the data before giving them to human judges.",
        "Our approach to generating 'sentences' of a fixed length is to take word sequences of different lengths from a corpus and glue them together probabilistically: the intuition is that a few longer sequences glued together will be more fluent than many shorter sequences.",
        "More precisely, to generate a sentence of length n, we take sequences of length l (such that l divides n), with sequence i of the form wi;1... wi;1, where is a word or punctuation mark.",
        "We start by selecting sequence 1, first by randomly choosing its first word according to the unigram probability P(w1;1), and then the sequence uniformly randomly over all sequences of length l starting with w1;1; we select subsequent sequences j (2 < j < n/l) randomly according to the bigram probability P(wj11 Wj-1}i).",

        "Regarding the interpretation of the absolute value of (Pearson's) correlation coefficients, both here and in the rest of the paper, we adopt Cohen's scale (Cohen, 1988) for use in human judgements, given in Table 1; we use this as most of this work is to do with human judgements of fluency.",
        "For data, we generated 1000 sentences of length 24 for each sequence length l = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 24, giving 7000 sentences in total.",
        "The correlations with the four parser outputs are as in Table 2, with the medium correlations for Collins and Link Grammar (nulled tokens) indicating that the sentences are indeed discriminable to some extent, and hence the approach is likely to be useful for generating sentences for human trials.",
        "The next step is then to obtain a set of human judgements for this data.",
        "Human judges can only be expected to judge a reasonably sized amount of data, so we first reduced the set of sequence sizes to be judged.",
        "To do this we determined for the 7000 generated sentences the scores according to the (arbitrarily chosen) Collins parser, and calculated the means for each sequence size and the 95% confidence intervals around these means.",
        "We then chose a subset of sequence sizes such that the confidence intervals did not overlap: 1,2,4,8,24; the idea was that this would be likely to give maximally discriminable sentences.",
        "For each of these sequences sizes, we chose randomly 10 sentences from the initial set, giving a set for human judgement of size 50.",

        "We instructed them also that they should evaluate the sentence without considering its content, using Colourless green ideas sleep furiously as an example of a nonsensical but perfectly fluent sentence.",
        "The judges were then presented with the 50 sentences in random order, and asked to score the sentences according to their own scale, as in magnitude estimation (Bard et al., 1996); these scores were then normalised in the range [0,1].",
        "Some judges noted that the task was difficult because of its subjectivity.",
        "Notwithstanding this subjectivity and variation in their approach to the task, the pairwise correlations between judges were high, as indicated by the maximum, minimum and mean values in Table 3, indicating that our assumption that humans had an intuitive notion of fluency and needed only minimal instruction was justified.",
        "Looking at mean scores for each sequence size, judges generally also ranked sentences by sequence size; see Figure 2.",
        "Comparing human judgement correlations against sequence size with the same correlations for the parser metrics (as for Table 2, but on the human trial data) gives Table 4, indicating that humans can also discriminate the different generated sentence types, in fact (not surprisingly) better than the automatic metrics.",

        "Our previous approach used only sequences of words concatenated together.",
        "To define some new methods for generating text, we introduced varying amounts of structure into the generation process.",
        "PoStag In the first of these, we constructed a rough approximation of typical sentence grammar structure by taking bigrams over part-of-speech tags.",

        "We then use a Viterbi-style algorithm to find the most likely word sequence.",
        "In this model we violate the Markov assumption of independence in much the same way as Witbrock and Mittal (1999) in their combination of content and language model probabilities, by backtracking at every state in order to discourage repeated words and avoid loops.",
        "Supertag This is a variant of the approach above, but using supertags (Bangalore and Joshi, 1999) instead of PoS tags.",

        "In general, there is at least one parser that correlates quite well with the human judges for each sentence type.",
        "With well-structured sentences, the probabilistic Collins parser performs best; on sentences that are generated by a poor probabilistic model leading to poor structure, Link Grammar (nulled tokens) performs best.",
        "This supports the use of a machine learner taking as features outputs from several parser types; empirically this is confirmed by the large advantage Gleu has on overall data (Table 9).",
        "The generated text itself from the Viterbi-based generators as implemented here is quite disappointing, given an expectation that introducing structure would make sentences more natural and hence lead to a range of sentence qualities.",
        "In hindsight, this is not so surprising; in generating the structure template, only sequences (over tags) of size 1 were used, which is perhaps why the human judges deemed them fairly close to sentences generated by the original method using sequence size 1, the poorest ofthat initial data set.",

        "In this paper we have investigated a new approach to evaluating the fluency of individual generated sentences.",
        "The notion of what constitutes fluency is an imprecise one, but trials with human judges have shown that even if it cannot be exactly defined, or even articulated by the judges, there is a high level of agreement about what is fluent and what is not.",
        "Given this data, metrics derived from parser outputs have been found useful for measuring fluency, correlating up to moderately well with these human judgements.",
        "A better approach is to combine these in a machine learner, as in our SVM Gleu, which outperforms individual parser metrics.",
        "Interestingly, we have found that the parser metrics can be fooled by the method of sentence generation; Gleu, however, gives a consistent estimate of fluency regardless of generation type; and, across all types of generated sentences examined in this paper, is superior to individual parser metrics by a large margin.",
        "This all suggests that the approach has promise, but it needs to be developed further for pratical use.",
        "The SVM presented in this paper has only four features; more features, and in particular a wider range of parsers, should raise correlations.",
        "In terms of the data, we looked only at sentences generated with several parameters fixed, such as sentence length, due to our limited pool of judges.",
        "In future we would like to examine the space of sentence types more fully.",
        "In particular, we will look at predicting the fluency of near-human quality sentences.",
        "More generally, we would like to look also at how the approach of this paper would relate to a perplexity-based metric; how it compares against Bleu or similar measures as a predictor of fluency in a context where reference sentences are available; and whether Gleu might be useful in applications such as reranking of candidate sentences in MT."
