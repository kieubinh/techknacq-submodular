        "Gesture, for example, is sometimes communicative, but other times merely distracting.",
        "While people have little difficulty distinguishing between meaningful gestures and irrelevant hand motions (e.g., self-touching, adjusting glasses) (Goodwin and Goodwin, 1986), NLP systems may be confused by such seemingly random movements.",
        "Our goal is to include non-verbal features only in the specific cases when they are helpful and necessary.",
        "We present a model that learns in an unsupervised fashion when non-verbal features are useful, allowing it to gate the contribution of those features.",
        "The relevance of the non-verbal features is treated as a hidden variable, which is learned jointly with the class label in a conditional model.",
        "We demonstrate that this improves performance on binary corefer-ence resolution, the task of determining whether a noun phrases refers to a single semantic entity.",
        "Conditional modality fusion yields a relative increase of 73% in the contribution of hand-gesture features.",

        "For example, if we are to compare the similarity of the gestures that accompany the two noun phrases, it should be the case that gesture is relevant during both time periods.",
        "For this reason, we create two hidden variables, mi and m2; they indicate the relevance of gesture over the first (antecedent) and second (anaphor) noun phrases, respectively.",

        "In addition, parameter tying in the HMM forces all clusters but one to represent static hold, with the remaining cluster accounting for the transition movements between holds.",

        "We have assumed that the relevance of gesture to semantics is dependent only on the currently available features, and not conditioned on prior history.",
        "In reality, meaningful gestures occur over contiguous blocks of time, rather than at randomly distributed instances.",
        "Indeed, the psychology literature describes a finite-state model of gesture, proceeding from \"preparation,\" to \"stroke,\" \"hold,\" and then \"retraction\" (McNeill, 1992).",
        "These units are called movement phases.",
        "The relevance of various gesture features may be expected to depend on the movement phase.",
        "During strokes, the trajectory of the gesture may be the most relevant feature, while during holds, static features such as hand position and hand shape may dominate; during preparation and retraction, gesture features are likely to be irrelevant.",
        "The identification of these movement phases should be independent of the specific problem of coreference resolution.",
        "Thus, additional labels for other linguistic phenomena (e.g., topic segmentation, disfluency) could be combined into the model.",
        "Ideally, each additional set of labels would transfer performance gains to the other labeling problems."

        "We have presented a new method for combining multiple modalities, which we feel is especially relevant to non-verbal modalities that are used to communicate only intermittently.",
        "Our model treats the relevance of the non-verbal modality as a hidden variable, learned jointly with the class labels.",
        "Applied to coreference resolution, this model yields a relative increase of 73% in the contribution of the gesture features.",
        "This gain is attained by identifying instances in which gesture features are especially relevant, and weighing their contribution more heavily.",
        "We next plan to investigate models with a temporal component, so that the behavior of the hidden variable is governed by a finite-state transducer.",
