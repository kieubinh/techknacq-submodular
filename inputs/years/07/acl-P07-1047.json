        "To facilitate effective human machine conversation, it is important for a conversational system to have knowledge about user vocabularies and understand how these vocabularies are mapped to the internal entities for which the system has representations.",
        "For example, in a multimodal conversational system that allows users to converse with a graphic interface, the system needs to know what vocabularies users tend to use to describe objects on the graphic display and what (type of) object(s) a user is attending to when a particular word is expressed.",
        "Here, we use acquisition to refer to the process of acquiring relevant vocabularies describing internal entities, and interpretation to refer to the process of automatically identifying internal entities given a particular word.",
        "Both acquisition and interpretation have been traditionally approached by either knowledge engineering (e.g., manually created lexicons) or supervised learning from annotated data.",
        "In this paper, we describe an unsupervised approach that relies on naturally co-occurred eye gaze and spoken utterances during human machine conversation to automatically acquire and interpret vocabularies.",
        "Motivated by psycholinguistic studies (Just and Carpenter, 1976; Griffin and Bock, 2000; Tenenhaus et al., 1995) and recent investigations on computational models for language acquisition and grounding (Siskind, 1995; Roy and Pentland, 2002; Yu and Ballard, 2004), we are particularly interested in two unique questions related to multimodal conversational systems: (1) In a multimodal conversation that involves more complex tasks (e.g., both user initiated tasks and system initiated tasks), is there a reliable temporal alignment between eye gaze and spoken references so that the coupled inputs can be used for automated vocabulary acquisition and interpretation?",
        "(2) If such an alignment exists, how can we model this alignment and automatically acquire and interpret the vocabularies?",
        "To address the first question, we conducted an empirical study to examine the temporal relationships between eye fixations and their corresponding spoken references.",
        "As shown later in section 4, although a larger variance (compared to the findings from psycholinguistic studies) exists in terms of how eye gaze is linked to speech production during human machine conversation, eye fixations and the corresponding spoken references still occur in a very close vicinity to each other.",
        "This natural coupling between eye gaze and speech provides an opportunity to automatically learn the mappings between words and objects without any human supervision.",
        "Because of the larger variance, it is difficult to apply rule-based approaches to quantify this alignment.",
        "Therefore, to address the second question, we developed an approach based on statistical translation models to explore the co-occurrence patterns between eye fixated objects and spoken references.",
        "Our preliminary experiment results indicate that the translation model can reliably capture the mappings between the eye fixated objects and the corresponding spoken references.",
        "Given an object, this model can provide possible words describing this object, which represents the acquisition process; given a word, this model can also provide possible objects that are likely to be described, which represents the interpretation process.",
        "In the following sections, we first review some related work and introduce the procedures used to collect eye gaze and speech data during human machine conversation.",
        "We then describe our empirical study and the unsupervised approach based on translation models.",
        "Finally, we present experiment results and discuss their implications in natural language processing applications."

        "Our work is motivated by previous work in the following three areas: psycholinguistics studies, multimodal interactive systems, and computational modeling of language acquisition and grounding.",
        "Previous psycholinguistics studies have shown that the direction of gaze carries information about the focus of the user's attention (Just and Carpenter, 1976).",
        "Specifically, in human language processing tasks, eye gaze is tightly linked to language production.",
        "The perceived visual context influences spoken word recognition and mediates syntactic processing (Tenenhaus et al., 1995).",
        "Additionally, before speaking a word, the eyes usually move to the objects to be mentioned (Griffin and Bock, 2000).",
        "These psycholinguistics findings have provided a foundation for our investigation.",
        "In research on multimodal interactive systems, recent work indicates that the speech and gaze integration patterns can be modeled reliably for individual users and therefore be used to improve multimodal system performances (Kaur et al., 2003).",
        "Studies have also shown that eye gaze has a potential to improve resolution of underspecified referring expressions in spoken dialog systems (Campana et al., 2001) and to disambiguate speech input (Tanaka, 1999).",
        "In contrast to these earlier studies, our work focuses on a different goal of using eye gaze for automated vocabulary acquisition and interpretation.",
        "The third area of research that influenced our work is computational modeling of language acquisition and grounding.",
        "Recent studies have shown that multisensory information (e.g., through vision and language processing) can be combined to effectively acquire words to their perceptually grounded objects in the environment (Siskind, 1995; Roy and Pentland, 2002; Yu and Ballard, 2004).",
        "Especially in (Yu and Ballard, 2004), an unsupervised approach based on a generative correspondence model was developed to capture the mapping between spoken words and the occurring perceptual features of objects.",
        "This approach is most similar to the translation model used in our work.",
        "However, compared to this work where multisensory information comes from vision and language processing, our work focuses on a different aspect.",
        "Here, instead of applying vision processing on objects, we are interested in eye gaze behavior when users interact with a graphic display.",
        "Eye gaze is an implicit and subconscious input modality during human machine interaction.",
        "Eye gaze data inevitably contain a significant amount of noise.",
        "Therefore, it is the goal of this paper to examine whether this modality can be utilized for vocabulary acquisition for conversational systems."

        "A room interior scene was displayed on a computer screen, as shown in Figure 1.",
        "While watching the graphical display, users were asked to communicate with the system on topics about the room decorations.",
        "A total of 28 objects (e.g., multiple lamps and picture frames, a bed, two chairs, a candle, a dresser, etc., as marked in Figure 1) are explicitly modeled in this scene.",

        "The collected raw gaze data is extremely noisy.",
        "To refine the gaze data, we further eliminated invalid and saccadic gaze points (known as \"saccadic suppression\" in vision studies).",
        "Since eyes do not stay still but rather make small, frequent jerky movements, we also smoothed the data by averaging nearby gaze locations to identify fixations."

      "text": [
        "Based on the data collected, we investigated the temporal alignment between co-occurred eye gaze and spoken utterances.",
        "In particular, we examined the temporal alignment between eye gaze fixations and the corresponding spoken references (i.e., the spoken words that are used to refer to the objects on the graphic display).",
        "According to the time-stamp information, we can measure the length of time gap between a user's eye fixation falling on an object and the corresponding spoken reference being uttered (which we refer to as \"length of time gap\" for brevity).",
        "Also, we can count the number of times that user fixations happen to change their target objects during this time gap (which we refer to as \"number of fixated object changes\" for brevity).",
        "The nine most frequently occurred spoken references in utterances from all users (as shown in Table 1) are chosen for this empirical study.",
        "For each of those spoken references, we use human judgment to decide which object is referred to.",
        "Then, from both before and after the onset of the spoken reference, we find the closest occurrence of the fixation falling on that particular object.",
        "Altogether we have 96 such speech-gaze pairs.",
        "In 54 pairs, the eye gaze fixation occurred before the corresponding speech reference was uttered; and in the other 42 pairs, the eye fixation occurred after the corresponding speech reference was uttered.",
        "This observation suggests that in human machine conversation, eye fixation on an object does not necessarily always proceed the utterance of the corresponding speech reference.",
        "Further, we computed the average absolute length of the time gap and the average number of fixated object changes, as well as their variances for each of 5 selected users as shown in Table 1.",
        "From Table 1, it is easy to observe that: (I) A spoken reference always appears within a short period of time (usually 1-2 seconds) before or after the corresponding eye gaze fixation.",
        "But, the exact length of the period is far from constant.",
        "(II) It is not necessary for a user to utter the corresponding spoken reference immediately before or after the eye gaze fixation falls on that particular object.",
        "Eye gaze fixations may move back and forth.",
        "Between the time an object is fixated and the corresponding spoken reference is uttered, a user's eye gaze may fixate on a few other objects (reflected by the average number of eye fixated object changes shown in the table).",
        "(III) There is a large variance in both the length of time gap and the number of fixated object changes in terms of 1) the same user and the same spoken reference at different time-stamps, 2) the same user but different spo-",
        "Table 1: The average absolute length of time and the number of eye fixated object changes within the time gap of eye gaze and corresponding spoken references.",
        "Variances are also listed.",
        "Some of the entries are not available because the spoken references were never or rarely used by the corresponding users.",
        "ken references, and 3) the same spoken reference but different users.",
        "We believe this is due to the different dialog scenarios and user language habits.",
        "To summarize our empirical study, we find that in human machine conversation, there still exists a natural temporal coupling between user speech and eye gaze, i.e. the spoken reference and the corresponding eye fixation happen within a close vicinity of each other.",
        "However, a large variance is also observed in terms of these temporal vicinities, which indicates an intrinsically more complex gaze-speech pattern.",
        "Therefore, it is hard to directly quantify the temporal or ordering relationship between spoken references and corresponding eye fixated objects (for example, through rules).",
        "To better handle the complexity in the gazespeech pattern, we propose to use statistical translation models.",
        "Given a time window of enough length, a speech input that contains a list of spoken references (e.g., definite noun phrases) is always accompanied by a list of naturally occurred eye fixations and therefore a list of objects receiving those fixations.",
        "All those pairs of speech references and corresponding fixated objects could be viewed asparallel, i.e. they co-occur within the time window.",
        "This situation is very similar to the training process of translation models in statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1993), where parallel corpus is used to find the mappings between words from different languages by exploiting their co-occurrence patterns.",
        "The same idea can be borrowed here: by exploring the co-occurrence statistics, we hope to uncover the exact mapping between those eye fixated objects and spoken references.",
        "The intuition is that, the more often a fixation is found to exclusively co-occur with a spoken reference, the more likely a mapping should be established between them.",
        "5 Translation Models for Vocabulary Acquisition and Interpretation",
        "Formally, we denote the set of observations by D = (wj, oi}N1 where and oj refers to the i-th speech utterance (i.e., a list of words of spoken references) and the i-th corresponding eye gaze pattern (i.e., a list of eye fixated objects) respectively.",
        "When we study the problem of mapping given objects to words (for vocabulary acquisition), the parameter space 0 = (Pr(wj |ok), 1 < j < mw, 1 < k < mo} consists of the mapping probabilities of an arbitrary word Wj to an arbitrary object ok, where mw and mo represent the total number of unique words and objects respectively.",
        "Those mapping probabilities are subject to constraints J2jjj=1 Pr(wj |ok) = 1.",
        "Note that Pr(wj |ok) = 0 if the corresponding word Wj and oknever co-occur in any observed list pair (wj, Oj).",
        "Let 1w and 1o denote the length of lists wj and oj respectively.",
        "To distinguish with the notations Wj and ok whose subscripts are indices for unique words and objects respectively, we use Wj;j to denote the word in the j-th position of the list wj and oj;k to denote the object in the k-th position of the list oj.",
        "In translation models, we assume that any word in the list wj is mapped to an object in the corresponding list oj or a null object (we reserve the position 0 for it in every object list).",
        "To denote all the word-object mappings in the i-th list pair, we introduce an alignment vector aj, whose element aj;jtakes the value k if the word Wj;j is mapped to oj)k.",

        "A time-stamp was associated with each word in the speech script.",

        "Considering that eye gaze fixation could occur during the pauses in speech, we expanded each time window by a fixed length at both its start and end to find the fixations.",
        "In our experiments, the expansion length is set to 0.5 seconds.",

        "Our experimental results have shown that this approach can reasonably uncover the mappings between words and objects on the graphical display.",
        "The main advantages of this approach include: 1) It is an unsupervised approach with minimum human inference; 2) It does not need any prior knowledge to train a statistical translation model; 3) Ityields probabilities that indicate the reliability of the mappings.",
        "Certainly, our current approach is built upon simplified assumptions.",
        "It is quite challenging to incorporate eye gaze information since it is extremely noisy with large variances.",
        "Recent work has shown that the effect of eye gaze in facilitating spoken language processing varies among different users (Qu and Chai, 2007).",
        "In addition, visual properties of the interface also affect user gaze behavior and thus influence the predication of attention (Prasov et al., 2007) based on eye gaze.",
        "Our future work will develop models to address these variations.",
        "Nevertheless, the results from our current work have several important implications in building robust conversational interfaces.",
        "First of all, most conversational systems are built with static knowledge space (e.g., vocabularies) and can only be updated by the system developers.",
        "Our approach can potentially allow the system to automatically acquire knowledge and vocabularies based on the natural interactions with the users without human intervention.",
        "Furthermore, the automatically acquired mappings between words and objects can also help language interpretation tasks such as reference resolution.",
        "Given the recent advances in eye tracking technology (Duchowski, 2002), integrating non-intrusive and high performance eye trackers with conversational interfaces becomes feasible.",
        "The work reported here can potentially be integrated in practical systems to improve the overall robustness of human machine conversation.",
