        "A major challenge in natural language parsing is the unsupervised induction of syntactic structure.",

        "2006; Henderson 2004; Steedman et al.",
        "2003), they depend on hand-annotated data which are difficult to come by and which exist only for a few languages.",
        "Unsupervised parsing methods are becoming increasingly important since they operate with raw, unlabeled data of which unlimited quantities are available.",
        "There has been a resurgence of interest in unsupervised parsing during the last few years.",
        "Where van Zaanen (2000) and Clark (2001) induced unlabeled phrase structure for small domains like the ATIS, obtaining around 40% unlabeled f-score, Klein and Manning (2002) report 71.1% f-score on Penn WSJ part-of-speech strings < 10 words (WSJ10) using a constituent-context model called CCM.",
        "Klein and Manning (2004) further show that a hybrid approach which combines constituency and dependency models, yields 77.6% f-score on WSJ10.",
        "While Klein and Manning's approach may be described as an \"all-substrings\" approach to unsupervised parsing, an even richer model consists of an \"all-subtrees\" approach to unsupervised parsing, called U-DOP (Bod 2006).",
        "U-DOP initially assigns all unlabeled binary trees to a training set, efficiently stored in a packed forest, and next trains subtrees thereof on a held-out corpus, either by taking their relative frequencies, or by iteratively training the subtree parameters using the EM algorithm (referred to as \"UML-DOP\").",
        "The main advantage of an all-subtrees approach seems to be the direct inclusion of discontiguous context that is not captured by (linear) substrings.",
        "Discontiguous context is important not only for learning structural dependencies but also for learning a variety of noncontiguous constructions such as nearest... to... or take ... by surprise.",
        "Bod (2006) reports 82.9% unlabeled f-score on the same WSJ10 as used by Klein and Manning (2002, 2004).",
        "Unfortunately, his experiments heavily depend on a priori sampling of subtrees, and the model becomes highly inefficient if larger corpora are used or longer sentences are included.",
        "In this paper we will also test an alternative model for unsupervised all-subtrees parsing, termed U-DOP*, which is based on the DOP* estimator by Zollmann and Sima'an (2005), and which computes the shortest derivations for sentences from a held-out corpus using all subtrees from all trees from an extraction corpus.",
        "While we do not achieve as high an f-score as the UML-DOP model in Bod (2006), we will show that U-DOP* can operate without subtree sampling, and that the model can be trained on corpora that are two orders of magnitude larger than in Bod (2006).",
        "We will extend our experiments to 4 million sentences from the NANC corpus (Graff 1995), showing that an f-score of 70.7% can be obtained on the standard Penn WSJ test set by means of unsupervised parsing.",
        "Moreover, U-DOP* can be directly put to use in bootstrapping structures for concrete applications such as syntax-based machine translation and speech recognition.",
        "We show that U-DOP* outperforms the supervised DOP model if tested on the German-English Europarl corpus in a syntax-based MT system.",

        "In section 3, we discuss how a PCFG reduction for supervised DOP can be applied to packed parse forests.",

        "DOP* is a modification of the DOP model in Bod (1998) that results in a statistically consistent estimator and in an efficient training procedure (Zollmann and Sima'an 2005).",
        "DOP* uses the all-subtrees idea from DOP: given a treebank, take all subtrees, regardless of size, to form a stochastic tree-substitution grammar (STSG).",
        "Since a parse tree of a sentence may be generated by several (leftmost) derivations, the probability of a tree is the sum of the probabilities of the derivations producing that tree.",
        "The probability of a derivation is the product of the subtree probabilities.",
        "The original DOP model in Bod (1998) takes the occurrence frequencies of the subtrees in the trees normalized by their root frequencies as subtree parameters.",
        "While efficient algorithms have been developed for this DOP model by converting it into a PCFG reduction (Goodman 2003), DOP's estimator was shown to be inconsistent by Johnson (2002).",
        "That is, even with unlimited training data, DOP's estimator is not guaranteed to converge to the correct distribution.",
        "Zollmann and Sima'an (2005) developed a statistically consistent estimator for DOP which is based on the assumption that maximizing the joint probability of the parses in a treebank can be approximated by maximizing the joint probability of their shortest derivations (i.e. the derivations consisting of the fewest subtrees).",
        "This assumption is in consonance with the principle of simplicity, but there are also empirical reasons for the shortest derivation assumption: in Bod (2003) and Hearne and Way (2006), it is shown that DOP models that select the preferred parse of a test sentence using the shortest derivation criterion perform very well.",
        "On the basis of this shortest-derivation assumption, Zollmann and Sima'an come up with a model that uses held-out estimation: the training corpus is randomly split into two parts proportional to a fixed ratio: an extraction corpus EC and a held-out corpus HC.",
        "Applied to DOP, held-out estimation would mean to extract fragments from the trees in EC and to assign their weights such that the likelihood of HC is maximized.",
        "If we combine their estimation method with Goodman's reduction of DOP, Zollman and Sima'an's procedure operates as follows:",
        "(1) Divide a treebank into an EC and HC",
        "(2) Convert the subtrees from EC into a PCFG reduction",
        "(3) Compute the shortest derivations for the sentences in HC (by simply assigning each subtree equal weight and applying Viterbi",
        "(4) From those shortest derivations, extract the subtrees and their relative frequencies in",
        "HC to form an STSG",
        "Zollmann and Sima'an show that the resulting estimator is consistent.",
        "But equally important is the fact that this new DOP* model does not suffer from a decrease in parse accuracy if larger subtrees are included, whereas the original DOP model needs to be redressed by a correction factor to maintain this property (Bod 2003).",
        "Moreover, DOP*'s estimation procedure is very efficient, while the EM training procedure for UML-DOP proposed in Bod (2006) is particularly time consuming and can only operate by randomly sampling trees.",
        "Given the advantages of DOP*, we will generalize this model in the current paper to unsupervised parsing.",
        "We will use the same all-subtrees methodology as in Bod (2006), but now by applying the efficient and consistent DOP*-based estimator.",
        "The resulting model, which we will call U-DOP*, roughly operates as follows:",
        "(1) Divide a corpus into an EC and HC",
        "(2) Assign all unlabeled binary trees to the sentences in EC, and store them in a shared parse forest",
        "(3) Convert the subtrees from the parse forests into a compact PCFG reduction (see next section)",
        "(4) Compute the shortest derivations for the sentences in HC (as in DOP*)",
        "(5) From those shortest derivations, extract the subtrees and their relative frequencies in HC to form an STSG",
        "(6) Use the STSG to compute the most probable parse trees for new test data by means of Viterbi n-best (see next section)",

        "The main computational problem is how to deal with the immense number of subtrees in U-DOP*.",
        "There exists already an efficient supervised algorithm that parses a sentence by means of all subtrees from a treebank.",
        "This algorithm was extensively described in Goodman (2003) and converts a DOP-based STSG into a compact PCFG reduction that generates eight rules for each node in the treebank.",
        "The reduction is based on the following idea: every node in every treebank tree is assigned a unique number which is called its address.",
        "The notation A@k denotes the node at address k where A is the nonterminal labeling that node.",
        "A new nonterminal is created for each node in the training data.",
        "This nonterminal is called Ak.",
        "Let aj represent the number of subtrees headed by the node A@j, and let a represent the number of subtrees headed by nodes with nonterminal A, that is a = Yij aj.",
        "Then there is a PCFG with the following property: for every subtree in the training corpus headed by A, the grammar will generate an isomorphic subderivation.",
        "For example, for a node (A@j (B@k, C@l)), the following eight PCFG rules in figure 1 are generated, where the number following a rule is its weight.",
        "Aj - BkCl (bkcl/aj)",
        "By simple induction it can be shown that this construction produces PCFG derivations isomorphic to DOP derivations (Goodman 2003: 130-133).",
        "The PCFG reduction is linear in the number of nodes in the corpus.",
        "While Goodman's reduction method was developed for supervised DOP where each training sentence is annotated with exactly one tree, the method can be generalized to a corpus where each sentence is annotated with all possible binary trees (labeled with the generalized category X), as long as we represent these trees by a shared parse forest.",
        "A shared parse forest can be obtained by adding pointers from each node in the chart (or tabular diagram) to the nodes that caused it to be placed in the chart.",
        "Such a forest can be represented in cubic space and time (see Billot and Lang 1989).",
        "Then, instead of assigning a unique address to each node in each tree, as done by the PCFG reduction for supervised DOP, we now assign a unique address to each node in each parse forest for each sentence.",
        "However, the same node may be part of more than one tree.",
        "A shared parse forest is an AND-OR graph where AND-nodes correspond to the usual parse tree nodes, while OR-nodes correspond to distinct subtrees occurring in the same context.",
        "The total number of nodes is cubic in sentence length n. This means that there are O(n) many nodes that receive a unique address as described above, to which next our PCFG reduction is applied.",
        "This is a huge reduction compared to Bod (2006) where the number of subtrees of all trees increases with the Catalan number, and only ad hoc sampling could make the method work.",
        "Since U-DOP* computes the shortest derivations (in the training phase) by combining subtrees from unlabeled binary trees, the PCFG reduction in figure 1 can be represented as in figure 2, where X refers to the generalized category while B and C either refer to part-of-speech categories or are equivalent to X.",
        "The equal weights follow from the fact that the shortest derivation is equivalent to the most probable derivation if all subtrees are assigned equal probability (see Bod 2000; Goodman 2003).",
        "Once we have parsed HC with the shortest derivations by the PCFG reduction in figure 2, we extract the subtrees from HC to form an STSG.",
        "The number of subtrees in the shortest derivations is linear in the number of nodes (see Zollmann and Sima'an 2005, theorem 5.2).",
        "This means that U-DOP* results in an STSG which is much more succinct than previous DOP-based STSGs.",
        "Moreover, as in Bod (1998, 2000), we use an extension of Good-Turing to smooth the subtrees and to deal with 'unknown' subtrees.",
        "Note that the direct conversion of parse forests into a PCFG reduction also allows us to efficiently implement the maximum likelihood extension of U-DOP known as UML-DOP (Bod 2006).",
        "This can be accomplished by training the PCFG reduction on the held-out corpus HC by means of the expectation-maximization algorithm, where the weights in figure 1 are taken as initial parameters.",
        "Both U-DOP*'s and UML-DOP's estimators are known to be statistically consistent.",
        "But while U-DOP*'s training phase merely consists of the computation of the shortest derivations and the extraction of subtrees, UML-DOP involves iterative training of the parameters.",
        "Once we have extracted the STSG, we compute the most probable parse for new sentences by Viterbi n-best, summing up the probabilities of derivations resulting in the same tree (the exact computation of the most probable parse is NP hard - see Sima'an 1996).",

        "Differently from U-DOP*, DOP* needed to be trained on annotated data, for which we used respectively the Negra and the Penn treebank.",
        "Of course, it is well-known that a supervised parser's f-score decreases if it is transferred to another domain: for example, the (non-binarized) WSJ-trained DOP model in Bod (2003) decreases from around 91% to 85.5% f-score if tested on the Brown corpus.",
        "Yet, this score is still considerably higher than the accuracy obtained by the unsupervised U-DOP model, which achieves 67.6% unlabeled f-score on Brown sentences.",
        "Our main question of interest is in how far this difference in accuracy on hand-annotated corpora carries over when tested in the context of a concrete application like MT.",

        "Evidently, U-DOP's capacity to capture both constituents and phrases pays off in a concrete application and shows the shortcomings of models that only allow for either constituents (such as linguistically syntax-based MT) or phrases (such as phrase-based MT).",
