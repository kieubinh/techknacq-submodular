        "It first maps the parse produced by the parser to a logic-based representation (relational conjunction (RC)) and then employs four methods for semantically analyzing whether a conjunct in the RC is likely to be reasonable.",
        "The filters use semantic information obtained from the Web.",
        "Measuring errors using filter f-score (see Section 3) and using the Collins generative model, woodward reduces errors by 67% on a set of TREC questions and by 20% on a set of a 100 WSJ sentences.",

        "Reranking algorithms (Koo and Collins, 2005; Charniak and Johnson, 2005) search the list of best parses output by a generative parser to find a parse of higher quality than the parse selected by the generative parser.",
        "Thus, these algorithms in effect assess parse quality using syntactic and lexical features.",
        "The SEPA algorithm does not use such features, and is successful in detecting high quality parses even when working on the output of a reranker.",
        "Reranking and SEPA are thus relatively independent.",
        "Bagging (Breiman, 1996) uses an ensemble of instances of a model, each trained on a sample of the training data.",
        "Bagging was suggested in order to enhance classifiers; the classification outcome was determined using a majority vote among the models.",
        "In NLP, bagging was used for active learning for text classification (Argamon-Engelson and Da-gan, 1999; McCallum and Nigam, 1998).",
        "Specifically in parsing, (Henderson and Brill, 2000) applied a constituent level voting scheme to an ensemble of bagged models to increase parser performance, and (Becker and osborne, 2005) suggested an active learning technique in which the agreement among an ensemble ofbagged parsers is used to predict examples valuable for human annotation.",
        "They reported experiments with small training sets only (up to 5,000 sentences), and their agreement function is very different from ours.",
        "Both works experimented with generative parsing models only.",
        "Ngai and Yarowsky (2000) used an ensemble based on bagging and partitioning for active learning for base NP chunking.",

        "A survey of several papers dealing with mapping predictors in classifiers' output to posterior probabilities is given in (Caruana and Niculescu-Mizil, 2006).",
        "As far as we know, the application of a sample based parser ensemble for assessing parse quality is novel.",

        "In this section we detail our parse assessment algorithm.",
        "Its input consists of a parsing algorithm A, an annotated training set TR, and an unannotated test set TE.",
        "The output provides, for each test sentence, the parse generated for it by A when trained on the full training set, and a grade assessing the parse's quality, on a continuous scale between 0 to 100.",
        "Applications are then free to select a sentence subset that suits their needs using our grades, e.g. by keeping only high-quality parses, or by removing low-quality parses and keeping the rest.",

        "The higher the agreement, the higher the quality of the parse.",
        "our approach assumes that if the parameters of the model are well designed to annotate a sentence with a high quality parse, then it is likely that the model will output the same (or a highly similar) parse even if the training data is somewhat changed.",
        "In other words, we rely on the stability of the parameters of statistical parsers.",
        "Although this is not always the case, our results confirm that strong correlation between agreement and parse quality does exist.",
        "We explored several agreement functions.",
        "The one that showed the best results is Mean F-score (MF), defined as follows.",
        "Denote the models by m1... mN, and the parse provided by mi for sentence s as mi(s).",
        "We randomly choose a model mi, and compute",
        "We use two measures to evaluate the quality of SEPA grades.",
        "Both measures are defined using a threshold parameter T, addressing only sentences whose SEPA grades are not smaller than T. We refer to these sentences as T-sentences.",
        "The first measure is the average f-score of the parses of T-sentences.",
        "Note that we compute the f-score of each of the selected sentences and then average the results.",
        "This stands in contrast to the way f-score is ordinarily calculated, by computing the labeled precision and recall of the constituents in the whole set and using these as the arguments of the f-score equation.",
        "The ordinary f-score is computed that way mostly in order to overcome the fact that sentences differ in length.",
        "However, for applications such as IE and QA, which work at the single sentence level and which might reach erroneous decision due to an inaccurate parse, normalizing over sentence lengths is less of a factor.",
        "For this reason, in this paper we present detailed graphs for the average f-score.",
        "For completeness, Table 4 also provides some of the results using the ordinary f-score.",
        "The second measure is a generalization of the filter f-score measure suggested by Yates et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "They define filter precision as the ratio of correctly parsed sentences in the filtered set (the set the algorithm choose) to total sentences in the filtered set and filter recall as the ratio of correctly parsed sentences in the filtered set to correctly parsed sentences in the whole set of sentences parsed by the parser (unfil-tered set or test set).",
        "Correctly parsed sentences are sentences whose parse got f-score of 100%.",
        "Since requiring a 100% may be too restrictive, we generalize this measure to filter f-score with parameter k. In our measure, the filter recall and precision are calculated with regard to sentences that get an f-score of k or more, rather than to correctly parsed sentences.",
        "Filtered f-score is thus a special case of our filtered f-score, with parameter 100.",
        "We now discuss the effect of the number of models N and the sample size S. The discussion is based on experiments (using development data, see Section 4) in which all the parameters are fixed except for the parameter in question, using our development sections.",
        "Regarding N (see Figure 2): As the number of models increases, the number of T-sentences selected by SEPA decreases and their quality improves, in terms of both average f-score and filter f-score (with k = 100).",
        "The fact that more models trained on different samples of the training data agree on the syntactic annotation of a sentence implies that this syntactic pattern is less sensitive to perturbations in the training data.",
        "The number of such sentences is small and it is likely the parser will correctly annotate them.",
        "The smaller T-set size leads to a decrease in filter recall, while the better quality leads to an increase in filter precision.",
        "Since the increase in filter precision is sharper than the decrease in filter recall, filter f-score increases with the number of models N.",
        "Regarding S: As the sample size increases, the number of T-sentences increases, and their quality degrades in terms of average f-score but improves in terms of filter f-score (again, with parameter k = 100).",
        "The overlap among smaller samples is small and the data they supply is sparse.",
        "If several models trained on such samples attach to a sentence the same parse, this syntactic pattern must be very prominent in the training data.",
        "The number of such sentences is small and it is likely that the parser will correctly annotate them.",
        "Therefore smaller sample size leads to smaller T-sets with high average f-score.",

        "The larger T-set size leads to increase in filter recall, while the lower average quality leads to decrease in filter precision.",

        "The second, minimum length (ML), contains the n shortest sentences in the test set.",
        "Since many times it is easier to parse short sentences, a trivial way to increase the average f-score measure of a set is simply to select short sentences.",
        "The third, following (Yates et al., 2006), is maximum recall (MR).",
        "MR simply predicts that all test set sentences should be contained in the selected T-set.",
        "The output set of this model gets filter recall of 1 for any k value, but its precision is lower.",
        "The MR baseline is not relevant to the average f-score measure, because it selects all of the sentences in a set, which leads to the same average as a random selection (see below).",
        "In order to minimize visual clutter, for the filter f-score measure we use the maximum recall (MR) baseline rather than the minimum length (ML) baseline, since the former outperforms the latter.",

        "As to k, the filter f-score measure gives a grade.",
        "This grade combines three values: (1) the number of sentences in the set (selected by an algorithm) whose f-score relative to the gold standard parse is at least k, (2) the size of the selected set, and (3) the total number of sentences with such a parse in the whole test set.",
        "We did not introduce separate notations for these values.",
        "Figure 3 (top) shows average f-score results where SEPA is applied to Collins' generative model in the in-domain (left) and adaptation (middle) scenarios.",
        "SEPA outperforms the baselines for all values of the agreement threshold parameter T. Furthermore, as T increases, not only does the SEPA set quality increase, but the quality differences between this set and the baseline sets increases as well.",
        "The graphs on the right show the number of sentences in the sets selected by SEPA for each T value.",
        "As expected, this number decreases as T increases.",

        "To explore the quality of the selected set in terms of filter f-score, we recall that the quality of a selected set of parses increases as both the number of models N and the sample size S increase, and with T. Therefore, for k = 85 ... 100 we show the value of filter f-score with parameter k when the parameters configuration is a relatively high N (20), relatively high S (33,000, which are about 80% of the training set), and the highest T (100).",
