        "Deriving the polarity and strength of opinions is an important research topic, attracting significant attention over the last few years.",
        "In this work, to measure the strength and polarity of an opinion, we consider the economic context in which the opinion is evaluated, instead of using human annotators or linguistic resources.",
        "We rely on the fact that text in on-line systems influences the behavior of humans and this effect can be observed using some easy-to-measure economic variables, such as revenues or product prices.",
        "By reversing the logic, we infer the semantic orientation and strength of an opinion by tracing the changes in the associated economic variable.",
        "In effect, we use econometrics to identify the \"economic value of text\" and assign a \"dollar value\" to each opinion phrase, measuring sentiment effectively and without the need for manual labeling.",
        "We argue that by interpreting opinions using econometrics, we have the first objective, quantifiable, and context-sensitive evaluation of opinions.",
        "We make the discussion concrete by presenting results on the reputation system of Amazon.com.",
        "We show that user feedback affects the pricing power of merchants and by measuring their pricing power we can infer the polarity and strength of the underlying feedback postings."

      "text": [
        "A significant number of websites today allow users to post articles where they express opinions about products, firms, people, and so on.",
        "For example, use^^ on Amazom.com post reviews about products they bought and users on eBay.com post feedback describing their experiences with sellers.",
        "The goal of opinion mining systems is to identify such pieces of the text that express opinions (Breck et al., 2007; Konig and Brill, 2006) and then measure the polarity and strength of the expressed opinions.",
        "While intuitively the task seems straightforward, there are multiple challenges involved.",
        "• What makes an opinion positive or negative?",
        "Is there an objective measure for this task?",
        "• How can we rank opinions according to their strength?",
        "Can we define an objective measure for ranking opinions?",
        "• How does the context change the polarity and strength of an opinion and how can we take the context into consideration?",
        "To evaluate the polarity and strength of opinions, most of the existing approaches rely either on training from human-annotated data (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997), or use linguistic resources (Hu and Liu, 2004; Kim and Hovy, 2004) like WordNet, or rely on co-occurrence statistics (Turney, 2002) between words that are unambiguously positive (e.g., \"excellent\") and unambiguously negative (e.g., \"horrible\").",
        "Finally, other approaches rely on reviews with numeric ratings from websites (Pang and Lee, 2002; Dave et al., 2003; Pang and Lee, 2004; Cui et al., 2006) and train (semi-)supervised learning algorithms to classify reviews as positive or negative, or in more fine-grained scales (Pang and Lee, 2005; Wilson et al., 2006).",
        "Implicitly, the supervised learning techniques assume that numeric ratings fully encapsulate the sentiment of the review.",
        "In this paper, we take a different approach and instead consider the economic context in which an opinion is evaluated.",
        "We observe that the text in on-line systems influence the behavior of the readers.",
        "This effect can be measured by observing some easy-to-measure economic variable, such as product prices.",
        "For instance, online merchants on eBay with \"positive\" feedback can sell products for higher prices than competitors with \"negative\" evaluations.",
        "Therefore, each of these (positive or negative) evaluations has a (positive or negative) effect on the prices that the merchant can charge.",
        "For example, everything else being equal, a seller with \"speedy\" delivery may be able to charge $10 more than a seller with \"slow\" delivery.",
        "Using this information, we can conclude that \"speedy\" is better than \"slow\" when applied to \"delivery\" and their difference is $10.",
        "Thus, we can infer the semantic orientation and the strength of an evaluation from the changes in the observed economic variable.",
        "Following this idea, we use techniques from econometrics to identify the \"economic value of text\" and assign a \"dollar value\" to each text snippet, measuring sentiment strength and polarity effectively and without the need for labeling or any other resource.",
        "We argue that by interpreting opinions within an econometric framework, we have the first objective and context-sensitive evaluation of opinions.",
        "For example, consider the comment \"good packaging,\" posted by a buyer to evaluate a merchant.",
        "This comment would have been considered unambiguously positive by the existing opinion mining systems.",
        "We observed, though, that within electronic markets, such as eBay, a posting that contains the words \"good packaging\" has actually negative effect on the power of a merchant to charge higher prices.",
        "This surprising effect reflects the nature of the comments in online marketplaces: buyers tend to use superlatives and highly enthusiastic language to praise a good merchant, and a lukewarm \"good packaging\" is interpreted as negative.",
        "By introducing the econometric interpretation of opinions we can effortlessly capture such challenging scenarios, something that is impossible to achieve with the existing approaches.",
        "We focus our paper on reputation systems in electronic markets and we examine the effect of opinions on the pricing power of merchants in the marketplace of Amazon.com.",
        "(We discuss more applications in Section 7.)",
        "We demonstrate the value of our technique using a dataset with 9,500 transactions that took place over 180 days.",
        "We show that textual feedback affects the power of merchants to charge higher prices than the competition, for the same product, and still make a sale.",
        "We then reverse the logic and determine the contribution of each comment in the pricing power of a merchant.",
        "Thus, we discover the polarity and strength of each evaluation without the need for human annotation or any other form of linguistic resource.",
        "The structure of the rest of the paper is as follows.",
        "Section 2 gives the basic background on reputation systems.",
        "Section 3 describes our methodology for constructing the data set that we use in our experiments.",
        "Section 4 shows how we combine established techniques from econometrics with text mining techniques to identify the strength and polarity of the posted feedback evaluations.",
        "Section 5 presents the experimental evaluations of our techniques.",
        "Finally, Section 6 discusses related work and Section 7 discusses further applications and concludes the paper."

        "When buyers purchase products in an electronic market, they assess and pay not only for the product they wish to purchase but for a set of fulfillment characteristics as well, e.g., packaging, delivery, and the extent to which the product description matches the actual product.",
        "Electronic markets rely on reputation systems to ensure the quality of these characteristics for each merchant, and the importance of such systems is widely recognized in the literature (Resnick et al., 2000; Dellarocas, 2003).",
        "Typically, merchants' reputation in electronic markets is encoded by a \"reputation profile\" that includes: (a) the number of past transactions for the merchant, (b) a summary of numeric ratings from buyers who have completed transactions with the seller, and (c) a chronological list of textual feedback provided by these buyers.",
        "Studies of online reputation, thus far, base a merchant's reputation on the numeric rating that characterizes the seller (e.g., average number of stars and number of completed transactions) (Melnik and Alm, 2002).",
        "The general conclusion of these studies show that merchants with higher (numeric) reputation can charge higher prices than the competition, for the same products, and still manage to make a sale.",
        "This price premium that the merchants can command over the competition is a measure of their reputation.",
        "Definition 2.1 Consider a set of merchants s\\,... ,snselling a product for prices pi,... ,pn.",
        "If Si makes the sale for price pi, then si commands a price premium equal to pi – pj over Sj and a relative price premium equal to _-Pj.",
        "Hence, a transaction that involves n competing merchants generates n – 1 price premiums.",
        "The average price premium for the transaction is E1=iP_i~Pj) and the average relative price premium is – p.",
        "(n-i) – • □ Example 2.1 Consider the case in Figure 1 where three merchants sell the same product for $631.95, $632.26, and $637.05, respectively.",
        "If GameHog sells the product, then the price premium against XP Passport is $4.79 (= $637.05 – $632.26) and against the merchant BuyPCsoft is $5.10.",
        "The relative price premium is 0.75% and 0.8%, respectively.",
        "Similarly, the average price premium for this transaction is $4.95 and the average relative price premium 0.78%.",
        "□",
        "Different sellers in these markets derive their reputation from different characteristics: some sellers have a reputation for fast delivery, while some others have a reputation of having the lowest price among their peers.",
        "Similarly, while some sellers are praised for their packaging in the feedback, others get good comments for selling high-quality goods but are criticized for being rather slow with shipping.",
        "Even though previous studies have established the positive correlation between higher (numeric) reputation and higher price premiums, they ignored completely the role of the textual feedback and, in turn, the multidimensional nature of reputation in electronic markets.",
        "We show that the textual feedback adds significant additional value to the numerical scores, and affects the pricing power of the merchants.",
        "We compiled a data set using software resellers from publicly available information on software product listings at Amazon.com.",
        "Our data set includes 280 individual software titles.",
        "The sellers' reputation matters when selling identical goods, and the price variation observed can be attributed primarily to variation in the merchant's reputation.",
        "We collected the data using Amazon Web Services over a period of 180 days, between October 2004 and March 2005.",
        "We describe below the two categories of data that we collected.",
        "Transaction Data: The first part of our data set contains details of the transactions that took place on the marketplace of Amazon.com for each of the software titles.",
        "The Amazon Web Services associates a unique transaction ID for each unique product listed by a seller.",
        "This transaction ID enables us to distinguish between multiple or successive listings of identical products sold by the same merchant.",
        "Keeping with the methodology in prior research (Ghose et al., 2006), we crawl the Amazon's XML listings every 8 hours and when a transaction ID associated with a particular listing is removed, we infer that the listed product was successfully sold in the prior 8 hour window.",
        "For each transaction that takes place, we keep the price at which the product was sold and the merchant's reputation at the time of the transaction (more on this later).",
        "Additionally, for each of the competing listings for identical products, we keep the listed price along with the competitors reputation.",
        "Using the collected data, we compute the price premium variables for each transaction using Definition 2.1.",
        "Overall, our data set contains 1,078 merchants, 9,484 unique transactions and 107,922 price premiums (recall that each transaction generates multiple price premiums).",
        "Reputation Data: The second part of our data set contains the reputation history of each merchant that had a (monitored) product for sale during our 180-day window.",
        "Each of these merchants has a feedback profile, which consists of numerical scores and text-based feedback, posted by buyers.",
        "We had an average of 4,932 postings per merchant.",
        "The numerical ratings are provided on a scale of one to five stars.",
        "These ratings are averaged to provide an overall score to the seller.",

        "We characterize a merchant using a vector of reputation dimensions X = (Xi,X2, ...,Xn), representing its ability on each of n dimensions.",
        "We assume that each of these n dimensions is expressed by a noun, noun phrase, verb, or a verb phrase chosen from the set of all feedback postings, and that a merchant is evaluated on these n dimensions.",

        "As discussed above, the textual feedback profile of merchant si is encoded as a n x p matrix M(si); the elements of this matrix belong to the set of modifiers M. In our case, we are interested in computing the \"score\" a([, d, j) that a modifier [i e M assigns to the dimension d, when it appears in the j-th posting.",
        "Since buyers tend to read only the first few pages of text-based feedback, we weight higher the influence of recent text postings.",
        "We model this by assuming that K is the number of postings that appear on each page (K = 25 on Amazon.com), and that c is the probability of clicking on the \"Next\" link and moving the next page of evaluations.",

        "Then, we set a(n, d, j) = rj • a(n, d) where a([, d) is the \"global\" score that modifier [i assigns to dimension d.",
        "Finally, since each reputation dimension has potentially a different weight, we use a weight vector w to weight the contribution of each reputation dimension to the overall \"reputation score\" n(si) of seller si:",
        "where rT = [ri,r2, ...r_] is the vector of the posting-specific weights and A(M(i)) is a matrix that contains as element the score a([j ,dk) where M(si) contains the modifier [j in the column of the dimension dk.",
        "If we model the buyers' preferences as independently distributed along each dimension and each modifier score a([, dk) also as an independent random variable, then the random variable n(si) is a sum of random variables.",
        "Specifically, we have:",
        "where R([ij, dk) is equal to the sum of the ri weights across all postings in which the modifier [ij modifies dimension dk.",
        "We can easily compute the R([ij, dk) values by simply counting appearances and weighting each appearance using the definition of ri.",
        "The question is, of course, how to estimate the values of wk • a([ij ,dk), which determine the polarity and intensity of the modifier [ij modifying the dimension dk.",
        "For this, we observe that the appearance of such modifier-dimension opinion phrases has an effect on the price premiums that a merchant can charge.",
        "Hence, there is a correlation between the reputation scores n( ) of the merchants and the price premiums observed for each transaction.",
        "To discover the level of association, we use regression.",
        "Since we are dealing with panel data, we estimate ordinary-least-squares (OLS) regression with fixed effects (Greene, 2002), where the dependent variable is the price premium variable, and the independent variables are the reputation scores n( ) of the merchants, together with a few other control variables.",
        "Generally, we estimate models of the form:",

        "Since we want to eliminate the effect of any other factors that may influence the price premiums, we also use a set of control variables.",
        "After all the control factors are taken into consideration, the modifier scores reflect the additional value of the text opinions.",
        "Specifically, we used as control variables the product's price on Amazon, the average star rating of the merchant, the number of merchant's past transactions, and the number ofsellers for the product.",
        "First, we ran OLS regressions with product-seller fixed effects controlling for unobserved heterogeneity across sellers and products.",
        "These fixed effects control for average product quality and differences in seller characteristics.",

        "Our regressions in this setting contain 107,922 observations, and a total of 547 independent variables.",
        "Recall of Extraction: The first step of our experimental evaluation is to examine whether the opinion extraction technique of Section 4.1 indeed captures all the reputation characteristics expressed in the feedback (recall) and whether the dimensions that we capture are accurate (precision).",
        "To examine the recall question, we used two human annotators.",
        "The annotators read a random sample of 1,000 feedback postings, and identified the reputation dimensions mentioned in the text.",
        "Then, they examined the extracted modifier-dimension pairs for each posting and marked whether the modifier-dimension pairs captured the identified real reputation dimensions mentioned in the posting and which pairs were spurious, non-opinion phrases.",
        "Both annotators identified nine reputation dimensions (see Table 1).",
        "Since the annotators did not agree in all annotations, we computed the average human recall hRecd = d for each dimension d, where agreedd is the number of postings for which both annotators identified the reputation dimension d, and alld is the number of postings in which at least one annotator identified the dimension d. Based on the annotations, we computed the recall of our algorithm against each annotator.",
        "We report the average recall for each dimension, together with the human recall in Table 1.",
        "The recall of our technique is only slightly inferior to the performance of humans, indicating that the technique of Section 4.1 extracts the majority of the posted evaluations.",
        "Interestingly, precision is not an issue in our setting.",
        "In our framework, if an particular modifier-dimension pair is just noise, then it is almost impossible to have a statistically significant correlation with the price premiums.",
        "The noisy opinion phrases are statistically guaranteed to be filtered out by the regression.",
        "Estimating Polarity and Strength: In Table 2, we present the modifier-dimension pairs (positive and negative) that had the strongest \"dollar value\" and were statistically significant across all regressions.",
        "(Due to space issues, we cannot list the values for all pairs.)",
        "These values reflect changes in the merchants's pricing power after taking their average numerical score and level of experience into account, and also highlight the additional the value contained in text-based reputation.",
        "The examples that we list here illustrate that our technique generates a natural ranking of the opinion phrases, inferring the strength of each modifier within the context in which this opinion is evaluated.",
        "This holds true even for misspelled evaluations that would break existing techniques based on annotation or on resources like WordNet.",
        "Furthermore, these values reflect the context in which the opinion is evaluated.",
        "For example, the pair good packaging has a dollar value of -$0.58.",
        "Even though this seems counterintuitive, it actually reflects the nature of an online marketplace where most of the positive evaluations contain superlatives, and a mere \"good\" is actually interpreted by the buyers as a lukewarm, slightly negative evaluation.",
        "Existing techniques cannot capture such phenomena.",
        "Price Premiums vs. Ratings: One of the natural comparisons is to examine whether we could reach similar results by just using the average star rating associated with each feedback posting to infer the score of each opinion phrase.",
        "The underlying assumption behind using the ratings is that the review is perfectly summarized by the star rating, and hence the text plays mainly an explanatory role and carries no extra information, given the star rating.",
        "For this, we examined the R fit of the regression, with and without the use of the text variables.",
        "Without the use of text variables, the R was 0.35, while when using only the text-based regressors, the R fit increased to 0.63.",
        "This result clearly indicates that the actual text contains significantly more information than the ratings.",

        "A few papers in the past tried to combine text analysis with economics (Das and Chen, 2006; Lewitt and Syverson, 2005), but the text analysis was limited to token counting and did not use any NLP techniques.",
        "The technique of Section 4.1 is based on existing research in sentiment analysis.",
        "For instance, (Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown, 1997; Nigam and Hurst, 2004) use annotated data to create a supervised learning technique to identify the semantic orientation of adjectives.",
        "We follow the approach by Turney (2002), who note that the semantic orientation of an adjective depends on the noun that it modifies and suggest using adjective-noun or adverb-verb pairs to extract semantic orientation.",
        "However, we do not rely on linguistic resources (Kamps and Marx, 2002) or on search engines (Turney and Littman, 2003) to determine the semantic orientation, but rather rely on econometrics for this task.",
        "Hu and Liu (2004), whose study is the closest to our work, use WordNet to compute the semantic orientation of product evaluations and try to summarize user reviews by extracting the positive and negative evaluations of the different product features.",
        "Similarly, Snyder and Barzilay (2007) decompose an opinion across several dimensions and capture the sentiment across each dimension.",
        "Other work in this area includes (Lee, 2004; Popescu and Etzioni, 2005) which uses text mining in the context product reviews, but none uses the economic context to evaluate the opinions."

        "We demonstrated the value of using econometrics for extracting a quantitative interpretation of opinions.",
        "Our technique, additionally, takes into consideration the context within which these opinions are evaluated.",
        "Our experimental results show that our techniques can capture the pragmatic meaning of the expressed opinions using simple economic variables as a form of training data.",
        "The source code with our implementation together with the data set used in this paper are available from",
        "http://economining.stern.nyu.edu.",
        "There are many other applications beyond reputation systems.",
        "For example, using sales rank data from Amazon.com, we can examine the effect of product reviews on product sales and detect the weight that customers put on different product features; furthermore, we can discover how customer evaluations on individual product features affect product sales and extract the pragmatic meaning of these evaluations.",
        "Another application is the analysis of the effect of news stories on stock prices: we can examine what news topics are important for the stock market and see how the views of different opinion holders and the wording that they use can cause the market to move up or down.",
        "In a slightly different twist, we can analyze news stories and blogs in conjunction with results from prediction markets and extract the pragmatic effect of news and blogs on elections or other political events.",
        "Another research direction is to examine the effect of summarizing product descriptions on product sales: short descriptions reduce the cognitive load of consumers but increase their uncertainty about the underlying product characteristics; a longer description has the opposite effect.",
        "The optimum description length is the one that balances both effects and maximizes product sales.",
