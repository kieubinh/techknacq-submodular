        "Extracting sentiment from text is a challenging problem with applications throughout Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval.",
        "Previous work on sentiment analysis has covered a wide range of tasks, including polarity classification (Pang et al., 2002; Turney, 2002), opinion extraction (Pang and Lee, 2004), and opinion source assignment (Choi et al., 2005; Choi et al., 2006).",
        "Furthermore, these systems have tackled the problem at different levels of granularity, from the document level (Pang et al., 2002), sentence level (Pang and Lee, 2004; Mao and Lebanon, 2006), phrase level (Tur-ney, 2002; Choi et al., 2005), as well as the speaker level in debates (Thomas et al., 2006).",
        "The ability to classify sentiment on multiple levels is important since different applications have different needs.",
        "For example, a summarization system for product reviews might require polarity classification at the sentence or phrase level; a question answering system would most likely require the sentiment of paragraphs; and a system that determines which articles from an online news source are editorial in nature would require a document level analysis.",
        "This work focuses on models that jointly classify sentiment on multiple levels ofgranularity.",
        "Consider the following example,",
        "This is the first Mp3 player that I have used ...",
        "I thought it sounded great... After only a few weeks, it started having trouble with the earphone connection ...",
        "I won't be buying another.",
        "Mp3 player review from Amazon.com",
        "This excerpt expresses an overall negative opinion of the product being reviewed.",
        "However, not all parts of the review are negative.",
        "The first sentence merely provides some context on the reviewer's experience with such devices and the second sentence indicates that, at least in one regard, the product performed well.",
        "We call the problem of identifying the sentiment of the document and of all its subcomponents, whether at the paragraph, sentence, phrase or word level, fine-to-coarse sentiment analysis.",
        "The simplest approach to fine-to-coarse sentiment analysis would be to create a separate system for each level of granularity.",
        "There are, however, obvious advantages to building a single model that classifies each level in tandem.",
        "Consider the sentence,",
        "My 11 year old daughter has also been using it and it is a lot harder than it looks.",
        "In isolation, this sentence appears to convey negative sentiment.",
        "However, it is part of a favorable review for a piece of fitness equipment, where hard essentially means good workout.",
        "In this domain, hard's sentiment can only be determined in context (i.e., hard to assemble versus a hard workout).",
        "If the classifier knew the overall sentiment of a document, then disambiguating such cases would be easier.",
        "Conversely, document level analysis can benefit from finer level classification by taking advantage of common discourse cues, such as the last sentence being a reliable indicator for overall sentiment in reviews.",
        "Furthermore, during training, the model will not need to modify its parameters to explain phenomena like the typically positive word great appearing in a negative text (as is the case above).",
        "The model can also avoid overfitting to features derived from neutral or objective sentences.",
        "In fact, it has already been established that sentence level classification can improve document level analysis (Pang and Lee, 2004).",
        "This line of reasoning suggests that a cascaded approach would also be insufficient.",
        "Valuable information is passed in both directions, which means any model of fine-to-coarse analysis should account for this.",
        "In Section 2 we describe a simple structured model that jointly learns and infers sentiment on different levels of granularity.",
        "In particular, we reduce the problem of joint sentence and document level analysis to a sequential classification problem using constrained Viterbi inference.",
        "Extensions to the model that move beyond just two-levels of analysis are also presented.",
        "In Section 3 an empirical evaluation of the model is given that shows significant gains in accuracy over both single level classifiers and cascaded systems.",
        "The models in this work fall into the broad class of global structured models, which are typically trained with structured learning algorithms.",
        "Hidden Markov models (Rabiner, 1989) are one of the earliest structured learning algorithms, which have recently been followed by discriminative learning approaches such as conditional random fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001; Sutton and McCallum, 2006), the structured perceptron (Collins, 2002) and its large-margin variants (Taskar et al., 2003; Tsochantaridis et al., 2004; McDonald et al., 2005; Daumé III et al., 2006).",
        "These algorithms are usually applied to sequential labeling or chunking, but have also been applied to parsing (Taskar et al., 2004; McDonald et al., 2005), machine translation (Liang et al., 2006) and summarization (Daumé III et al., 2006).",
        "Structured models have previously been used for sentiment analysis.",
        "Choi et al.",
        "(2005, 2006) use CRFs to learn a global sequence model to classify and assign sources to opinions.",
        "Mao and Lebanon (2006) used a sequential CRF regression model to measure polarity on the sentence level in order to determine the sentiment flow of authors in reviews.",
        "Here we show that fine-to-coarse models of sentiment can often be reduced to the sequential case.",
        "Cascaded models for fine-to-coarse sentiment analysis were studied by Pang and Lee (2004).",
        "In that work an initial model classified each sentence as being subjective or objective using a global mincut inference algorithm that considered local labeling consistencies.",
        "The top subjective sentences are then input into a standard document level polarity classifier with improved results.",
        "The current work differs from that in Pang and Lee through the use of a single joint structured model for both sentence and document level analysis.",
        "Many problems in natural language processing can be improved by learning and/or predicting multiple outputs jointly.",
        "This includes parsing and relation extraction (Miller et al., 2000), entity labeling and relation extraction (Roth and Yih, 2004), and part-of-speech tagging and chunking (Sutton et al., 2004).",
        "One interesting work on sentiment analysis is that of Popescu and Etzioni (2005) which attempts to classify the sentiment of phrases with respect to possible product features.",
        "To do this an iterative algorithm is used that attempts to globally maximize the classification of all phrases while satisfying local consistency constraints."

        "We start by examining the simple case with two-levels of granularity - the sentence and document - and show that the problem can be reduced to sequential classification with constrained inference.",

        "Extensions to the model are also examined.",
        "Let Y (d) be a discrete set of sentiment labels at the document level and Y(s) be a discrete set of sentiment labels at the sentence level.",

Define y = (yd, ys) = (yd, yf,..., yn) as the joint labeling of the document and sentences.",
        "For instance, in Pang and Lee (2004), yd would be the polarity of the document and ys would indicate whether sentence Sj is subjective or objective.",
        "The models presented here are compatible with arbitrary sets of discrete output labels.",
        "Figure 1 presents a model for jointly classifying the sentiment of both the sentences and the document.",
        "In this undirected graphical model, the label of each sentence is dependent on the labels of its neighbouring sentences plus the label of the document.",
        "The label of the document is dependent on the label of every sentence.",
        "Note that the edges between the input (each sentence) and the output labels are not solid, indicating that they are given as input and are not being modeled.",
        "The fact that the sentiment of sentences is dependent not only on the local sentiment of other sentences, but also the global document sentiment - and vice versa - allows the model to directly capture the importance of classification decisions across levels in fine-to-coarse sentiment analysis.",
        "The local dependencies between sentiment labels on sentences is similar to the work of Pang and Lee (2004) where soft local consistency constraints were created between every sentence in a document and inference was solved using a min-cut algorithm.",
        "However, jointly modeling the document label and allowing for non-binary labels complicates min-cut style solutions as inference becomes intractable.",
        "Learning and inference in undirected graphical models is a well studied problem in machine learning and NLP.",
        "For example, CRFs define the probability over the labels conditioned on the input using the property that the joint probability distribution over the labels factors over clique potentials in undirected graphical models (Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "In this work we will use structured linear classifiers (Collins, 2002).",
        "We denote the score of a labeling y for an input s as score(y, s) and define this score as the sum of scores over each clique, where each clique score is a linear combination of features and their weights, and f is a high dimensional feature representation of the clique and w a corresponding weight vector.",
        "Note that s is included in each score since it is given as input and can always be conditioned on.",
        "In general, inference in undirected graphical models is intractable.",
        "However, for the common case of sequences (a.k.a.",
        "linear-chain models) the Viterbi algorithm can be used (Rabiner, 1989; Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "Fortunately there is a simple technique that reduces inference in the above model to sequence classification with a constrained version of Viterbi.",
        "The inference problem is to find the highest scoring labeling y for an input s, i.e.,",
        "arg max score(y, s) y",
        "If the document label yd is fixed, then inference in the model from Figure 1 reduces to the sequential case.",
        "This is because the search space is only over the sentence labels ys, whose graphical structure forms a chain.",

        "In this section we define the feature representation for each clique, f(yd, y|_ 1, ys, s).",
        "Assume that each sentence sj is represented by a set of binary predicates P(sj).",
        "This set can contain any predicate over the input s, but for the present purposes it will include all the unigram, bigram and trigrams in the sentence sj conjoined with their part-of-speech (obtained from an automatic classifier).",
        "Back-offs of each predicate are also included where one or more word is discarded.",
        "For instance, if P(sj) contains the predicate a:DT_great:JJjproduct:NN, then it would also have the predicates a:DT.great:JJ-*:NN, a:DT*:JJjproduct:NN, *:DT-great:JJ-product:NN, a:DT*:JJ*:NN, etc.",
        "Each predicate, p, is then conjoined with the label information to construct a binary feature.",

        "The first uses the Sentence-Structured classifier to classify all the sentences from a review, then passes this information to the document classifier as input.",
        "In particular, for every predicate in the original document classifier, an additional predicate that specifies the polarity of the sentence in which this predicate occurred was created.",
        "The second cascaded system uses the document classifier to determine the global polarity, then passes this information as input into the Sentence-Structured model, constructing predicates in a similar manner.",
        "The results for these two systems can be seen in the last two rows of Table 2.",
        "In both cases there is a slight improvement in performance suggesting that an iterative approach might be beneficial.",
        "That is, a system could start by classifying documents, use the document information to classify sentences, use the sentence information to classify documents, and repeat until convergence.",
        "However, experiments showed that this did not improve accuracy over a single iteration and often hurt performance.",
        "Improvements from the cascaded models are far less consistent than those given from the joint structure model.",
        "This is because decisions in the cascaded system are passed to the next layer as the \"gold\" standard at test time, which results in errors from the first classifier propagating to errors in the second.",
        "This could be improved by passing a lattice of possibilities from the first classifier to the second with corresponding confidences.",
        "However, solutions such as these are really just approximations of the joint structured model that was presented here."

        "In particular, the relative position of a phrase to a contrastive discourse connective or a cue phrase like \"in conclusion\" or \"to summarize\" may lead to improved performance since higher level classifications can learn to weigh information passed from these lower level components more heavily."
