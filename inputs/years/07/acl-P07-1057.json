        "The semantic relationship between words, and the extraction of meaning from syntactic data has been one of the main points of research in the field of computational linguistics (see Section 5 and references therein).",
        "Until recently, the focus has remained largely either at the single word or sentence level (for instance: dependency extraction, word-to-word semantic similarity from syntax, etc.)",
        "or on relations between units at a very high context level such as the entire paragraph or document (e.g. categorizing documents by topic).",
        "Recently there have been several attempts to define frameworks for detecting and studying interactions at an intermediate context level, and involving whole clauses or sentences.",
        "Dagan et al.",
        "(2005) have emphasized the importance of detecting textual-entailment/implication between two sentences, and its place as a key component in many real-world applications, such as Information Retrieval and Question Answering.",
        "When designing such a framework, one is faced with several obstacles.",
        "As we approach higher levels of complexity, the problem of defining the basic units we study (e.g. words, sentences etc.)",
        "and the increasing amount of interactions make the task very difficult.",
        "In addition, the data sparseness problem becomes more acute as the data units become more complex and have an increasing number of possible values, despite the fact that many of these values have similar or identical meaning.",
        "In this paper we demonstrate an approach to solving the complexity and data sparseness problems in the task of detecting relations between sentences or clauses.",
        "We present the Clustered Clause structure, which utilizes information-based clustering and dependencies within the sentence to create a simplified and generalized representation of the grammatical clause and is designed to overcome both these problems.",
        "The clustering method we employ is an integral part of the model.",
        "We evaluate our clusters against semantic similarity measures defined on the human-annotated WordNet structure (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "The results of these comparisons show that our cluster members are very similar semantically.",
        "We also define a high-level relation detection task involving relations between clauses, evaluate our results, and demonstrate the effectiveness of using our model in this task.",

        "When designing our framework, we must address the complexity and sparseness problems encountered when dealing with whole sentences.",
        "Our solution to these issues combines two elements.",
        "First, to reduce complexity, we simplify a grammatical clause to its primary components - the subject, verb and object.",
        "Secondly, to provide a generalization framework which will enable us to overcome data-sparseness, we cluster each part of the clause using data from within the clause itself.",
        "By combining the simplified clause structure and the clustering we produce our Clustered Clause model - a triplet of clusters representing a generalized clause.",
        "The Simplified Clause: In order to extract clauses from the text, we use Lin's parser MINI-PAR (Lin, 1994).",
        "The output of the parser is a dependency tree of each sentence, also containing lemmatized versions of the component words.",
        "We extract the verb, subject and object of every clause (including subordinate clauses), and use this triplet of values, the simplified clause, in place of the original complete clause.",
        "As seen in Figure 1, these components make up the top (root) triangle of the clause parse tree.",

        "The subject-verb-object triplet is marked with a border.",
        "Clustering Clause Components: For our model, we cluster the data to provide both generalization, by using a cluster to represent a more generalized concept shared by its component words, and a form of dimensionality reduction, by using fewer units (clusters) to represent a much larger amount of words.",
        "We chose to use the Sequential Information Bottleneck algorithm (Slonim et al., 2002) for our clustering tasks.",
        "The information Bottleneck principle views the clustering task as an optimization problem, where the clustering algorithm attempts to group together values of one variable while retaining as much information as possible regarding the values of another (target) variable.",
        "There is a trade-off between the compactness of the clustering and the amount of retained information.",
        "This algorithm (and others based on the IB principle) is especially suited for use with graphical models or dependency structures, since the distance measure it employs in the clustering is defined solely by the dependency relation between two variables, and therefore required no external parameters.",
        "The values of one variable are clustered using their cooccurrence distribution with regard to the values of the second (target) variable in the dependency relation.",

        "In the first stage, we clustered the subject variable into 200 clusters, using the subject-verb dependency (i.e. the verb variable was the target).",

        "In the second phase, we wish to cluster the verb values with regard to both the subject and object variables.",

        "As stated by (Dagan et al., 2005), such relations are important for IR applications.",
        "In addition, the patterns we employ are likely to be useful in other linguistic tasks involving whole clauses, such as paraphrase acquisition.",
        "Pattern Definition: For our relation detection task, we searched for instances of predefined patterns indicating a relation between two clustered clauses.",
        "We restricted the search to clause pairs which co-occur within a distance of ten clauses from each other.",
        "In addition to the distance restriction, we required an anchor: a noun that appears in both clauses, to further strengthen the relation between them.",
        "Noun anchors establish the fact that the two component actions described by the pattern involve the same entities, implying a direct connection between them.",
        "The use of verb anchors was also tested, but found to be less helpful in detecting significant patterns, since in most cases it simply found verbs which tend to repeat themselves frequently in a context.",

        "Significance Calculation: The patterns detected by the system were scored using the statistical p-value measure.",

        "Anchoring between the same categories produces more patterns than between the same noun in diferent grammatical roles.",
        "This is expected, since many nouns can only play a certain part in the clause (for instance, many verbs cannot have an inanimate entity as their subject).",
        "The number of instances of patterns we found for the anchored template might be considered low, and it is likely that some patterns were missed simply because their occurrence probability was very low and not enough instances of the pattern occurred in the text.",
        "In Section 4 we stated that in this task, we were more interested in precision than in recall.",
        "In order to detect a wider range of patterns, a less restricted definition of the patterns, or a different significance indicator, should be used (see Sec. 6).",

        "The scores were averaged over all examples and all judges.",

        "Achievement of Model Goals: We employed clustering in our model to overcome data-sparseness.",
        "The importance of this decision was evident in our results.",

        "In these instances, verb cluster 40 was represented twice by the verb arrest and twice by detain.",
        "Two appearances are within the statistical deviation of all but the rarest words, and would not have been detected as significant without the clustering efect.",

        "The other reason for clustering was generalization.",

        "Furthermore, Lin and Pantel did not create path clusters or generalized paths, so that while their method allowed them to compare phrases for similarity, there is no convenient way to identify high level contextual relationships between two nearby sentences.",
        "This is one of the significant advantages that clustering has over similarity measures - it allows a group of similar objects to be represented by a single unit.",
        "There have been several attempts to formulate and detect relationships at a higher context level.",
        "The VerbOcean project (Chklovski and Pantel, 2004) deals with relations between verbs.",
        "It presents an automatically acquired network of such relations, similar to the WordNet framework.",
        "Though the patterns used to acquire the relations are usually parts of a single sentence, the relationships themselves can also be used to describe connections between different sentences, especially the enablement and happens-before relations.",
        "Since verbs are the central part of the clause, VerbOcean can be viewed as detecting relations between clauses as whole units, as well as those between individual words.",
        "As a solution to the data sparseness problem, web queries are used.",
        "Torisawa (2006) addresses a similar problem, but focuses on temporal relations, and makes use of the phenomena of Japanese coordinate sentences.",
        "Neither of these approaches attempt to create generalized relations or group verbs into clusters, though in the case of VerbOcean this could presumably be done using the similarity and strength values which are defined and detected by the system."

        "The clustered clause model presents many directions for further research.",
        "It may be productive to extend the model further, and include other parts of the sentence, such as adjectives and adverbs.",
        "Clustering nouns by the adjectives that describe them may provide a more intuitive grouping.",
        "The addition of further elements to the structure may also allow the detection of new kinds of relations.",
        "The news-oriented domain of the corpus we used strongly influenced our results.",
        "If we were interested in more mundane relations, involving day-to-day actions of individuals, a literary corpus would probably be more suitable.",
        "In defining our pattern template, several elements were tailored specifically to our task.",
        "We limited ourselves to a very restricted set of patterns in order to better demonstrate the efec-tiveness of our model.",
        "For a more general knowledge acquisition task, several of these restrictions may be relaxed, allowing a much larger set of relations to be detected.",
        "For example, a less strict significance filter, such as the support and confidence measures commonly used in data mining, may be preferable.",
        "These can be set to diferent thresholds, according to the user's preference.",
        "In our current work, in order to prevent over-generalization, we employed a single step postprocessing algorithm which detected the incorrect use of an entire cluster in place of a single word (see footnote for Table 2).",
        "This method allows only two levels of generalization - single words and whole clusters.",
        "A more appropriate way to handle generalization would be to use a hierarchical clustering algorithm.",
        "The Agglomerative Information Bottleneck (Slonim and Tishby, 1999) is an example of such an algorithm, and could be employed for this task.",
        "Use of a hierarchical method would result in several levels of clusters, representing diferent levels of generalization.",
        "It would be relatively easy to modify our procedure to reduce generalization to the level indicated by the pattern examples in the text, producing a more accurate description of the patterns detected."
