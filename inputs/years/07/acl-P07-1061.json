        "In this article, we address the problem of linear topic segmentation, which consists in segmenting documents into topically homogeneous segments that does not overlap each other.",
        "This part of the Discourse Analysis field has received a constant interest since the initial work in this domain such as (Hearst, 1994).",
        "One criterion for classifying topic segmentation systems is the kind of knowledge they depend on.",
        "Most of them only rely on surface features of documents: word reiteration in (Hearst, 1994; Choi, 2000; Utiyama and Isahara, 2001; Galley et al., 2003) or discourse cues in (Passonneau and Lit-man, 1997; Galley et al., 2003).",
        "As such systems do not require external knowledge, they are not sensitive to domains but they are limited by the type of documents they can be applied to: lexical reiteration is reliable only if concepts are not too frequently expressed by several means (synonyms, etc.)",
        "and discourse cues are often rare and corpus-specific.",
        "To overcome these difficulties, some systems make use of domain-independent knowledge about lexical cohesion: a lexical network built from a dictionary in (Kozima, 1993); a thesaurus in (Morris and Hirst, 1991); a large set of lexical cooccurrences collected from a corpus in (Choi et al., 2001).",
        "To a certain extent, these lexical networks enable topic segmenters to exploit a sort of concept reiteration.",
        "However, their lack of any explicit topical structure makes this kind of knowledge difficult to use when lexical ambiguity is high.",
        "The most simple solution to this problem is to exploit knowledge about the topics that may occur in documents.",
        "Such topic models are generally built from a large set of example documents as in (Yam-ron et al., 1998), (Blei and Moreno, 2001) or in one component of (Beeferman et al., 1999).",
        "These statistical topic models enable segmenters to improve their precision but they also restrict their scope.",
        "Hybrid systems that combine the approaches we have presented were also developed and illustrated the interest of such a combination: (Job-bins and Evett, 1998) combined word recurrence, co-occurrences and a thesaurus; (Beeferman et al., 1999) relied on both lexical modeling and discourse cues; (Galley et al., 2003) made use of word reiteration through lexical chains and discourse cues.",
        "The work we report in this article takes place in the first category we have presented.",
        "It does not rely on any a priori knowledge and exploits word usage rather than discourse cues.",
        "More precisely, we present a new method for enhancing the results of segmentation systems based on word reiteration without relying on any external knowledge."

        "In most of the algorithms in the text segmentation field, documents are represented as sequences of basic discourse units.",
        "When they are written texts, these units are generally sentences, which is also the case in our work.",
        "Each unit is turned into a vector of words, following the principles of the Vector Space model.",
        "Then, the similarity between the basic units of a text is evaluated by computing a similarity measure between the vectors that represent them.",
        "Such a similarity is considered as representative of the topical closeness of the corresponding units.",
        "This principle is also applied to groups of basic units, such as text segments, because of the properties of the Vector Space model.",
        "Segments are finally delimited by locating the areas where the similarity between units or groups of units is weak.",
        "This quick overview highlights the important role of the evaluation of the similarity between discourse units in the segmentation process.",
        "When no external knowledge is used, this similarity is only based on the strict reiteration of words.",
        "But it can be enhanced by taking into account semantic relations between words.",
        "This was done for instance in (Jobbins and Evett, 1998) by taking semantic relations from Roget's Thesaurus.",
        "This resource was also used in (Morris and Hirst, 1991) where the similarity between discourse units was more indirectly evaluated through the lexical chains they share.",
        "The same approach was adopted in (Stokes et al., 2002) but with WordNet as the reference semantic resource.",
        "In this article, we propose to improve the detection of topical similarity between text segments but without relying on any external knowledge.",
        "For each text to segment, we first identify its topics by performing an unsupervised clustering of its words according to their co-occurrents in the text.",
        "Thus, each of its topics is represented by a subset of its vocabulary.",
        "When the similarity between two segments is evaluated during segmentation, the words they share are first considered but the presence of words of the same topic is also taken into account.",
        "This makes it possible to find similar two segments that refer to the same topic although they do not share a lot of words.",
        "It is also a way to exploit long-range relations between words at a local level.",
        "More globally, it helps to reduce the false detection oftopic shifts."

        "Hence, for each word of the text with a minimal frequency, we collect its co-occurrents, we evaluate the pairwise similarity of these selected text words by relying on their co-occurrents and finally, we build topics by applying an unsupervised clustering method to them.",
        "The first step for discovering the topics of a text is a linguistic preprocessing of it.",
        "This preprocessing splits the text into sentences and represents each of them as the sequence of its lemmatized plain words, that is, nouns (proper and common nouns), verbs and adjectives.",
        "After filtering the low frequency words of the text (frequency < 3), the co-occurrents of the remaining words are classically collected by recording the co-occurrences in a fixed-size window (15 plain words) moved over the preprocessed text.",
        "As a result, each text word is represented by a vector that contains its co-occurrents and their cooccurrence frequency.",
        "The pairwise similarity between all the selected text words is then evaluated for building their similarity matrix.",
        "We classically apply the Cosine measure between the vectors that represent them for this evaluation.",

        "This algorithm particularly fits our needs as it automatically determines the number of clusters - in our case the number of topics of a text - and does not take into account the elements that are not representative of the clusters it builds.",
        "This last point is important for our application as all the plain words of a text are not representative of its topics.",
        "The SNN algorithm (see Algorithm 1) performs clustering by detecting high-density areas in a similarity graph.",
        "In our case, the similarity graph is directly built from the similarity matrix: each vertex represents a text word and an edge links two words whose similarity is not null.",
        "The SNN algorithm splits up into two main stages: the first one finds the elements that are the most representative of their neighborhood.",

        "Since the work of Choi (Choi, 2000), the evaluation framework he proposed has become a kind of standard for the evaluation of topic segmentation algorithms.",
        "This framework is based on the building of artificial texts made of segments extracted from different documents.",
        "It has at least two advantages: the reference corpus is easy to build as it does not require human annotations; parameters such as the size of the documents or the segments can be precisely controlled.",
        "But it has also an obvious drawback: its texts are artificial.",

        "Hence, it confirms our hypothesis about the interest of taking into account the topics of a text for its segmentation, even if these topics were discovered in an unsupervised way and without using external knowledge.",
        "Moreover, F06T have the best results among all the tested algorithms, with a significant difference in most of the cases.",
        "Another notable point about these results is their stability across our two corpora, even if these corpora are quite similar.",
        "Whereas F06 and F06T were initially developed on a corpus in French, their results on the English corpus are comparable to their results on the French test corpus, both for the difference between them and the difference with the four other algorithms.",
        "The comparison with these algorithms also illustrates the relationships between them: TextTiling*, LCseg, F06 and F06T share a large number of principles and their overall results are significantly higher than the results of U00 and C99.",
        "This trend is different from the one observed from the Choi corpus for which algorithms such C99",
        "F06T is respectively equal to 12%, 10%, 14% and 14%).",
        "This means probably that algorithms with good results on a corpus built as the Choi corpus will not necessarily have good results on \"true\" texts, which agrees with (Georgescul et al., 2006).",
        "Finally, we can observe that all these algorithms have better results on the English corpus than on the French one.",
        "As the two corpora are quite similar, this difference seems to come from their difference of language, perhaps because repetitions are more discouraged in French than in English from a stylistic viewpoint.",
        "This tends to be confirmed by the ratio between the size of the lemmatized vocabulary of each corpus and their number of tokens, equal to 8% for the French corpus and to 5.6% for the English corpus."

        "One of the main problems addressed by our work is the detection of the topical similarity of two text units.",
        "We have tackled this problem following an endogenous approach, which is new in the topic segmentation field to our knowledge.",
        "The main advantage of this option is that it does not require external knowledge.",
        "Moreover, it can integrate relations between words, such as proper nouns for instance, that are unlikely to be found in an external resource.",
        "Other solutions have been already proposed to solve the problem we consider.",
        "Most of them consist of two steps: first, they automatically build a semantic representation of words from the co-occurrences collected from a large corpus; then, they use this representation for enhancing the representation of each text unit to compare.",
        "This overall principle is implemented with different forms by several topic segmenters.",
        "In CWM (Choi et al., 2001), a variant of C99, each word of a sentence is replaced by its representation in a Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) space.",
        "In the work of Ponte and Croft (Ponte and Croft, 1997), the representations ofsentences are expanded by adding to them words selected from an external corpus by the means of the Local Context Analysis (LCA) method.",
        "Finally in (Caillet et al., 2004), a set of concepts are learnt from a corpus in an unsupervised way by using the X-means clustering algorithm and the paragraphs of documents are represented in the space defined by these concepts.",
        "In fact, the way we use relations between words is closer to (Jobbins and Evett, 1998), even if the relations in this work come from a network of co-occurrences or a thesaurus rather than from text topics.",
        "In both cases the similarity of two text units is determined by the proportion of their words that are part of a relation across the two units.",
        "More globally, our work exploits the topics of a text for its segmentation.",
        "This kind of approach was also explored in (Blei and Moreno, 2001) where probabilistic topic models were built in an unsupervised way.",
        "More recently, (Purver et al., 2006) has also proposed a method for unsupervised topic modeling to address both topic segmentation and identification.",
        "(Purver et al., 2006) is closer to our work than (Blei and Moreno, 2001) because it does not require to build topic models from a corpus but as in our case, its results do not outperform LCseg (Galley et al., 2003) while its model is far more complex.",
