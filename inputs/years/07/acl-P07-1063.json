        "our primary hypothesis is that language generated by varying parameters suggested by psycholinguistic research can be recognized as extravert or introvert.",
        "To test this hypothesis, three expert judges evaluated a set of generated utterances as if they had been uttered by a friend responding in a dialogue to a request to recommend restaurants.",
        "These utterances had been generated to systematically manipulate extraversion/introversion parameters.",
        "The judges rated each utterance for perceived extraversion, by answering the two questions measuring that trait from the Ten-item Personality inventory, as this instrument was shown to be psychome-trically superior to a 'single item per trait' questionnaire (Gosling et al., 2003).",
        "The answers are averaged to produce an extraversion rating ranging from 1 (highly introvert) to 7 (highly extravert).",
        "Because it was unclear whether the generation parameters in Table 2 would produce natural sounding utterances, the judges also evaluated the naturalness of each utterance on the same scale.",
        "The judges rated 240 utterances, grouped into 20 sets of 12 utterances generated from the same content plan.",
        "They rated one randomly ordered set at a time, but viewed all 12 utterances in that set before rating them.",
        "The utterances were generated to meet two experimental goals.",
        "First, to test the direct control of the perception of extraversion.",
        "2 introvert utterances and 2 extravert utterances were generated for each content plan (80 in total) using the parameter values in Table 2.",
        "Multiple outputs were generated with both parameter settings normally distributed with a 15% standard deviation.",
        "Second, 8 utterances for each content plan (160 in total) were generated with random parameter values.",
        "These random utterances make it possible to: (1) improve PERSONAGE's direct output by calibrating its parameters more precisely; and (2) build a statistical model that selects utterances matching input personality values after an overgeneration phase (see Section 6.2).",
        "The interrater agreement for extraversion between the judges over all 240 utterances (average Pearson's correlation of 0.57) shows that the magnitude of the differences of perception between judges is almost constant (cr = .037).",
        "A low agreement can yield a high correlation (e.g. if all values differ by a constant factor), so we also compute the intraclass correlation coefficient r based on a two-way random effect model.",
        "We obtain a r of 0.79, which is significant at the p < .001 level (reliability of average measures, identical to cronbach's alpha).",
        "This is comparable to the agreement ofjudgments ofpersonality in Mehl et al.",

        "These ratings are significantly different at the p < .001 level (two-tailed).",
        "in addition, if we divide the data into two equal-width bins around the neutral extravert rating (4 out of 7), then PERSONAGE's utterance ratings fall in the bin predicted by the parameter set 89.2% of the time.",

        "Interestingly, the random utterances, which may combine linguistic variables associated with both introverts and extraverts, are less natural than the introvert (p = .059) and extravert sets (p < .001).",
        "We also investigate a second approach: overgeneration with random parameter settings, followed by ranking via a statistical model trained on the judges' feedback.",

        "All models significantly outperform the baseline (0.83 mean absolute error, p < .05), but surprisingly the linear model performs the best with a mean absolute error of0.65.",

        "Verbosity plays the most important role: utterances with 4 or more content items are modeled as more extravert.",
        "Given a low verbosity, lexical frequency and restatements determine the extraversion level, e.g. utterances with less than 4 content items and infrequent words are perceived as very introverted (rating of 2.69 out of 7).",

        "We present an evaluation experiment showing that we can control the parameters to produce recognizable linguistic variation along the extraversion personality dimension.",

        "Some of the challenges discussed in the introduction remain.",
        "We have shown that evaluative utterances in the restaurant domain can manifest personality, but more research is needed on which speech acts recognisably manifest personality in a restricted domain.",
        "We also showed that the mapping we hypothesised of findings to generation parameters was effective, but there may be additional parameters that the psycholinguistic findings could be mapped to.",
        "Our work was partially inspired by the ICONOCLAST and PAULINE parameterizable generators (Bouayad-Agha et al., 2000; Hovy, 1988), which vary the style, rather than the personality, ofthe generated texts.",

        "(2000); Piwek (2003) uses personality variables to affect the linguistic behaviour of conversational agents, but they did not systematically manipulate parameters, and their generators were not evaluated.",

        "Paiva and Evans' trainable generator (2005) produces outputs that correspond to a set of linguistic variables measured in a corpus of target texts.",
