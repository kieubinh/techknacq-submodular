        "A bLSA model is introduced which enables latent topic distributions to be efficiently transferred across languages by enforcing a one-to-one topic correspondence during training.",
        "Using the proposed bLSA framework crosslingual LM adaptation can be performed by, first, inferring the topic posterior distribution of the source text and then applying the inferred distribution to the target language N-gram LM via marginal adaptation.",

        "On Chinese to English speech and text translation the proposed bLSA framework successfully reduced word perplexity of the English LM by over 27% for a unigram LM and up to 13.6% for a 4-gram LM.",

        "This approach has been successfully applied in automatic speech recognition (ASR) (Tam and Schultz, 2006) using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Blei et al., 2003).",
        "The LDA model can be viewed as a Bayesian topic mixture model with the topic mixture weights drawn from a Dirichlet distribution.",
        "For LM adaptation, the topic mixture weights are estimated based on in-domain adaptation text (e.g. ASR hypotheses).",
        "The adapted mixture weights are then used to interpolate a topic-dependent unigram LM, which is finally integrated into the background N-gram LM using marginal adaptation (Kneser et al., 1997)",
        "In this paper, we propose a framework to perform LM adaptation across languages, enabling the adaptation of a LM from one language based on the adaptation text of another language.",
        "In statistical machine translation (SMT), one approach is to apply LM adaptation on the target language based on an initial translation of input references (Kim and Khudanpur, 2003; Paulik et al., 2005).",
        "This scheme is limited by the coverage of the translation model, and overall by the quality of translation.",

        "We propose a bilingual Language model adaptation is crucial to numerous LSA model (bLSA) for crosslingual LM adaptation speech and translation tasks as it enables higher-that can be applied before translation.",
        "The bLSA level contextual information to be effectively incor- model consists of two LSA models: one for each porated into a background LM improving recogni- side of the language trained on parallel document tion or translation performance.",
        "One approach is corpora.",
        "The key property ofthe bLSA model is that the latent topic of the source and target LSA models can be assumed to be a one-to-one correspondence and thus share a common latent topic space since the training corpora consist of bilingual parallel data.",
        "For instance, say topic 10 of the Chinese LSA model is about politics.",
        "Then topic 10 of the English LSA model is set to also correspond to politics and so forth.",
        "During LM adaptation, we first infer the topic mixture weights from the source text using the source LSA model.",
        "Then we transfer the inferred mixture weights to the target LSA model and thus obtain the target LSA marginals.",
        "The challenge is to enforce the one-to-one topic correspondence.",
        "Our proposal is to share common variational Dirichlet posteriors over the topic mixture weights of a document pair in the LDA-style model.",
        "The beauty of the bLSA framework is that the model searches for a common latent topic space in an unsupervised fashion, rather than to require manual interaction.",
        "Since the topic space is language independent, our approach supports topic transfer in multiple language pairs in O(N) where N is the number of languages.",
        "Related work includes the Bilingual Topic Admixture Model (BiTAM) for word alignment proposed by (Zhao and Xing, 2006).",
        "Basically, the BiTAM model consists of topic-dependent translation lexicons modeling Pr(c|e, k) where c, e and k denotes the source Chinese word, target English word and the topic index respectively.",
        "On the other hand, the bLSA framework models Pr(c|k) and Pr(e|k) which is different from the BiTAM model.",
        "By their different modeling nature, the bLSA model usually supports more topics than the BiTAM model.",
        "Another work by (Kim and Khudanpur, 2004) employed crosslingual LSA using singular value decomposition which concatenates bilingual documents into a single input supervector before projection.",
        "We organize the paper as follows: In Section 2, we introduce the bLSA framework including Latent Dirichlet-Tree Allocation (LDTA) (Tam and Schultz, 2007) as a correlated LSA model, bLSA training and crosslingual LM adaptation.",

        "We proposed a bilingual latent semantic model for crosslingual LM adaptation in spoken language translation.",
        "The bLSA model consists of a set of monolingual LSA models in which a one-to-one topic correspondence is enforced between the LSA models through the sharing of variational Dirich-let posteriors.",
        "Bootstrapping a LSA model for a new language can be performed rapidly with topic transfer from a well-trained LSA model of another language.",
        "We transfer the inferred topic distribution from the input source text to the target language effectively to obtain an in-domain target LSA marginals for LM adaptation.",
        "Results showed that our approach signiicantly reduces the word perplexity on the target language in both cases using ASR hypotheses and manual transcripts.",
        "Interestingly, the adaptation performance is not much affected when ASR hypotheses were used.",
        "We evaluated the adapted LM on SMT and found that the evaluation metrics are crucial to reflect the actual improvement in performance.",
        "Future directions include the exploration of story-dependent LM adaptation with automatic story segmentation instead of show-dependent adaptation due to the possibility of multiple stories within a show.",
        "We will investigate the incorporation of monolingual documents for potentially better bilingual LSA modeling.",
