        "In the past decade, knowledge-lean approaches have significantly influenced research in noun phrase (NP) coreference resolution – the problem of determining which NPs refer to the same real-world entity in a document.",
        "In knowledge-lean approaches, coreference resolvers employ only morpho-syntactic cues as knowledge sources in the resolution process (e.g., Mitkov (1998), Tetreault (2001)).",
        "While these approaches have been reasonably successful (see Mitkov (2002)), Kehler et al.",
        "(2004) speculate that deeper linguistic knowledge needs to be made available to resolvers in order to reach the next level of performance.",
        "In fact, semantics plays a crucially important role in the resolution of common NPs, allowing us to identify the coreference relation between two lexically dissimilar common nouns (e.g., talks and negotiations) and to eliminate George W. Bush from the list of candidate antecedents of the city, for instance.",
        "As a result, researchers have readopted the once-popular knowledge-rich approach, investigating a variety of semantic knowledge sources for common noun resolution, such as the semantic relations between two NPs (e.g., Ji et al.",
        "(2005)), their semantic similarity as computed using WordNet (e.g., Poesio et al.",
        "(2004)) or Wikipedia (Ponzetto and Strube, 2006), and the contextual role played by an NP (see Bean and Riloff (2004)).",
        "Another type of semantic knowledge that has been employed by coreference resolvers is the semantic class (SC) of an NP, which can be used to disallow coreference between semantically incompatible NPs.",
        "However, learning-based resolvers have not been able to benefit from having an SC agreement feature, presumably because the method used to compute the SC of an NP is too simplistic: while the SC of a proper name is computed fairly accurately using a named entity (NE) recognizer, many resolvers simply assign to a common noun the first (i.e., most frequent) WordNet sense as its SC (e.g., Soon et al.",
        "(2001), Markert and Nissim (2005)).",
        "It is not easy to measure the accuracy of this heuristic, but the fact that the SC agreement feature is not used by Soon et al.",
        "'s decision tree coreference classifier seems to suggest that the SC values of the NPs are not computed accurately by this first-sense heuristic.",
        "Motivated in part by this observation, we examine whether automatically induced semantic class knowledge can improve the performance of a learning-based coreference resolver, reporting evaluation results on the commonly-used ACE coreference corpus.",
        "Our investigation proceeds as follows.",
        "Train a classifier for labeling the SC of an NP.",
        "In ACE, we are primarily concerned with classifying an NP as belonging to one of the ACE semantic classes.",
        "For instance, part of the ACE Phase 2 evaluation involves classifying an NP as person, organization, gpe (a geographical-political region), facility, location, or others.",
        "We adopt a corpus-based approach to SC determination, recasting the problem as a six-class classification task.",
        "Derive two knowledge sources for coreference resolution from the induced SCs.",
        "The first knowledge source (KS) is semantic class agreement (SCA).",
        "Following Soon et al.",
        "(2001), we represent SCA as a binary value that indicates whether the induced SCs of the two NPs involved are the same or not.",
        "The second KS is mention, which is represented as a binary value that indicates whether an NP belongs to one of the five ACE SCs mentioned above.",
        "Hence, the mention value of an NP can be readily derived from its induced SC: the value is no if its SC is others, and yes otherwise.",
        "This KS could be useful for ACE coreference, since ACE is concerned with resolving only NPs that are mentions.",
        "Incorporate the two knowledge sources in a coreference resolver.",
        "Next, we investigate whether these two KSs can improve a learning-based baseline resolver that employs a fairly standard feature set.",
        "Since (1) the two KSs can each be represented in the resolver as a constraint (for filtering non-mentions or disallowing coreference between semantically incompatible NPs) or as a feature, and (2) they can be applied to the resolver in isolation or in combination, we have eight ways of incorporating these KSs into the baseline resolver.",
        "In our experiments on the ACE Phase 2 coref-erence corpus, we found that (1) our SC induction method yields a significant improvement of 2% in accuracy over Soon et al.",
        "'s first-sense heuristic method as described above; (2) the coreference resolver that incorporates our induced SC knowledge by means of the two KSs mentioned above yields a significant improvement of 2% in F-measure over the resolver that exploits the SC knowledge computed by Soon et al.",
        "'s method; (3) the mention KS, when used in the baseline resolver as a constraint, improves the resolver by approximately 5-7% in F-measure; and (4) SCA, when employed as a feature by the baseline resolver, improves the accuracy of common noun resolution by about 5-8%."

        "Many ACE participants have also adopted a corpus-based approach to SC determination that is investigated as part of the mention detection (MD) task (e.g., Florian et al.",
        "(2006)).",
        "Briefly, the goal of MD is to identify the boundary of a mention, its mention type (e.g., pronoun, name), and its semantic type (e.g., person, location).",
        "Unlike them, (1) we do not perform the full MD task, as our goal is to investigate the role of SC knowledge in coreference resolution; and (2) we do not use the ACE training data for acquiring our SC classifier; instead, we use the BBN Entity Type Corpus (Weischedel and Brunstein, 2005), which consists of all the Penn Treebank Wall Street Journal articles with the ACE mentions manually identified and annotated with their SCs.",
        "This provides us with a training set that is approximately five times bigger than that of ACE.",
        "More importantly, the ACE participants do not evaluate the role of induced SC knowledge in coreference resolution: many of them evaluate coreference performance on perfect mentions (e.g., Luo et al.",
        "(2004)); and for those that do report performance on automatically extracted mentions, they do not explain whether or how the induced SC information is used in their coreference algorithms.",
        "Joint probabilistic models of coreference.",
        "Recently, there has been a surge of interest in improving coreference resolution by jointly modeling coreference with a related task such as MD (e.g., Daumé and Marcu (2005)).",
        "However, joint models typically need to be trained on data that is simultaneously annotated with information required by all of the underlying models.",
        "For instance, Daumé and Marcu's model assumes as input a corpus annotated with both MD and coreference information.",
        "On the other hand, we tackle coreference and SC induction separately (rather than jointly), since we train ourSC determination model on the BBN Entity Type Corpus, where coreference information is absent."

        "system performs worse according to both metrics, and although the drop in F-measure seems moderate, the performance difference is in fact highly significant (p=0.002).n",
        "Recall from the introduction that our investigation of the role of induced SC knowledge in learning-based coreference resolution proceeds in three steps: Label the SC of each NP in each ACE document.",
        "If a noun phrase, NPj, is a proper or common NP, then its SC value is determined using an SC classifier that we acquired in Section 3.",
        "On the other hand, if NPi is a pronoun, then we will be conservative and posit its SC value as UNCONSTRAINED (i.e., it is semantically compatible with all other NPs).Derive two KSs from the induced SCs.",
        "Recall that our first KS, Mention, is defined on an NP; its value is YES if the induced SC of the NP is not OTHERS, and NO otherwise.",
        "On the other hand, our second KS, SCA, is defined on a pair of NPs; its value is YES if the two NPs have the same induced SC that is not OTHERS, and NO otherwise.",
        "Incorporate the two KSs into the baseline re-solver.",
        "Recall that there are eight ways of incorporating these two KSs into our resolver: they can each be represented as a constraint or as a feature, and they can be applied to the resolver in isolation and in combination.",
        "Constraints are applied during the antecedent selection step.",
        "Specifically, when employed as a constraint, the Mention KS disallows coreference between two NPs if at least one of them has a Mention value of NO, whereas the SCA KS disallows coreference if the SCA value of the two NPs involved is NO.",
        "When encoded as a feature for the resolver, the Mention feature for an NP pair has the value YES if and only if the Mention value for both NPs is YES, whereas the SCA feature for an NP pair has its value taken from the SCA KS.",
        "Now, we can evaluate the impact of the two KSs on the performance of our baseline resolver.",
        "Specifically, rows 3-6 of Tables 6 and 7 show the F-measure and the resolution accuracy, respectively, when exactly one of the two KSs is employed by the baseline as either a constraint (C) or a feature (F), and rows 7-10 of the two tables show the results when both KSs are applied to the baseline.",
        "Furthermore, each row of Table 6 contains four sets of results, each of which corresponds to a different method for determining the SC value of an NP.",
        "For instance, the first set is obtained by using Soon et al.",
        "'s method as described in Footnote 8 to compute SC values, serving as sort of a baseline for our results using induced SC values.",
        "The second and third sets are obtained based on the SC values computed by the DL and the SVM classifier, respectively.",
        "The last set corresponds to an oracle experiment in which the resolver has access to perfect SC information.",
        "Rows 3-10 of Table 7 can be interpreted in a similar manner.",
        "From Table 6, we can see that (1) in comparison to the baseline, F-measure increases significantly in the five cases where at least one of the KSs is employed as a constraint by the resolver, and such improvements stem mainly from significant gains in precision; (2) in these five cases, the resolvers that use SCs induced by DL and SVM achieve significantly higher F-measure scores than their counterparts that rely on Soon's method for SC determination; and (3) none of the resolvers appears to benefit from SCA information whenever mention is used as a constraint.",
        "Moreover, note that even with perfectly computed SC information, the performance of the baseline system does not improve when neither MD nor SCA is employed as a constraint.",
        "These results provide further evidence that the decision tree learner is not exploiting these two semantic KSs in an optimal manner, whether they are computed automatically or perfectly.",
        "Hence, in machine learning for coreference resolution, it is important to determine not only what linguistic KSs to use, but also how to use them.",
        "While the coreference results in Table 6 seem to suggest that SCA and mention should be employed as constraints, the resolution results in Table 7 suggest that SCA is better encoded as a feature.",
        "Specifically, (1) in comparison to the baseline, the accuracy of common NP resolution improves by about 5-8% when SCA is encoded as a feature; and (2) whenever SCA is employed as a feature, the overall resolution accuracy is significantly higher for resolvers that use SCs induced by DL and SVM than those that rely on Soon's method for SC determination, with improvements in resolution observed on all three NP types.",
