        "The two tasks are similar in essence because they both aim to extract concise representations for documents.",
        "Automatic text summarization and keyword extraction have drawn much attention for a long time because they both are very important for many text applications, including document retrieval, document clustering, etc.",
        "For example, keywords of a document can be used for document indexing and thus benefit to improve the performance of document retrieval, and document summary can help to facilitate users to browse the search results and improve users' search experience.",
        "Text summaries and keywords can be either query-relevant or generic.",
        "Generic summary and keyword should reflect the main topics of the document without any additional clues and prior knowledge.",
        "In this paper, we focus on generic document summarization and keyword extraction for single documents.",
        "Document summarization and keyword extraction have been widely explored in the natural language processing and information retrieval communities.",
        "A series of workshops and conferences on automatic text summarization (e.g. SUMMAC, DUC and NTCIR) have advanced the technology and produced a couple of experimental online systems.",
        "In recent years, graph-based ranking algorithms have been successfully used for document summarization (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004, 2005; ErKan and Radev, 2004) and keyword extraction (Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004).",
        "Such algorithms make use of \"voting\" or \"recommendations\" between sentences (or words) to extract sentences (or keywords).",
        "Though the two tasks essentially share much in common, most algorithms have been developed particularly for either document summarization or keyword extraction.",
        "Zha (2002) proposes a method for simultaneous keyphrase extraction and text summarization by using only the heterogeneous sentence-to-word relationships.",
        "Inspired by this, we aim to take into account all the three kinds of relationships among sentences and words (i.e. the homogeneous relationships between words, the homogeneous relationships between sentences, and the heterogeneous relationships between words and sentences) in a unified framework for both document summarization and keyword extraction.",
        "The importance of a sentence (word) is determined by both the importance of related sentences (words) and the importance of related words (sentences).",

        "Generally speaking, single document summarization methods can be either extraction-based or abstraction-based and we focus on extraction-based methods in this study.",
        "Extraction-based methods usually assign a saliency score to each sentence and then rank the sentences in the document.",
        "The scores are usually computed based on a combination of statistical and linguistic features, including term frequency, sentence position, cue words, stigma words, topic signature (Hovy and Lin, 1997; Lin and Hovy, 2000), etc.",
        "Machine learning methods have also been employed to extract sentences, including unsupervised methods (Nomoto and Matsumoto, 2001) and supervised methods (Kupiec et al., 1995; Conroy and O'Leary, 2001; Amini and Gallinari, 2002; Shen et al., 2007).",
        "Other methods include maximal marginal relevance (MMR) (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998), latent semantic analysis (LSA) (Gong and Liu, 2001).",

        "Most recently, graph-based ranking methods, including TextRank ((Mihalcea and Tarau, 2004, have been proposed for document summarization.",
        "Similar to Kleinberg's HITS algorithm (Kleinberg, 1999) or Google's PageRank (Brin and Page, 1998), these methods first build a graph based on the similarity between sentences in a document and then the importance of a sentence is determined by taking into account global information on the graph recursively, rather than relying only on local sentence-specific information.",
        "Keyword (or keyphrase) extraction usually involves assigning a saliency score to each candidate keyword by considering various features.",
        "Krulwich and Burkey (1996) use heuristics to extract key-phrases from a document.",

        "The proposed approach is intuitively based on the following assumptions:",
        "Assumption 1: A sentence should be salient if it is heavily linked with other salient sentences, and a word should be salient if it is heavily linked with other salient words.",
        "Assumption 2: A sentence should be salient if it contains many salient words, and a word should be salient if it appears in many salient sentences.",
        "The first assumption is similar to PageRank which makes use of mutual \"recommendations\" between homogeneous objects to rank objects.",
        "The second assumption is similar to HITS if words and sentences are considered as authorities and hubs respectively.",
        "In other words, the proposed approach aims to fuse the ideas of PageRank and HITS in a unified framework.",
        "In more detail, given the heterogeneous data points of sentences and words, the following three kinds of relationships are fused in the proposed approach:",
        "SS-Relationship: It reflects the homogeneous relationships between sentences, usually computed by their content similarity.",
        "WW-Relationship: It reflects the homogeneous relationships between words, usually computed by knowledge-based approach or corpus-based approach.",
        "SW-Relationship: It reflects the heterogeneous relationships between sentences and words, usually computed as the relative importance of a word in a sentence.",
        "The proposed approach first builds three graphs to reflect the above relationships respectively, and then iteratively computes the saliency scores of the sentences and words based on the graphs.",
        "Finally, the algorithm converges and each sentence or word gets its saliency score.",
        "The sentences with high saliency scores are chosen into the summary, and the words with high saliency scores are combined to produce the keywords.",
        "Given the sentence collection S={st | 1<i<m} of a document, if each sentence is considered as a node, the sentence collection can be modeled as an undirected graph by generating an edge between two sentences if their content similarity exceeds 0, i.e. an undirected link between si and Sj (iKj) is constructed and the associated weight is their content similarity.",
        "Thus, we construct an undirected graph GSS to reflect the homogeneous relationship between sentences.",
        "The content similarity between two sentences is computed with the cosine measure.",
        "We use an adjacency matrix U to describe GSS with each entry corresponding to the weight of a link in the graph.",

        "Note that other measures (e.g. Jaccard, Dice, Overlap, etc.)",
        "can also be explored to compute the content similarity between sentences, and we simply choose the cosine measure in this study.",
        "Then U is normalized to U as follows to make the sum of each row equal to 1:",
        "Given the word collection T={tj\\1<j<n } of a document , the semantic similarity between any two words ti and tj can be computed using approaches that are either knowledge-based or corpus-based (Mihalcea et al., 2006).",
        "Knowledge-based measures of word semantic similarity try to quantify the degree to which two words are semantically related using information drawn from semantic networks.",
        "WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) is a lexical database where each unique meaning of a word is represented by a synonym set or synset.",
        "Each synset has a gloss that defines the concept that it represents.",
        "Synsets are connected to each other through explicit semantic relations that are defined in WordNet.",
        "Many approaches have been proposed to measure semantic relatedness based on WordNet.",
        "The measures vary from simple edge-counting to attempt to factor in peculiarities of the network structure by considering link direction, relative path, and density, such as vector, lesk, hso, Ich, wup, path, res, lin and jcn (Pedersen et al., 2004).",
        "For example, \"cat\" and \"dog\" has higher semantic similarity than \"cat\" and \"computer\".",
        "In this study, we implement the vector measure to efficiently evaluate the similarities of a large number of word pairs.",
        "The vector measure (Patwardhan, 2003) creates a cooccurrence matrix from a corpus made up of the WordNet glosses.",
        "Each content word used in a WordNet gloss has an associated context vector.",
        "Each gloss is represented by a gloss vector that is the average of all the context vectors of the words found in the gloss.",
        "Relatedness between concepts is measured by finding the cosine between a pair of gloss vectors.",
        "Corpus-based measures of word semantic similarity try to identify the degree of similarity between words using information exclusively derived from large corpora.",
        "Such measures as mutual information (Turney 2001), latent semantic analysis (Landauer et al., 1998), log-likelihood ratio (Dunning, 1993) have been proposed to evaluate word semantic similarity based on the co-occurrence information on a large corpus.",
        "In this study, we simply choose the mutual information to compute the semantic similarity between word ti and tj as follows:",
        "N x p(ti,tj) which indicates the degree of statistical dependence between ti and tj.",
        "Here, N is the total number of words in the corpus and p(ti) and p(tj) are respectively the probabilities of the occurrences of ti and tj, i.e. count(ti)/N and count(tj)/N, where count(t) and count(tj) are the frequencies of ti and tj.",
        "p(ti, tj) is the probability of the co-occurrence of ti and tjwithin a window with a predefined size k, i.e. count(ti, tj)/N, where count(ti, tj) is the number of the times ti and tj co-occur within the window.",
        "Similar to the SS-Graph, we can build an undirected graph GWW to reflect the homogeneous relationship between words, in which each node corresponds to a word and the weight associated with the edge between any different word ti and tj is computed by either the WordNet-based vector measure or the corpus-based mutual information measure.",
        "We use an adjacency matrix V to describe GWW with each entry corresponding to the weight of a link in the graph.",
        "V= [Vij]nxn, where Vj =sim(th tj) if iKj and Vij=0 if i=j.",
        "Then V is similarly normalized to V to make the sum of each row equal to 1.",
        "Given the sentence collection S={ si | 1 <i<m} and the word collection T={tj|1<j<n } of a document, we can build a weighted bipartite graph GSW from S and T in the following way: if word tjappears in sentence si, we then create an edge between si and tj.",
        "A nonnegative weight aff(si,tj) is specified on the edge, which is proportional to the importance of word tj in sentence si, computed as follows:",
        ", tftj x isftj",
        "Ift x isft",
        "where t represents a unique term in si and tft, isft are respectively the term frequency in the sentence and the inverse sentence frequency.",
        "We use an adjacency (affinity) matrix W=[Wij]mxn to describe GSW with each entry Wj corresponding to aff(si,tj).",
        "Similarly, W is normalized to W to make the sum of each row equal to 1.",
        "In addition, we normalize the transpose of W, i.e.",
        "WT, to W to make the sum of each row in WTequal to 1.",
        "We use two column vectors u=[u(si)]mx1 and v =[v(tj)]nx1 to denote the saliency scores of the sentences and words in the specified document.",
        "The assumptions introduced in Section 3.1 can be rendered as follows:",
        "After fusing the above equations, we can obtain the following iterative forms:",
        "And the matrix form is:",
        "where a and ) specify the relative contributions to the final saliency scores from the homogeneous nodes and the heterogeneous nodes and we have a+)=l.",
        "In order to guarantee the convergence of the iterative form, u and v are normalized after each iteration.",
        "For numerical computation of the saliency scores, the initial scores of all sentences and words are set to l and the following two steps are alternated until convergence, 1.",
        "Compute and normalize the scores of sentences:",
        "2.",
        "Compute and normalize the scores of words: '(n) - aVTv(n-1) + )WTu(nA), where u(n) and v(n) denote the vectors computed at the nth iteration.",
        "Usually the convergence of the iteration algorithm is achieved when the difference between the scores computed at two successive iterations for any sentences and words falls below a given threshold (0.0001 in this study).",
        "We used task 1 of DUC2002 (DUC, 2002) for evaluation.",
        "The task aimed to evaluate generic summaries with a length of approximately 100 words or less.",

        "The sentences in each article have been separated and the sentence information was stored into files.",
        "In the experiments, the background corpus for using the mutual information measure to compute word semantics simply consisted of all the documents from DUC2001 to DUC2005, which could be easily expanded by adding more documents.",
        "The stopwords were removed and the remaining words were converted to the basic forms based on WordNet.",
        "Then the semantic similarity values between the words were computed.",
        "We used the ROUGE (Lin and Hovy, 2003) toolkit (i.e.ROUGEeval-1.4.2 in this study) for evaluation, which has been widely adopted by DUC for automatic summarization evaluation.",
        "It measured summary quality by counting overlapping units such as the n-gram, word sequences and word pairs between the candidate summary and the reference summary.",
        "ROUGE toolkit reported separate scores for 1, 2, 3 and 4-gram, and also for longest common subsequence co-occurrences.",
        "Among these different scores, unigram-based ROUGE score (ROUGE-1) has been shown to agree with human judgment most (Lin and Hovy, 2003).",

        "When using the mutual information measure, we heuristically set the window size k to 2, 5 and 10, respectively.",

        "Evaluation results demonstrate the performance improvement of the proposed approach over the baselines for both tasks.",
        "In this study, only the mutual information measure and the vector measure are employed to compute word semantics, and in future work many other measures mentioned earlier will be investigated in the framework in order to show the robustness of the framework.",
        "The evaluation of keyword extraction is preliminary in this study, and we will conduct more thorough experiments to make the results more convincing.",
        "Furthermore, the proposed approach will be applied to multi-document summarization and keyword extraction, which are considered more difficult than single document summarization and keyword extraction."
