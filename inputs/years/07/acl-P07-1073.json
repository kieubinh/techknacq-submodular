        "A growing body of recent work in information extraction has addressed the problem of relation extraction (RE), identifying relationships between entities stated in text, such as LivesIn(Person, Location) or EmployedBy(Person, Company).",
        "Supervised learning has been shown to be effective for RE (Zelenko et al., 2003; Culotta and Sorensen, 2004; Bunescu and Mooney, 2006); however, annotating large corpora with examples of the relations to be extracted is expensive and tedious.",
        "In this paper, we introduce a supervised learning approach to RE that requires only a handful of training examples and uses the web as a corpus.",
        "Given a few pairs of well-known entities that clearly exhibit or do not exhibit a particular relation, such as CorpAcquired(Google, YouTube) and not(CorpAcquired(Yahoo, Microsoft)), a search engine is used to find sentences on the web that mention both of the entities in each of the pairs.",
        "Although not all of the sentences for positive pairs will state the desired relationship, many of them will.",
        "Presumably, none of the sentences for negative pairs state the targeted relation.",
        "Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a machine learning framework that exploits this sort of weak supervision, in which a positive bag is a set of instances which is guaranteed to contain at least one positive example, and a negative bag is a set of instances all of which are negative.",
        "MIL was originally introduced to solve a problem in biochemistry (Dietterich et al., 1997); however, it has since been applied to problems in other areas such as classifying image regions in computer vision (Zhang et al., 2002), and text categorization (Andrews et al., 2003; Ray and Craven, 2005).",
        "We have extended an existing approach to relation extraction using support vector machines and string kernels (Bunescu and Mooney, 2006) to handle this weaker form of MIL supervision.",
        "This approach can sometimes be misled by textual features correlated with the specific entities in the few training pairs provided.",
        "Therefore, we also describe a method for weighting features in order to focus on those correlated with the target relation rather than with the individual entities.",
        "We present experimental results demonstrating that our approach is able to accurately extract relations from the web by learning from such weak supervision."

        "In Section 6 we describe a method for extracting bags of relevant sentences from the web.",
        "Using a limited set of entity pairs (e.g. those in Table 1) and their associated bags as training data, the aim is to induce a relation extraction system that can reliably decide whether two entities mentioned in the same sentence exhibit the target relationship or not.",
        "In particular, when tested on the example sentences from Figure 1, the system should classify Si, S3,and S4 as positive, and S2 and S5 as negative.",
        "As formulated above, the learning task can be seen as an instance of multiple instance learning.",
        "However, there are important properties that set it apart from problems previously considered in MIL.",

        "Consequently, an application of the learning model described in Sections 3 & 4 is bound to be affected by the following two types of bias:",
        "■ [Type I Bias] By definition, all sentences inside a bag are constrained to contain the same two arguments.",
        "Words that are semantically correlated with either of the two arguments are likely to occur in many sentences.",
        "For example, consider the sentences Si and S2 from the bag associated with \"Google\" and \"YouTube\" (as shown in Figure 1).",
        "They both contain the words \"search\" - highly correlated with \"Google\", and \"video\" - highly correlated with \"YouTube\", and it is likely that a significant percentage of sentences in this bag contain one of the two words (or both).",
        "The two entities can be mentioned in the same sentence for reasons other than the target relation R, and these noisy training sentences are likely to contain words that are correlated with the two entities, without any relationship to R. A learning model where the features are based on words, or word sequences, is going to give too much weight to words or combinations of words that are correlated with either of individual arguments.",
        "This overweighting will adversely affect extraction performance through an increased number of errors.",
        "A method for eliminating this type of bias is introduced in Section 5.1.",
        "■ [Type II Bias] While Type I bias is due to words that are correlated with the arguments of a relation instance, the Type II bias is caused by words that are specific to the relation instance itself.",
        "Using",
        "FrameNet terminology (Baker et al., 1998), these correspond to instantiated frame elements.",
        "For example, the corporate acquisition frame can be seen as a subtype of the \"Getting\" frame in FrameNet.",
        "The core elements in this frame are the Recipient (e.g. Google) and the Theme (e.g. YouTube), which for the acquisition relationship coincide with the two arguments.",
        "They do not contribute any bias, since they are replaced with the generic tags (ei) and (e2) in all sentences from the bag.",
        "There are however other frame elements - peripheral, or extra-thematic - that can be instantiated with the same value in many sentences.",
        "In Figure 1, for instance, sentence S3 contains two non-core frame elements: the Means element (e.g \"in a stock-for-stock transaction\") and the Time element (e.g. \"on October 9, 2006\").",
        "Words from these elements, like \"stock\", or \"October\", are likely to occur very often in the Google-YouTube bag, and because the training dataset contains only a few other bags, subsequence patterns containing these words will be given too much weight in the learned model.",
        "This is problematic, since these words can appear in many other frames, and thus the learned model is likely to make errors.",
        "Instead, we would like the model to focus on words that trigger the target relationship (in FrameNet, these are the lexical units associated with the target frame).",
        "In order to account for how strongly the words in a sequence are correlated with either of the individual arguments of the relation, we modify the formula for the sequence weight t(s) by factoring in a weight t (w) for each word in the sequence, as illustrated in Equation 1.",
        "Given a predefined set of weights t (w), it is straightforward to update the recursive computation of the subsequence kernel so that it reflects the new weighting scheme.",
        "If all the word weights are set to 1, then the new kernel is equivalent to the old one.",
        "What we want, however, is a set of weights where words that are correlated with either of the two arguments are given lower weights.",
        "For any word, the decrease in weight should reflect the degree of correlation between that word and the two arguments.",
        "Before showing the formula used for computing the word weights, we first introduce some notation:",
        "• Let X G X be an arbitrary bag, and let X.aiand X.a2 be the two arguments associated with the bag.",
        "• Let C(X) be the size of the bag (i.e. the number of sentences in the bag), and C(X, w) the number of sentences in the bag X that contain the word w. Let P(w|X) = C(X, w)/C(X).",

        "The word weights are computed as follows:",
        "P(w\\a) = C(w, a)/C(a).",
        "Because this may be an overestimate (w may appear in a sentence containing a due to causes other than a), and also because of data sparsity, the quantity t (w) may sometimes result in a negative value - in these cases it is set to 0, which is equivalent to ignoring the word w in all subsequence patterns."

        "An interesting potential application of our approach is a web relation-extraction system similar to Google Sets, in which the user provides only a handful of pairs of entities known to exhibit or not to exhibit a particular relation, and the system is used to find other pairs of entities exhibiting the same relation.",

        "Sentences containing one of the relation arguments could be extracted from the web, and likely negative sentence examples automatically created by pairing this entity with other named entities mentioned in the sentence.",

        "Any pair of entities different from the relation pair is very likely to be a negative example for that relation.",
        "This is similar to the concept of negative neighborhoods introduced by Smith and Eisner (2005), and has the potential of eliminating both Type I and Type II bias."

        "Also, KNOWITALL requires large numbers of search engine queries in order to collect and validate extraction patterns, therefore experiments can take weeks to complete.",
