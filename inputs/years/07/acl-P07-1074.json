        "Information extraction (IE) has the task to discover n-tuples of relevant items (entities) belonging to an nary relation in natural language documents.",
        "One of the central goals of the ACE programl is to develop a more systematically grounded approach to IE starting from elementary entities, binary relations to nary relations such as events.",
        "Current semi-or unsupervised approaches to automatic pattern acquisition are either limited to a certain linguistic representation (e.g., subject-verb-object), or only deal with binary relations, or cannot assign slot filler roles to the extracted arguments, or do not have good selection and filtering methods to handle the large number of tree patterns (Riloff, 1996; Agichtein and Gravano, 2000; Yangarber, 2003; Sudo et al., 2003; Greenwood and Stevenson, 2006; Stevenson and Greenwood, 2006).",
        "Most of these approaches do not consider the linguistic interaction between relations and their projections on k dimensional subspaces where 1<k<n, which is important for scalability and reusability of rules.",
        "Stevenson and Greenwood (2006) present a systematic investigation of the pattern representation models and point out that substructures of the linguistic representation and the access to the embedded structures are important for obtaining a good coverage of the pattern acquisition.",
        "However, all considered representation models (subject-verb-object, chain model, linked chain model and subtree model) are verb-centered.",
        "Relations embedded in non-verb constructions such as a compound noun cannot be discovered: (1) the 2005 Nobel Peace Prize (1) describes a ternary relation referring to three properties of a prize: year, area and prize name.",
        "We also observe that the automatically acquired et al.",
        "(2003), Greenwood and Stevenson (2006) cannot be directly used as relation extraction rules because the relation-specific argument role information is missing.",
        "E.g., in the management succession domain that concerns the identification of job changing events, a person can either move into a job (called PersonIn) or leave a job (called Per-son_Out).",
        "(2) is a simplified example of patterns extracted by these systems:",
        "(2) <subject: person> verb <object:organisation>",
        "In (2), there is no further specification of whether the person entity in the subject position is Per-son_In or Person_Out.",
        "The ambitious goal of our approach is to provide a general framework for the extraction of relations and events with various complexity.",
        "Within this framework, the IE system learns extraction patterns automatically and induces rules of various complexity systematically, starting from sample relation instances as seeds.",
        "The arity of the seed determines the complexity of extracted relations.",
        "The seed helps us to identify the explicit linguistic expressions containing mentionings of relation instances or instances of their k-ary projections where 1<k<n. Because our seed samples are not linguistic patterns, the learning system is not restricted to a particular linguistic representation and is therefore suitable for various linguistic analysis methods and representation formats.",
        "The pattern discovery is bottom-up and compositional, i.e., complex patterns can build on top of simple patterns for projections.",
        "We propose a rule representation that supports this strategy.",
        "Therefore, our learning approach is seed-driven and bottom-up.",
        "Here we use dependency trees as input for pattern extraction.",
        "We consider only trees or their subtrees containing seed arguments.",
        "Therefore, our method is much more efficient than the subtree model of Sudo et al., (2003), where all subtrees containing verbs are taken into account.",
        "Our pattern rule ranking and filtering method considers two aspects of a pattern: its domain relevance and the trustworthiness of its origin.",
        "We tested our framework in two domains: Nobel Prize awards and management succession.",
        "Evaluations have been conducted to investigate the performance with respect to the seed parameters: the number of seeds and the influence of data size and its redundancy property.",
        "The whole system has been evaluated for the two domains considering precision and recall.",
        "We utilize the evaluation strategy \"Ideal Matrix\" of Agichtein and Gravano (2000) to deal with unannotated test data.",

        "We call our system DARE, standing for \"Domain Adaptive Relation Extraction based on Seeds\".",
        "DARE contains four major components: linguistic annotation, classifier, rule learning and relation extraction.",
        "The first component only applies once, while the last three components are integrated in a bootstrapping loop.",
        "At each iteration, rules will be learned based on the seed and then new relation instances will be extracted by applying the learned rules.",
        "The new relation instances are then used as seeds for the next iteration of the learning cycle.",
        "The cycle terminates when no new relations can be acquired.",
        "The linguistic annotation is responsible for enriching the natural language texts with linguistic information such as named entities and dependency structures.",
        "In our framework, the depth of the linguistic annotation can be varied depending on the domain and the available resources.",
        "The classifier has the task to deliver relevant paragraphs and sentences that contain seed elements.",
        "It has three subcomponents: document retrieval, paragraph retrieval and sentence retrieval.",
        "The document retrieval component utilizes the open source IR-system Lucene.",
        "A translation step is built in to convert the seed into the proper IR query format.",
        "As explained in Xu et al.",
        "(2006), we generate all possible lexical variants of the seed arguments to boost the retrieval coverage and formulate a boolean query where the arguments are connected via conjunction and the lexical variants are associated via disjunction.",
        "However, the translation could be modified.",
        "The task of paragraph retrieval is to find text snippets from the relevant documents where the seed relation arguments co-occur.",
        "Given the paragraphs, a sentence containing at least two arguments of a seed relation will be regarded as relevant.",
        "As mentioned above, the rule learning component constitutes the core of our system.",
        "It identifies patterns from the annotated documents inducing extraction rules from the patterns, and validates them.",
        "In section 4, we will give a detailed explanation of this component.",
        "The relation extraction component applies the newly learned rules to the relevant documents and extracts relation instances.",
        "The validated relation instances will then be used as new seeds for the next iteration."

        "The conclusion, we draw from the observed difference between the two tasks is simple: We shall always try to find a highly redundant training data set.",
        "If at all possible, the training data should exhibit a skewed distribution of reports to events.",
        "Actually, such training data may be the only realistic chance for reaching a large number of rare patterns.",
