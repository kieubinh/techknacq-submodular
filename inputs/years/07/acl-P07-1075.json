        "In this paper, we follow the IE tasks as defined by the conferences MUC4, MUC6 and ACE RDC: slotbased extraction, template filling and relation extraction, respectively.",
        "Previous approaches to IE relied on cooccurrence (Xiao et al., 2004) and dependency (Zhang et al., 2006) relations between entities.",
        "These relations enable us to make reliable extraction of correct entities/relations at the level of a single clause.",
        "However, Maslennikov et al.",
        "(2006) reported that the increase of relation path length will lead to considerable decrease in performance.",
        "In most cases, this decrease in performance occurs because entities may belong to different clauses.",
        "Since clauses in a sentence are connected by clausal relations (Halliday and Hasan, 1976), it is thus important to perform discourse analysis of a sentence.",
        "Discourse analysis may contribute to IE in several ways.",
        "First, Taboada and Mann (2005) reported that discourse analysis helps to decompose long sentences into clauses.",
        "Therefore, it helps to distinguish relevant clauses from non-relevant ones.",
        "Second, Miltsakaki (2003) stated that entities in subordinate clauses are less salient.",
        "Third, the knowledge of textual structure helps to interpret the meaning of entities in a text (Grosz and Sidner 1986).",
        "As an example, consider the sentences \"ABC Co. appointed a new chairman.",
        "Additionally, the current CEO was retired\".",
        "The word 'additionally' connects the event in the second sentence to the entity 'ABC Co.' in the first sentence.",
        "Fourth, Moens and De Busser (2002) reported that discourse segments tend to be in a fixed order for structured texts such as court decisions or news.",
        "Hence, analysis of discourse order may reduce the variability of possible relations between entities.",
        "To model these factors, we propose a multiresolution framework ARE that integrates both discourse and dependency relations at 2 levels.",
        "ARE aims to filter noisy dependency relations from training and support their evaluation with discourse relations between entities.",
        "Additionally, we encode semantic roles of entities in order to utilize semantic relations.",
        "Evaluations on MUC4, MUC6 and ACE RDC 2003 corpora demonstrates that our approach outperforms the state-of-art systems mainly due to modeling of discourse relations.",
        "The contribution of this paper is in applying discourse relations to supplement dependency relations in a multi-resolution framework for IE.",
        "The framework enables us to connect entities in different clauses and thus improve the performance on long-distance dependency paths.",
        "Section 2 describes related work, while Section 3 presents our proposed framework, including the extraction of anchor cues and various types of relations, integration of extracted relations, and complexity classification.",

        "We can often remove satellites without losing the meaning of text.",
        "Both nuclei and satellites are connected with discourse relations in a hierarchical structure.",
        "In our work, we use 16 classes of discourse relations between clauses: Attribution, Background, Cause, Comparison, Condition, Contrast, Elaboration, Enablement, Evaluation, Explanation, Joint, Manner-Means, Topic-Comment, Summary, Temporal, Topic-Change.",

        "Therefore, we decide to include all of them in the learning process to learn patterns with best possible performance.",
        "We consider two main rationales for utilizing discourse relations to IE.",
        "First, discourse relations help to narrow down the search space to the level of a single clause.",
        "For example, the sentence \"[<Soc-Al>Trudeau</>'s <Soc-A2>son</> told everyone], [their prime minister was his father], [who took him to a secret base in the arctic] [and let him peek through a window]. \"",
        "contains 4 clauses and 7 anchor cues (key phrases) for the type Social, which leads to 21 possible variants.",
        "Splitting this sentence into clauses reduces the combinations to 4 possible variants.",
        "Additionally, this reduction eliminates the long and noisy dependency paths.",
        "Second, discourse analysis enables us to connect entities in different clauses with clausal relations.",
        "As an example, we consider a sentence \"It's a dark comedy about a boy named <AT-A1>Marshal</> played by Amourie Kats who discovers all kinds of on and scary things going on in <AT-A2>a seemingly quiet little town</> \".",

        "We carry out our experiments on 3 domains: MUC4 (Terrorism), MUC6 (Management Succession), and ACE-Relation Detection and Characterization (2003).",
        "The MUC4 corpus contains 1,300 documents as training set and 200 documents (TST3 and TST4) as official testing set.",
        "We used a modified version of the MUC6 corpus described by Soderland (1999).",
        "This version includes 599 documents as training set and 100 documents as testing set.",
        "Following the methodology of Zhang et al.",
        "(2006), we use only the English portion of ACE RDC 2003 training data.",
        "We used 97 documents for testing and the remaining 155 documents for training.",
        "Our task is to extract 5 major relation types and 24 subtypes.",
        "To compare the results on the terrorism domain in MUC4, we choose the recent state-of-art systems GRID by Xiao et al.",

        "(2005) and ARE (2006) by Maslennikov et al.",
        "(2006) which does not utilize discourse and semantic relations.",
        "The comparative results are given in Table 2.",
        "It shows that our enhanced ARE results in 3% improvement in F1 measure over ARE (2006) that does not use clausal relations.",
        "The improvement was due to the use of discourse relations on long paths, such as \"X distributed leaflets claiming responsibility for murder of Y\".",
        "At the same time, for many instances, it would be useful to store the extracted anchors for another round of learning.",
        "For example, the extracted features of discourse pattern \"murder -same_clause-> HUMPERSON\" may boost the score for patterns that correspond to relation path \"X <-span- _ -Elaboration-> murder\".",
        "In this way, high-precision patterns will support the refinement of patterns with average recall and low precision.",
        "This observation is similar to that described in Ciravegna's work on (LP)(Ciravegna 2001).",
        "Next, we present the performance of our system on MUC6 corpus (Management Succession) as shown in Table 3.",
        "The improvement of 7% in F1 is mainly due to the filtering of irrelevant dependency relations.",
        "Additionally, we noticed that 22% of testing sentences contain 2 answer templates, and entities in many of such templates are intertwined.",
        "One example is the sentence \"Mr. Bronc-zek who is 39 years old succeeds Kenneth Newell 55 who was named to the new post of senior vice president\", which refers to 2 positions.",
        "We therefore we need to extract 2 templates \"PersonIn: Bronczek, PersonOut: Newell\" and \"PersonIn: Newell, Post: senior vice president\" .",
        "The discourse analysis is useful to extract the second template, while rejecting another long-distance template \"PersonIn: Bronczek, PersonOut: Newell, Post: seniour vice president\" .",
        "Another remark is that it is important to assign 2 anchors of 'CandPersonIn' and 'CandPersonOut' for the phrase \"Kenneth Newell\".",
        "The characteristic of the ACE corpus is that it contains a large amount of variations, while only 2% of possible dependency paths are correct.",
        "Since many of the relations occur only at the level of single clause (for example, most instances of relation At), the discourse analysis is used to eliminate long-distance dependency paths.",
        "It allows us to significantly decrease the dimensionality of the problem.",
        "We noticed that 38% of relation paths in ACE contain a single relation, 28% contain 2 relations and 34% contain > 3 relations.",
        "For the case of > 3 relations, the analysis of dependency paths alone is not sufficient to eliminate the unreliable paths.",
        "Our results for general types and specific subtypes are presented in Tables 6 and 7, respectively.",
        "Based on our results in Table 4, discourse and dependency relations support each other in different situations.",
