        "Latent variable models have recently been of increasing interest in Natural Language Processing, and in parsing in particular (e.g. (Koo and Collins, 2005; Matsuzaki et al., 2005; Riezler et al., 2002)).",
        "Latent variables provide a principled way to include features in a probability model without needing to have data labeled with those features in advance.",
        "Instead, a labeling with these features can be induced as part of the training process.",
        "The difficulty with latent variable models is that even small numbers of latent variables can lead to computationally intractable inference (a.k.a.",
        "decoding, parsing).",
        "In this paper we propose a solution to this problem based on dynamic Sigmoid Belief Networks (SBNs) (Neal, 1992).",
        "The dynamic SBNs which we peopose, called Incremental Sigmoid Be-liefNetworks (ISBNs) have large numbers oflatent variables, which makes exact inference intractable.",
        "However, they can be approximated sufficiently well to build fast and accurate statistical parsers which induce features during training.",
        "We use SBNs in a generative history-based model of constituent structure parsing.",
        "The probability of an unbounded structure is decomposed into a sequence of probabilities for individual derivation decisions, each decision conditioned on the unbounded history of previous decisions.",
        "The most common approach to handling the unbounded nature of the histories is to choose a predefined set of features which can be unambiguously derived from the history (e.g. (Charniak, 2000; Collins, 1999)).",
        "Decision probabilities are then assumed to be independent of all information not represented by this finite set of features.",
        "Another previous approach is to use neural networks to compute a compressed representation of the history and condition decisions on this representation (Henderson, 2003; Henderson, 2004).",
        "It is possible that an unbounded amount of information is encoded in the compressed representation via its continuous values, but it is not clear whether this is actually happening due to the lack ofany principled interpretation for these continuous values.",
        "Like the former approach, we assume that there are a finite set of features which encode the relevant information about the parse history.",
        "But unlike that approach, we allow feature values to be ambiguous, and represent each feature as a distribution over (binary) values.",
        "In other words, these history features are treated as latent variables.",
        "Unfortunately, interpreting the history representations as distributions over discrete values of latent variables makes the exact computation of decision probabilities intractable.",
        "Exact computation requires marginalizing out the latent variables, which involves summing over all possible vectors of discrete values, which is exponential in the length of the vector.",
        "We propose two forms of approximation for dynamic SBNs, a neural network approximation and a form of mean field approximation (Saul and Jordan, 1999).",
        "We first show that the previous neural network model of (Henderson, 2003) can be viewed as a coarse approximation to inference with ISBNs.",
        "We then propose an incremental mean field method, which results in an improved approximation over the neural network but remains tractable.",
        "The resulting parser achieves significantly higher accuracy than the neural network parser (90.0% F-measure vs 89.1%).",
        "We argue that this correlation between better approximation and better accuracy suggests that dynamic SBNs are a good abstract model for natural language parsing."

        "Variational methods have also been proposed for approximating SBNs (Saul and Jordan, 1999).",
        "The main idea of variational methods (Jordan et al., 1999) is, roughly, to construct a tractable approximate model with a number of free parameters.",
        "The free parameters are set so that the resulting approximate model is as close as possible to the original graphical model for a given inference problem.",
        "The simplest example of a variation method is the mean field method, originally introduced in statistical mechanics and later applied to unsupervised neural networks in (Hinton et al., 1995).",

        "It is used in the mean field theory (Saul and Jordan, 1999) to approximate the likelihood.",
        "However, in our case of dynamic graphical models, we have to use a different approach which allows us to construct an incremental parsing method without needing to introduce the additional parameters proposed in (Saul and Jordan, 1999).",
        "We will describe our modification of the mean field method in section 3.3.",
        "Dynamic Bayesian networks are Bayesian networks applied to arbitrarily long sequences.",
        "A new set of variables is instantiated for each position in the sequence, but the edges and weights for these variables are the same as in other positions.",
        "The edges which connect variables instantiated for different positions must be directed forward in the sequence, thereby allowing a temporal interpretation of the sequence.",
        "Typically a dynamic Bayesian Network will only involve edges between adjacent positions in the sequence (i.e. they are Markovian), but in our parsing models the pattern of interconnection is determined by structural locality, rather than sequence locality, as in the neural networks of (Henderson, 2003).",
        "Using structural locality to define the graph in a dynamic SBN means that the subgraph of edges with destinations at a given position cannot be determined until all the parser decisions for previous positions have been chosen.",
        "We therefore call these models Incremental SBNs, because, at any given position in the parse, we only know the graph of edges for that position and previous positions in the parse.",
        "For example in figure 1, discussed below, it would not be possible to draw the portion of the graph after t, because we do not yet know the decision d\\.",
        "The incremental specification of model structure means that we cannot use an undirected graphical model, such as Conditional Random Fields.",
        "With a directed dynamic model, all edges connecting the known portion of the graph to the unknown portion of the graph are directed toward the unknown portion.",
        "Also there are no variables in the unknown portion of the graph whose values are known (i.e. no visible variables), because at each step in a history-based model the decision probability is conditioned only on the parsing history.",
        "Only visible variables can result in information being reflected backward through a directed edge, so it is impossible for anything in the unknown portion of the graph to affect the probabilities in the known portion of the graph.",
        "Therefore inference can be performed by simply ignoring the unknown portion of the graph, and there is no need to sum over all possible structures for the unknown portion of the graph, as would be necessary for an undirected graphical model."

Variables whose value are given at the current decision (t, k) are shaded in figure 1, latent and output variables are left unshaded.",

        "This empirical result motivates research into more accurate approximations of dynamic SBNs.",
        "We focused in this paper on generative models of parsing.",
        "The results of such a generative model can be easily improved by a discriminative rerank-ing model, even without any additional feature engineering.",
        "For example, the discriminative training techniques successfully applied in (Henderson, 2004) to the feed-forward neural network model can be directly applied to the mean field model proposed in this paper.",
        "The same is true for rerank-ing with data-defined kernels, with which we would expect similar improvements as were achieved with the neural network parser (Henderson and Titov, 2005).",
        "Such improvements should situate the resulting model among the best current parsing models."
