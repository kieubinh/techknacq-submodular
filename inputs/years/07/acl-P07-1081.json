        "Transliteration is applied to proper nouns and out-",
        "Several transliteration methods are reported in the literature for a variety of languages, with their performance being evaluated on multilingual corpora.",
        "Source-target pairs are either extracted from bilingual documents or dictionaries (AbdulJaleel and Larkey, 2003; Bilac and Tanaka, 2005; Oh and Choi, 2006; Zelenko and Aone, 2006), or gathered explicitly from human transliterators (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002; Zelenko and Aone, 2006).",

        "Machine transliteration methods are divided into grapheme-based (AbdulJaleel and Larkey, 2003; Linden, 2005), phoneme-based (Jung et al., 2000; Virga and Khudanpur, 2003) and combined techniques (Bilac and Tanaka, 2005; Oh and Choi, 2006).",
        "Grapheme-based methods derive transformation rules for character combinations in the source text from a training data set, while phoneme-based methods use an intermediate phonetic transformation.",
        "In this paper, we use two grapheme-based methods for English to Persian transliteration.",
        "During a training phase, both methods derive rules for transforming character combinations (segments) in the source language into character combinations in the target language with some probability.",
        "During transliteration, the source word S' is segmented and rules are chosen and applied to each segment according to heuristics.",
        "The probability of a resulting word is the product of the probabilities of the applied rules.",
        "The result is a list of target words sorted by their associated probabilities, L'.",
        "The first system we use (SYS-1) is an n-gram approach that uses the last character of the previous source segment to condition the choice of the rule for the current source segment.",
        "This system has been shown to outperform other n-gram based methods for English to Persian transliteration (Karimi et al., 2006).",
        "The second system we employ (SYS-2) makes use of some explicit knowledge of our chosen language pair, English and Persian, and is also on the collapsed-vowel scheme presented by Karimi et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "In particular, it exploits the tendency for runs of English vowels to be collapsed into a single Persian character, or perhaps omitted from the Persian altogether.",
        "As such, segments are chosen based on surrounding consonants and vowels.",
        "The full details of this system are not important for this paper; here we focus on the performance evaluation of systems, not the systems themselves.",
        "In order to evaluate the list L' of target words produced by a transliteration system for source word s', a test corpus is constructed.",
        "The test corpus consists of a source word, S', and a list of possible target words {t'j}, where 1 < j < d', the number of distinct target words for source word s'.",
        "Associated with each t' j is a count n' j which is the number of human transliterators who transliterated s' into t'j.",
        "Often the test corpus is a proportion of a larger corpus, the remainder of which has been used for training the system's rule base.",
        "In this work we adopt the standard tenfold cross validation technique for all of our results, where 90% of a corpus is used for training and 10% for testing.",
        "The process is repeated ten times, and the mean result taken.",
        "Forthwith, we use the term corpus to refer to the single corpus from which both training and test sets are drawn in this fashion.",
        "Once the corpus is decided upon, a metric to measure the system's accuracy is required.",
        "The appropriate metric depends on the scenario in which the transliteration system is to be used.",
        "For example, in a machine translation application where only one target word can be inserted in the text to represent a source word, it is important that the word at the top of the system generated list of target words (by definition the most probable) is one of the words generated by a human in the corpus.",
        "More formally, the first word generated for source word S', L'1, must be one of t'j, 1 < j < d'.",
        "It may even be desirable that this is the target word most commonly used for this source word; that is, L\\ = t'j such that > nk, for all 1 < k < d'.",
        "Alternately, in a CLIR application, all variants of a source word might be required.",
        "For example, if a user searches for an English term \"Tom\" in Persian documents, the search engine should try and locate documents that contain both \"j»b\" (3 letters: o-!-j») and 'V\"(2 letters: o-{»), two possible transliterations of \"Tom\" that would be generated by human transliterators.",
        "In this case, a metric that counts the number of t j that appear in the top d elements of the system generated list, L , might be appropriate.",
        "In this paper we focus on the \"Top-1\" case, where it is important for the most probable target word generated by the system, L1 to be either the most popular t'j (labeled the Majority, with ties broken arbitrarily), or just one of the t'j's (labeled Un'form because all possible transliterations are equally rewarded).",
        "A third scheme (labeled We'ghted) is also possible where the reward for t'j appearing as L'1is n'j / X/= 1 n'j; here, each target word is given a weight proportional to how often a human translit-erator chose that target word.",
        "Due to space considerations, we focus on the first two variants only.",
        "In general, there are two commonly used metrics for transliteration evaluation: word accuracy (WA) and character accuracy (CA) (Hall and Dowl-ing, 1980).",
        "In all of our experiments, CA based metrics closely mirrored WA based metrics, and so conclusions drawn from the data would be the same whether WA metrics or CA metrics were used.",
        "Hence we only discuss and report WA based metrics in this paper.",
        "For each source word in the test corpus of K words, word accuracy calculates the percentage of correctly transliterated terms.",
        "Hence for the majority case, where every source word in the corpus only has one target word, the word accuracy is defined as and for the Un'form case, where every target variant is included with equal weight in the corpus, the word accuracy is defined as",
        "To evaluate the level of agreement between translit-erators, we use an agreement measure based on Mun and Eye (2004).",
        "For any source word s', there are d' different transliterations made by the n' human translitera-tors (n = Xf= 1 n'j, where n'j is the number of times source word s' was transliterated into target word t' j).",
        "When any two transliterators agree on the same target word, there are two agreements being made: transliterator one agrees with transliterator two, and vice versa.",
        "In general, therefore, the total number of agreements made on source word s' is Xd/= 1 n'j (n'j – 1).",
        "Hence the total number of actual agreements made on the entire corpus of K words is",
        "Aact = XX n'j (n'j – 1).",
        "The total number of possible agreements (that is, when all human transliterators agree on a single target word for each source word), is",
        "Aposs = X n(n – 1).",
        "The proportion of overall agreement is therefore",

        "Five hundred ofthese names also appeared in lists of names on Arabic Web sites, and five hundred on Dutch name lists.",

        "Figure 1 shows the values of UWA and MWA for E7, A7, D7 and EDA7 using the two transliteration systems.",
        "Immediately obvious is that varying the corpora (x-axis) results in different values for word accuracy, whether by the UWA or MWA method.",
        "For example, if you chose to evaluate SYS-2 with the UWA metric on the D7 corpus, you would obtain a result of 82%, but if you chose to evaluate it with the A7 corpus you would receive a result of only 73%.",
        "This makes comparing systems that report results obtained on different corpora very difficult.",
        "Encouragingly, however, SYS-2 consistently outperforms the SYS-1 on all corpora for both metrics except MWA on E7.",
        "This implies that ranking system performance on the same corpus most likely yields a system ranking that is transferable to other corpora.",
        "To further investigate this, we randomly extracted 100 corpora of 500 word pairs from EDA7 and ran the two systems on them and evaluated the results using both MWA and UWA.",
        "Both of the measures ranked the systems consistently using all these corpora (Figure 2).",
        "As expected, the UWA metric is consistently higher than the MWA metric; it allows for the top transliteration to appear in any of the possible variants for that word in the corpus, unlike the MWA metric which insists upon a single target word.",

        "For E7, the range of accuracies achieved is high when only two or three translitera-tors are involved, ranging from 37.0% to 50.6% in SYS-2 method and from 33.8% to 48.0% in SYS-1 (not shown) when only two transliterators' data are available.",
        "When more than three transliterators are used, the range ofperformance is noticeably smaller.",
        "Hence if at least four transliterators are used, then it is more likely that a system's MWA will be stable.",
        "This finding is supported by Papineni et al.",
        "(2002) who recommend that four people should be used for collecting judgments for machine translation experiments.",

        "The D7 collection does not show any stable results until at least six transliterator's are used.",
        "The results indicate that creating a collection used for the evaluation of transliteration systems, based on a \"gold standard\" created by only one human transliterator may lead to word accuracy results that could show a 10% absolute difference compared to results on a corpus derived using a different transliterator.",
        "This is evidenced by the leftmost box in each panel of the figure which has a wide range of results.",
        "Figure 4 shows this box in more detail for each collection, plotting the word accuracy for each user for all sub-corpora for SYS-2.",
        "The accuracy achieved varies significantly between transliterators; for example, for E7 collections, word accuracy varies from 37.2% for T1 to 50.0% for T5.",
        "This variance is more obvious for the D7 dataset where the difference ranges from 23.2% for T1 to 56.2% for T3.",
        "Origin language also has an effect: accuracy for the Arabic collection (A7) is generally less than that of English (E7).",
        "The Dutch collection (D7), shows an unstable trend across transliterators.",
        "In other words, accuracy differs in a narrower range for Arabic and English, but in wider range for Dutch.",
        "This is likely due to the fact that most transliterators found Dutch a difficult language to work with, as reported in Table 1.",
        "To investigate the effect of invididual transliterator consistency on system accuracy, we consider the number of Persian characters used by each transliter-ator on each sub-corpus, and the average number of rules generated by S YS-2 on the ten training sets derived in the tenfold cross validation process, which are shown in Table 2.",
        "For example, when transliterating words from E7 into Persian, T3 only ever used 21 out of 32 characters available in the Persian alphabet; T7, on the other hand, used 24 different Persian characters.",
        "It is expected that an increase in number of characters or rules provides more \"noise\" for the automated system, hence may lead to lower accuracy.",
        "Superficially the opposite seems true for rules: the mean number of rules generated by SYS-2 is much higher for the EDA7 corpus than for the A7corpus, and yet Figure 1 shows that word accuracy is higher on the EDA7 corpus.",
        "A correlation test, however, reveals that there is no significant relationship between either the number of characters used, nor the number of rules generated, and the resulting word accuracy of SYS-2 (Spearman correlation, p = 0.09 (characters) and p = 0.98 (rules)).",
        "A better indication of \"noise\" in the corpus may be given by the consistency with which a translit-erator applies a certain rule.",
        "For example, a large number of rules generated from a particular translit-erator's corpus may not be problematic if many of the rules get applied with a low probability.",
        "If, on the other hand, there were many rules with approximately equal probabilities, the system may have difficulty distinguishing when to apply some rules, and not others.",
        "One way to quantify this effect is to compute the self entropy of the rule distribution for each segment in the corpus for an individual.",
        "If pi j is the probability of applying rule 1 < j < m when confronted with source segment i, then Hi = – Y!j=1 pij log2 pij is the entropy of the probability distribution for that rule.",
        "H is maximized when the probabilities pi j are all equal, and minimized when the probabilities are very skewed (Shannon, 1948).",
        "As an example, consider the rules: t – <o,0.5 >, t -xJe.,0.3 > and t – <i,0.2 >; for which Ht = 0.79.",
        "The expected entropy can be used to obtain a single entropy value over the whole corpus, where Hi is the entropy of the rule probabilities for segment i, R is the total number of segments, fi is the frequency with which segment i occurs at any position in all source words in the corpus, and S is the sum of all fi.",
        "The expected entropy for each transliterator is shown in Figure 5, separated by corpus.",
        "Comparison of this graph with Figure 4 shows that generally transliterators that have used rules inconsistently generate a corpus that leads to low accuracy for the systems.",
        "For example, T1 who has the lowest accuracy for all the collections in both methods, also has the highest expected entropy of rules for all the collections.",
        "For the E7 collection, the maximum accuracy of 50.0%, belongs to T5 who has the minimum expected entropy.",
        "The same applies to the D7 collection, where the maximum accuracy of 56.2% and the minimum expected entropy both belong to T3.",
        "These observations are confirmed by a statistically significant Spearman correlation between expected rule entropy and word accuracy (r = – 0.54,p = 0.003).",
        "Therefore, the consistency with which transliterators employ their own internal rules in developing a corpus has a direct effect on system performance measures.",
        "Here we present various agreement proportions (PA from Section 2.2), which give a measure of consistency in the corpora across all users, as opposed to the entropy measure which gives a consistency measure for a single user.",
        "For E7, PA was 33.6%, for A7 it was 33.3% and for D7, agreement was 15.5%.",
        "In general, humans agree less than 33% of the time when transliterating English to Persian.",
        "In addition, we examined agreement among transliterators based on their perception of the task difficulty shown in Table 1.",
        "For A7, agreement among those who found the task easy was higher (22.3%) than those who found it in medium level (18.8%).",
        "Pa is 12.0% for those who found the D7 collection hard to transliterate; while the six transliterators who found the E7 collection difficulty medium had Pa = 30.2%.",
        "Hence, the harder participants rated the transliteration task, the lower the agreement scores tend to be for the derived corpus.",
        "Finally, in Table 3 we show word accuracy results for the two systems on corpora derived from translit-erators grouped by perceived level of difficulty on A7.",
        "It is readily apparent that SYS-2 outperforms S YS-1 on the corpus comprised of human transliterations from people who saw the task as easy with both word accuracy metrics; the relative improvement of over 50% is statistically significant (paired t-test on tenfold cross validation runs).",
        "However, on the corpus composed of transliterations that were perceived as more difficult, \"Medium\", the advantage of SYS-2 is significantly eroded, but is still statistically significant for UWA.",
        "Here again, using only one transliteration, MWA, did not distinguish the performance of each system."

        "Some past studies do not use more than a single target word for every source word in the corpus (Bilac and Tanaka, 2005; Oh and Choi, 2006).",
        "Our results indicate that it is unlikely that these results would translate onto a corpus other than the one used in these studies, except in rare cases where human transliterators are in 100% agreement for a given language pair.",
        "Given the nature of the English language, an English corpus can contain English words from a variety of different origins.",
        "In this study we have used English words from an Arabic and Dutch origin to show that word accuracy of the systems can vary by up to 25% (in absolute terms) depending on the origin of English words in the corpus, as demonstrated in Figure 1.",

        "vestigated the transliterator's perception of difficulty of the transliteration task with the ensuing word accuracy of the systems.",
        "Interestingly, when using corpora built from transliterators that perceive the task to be easy, there is a large difference in the word accuracy between the two systems, but on corpora built from transliterators who perceive the task to be more difficult, the gap between the systems narrows.",
        "Hence, a corpus applied for evaluation of transliteration should either be made carefully with translit-erators with a variety of backgrounds, or should be large enough and be gathered from various sources so as to simulate different expectations of its expected non-homogeneous users.",
        "The self entropy of rule probability distributions derived by the automated transliteration system can be used to measure the consistency with which individual transliterators apply their own rules in constructing a corpus.",
        "It was demonstrated that when systems are evaluated on corpora built by transliter-ators who are less consistent in their application of transliteration rules, word accuracy is reduced.",
        "Given the large variations in system accuracy that are demonstrated by the varying corpora used in this study, we recommend that extreme care be taken when constructing corpora for evaluating transliteration systems.",
        "Studies should also give details oftheir corpora that would allow any of the effects observed in this paper to be taken into account."
