        "In each of these examples, a similarity measure can make use of the recurrent substring pairings that reliably occur between words having the same meaning.",
        "Across natural languages, these recurrent substring correspondences are found in word pairs known as cognates: words with a common form and meaning across languages.",
        "Cognates arise either from words in a common ancestor language (e.g. light/Licht, night/Nacht in English/German) or from foreign word borrowings (e.g. trampo-line/toranporin in English/Japanese).",

        "The most well-known measure of the similarity of two strings is the Edit Distance or Lev-enshtein Distance (Levenshtein, 1966): the number of insertions, deletions and substitutions required to transform one string into another.",
        "In our experiments, we use Normalized Edit Distance (NED): Edit Distance divided by the length of the longer word.",
        "Other popular measures include Dice's Coefficient (DICE) (Adamson and Boreham, 1974), and the length-normalized measures Longest Common Subsequence Ratio (LCSR) (Melamed, 1999), and Longest Common Prefix Ratio (PREFIX) (Kondrak, 2005).",
        "These baseline approaches have the important advantage of not requiring training data.",
        "We can also include in the non-learning category Kon-drak (2005)'s Longest Common Subsequence Formula (LCSF), a probabilistic measure designed to mitigate LCSR's preference for shorter words.",
        "Although simple to use, the untrained measures cannot adapt to the specific spelling differences between a pair of languages.",
        "Researchers have therefore investigated adaptive measures that are learned from a set of known cognate pairs.",
        "Ristad and Yiani-los (1998) developed a stochastic transducer version of Edit Distance learned from unaligned string pairs.",
        "Mann and Yarowsky (2001) saw little improvement over Edit Distance when applying this transducer to cognates, even when filtering the transducer's probabilities into different weight classes to better approximate Edit Distance.",
        "Tiedemann (1999) used various measures to learn the recurrent spelling changes between English and Swedish, and used these changes to re-weight LCSR to identify more cognates, with modest performance improvements.",
        "Mulloni and Pekar (2006) developed a similar technique to improve NED for English/German.",
        "Essentially, all these techniques improve on the baseline approaches by using a set of positive (true) cognate pairs to re-weight the costs of edit operations or the score of sequence matches.",
        "Ideally, we would prefer a more flexible approach that can learn positive or negative weights on substring pairings in order to better identify related strings.",
        "One system that can potentially provide this flexibility is a discriminative string-similarity approach to named-entity transliteration by Klementiev and Roth (2006).",
        "Although not compared to other similarity measures in the original paper, we show that this discriminative technique can strongly outperform traditional methods on cognate identification.",
        "Unlike many recent generative systems, the Kle-mentiev and Roth approach does not exploit the known positions in the strings where the characters match.",
        "For example, Brill and Moore (2000) combine a character-based alignment with the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to develop an improved probabilistic error model for spelling correction.",
        "Rappoport and Levent-Levi (2006) apply this approach to learn substring correspondences for cognates.",
        "Zelenko and Aone (2006) recently showed a Klementiev and Roth (2006)-style discriminative approach to be superior to alignment-based generative techniques for name transliteration.",

        "This example also highlights the limitations ofthe Klementiev and Roth approach.",
        "The learner can provide weight to features like s-s or s-st at the beginning of the word, but because of the gradual accumulation of positional differences, the learner never sees the tor-tr and es-es correspondences that really help indicate the words are cognate.",
        "Our solution is to use the minimum-edit-distance alignment of the two strings as the basis for feature extraction, rather than the positional correspondences.",

        "A similar use of the term \"phrase\" exists in machine translation, where phrases are often pairs of word sequences consistent with word-based alignments (Koehn et al., 2003).",

        "The trendline suggests a bimodal distribution, with two distinct distributions of translation pairs making up the dictionary: incidental letter agreement gives low LCSR for the larger, non-cognate portion and high LCSR characterizes the likely cognates.",
        "A threshold of 0.58 captures most of the cognate distribution while excluding non-cognate pairs.",

        "We performed error analysis by looking at all the pairs our system scored quite confidently (highly positive or highly negative similarity), but which were labelled oppositely.",
        "Highly-scored false positives arose equally from 1) actual cognates not linked as translations in the data, 2) related words with diverged meanings, e.g. the error in Table 5: makaroni in Greek actually means spaghetti in English, and 3) the same word stem, a different part of speech (e.g. the Greek/English adjective/noun synonymos:synonym).",

        "Thus the errors that our system makes are often either linguistically interesting or point out mistakes in our automatically-labelled bitext and (to a lesser extent) dictionary data."

        "In particular, we plan to investigate approaches that do not require the bilingual dictionaries or bitexts to generate training data.",
        "For example, researchers have automatically developed translation lexicons by seeing if words from each language have similar frequencies, contexts (Koehn and Knight, 2002), bursti-ness, inverse document frequencies, and date distributions (Schafer and Yarowsky, 2002).",
        "Semantic and string similarity might be learned jointly with a co-training or bootstrapping approach (Klementiev and Roth, 2006).",
        "We may also compare alignment-based discriminative string similarity with a more complex discriminative model that learns the alignments as latent structure (McCallum et al., 2005)."
