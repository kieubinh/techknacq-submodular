        "Two main approaches exist for compiling corpora: \"Big is beautiful\" or \"Insecurity in large collections\".",
        "Text mining research commonly adopts the first approach and favors data quantity over quality.",
        "This is normally justified on the one hand by the need for large amounts of data in order to make use of statistic or stochastic methods (Manning and Schütze, 1999), and on the other by the lack of operational methods to automatize the building of a corpus answering to selected criteria, such as domain, register, media, style or discourse.",
        "For lexical alignment from comparable corpora, good results on single words can be obtained from large corpora – several millions words – the accuracy of proposed translation is about 80% for the top 10-20 candidates (Fung, 1998; Rapp, 1999; Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002).",
        "(Cao and Li, 2002) have achieved 91% accuracy for the top three candidates using the Web as a comparable corpus.",
        "But for specific domains, and many pairs of languages, such huge corpora are not available.",
        "More importantly, as terms are defined vis-à-vis a specific domain with a restricted register, it is expected that the quality rather than the quantity of the corpus matters more in terminology mining.",
        "For terminology mining, therefore, our hypothesis is that the quality of the corpora is more important than the quantity and that this ensures the quality of the acquired terminological resources.",
        "Comparable corpora are \"sets of texts in different languages, that are not translations of each other\" (Bowker and Pearson, 2002, p. 93).",
        "The term comparable is used to indicate that these texts share some characteristics or features: topic, period, media, author, register (Biber, 1994), discourse...",
        "This corpus comparability is discussed by lexical alignment researchers but never demonstrated: it is often reduced to a specific domain, such as the medical (Chiao and Zweigenbaum, 2002) or financial domains (Fung, 1998), or to a register, such as newspaper articles (Fung, 1998).",
        "For terminology mining, the comparability of the corpus should be based on the domain or the sub-domaine, but also on the type of discourse.",
        "Indeed, discourse acts semantically upon the lexical units.",
        "For a defined topic, some terms are specific to one discourse or another.",
        "For example, for French, within the subdomain of obesity in the domain of medicine, we find the term excès de poids (overweight) only inside texts sharing a popular science discourse, and the synonym excès pondéral (overweight) only in scientific discourse.",
        "In order to evaluate how important the discourse criterion is for building bilingual terminological lists, we carried out experiments on French-Japanese comparable corpora in the domain of medicine, more precisely on the topic of diabetes and nutrition, using texts collected from the Web and manually selected and classified into two discourse categories: one contains only scientific documents and the other contains both scientific and popular science documents.",
        "We used a state-of-the-art multilingual terminology mining chain composed of two term extraction programs, one in each language, and an alignment program.",
        "The term extraction programs are publicly available and both extract multi-word terms that are more precise and specific to a particular scientific domain than single word terms.",
        "The alignment program makes use of the direct context-vector approach (Fung, 1998; Peters and Picchi, 1998; Rapp, 1999) slightly modified to handle both single-and multi-word terms.",
        "We evaluated the candidate translations of multi-word terms using a reference list compiled from publicly available resources.",
        "We found that taking discourse type into account resulted in candidate translations of a better quality even when the corpus size is reduced by half.",
        "Thus, even using a state-of-the-art alignment method well-known as data greedy, we reached the conclusion that the quantity of data is not sufficient to obtain a terminological list of high quality and that a real comparability of corpora is required."

        "The patterns are expressed using part-of-speech tags: for French, Brill's POS tagger and the FLEM lemmatiser are utilised, and for Japanese, CHASEN.",
        "For French, the main patterns are N N, N Prep N et N Adj and for Japanese, N N, N Suff, Adj N and Pref N. The variants handled are morphological for both languages, syntactical only for French, and compounding only for Japanese.",
        "We consider as a morphological variant a morphological modification of one of the components of the base form, as a syntactical variant the insertion of another word into the components of the base form, and as a compounding variant the agglutination of another word to one of the components of the base form.",

        "The lexical alignment program adapts the direct context-vector approach proposed by (Fung, 1998) for single-word terms (SWTs) to multi-word terms (MWTs).",
        "It aligns source MWTs with target single words, SWTs or MWTs.",
        "From now on, we will refer to lexical units as words, SWTs or MWTs.",
        "Our implementation of the direct context-vector method consists of the following 4 steps:",
        "1.",
        "We collect all the lexical units in the context of each lexical unit and count their occurrence frequency in a window of n words around i.",
        "For each lexical unit of the source and the target language, we obtain a context vector which gathers the set of co-occurrence units associated with the number of times that j and % occur together .",
        "We normalise context vectors using an association score such as Mutual Information or Log-likelihood.",
        "In order to reduce the arity of context vectors, we keep only the co-occurrences with the highest association scores.",
        "2.",
        "Using a bilingual dictionary, we translate the lexical units of the source context vector.",
        "3.",
        "For a word to be translated, we compute the similarity between the translated context vector and all target vectors through vector distance measures such as Cosine (Salton and Lesk, 1968) or Jaccard (Tanimoto, 1958).",
        "4.",
        "The candidate translations of a lexical unit are the target lexical units closest to the translated context vector according to vector distance.",
        "The translation of the lexical units of the context vectors, which depends on the coverage of the bilingual dictionary vis-à-vis the corpus, is an important step of the direct approach: more elements of the context vector are translated more the context vector will be discrimating for selecting translations in the target language.",
        "If the bilingual dictionary provides several translations for a lexical unit, we consider all of them but weight the different translations by their frequency in the target language.",
        "If an MWT cannot be directly translated, we generate possible translations by using a compositional method (Grefenstette, 1999).",
        "For each element of the MWT found in the bilingual dictionary, we generate all the translated combinations identified by the term extraction program.",
        "For example, in the case of the MWT fatigue chronique (chronic fatigue), we have the following four translations for fatigue: Htl,",
        ", and the following two translations for chronique: i2l|l#$i, 'BtfÊ.",
        "Next, we generate all combinations of translated elements (See Table 1) and select those which refer to an existing MWT in the target language.",
        "Here, only one term has been identified by the Japanese terminology extraction program: .",
        ".",
        "In this approach, when it is not possible to translate all parts of an MWT, or when the translated combinations are not identified by the term extraction program, the MWT is not taken into account in the translation process.",
        "This approach differs from that used by (Ro-bitaille et al., 2006) for French/Japanese translation.",
        "They first decompose the French MWT into combinations of shorter multi-word units (MWU) elements.",
        "This approach makes the direct translation of a subpart of the MWT possible if it is present in the bilingual dictionary.",
        "For an MWT of length , (Ro-bitaille et al., 2006) produce all the combinations of MWU elements of a length less than or equal to .",
        "For example, the French term syndrome de fatigue chronique (chronic fatigue disease) yields the following four combinations: i) syndrome de fatigue chronique , ii) syndrome de fatigue chronique , iii) [syndrome] fatigue chronique] and iv) [syndrome] fatigue chronique .",

        "These constraints prevented us from obtaining 100 French SWTs and MWTs for lexicon 2.",
