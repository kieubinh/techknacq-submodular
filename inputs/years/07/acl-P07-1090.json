        "The focus of this paper is on function words, a class of words with little intrinsic meaning but is vital in expressing grammatical relationships among words within a sentence.",
        "Such encoded grammatical information, often implicit, makes function words pivotal in modeling structural divergences, as projecting them in different languages often result in longrange structural changes to the realized sentences.",
        "Just as a foreign language learner often makes mistakes in using function words, we observe that current machine translation (MT) systems often perform poorly in ordering function words' arguments; lexically correct translations often end up reordered incorrectly.",
        "Thus, we are interested in modeling the structural divergence encoded by such function words.",
        "A key finding of our work is that modeling the ordering of the dependent arguments of function words results in better translation quality.",
        "Most current systems use statistical knowledge obtained from corpora in favor of rich natural language knowledge.",
        "Instead of using syntactic knowledge to determine function words, we approximate this by equating the most frequent words as function words.",
        "By explicitly modeling phrase ordering around these frequent words, we aim to capture the most important and prevalent ordering productions."

        "A good translation should be both faithful with adequate lexical choice to the source language and fluent in its word ordering to the target language.",
        "In pursuit of better translation, phrase-based models (Och and Ney, 2004) have significantly improved the quality over classical word-based models (Brown et al., 1993).",
        "These multiword phrasal units contribute to fluency by inherently capturing intra-phrase reordering.",
        "However, despite this progress, interphrase reordering (especially long distance ones) still poses a great challenge to statistical machine translation (SMT).",
        "The basic phrase reordering model is a simple unlexicalized, context-insensitive distortion penalty model (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "This model assumes little or no structural divergence between language pairs, preferring the original, translated order by penalizing reordering.",
        "This simple model works well when properly coupled with a well-trained language model, but is otherwise impoverished without any lexical evidence to characterize the reordering.",
        "To address this, lexicalized context-sensitive models incorporate contextual evidence.",
        "The local prediction model (Tillmann and Zhang, 2005) models structural divergence as the relative position between the translation of two neighboring phrases.",
        "Other further generalizations of orientation include the global prediction model (Nagata et al., 2006) and distortion model (Al-Onaizan and Papineni, 2006).",
        "However, these models are often fully lexicalized and sensitive to individual phrases.",
        "As a result, they are not robust to unseen phrases.",
        "A careful approximation is vital to avoid data sparseness.",
        "Proposals to alleviate this problem include utilizing bilingual phrase cluster or words at the phrase boundary (Na-gata et al., 2006) as the phrase identity.",
        "The benefit of introducing lexical evidence without being fully lexicalized has been demonstrated by a recent state-of-the-art formally syntax-based model, Hiero (Chiang, 2005).",
        "Hiero performs phrase ordering by using linked non-terminal symbols in its synchronous CFG production rules coupled with lexical evidence.",
        "However, since it is difficult to specify a well-defined rule, Hiero has to rely on weak heuristics (i.e., length-based thresholds) to extract rules.",
        "As a result, Hiero produces grammars of enormous size.",
        "Watanabe et al.",
        "(2006) further reduces the grammar's size by enforcing all rules to comply with Greibach Normal Form.",
        "Taking the lexicalization an intuitive a step forward, we propose a novel, finer-grained solution which models the content and context information encoded by function words - approximated by high frequency words.",
        "Inspired by the success of syntax-based approaches, we propose a synchronous grammar that accommodates gapping production rules, while focusing on the statistical modeling in relation to function words.",
        "We refer to our approach as the Function Word-centered Syntax-based approach (FWS).",
        "Our FWS approach is different from Hiero in two key aspects.",
        "First, we use only a small set of high frequency lexical items to lexi-calize non-terminals in the grammar.",
        "This results in a much smaller set of rules compared to Hiero,",
        "a form is a coll.",
        "of data entry fields on a page Figure 1: A Chinese-English sentence pair.",
        "greatly reducing the computational overhead that arises when moving from phrase-based to syntax-based approach.",
        "Furthermore, by modeling only high frequency words, we are able to obtain reliable statistics even in small datasets.",
        "Second, as opposed to Hiero, where phrase ordering is done implicitly alongside phrase translation and lexical weighting, we directly model the reordering process using orientation statistics.",
        "The FWS approach is also akin to (Xiong et al., 2006) in using a synchronous grammar as a reordering constraint.",
        "Instead of using Inversion Transduction Grammar (ITG) (Wu, 1997) directly, we will discuss an ITG extension to accommodate gapping."

        "We use the following Chinese (c) to English (e) translation in Fig.1 as an illustration to conduct an inquiry to the problem.",
        "Note that the sentence translation requires some translations of English words to be ordered far from their original position in Chinese.",
        "Recovering the correct English ordering requires the inversion of the Chinese postpositional phrase, followed by the inversion of the first smaller noun phrase, and finally the inversion of the second larger noun phrase.",
        "Nevertheless, the correct ordering can be recovered if the position and the semantic roles of the arguments of the boxed function words were known.",
        "Such a function word centered approach also hinges on knowing the correct phrase boundaries for the function words' arguments and which reorderings are given precedence, in case of conflicts.",
        "We propose modeling these sources of knowledge using a statistical formalism.",
        "It includes 1) a model to capture bilingual orientations of the left and right arguments of these function words; 2) a model to approximate correct reordering sequence; and 3) a model for finding constituent boundaries of the left and right arguments.",
        "Assuming that the most frequent words in a language are function words, we can apply orientation statistics associated with these words to reorder their adjacent left and right neighbors.",
        "We follow the notation in (Nagata et al., 2006) and define the following bilingual orientation values given two neighboring source (Chinese) phrases: Monotone-Adjacent (MA); Reverse-Adjacent (RA); Monotone-Gap (MG); and ReverseGap (RG).",
        "The first clause (monotone, reverse) indicates whether the target language translation order follows the source order; the second (adjacent, gap) indicates whether the source phrases are adjacent or separated by an intervening phrase on the target side.",
        "Table 1 shows the orientation statistics for several function words.",
        "Note that we separate the statistics for left and right arguments to account for differences in argument structures: some function words take a single argument (e.g., prepositions), while others take two or more (e.g., copulas).",
        "To handle other reordering decisions not explicitly encoded (i.e., lexicalized) in our FWS model, we introduce a universal token U, to be used as a backoff statistic when function words are absent.",
        "For example, orientation statistics for j (to be) overwhelmingly suggests that the English translation of its surrounding phrases is identical to its Chinese ordering.",
        "This reflects the fact that the arguments of copulas in both languages are realized in the same order.",
        "The orientation statistics for postposition _h (on) suggests inversion which captures the divergence between Chinese postposition to the English preposition.",
        "Similarly, the dominant orientation for particle ^ (of) suggests the noun-phrase shift from modified-modifier to modifier-modified, which is common when translating Chinese noun phrases to English.",
        "Taking all parts of the model, which we detail later, together with the knowledge in Table 1, we demonstrate the steps taken to translate the example in Fig. 2.",
        "We highlight the function words with boxed characters and encapsulate content words as indexed symbols.",
        "As shown, orientation statistics from function words alone are adequate to recover the English ordering - in practice, content words also influence the reordering through a language model.",
