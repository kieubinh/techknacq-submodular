        "Statistical machine translation (Brown et al., 1993) has seen many improvements in recent years, most notably the transition from word-to phrase-based models (Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "Modern SMT systems are capable of producing high quality translations when provided with large quantities of training data.",
        "With only a small training sample, the translation output is often inferior to the output from using larger corpora because the translation algorithm must rely on more sparse estimates of phrase frequencies and must also 'back-off' to smaller sized phrases.",
        "This often leads to poor choices of target phrases and reduces the coherence ofthe output.",
        "Unfortunately, parallel corpora are not readily available in large quantities, except for a small subset of the world's languages (see Resnik and Smith (2003) for discussion), therefore limiting the potential use of current SMT systems.",
        "In this paper we provide a means for obtaining more reliable translation frequency estimates from small datasets.",
        "We make use of multi-parallel corpora (sentence aligned parallel texts over three or more languages).",
        "Such corpora are often created by international organisations, the United Nations (UN) being a prime example.",
        "They present a challenge for current SMT systems due to their relatively moderate size and domain variability (examples of UN texts include policy documents, proceedings of meetings, letters, etc.).",
        "Our method translates each target phrase, t, first to an intermediate language, i, and then into the source language, s. We call this two-stage translation process triangulation (Kay, 1997).",
        "We present a probabilistic formulation through which we can estimate the desired phrase translation distribution (phrase-table) by marginalisation, p(s|t) = ^;p(s, i|t).",
        "As with conventional smoothing methods (Koehn et al., 2003; Foster et al., 2006), triangulation increases the robustness of phrase translation estimates.",
        "In contrast to smoothing, our method alleviates data sparseness by exploring additional multiparallel data rather than adjusting the probabilities of existing data.",
        "Importantly, triangulation provides us with separately estimated phrase-tables which could be further smoothed to provide more reliable distributions.",
        "Moreover, the triangulated phrase-tables can be easily combined with the standard source-target phrase-table, thereby improving the coverage over unseen source phrases.",
        "As an example, consider Figure 1 which shows the coverage of unigrams and larger n-gram phrases when using a standard source target phrase-table, a triangulated phrase-table with one (it) and nine languages (all), and a combination of standard and triangulated phrase-tables (all+standard).",
        "The phrases were harvested from a small French-English bitext and evaluated against a test set.",
        "Although very few small phrases are unknown, the majority of larger phrases are unseen.",
        "The Italian and all results show that triangulation alone can provide similar or improved coverage compared to the standard source-target model; further improvement is achieved by combining the triangulated and standard models (all+standard).",
        "These models and datasets will be described in detail in Section 3.",
        "We also demonstrate that triangulation can be used on its own, that is without a source-target distribution, and still yield acceptable translation output.",
        "This is particularly heartening, as it provides a means of translating between the many \"low density\" language pairs for which we don't yet have a source-target bitext.",
        "This allows SMT to be applied to a much larger set of language pairs than was previously possible.",
        "In the following section we provide an overview of related work.",
        "Section 3 introduces a generative formulation of triangulation.",
        "We present our evaluation framework in Section 4 and results in Section 5."

        "The idea of using multiple source languages for improving the translation quality of the target language dates back at least to Kay (1997), who observed that ambiguities in translating from one language onto another may be resolved if a translation into some third language is available.",
        "Systems which have used this notion of triangulation typically create several candidate sentential target translations for source sentences via different languages.",
        "A single translation is then selected by finding the candidate that yields the best overall score (Och and Ney, 2001; Utiyama and Isahara, 2007) or by co-training (Callison-Burch and Osborne, 2003).",
        "This ties in with recent work on ensemble combinations of SMT systems, which have used alignment techniques (Matusov et al., 2006) or simple heuristics (Eisele, 2005) to guide target sentence selection and generation.",
        "Beyond SMT, the use of an intermediate language as a translation aid has also found application in cross-lingual information retrieval (Gollins and Sanderson, 2001).",
        "Callison-Burch et al.",

        "guage, translating them into multiple target languages, and then back to the source.",
        "Unknown source phrases are substituted by the back-translated paraphrases and translation proceeds on the paraphrases.",
        "In line with previous work, we exploit multiple source corpora to alleviate data sparseness and increase translation coverage.",
        "However, we differ in several important respects.",
        "Our method operates over phrases rather than sentences.",
        "We propose a generative formulation which treats triangulation not as a post-processing step but as part of the translation model itself.",
        "The induced phrase-table entries are fed directly into the decoder, thus avoiding the additional inefficiencies of merging the output of several translation systems.",
        "Although related to Callison-Burch et al.",
        "(2006) our method is conceptually simpler and more general.",
        "Phrase-table entries are created via multiple source languages without the intermediate step of paraphrase extraction, thereby reducing the exposure to compounding errors.",
        "Our phrase-tables may well contain paraphrases but these are naturally induced as part of our model, without extra processing effort.",
        "Furthermore, we improve the translation estimates for both seen and unseen phrase-table entries, whereas Callison-Burch et al.",
        "concentrate solely on unknown phrases.",

        "Minimum error-rate training was not used for this experiment, or the next shown in Figure 5, in order to highlight the effect of the changing translation estimates.",
        "Romance languages (es, it, pt) give the best results, both on their own and when used together with the standard phrase-table (using uniform interpolation); Germanic languages (de, nl, da, sv) are a distant second, with the less related Greek and Finnish the least useful.",
        "Interpolation yields an improvement for all 'intermediate' languages, even Finnish, which has a very low score when used alone.",
        "The same experiment was repeated for en – de translation with similar trends, except that the Germanic languages outscored the Romance languages.",
        "These findings suggest that 'intermediate' languages which exhibit a high degree of similarity with the source or target language are desirable.",
        "We conjecture that this is a consequence of better automatic word alignments and a generally easier translation task, as well as a better preservation of information between aligned phrases.",

        "Comparative statistics of a standard and a triangulated phrase-table are given in Table 4.",
        "The coverage over source and target phrases is much higher in the standard table than the triangulated tables, which reflects the reduced ability of triangulation to extract large phrases – despite the large increase in the number of events.",
        "The table also shows the overlapping probability mass which measures the sum of probability in one table for which the events are present in the other.",
        "This shows that the majority of mass is shared by both tables (as joint distributions), although there are significant differences.",
