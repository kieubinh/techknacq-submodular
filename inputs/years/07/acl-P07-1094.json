        "Eisner, 2005).",
        "Nearly all of these approaches have one aspect in common: the goal of learning is to identify the set of model parameters that maximizes some objective function.",
        "Values for the hidden variables in the model are then chosen based on the learned parameterization.",
        "Here, we propose a different approach based on Bayesian statistical principles: rather than searching for an optimal set of parameter values, we seek to directly maximize the probability of the hidden variables given the observed data, integrating over all possible parameter values.",
        "Using part-of-speech (POS) tagging as an example application, we show that the Bayesian approach provides large performance improvements over maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) for the same model structure.",
        "Two factors can explain the improvement.",
        "First, integrating over parameter values leads to greater robustness in the choice of tag sequence, since it must have high probability over a range of parameters.",
        "Second, integration permits the use ofpriors favoring sparse distributions, which are typical of natural language.",
        "These kinds of priors can lead to degenerate solutions ifthe parameters are estimated directly.",
        "Before describing our approach in more detail, we briefly review previous work on unsupervised POS tagging.",
        "Perhaps the most well-known is that of Merialdo (1994), who used MLE to train a tri-gram hidden Markov model (HMM).",
        "More recent work has shown that improvements can be made by modifying the basic HMM structure (Banko and Moore, 2004), using better smoothing techniques or added constraints (Wang and Schuurmans, 2005), or using a discriminative model rather than an HMM (Smith and Eisner, 2005).",
        "Non-model-based approaches have also been proposed (Brill (1995); see also discussion in Banko and Moore (2004)).",
        "All of this work is really POS disambiguation: learning is strongly constrained by a dictionary listing the allowable tags for each word in the text.",
        "Smith and Eisner (2005) also present results using a diluted dictionary, where infrequent words may have any tag.",
        "Haghighi and Klein (2006) use a small list of labeled prototypes and no dictionary.",
        "A different tradition treats the identification of syntactic classes as a knowledge-free clustering problem.",
        "Distributional clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques are typically applied when linguistically meaningful classes are desired (Schütze, 1995; Clark, 2000; Finch et al., 1995); probabilistic models have been used to find classes that can improve smoothing and reduce perplexity (Brown et al., 1992; Saul and Pereira, 1997).",
        "Unfortunately, due to a lack of standard and informative evaluation techniques, it is difficult to compare the effectiveness of different clustering methods.",
        "In this paper, we hope to unify the problems of POS disambiguation and syntactic clustering by presenting results for conditions ranging from a full tag dictionary to no dictionary at all.",
        "We introduce the use of a new information-theoretic criterion, variation of information (Meila, 2002), which can be used to compare a gold standard clustering to the clustering induced from a tagger's output, regardless of the cluster labels.",
        "We also evaluate using tag accuracy when possible.",
        "Our system outperforms an HMM trained with MLE on both metrics in all circumstances tested, often by a wide margin.",
        "Its accuracy in some cases is close to that of Smith and Eisner's (2005) discriminative model.",
        "Our results show that the Bayesian approach is particularly useful when learning is less constrained, either because less evidence is available (corpus size is small) or because the dictionary contains less information.",
        "In the following section, we discuss the motivation for a Bayesian approach and present our model and search procedure.",
        "Section 3 gives results illustrating how the parameters of the prior affect results, and Section 4 describes how to infer a good choice of parameters from unlabeled data.",

        "In model-based approaches to unsupervised language learning, the problem is formulated in terms of identifying latent structure from data.",
        "We define a model with parameters 9, some observed variables w (the linguistic input), and some latent variables t (the hidden structure).",
        "The goal is to assign appropriate values to the latent variables.",
        "Standard approaches do so by selecting values for the model parameters, and then choosing the most probable variable assignment based on those parameters.",
        "For example, maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE) seeks parameters 9 such that where P(w| 9) = ^t P(w, t|9).",
        "Sometimes, a non-uniform prior distribution over is introduced, in which case 9 is the maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution for :",
        "The values of the latent variables are then taken to be those that maximize P(t| w, ).",
        "In contrast, the Bayesian approach we advocate in this paper seeks to identify a distribution over latent variables directly, without ever fixing particular values for the model parameters.",
        "The distribution over latent variables given the observed data is obtained by integrating over all possible values of :",
        "This distribution can be used in various ways, including choosing the MAP assignment to the latent variables, or estimating expected values for them.",
        "To see why integrating over possible parameter values can be useful when inducing latent structure, consider the following example.",
        "We are given a coin, which may be biased (t = 1) or fair (t = 0), each with probability .5.",
        "Let be the probability of heads.",
        "If the coin is biased, we assume a uniform distribution over 9, otherwise 9 = .5.",
        "We observe w, the outcomes of 10 coin flips, and we wish to determine whether the coin is biased (i.e. the value of t).",
        "Assume that we have a uniform prior on , with p(9) = 1 for all 9 e [0,1].",
        "First, we apply the standard methodology of finding the MAP estimate for and then selecting the value of t that maximizes P(t|w, 9).",
        "In this case, an elementary calculation shows that the MAP estimate is 9 = nH /10, where nH is the number of heads in w (likewise, nT is the number of tails).",
        "Consequently, P (t|w, 9) favors t = 1 for any sequence that does not contain exactly five heads, and assigns equal probability to t = 1 and t = 0 for any sequence that does contain exactly five heads – a counterintuitive result.",
        "In contrast, using some standard results in Bayesian analysis we can show that applying Equation 3 yields which is significantly less than .5 when nH = 5, and only favors t = 1 for sequences where nH > 8 or nH < 2.",
        "This intuitively sensible prediction results from the fact that the Bayesian approach is sensitive to the robustness of a choice of t to the value of , as illustrated in Figure 1.",
        "Even though a sequence with nH = 6 yields a MAP estimate of 9 = 0.6 (Figure 1 (a)), P(t = 1|w,9) is only greater than 0.5 for a small range of around (Figure 1 (b)), meaning that the choice of t = 1 is not very robust to variation in 9.",
        "In contrast, a sequence with nH = 8 favors t = 1 for a wide range of around .",
        "By integrating over , Equation 3 takes into account the consequences of possible variation in .",
        "Another advantage of integrating over is that it permits the use of linguistically appropriate priors.",
        "In many linguistic models, including HMMs, the distributions over variables are multinomial.",
        "For a multinomial with parameters 9 = (9i,..., 9K), a natural choice of prior is the K-dimensional Dirich-let distribution, which is conjugate to the multinomial.",
        "For simplicity, we initially assume that all K parameters (also known as hyperparameters) of the Dirichlet distribution are equal to //, i.e. the Dirichlet is symmetric.",
        "The value of // determines which parameters will have high probability: when / = 1 , all parameter values are equally likely; when // > 1, multinomials that are closer to uniform are",

        "preferred; and when // < 1, high probability is assigned to sparse multinomials, where one or more parameters are at or near 0.",
        "Typically, linguistic structures are characterized by sparse distributions (e.g., POS tags are followed with high probability by only a few other tags, and have highly skewed output distributions).",
        "Consequently, it makes sense to use a Dirichlet prior with // < 1.",
        "However, as noted by Johnson et al.",
        "(2007), this choice of // leads to difficulties with MAP estimation.",
        "For a sequence of draws x = (x1;..., xn) from a multinomial distribution with observed counts n1;..., nK, a symmetric Dirichlet(//) prior over 9 yields the MAP estimate 9k = ™+K(i3~-i) ■ When / > 1 , standard MLE techniques such as EM can be used to find the MAP estimate simply by adding \"pseudocounts\" of size // – 1 to each of the expected counts nk at each iteration.",
        "However, when / < 1 , the values of that set one or more of the 9k equal to 0 can have infinitely high posterior probability, meaning that MAP estimation can yield degenerate solutions.",
        "If, instead of estimating , we integrate over all possible values, we no longer encounter such difficulties.",

        "Note that, by integrating out the parameters t and w, we induce dependencies between the variables in the model.",
        "The probability of generating a particular trigram tag sequence (likewise, output) depends on the number of times that sequence (output) has been generated previously.",
        "Importantly, trigrams (and outputs) remain exchangeable: the probability of a set of trigrams (outputs) is the same regardless of the order in which it was generated.",
        "The property of exchangeability is crucial to the inference algorithm we describe next.",
        "To perform inference in our model, we use Gibbs sampling (Geman and Geman, 1984), a stochastic procedure that produces samples from the posterior distribution P(t|w,a,//) oc P(w|t,//)P(t| a).",
        "We initialize the tags at random, then iteratively resample each tag according to its conditional distribution given the current values of all other tags.",
        "Exchangeability allows us to treat the current counts of the other tag trigrams and outputs as \"previous\" observations.",
        "The only complication is that resampling a tag changes the identity of three trigrams at once, and we must account for this in computing its conditional distribution.",
        "The sampling distribution for tj is given in Figure 2.",
        "In Bayesian statistical inference, multiple samples from the posterior are often used in order to obtain statistics such as the expected values of model variables.",
        "For POS tagging, estimates based on multiple samples might be useful ifwe were interested in, for example, the probability that two words have the same tag.",
        "However, computing such probabilities across all pairs of words does not necessarily lead to a consistent clustering, and the result would be difficult to evaluate.",
        "Using a single sample makes standard evaluation methods possible, but yields suboptimal results because the value for each tag is sampled from a distribution, and some tags will be assigned low-probability values.",
        "Our solution is to treat the Gibbs sampler as a stochastic search procedure with the goal of identifying the MAP tag sequence.",
        "This can be done using tempering (annealing), where a temperature of 0 is equivalent to raising the probabilities in the sampling distribution to the power of ^.",

        "The variation of information (VI) between two clusterings C (the gold standard) and C (the found clustering) of a set of data points is a sum of the amount of information lost in moving from C to C , and the amount that must be gained.",

        "Similar differences hold to a lesser degree when a partial dictionary is provided.",
        "With MLHMM, different tokens of the same word type are usually assigned to the same cluster, but types are assigned to clusters more or less at random, and all clusters have approximately the same number of types (542 on average, with a standard deviation of 174).",
        "The clusters found by BHMM2 tend to be more coherent and more variable in size: in the 5 runs of BHMM2, the average number of types per cluster ranged from 436 to 465 (i.e., tokens of the same word are spread over fewer clusters than in MLHMM), with a standard deviation between 460 and 674.",
        "Determiners, prepositions, the possessive marker, and various kinds of punctuation are mostly clustered coherently.",
        "Nouns are spread over a few clusters, partly due to a distinction found between common and proper nouns.",
        "Likewise, modal verbs and the copula are mostly separated from other verbs.",
        "Errors are often sensible: adjectives and nouns are frequently confused, as are verbs and adverbs.",
        "The kinds of results produced by BHMM1 and BHMM2 are more similar to each other than to the results of MLHMM, but the differences are still informative.",
        "Recall that BHMM1 learns a single value for / that is used for all output distributions, while BHMM2 learns separate hyperparameters for each cluster.",
        "This leads to different treatments of difficult-to-classify low-frequency items.",

        "In BHMM2, the system creates one or two clusters consisting entirely of very infrequent items, where the priors on these clusters strongly prefer uniform outputs, and all other clusters prefer extremely sparse outputs (and are more coherent than in BHMM1).",
        "This explains the difference in VI between the two systems, as well as the higher accuracy of BHMM1 for d > 3: the single / discourages placing low-frequency items in their own cluster, so they are more likely to be clustered with items that have sim-",
