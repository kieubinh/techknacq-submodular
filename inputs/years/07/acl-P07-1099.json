        "Question answering (QA) systems aim at finding precise answers to natural language questions from large document collections.",
        "Typical QA systems (Prager et al., 2000; Clarke et al., 2001; Harabagiu et al., 2000) adopt a pipeline architecture that incorporates four major steps: (1) question analysis, (2) document retrieval, (3) answer extraction and (4) answer selection.",
        "Question analysis is a process which analyzes a question and produces a list of keywords.",
        "Document retrieval is a step that searches for relevant documents or passages.",
        "Answer extraction extracts a list of answer candidates from the retrieved documents.",
        "Answer selection is a process which pinpoints correct answer(s) from the extracted candidate answers.",
        "Since the first three steps in the QA pipeline may produce erroneous outputs, the final answer selection step often entails identifying correct answer(s) amongst many incorrect ones.",
        "For example, given the question \"Which Chinese city has the largest number of foreign financial companies?",
        "\", the answer extraction component produces a ranked list of five answer candidates: Beijing (AP880603-0268), Hong Kong (WSJ920110-0013), Shanghai (FBIS3-58), Taiwan (FT942-2016) and Shanghai (FBIS3-45320).",
        "Due to imprecision in answer extraction, an incorrect answer (\"Beijing\") can be ranked in the first position, and the correct answer (\"Shanghai\") was extracted from two different documents and ranked in the third and the fifth positions.",
        "In order to rank \"Shanghai\" in the top position, we have to address two interesting challenges:",
        "• Answer Similarity.",
        "How do we exploit similarity among answer candidates?",
        "For example, when the candidates list contains redundant answers (e.g., \"Shanghai\" as above) or several answers which represent a single instance (e.g.",
        "should we boost the rank of the redundant answers?",
        "• Answer Relevance.",
        "How do we identify relevant answer(s) amongst irrelevant ones?",
        "This task may involve searching for evidence of a relationship between the answer",
        "and the answer type or a question keyword.",
        "For example, we might wish to query a knowledge base to determine if \"Shanghai\" is a city (IS-A(Shanghai, city)), or to determine if Shanghai is in China (IS-IN(Shanghai, China)).",
        "The first challenge is to exploit redundancy in the set of answer candidates.",
        "As answer candidates are extracted from different documents, they may contain identical, similar or complementary text snippets.",
        "For example, \"U.S.\" can appear as \"United States\" or \"USA\" in different documents.",
        "It is important to detect redundant information and boost answer confidence, especially for list questions that require a set of unique answers.",
        "One approach is to perform answer clustering (Nyberg et al., 2002; Jijkoun et al., 2006).",
        "However, the use of clustering raises additional questions: how to calculate the score of the clustered answers, and how to select the cluster label.",
        "To address the second question, several answer selection approaches have used external knowledge resources such as WordNet, CYC and gazetteers for answer validation or answer reranking.",
        "Answer candidates are either removed or discounted if they are not of the expected answer type (Xu et al., 2002;",
        "Echihabi et al., 2004).",
        "The Web also has been used for answer reranking by exploiting search engine results produced by queries containing the answer candidate and question keywords (Magnini et al., 2002).",
        "This approach has been used in various languages for answer validation.",
        "Wikipedia's structured information was used for Spanish answer type checking (Buscaldi and Rosso, 2006).",
        "Although many QA systems have incorporated individual features and/or resources for answer selection in a single language, there has been little research on a generalized probabilistic framework that supports answer ranking in multiple languages using any answer relevance and answer similarity features that are appropriate for the language in question.",
        "In this paper, we describe a probabilistic answer ranking framework for multiple languages.",
        "The framework uses logistic regression to estimate the probability that an answer candidate is correct given multiple answer relevance features and answer similarity features.",
        "An existing framework which was originally developed for English (Ko et al., 2007) was extended for Chinese and Japanese answer ranking by incorporating language-specific features.",
        "Empirical results on NTCIR Chinese and Japanese factoid questions show that the framework significantly improved answer selection performance; Chinese performance improved by 40% over the baseline, and Japanese performance improved by 45% over the baseline.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 contains an overview of the answer ranking task.",
        "Section 3 summarizes the answer ranking framework.",
        "In Section 4, we explain how we extended the framework by incorporating language-specific features.",
        "Section 5 describes the experimental methodology and results.",

        "For factoid questions, the top answer is selected as a final answer to the question.",
