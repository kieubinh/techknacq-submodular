        "Cue phrases (also known as discourse markers) are linguistic expressions that can be used to convey explicit information about the structure of a discourse or to convey a semantic contribution (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Reichman, 1985; Cohen, 1984).",
        "For example, the word okay can be used to convey a 'satisfactory' evaluation of some entity in the discourse (the movie was okay); as a backchannel in a dialogue to indicate that one interlocutor is still attending to another; to convey acknowledgment or agreement; or, in its 'cue' use, to start or finish a discourse segment (Jefferson, 1972; Schegloff and Sacks, 1973; Kowtko, 1997; Ward and Tsuka-hara, 2000).",
        "A major question is how speakers indicate and listeners interpret such variation in meaning.",
        "From a practical perspective, understanding how speakers and listeners disambiguate cue phrases is important to spoken dialogue systems, so that systems can convey potentially ambiguous terms with their intended meaning and can interpret user input correctly.",
        "There is considerable evidence that the different uses of individual cue phrases can be distinguished by variation in the prosody with which they are realized.",
        "For example, (Hirschberg andLitman, 1993) found that cue phrases in general could be disambiguated between their 'semantic' and their 'discourse marker' uses in terms of the type of pitch accent borne by the cue phrase, the position of the phrase in the intonational phrase, and the amount of additional information in the phrase.",
        "Despite the frequence of the word okay in natural dialogues, relatively little attention has been paid to the relationship between its use and its prosodic realization.",
        "(Hockey, 1993) did find that okay differs in terms of the pitch contour speakers use in uttering it, suggesting that a final rising pitch contour \"categorically marks a turn change,\" while a downstepped falling pitch contour usually indicates a discourse segment boundary.",
        "However, it is not clear which, if any, of the prosodic differences identified in this study are actually used by listeners in interpreting these potentially ambiguous items.",
        "In this study, we address the question of how hearers disambiguate the interpretation of okay.",
        "Our goal is to identify the acoustic, prosodic and phonetic features of okay tokens for which listeners assign different meanings.",
        "Additionally, we want to determine the role that discourse context plays in this classification: i.e., can subjects classify okay tokens reliably from the word alone or do they require additional context?",
        "Below we describe a perception study in which listeners were presented with a number of spoken productions of okay, taken from a corpus of dialogues between subjects playing a computer game.",
        "The tokens were presented both in isolation and in context.",
        "Users were asked to select the meaning of each token from three of the meanings that okay can take on: acknowledgement/agreement, backchannel, and cue of an initial discourse segment.",
        "Subsequently, we examined the acoustic, prosodic and phonetic correlates of these classifications to try to infer what cues listeners used to interpret the tokens, and how these varied by context condition.",
        "Section 2 describes our corpus.",
        "Section 3 describes the perception experiment.",
        "In Section 4 we analyze inter-subject agreement, introduce a novel representation of subject judgments, and examine the acoustic, prosodic, phonetic and contextual correlates of subject classification of okays.",

        "The recordings were orthographically transcribed and words were aligned by hand by trained annotators in a ToBI (Beckman and Hirschberg, 1994) orthographic tier using Praat (Boersma and Weenink, 2001) to manipulate waveforms.",

        "After the players had negotiated what they determined to be the best location, they were awarded up to 100 points based on the actual match of the target location on the two screens.",
        "The game proceeded in this way through 14 tasks, with describer and follower alternating roles.",
        "On average, the Objects Games portion of each session took 21m 36s, resulting in 4h 19m of dialogue for the twelve sessions in the corpus.",

        "The distribution of class labels in each experimental condition is shown in Table 1.",

        "This supports the hypothesis that acknowledgment/agreement may function as the default interpretation of okay.",

        "In the contextualized condition, we find very different correlations.",
        "Table 6 shows that nearly all of the strong correlations in this condition involve contextual features, such as the latency before Speaker B's turn, or the number of words by each speaker before and after the target okay.",
        "Notably, only one of the features that show strong correlations in the isolated condition shows the same strong correlation in the contextualized condition: the pitch slope at the end of the word.",
        "In both conditions subjects tended to label tokens with a final rising pitch contour as B, and tokens with a final falling pitch contour as C. This supports (Hockey, 1993)'s findings on the role of pitch contour in disambiguating okay.",
        "We next conducted a series of two-sided Fisher s exact tests to find correlations between subjects' la-belings of okay and the nominal features described in Section 4.3.",
        "We found significant associations between the realization of the /ou/ phoneme and the okay function in the isolated condition (p < 0.005).",
        "Table 7 shows that, in particular, [m] seems to be the preferred realization for B okays, while [a] seems to be the preferred one for A okays, and [ou] and [o] for A and C okays.",
        "Summing up, when subjects listened to the okay tokens in isolation, with only their acoustic, prosodic and phonetic properties available, a few features seem to strongly correlate with the perception of word function; for example, maximum intensity, word duration, and realizing the /ou/ phoneme as [m] tend to be associated with backchannel, while the duration of the realization of the /k/ phoneme, and realizing the /ou/ phoneme as [a] tend to be associated with acknowledgment/agreement.",
        "In the second part of the study, when subjects listened to contextualized versions of the same tokens of okay, most of the strong correlations of word function with acoustic, prosodic and phonetic features were replaced by correlations with contextual features, like latency and turn duration.",
        "In other words, these results suggest that contextual features might override the effect of most acoustic, prosodic and phonetic features of okay.",
        "There is nonetheless one notable exception: word final intonation – captured by the pitch slope and the ToBI labels for phrase accent and boundary tone – seems to play a central role in the interpretation of both isolated and contextualized okays.",

        "Additionally, the higher degree of inter-subject agreement in the contextualized condition, along with the strong correlations found for contextualized features, suggests that context, when available, plays a central role in the disambiguation of okay.",
        "(Note, however, that further research is needed in order to assess whether these features are indeed, in fact, perceptually important, both individually and combined.)",
        "We have also presented results suggesting that acknowledgment/agreement acts as a default function for both isolated an contextualized okays.",
        "Furthermore, while that function remains confusable with backchannel in both conditions, the availability of some context helps in distinguishing those two functions from cue to topic beginning.",
        "These results are relevant to spoken dialogue systems in suggesting how systems can convey the cue word okay with the intended meaning and can interpret users' productions of okay correctly.",
        "How these results extend to other cue words and to other word functions remains an open question.",

        "Since we have observed considerable differences in conversation style in the two parts of the corpus (the Objects Games elicited more 'dynamic' conversations, with more overlaps and interruptions than the Cards Games), we will compare cue phrase usage in these two settings.",
        "Finally, we are also interested in examining speaker entrainment in cue phrase usage, or how subjects adapt their choice and production of cue phrases to their conversation partner s."
