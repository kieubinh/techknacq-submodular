        "While humans are remarkably efficient, flexible and reliable communicators, we are far from perfect.",
        "Our dialogues differ in how successfully information is conveyed.",
        "In task-oriented dialogue, where the interlocutors are communicating to solve a problem, task success is a crucial indicator ofthe success of the communication.",
        "An automatic measure of task success would be useful for evaluating conversations among humans, e.g., for evaluating agents in a call center.",
        "In humancomputer dialogues, predicting the task success after just a first few turns of the conversation could avoid disappointment: if the conversation isn't going well, a caller may be passed on to a human operator, or the system may switch dialogue strategies.",
        "As a first step, we focus on human-human dialogue, since current spoken dialogue systems do not yet yield long, syntactically complex conversations.",
        "In this paper, we use syntactic and lexical features to predict task success in an environment where we assume no speaker model, no semantic information and no information typical for a human-computer dialogue system, e.g., ASR confidence.",
        "The features we use are based on a psychological theory, linking alignment between dialogue participants to low-level syntactic priming.",
        "An examination of this priming reveals differences between short-term and long-term effects.",
        "In their Interactive Alignment Model (IAM), Pickering and Garrod (2004) suggest that dialogue between humans is greatly aided by aligning representations on several linguistic and conceptual levels.",
        "This effect is assumed to be driven by a cascade of linguistic priming effects, where interlocutors tend to reuse lexical, syntactic and other linguistic structures after their introduction.",
        "Such reuse leads speakers to agree on a common situation model.",
        "Several studies have shown that speakers copy their interlocutor's syntax (Branigan et al., 1999).",
        "This effect is usually referred to as structural (or: syntactic) priming.",
        "These persistence effects are inter-related, as lexical repetition implies preferences for syntactic choices, and syntactic choices lead to preferred semantic interpretations.",
        "Without demanding additional cognitive resources, the effects form a causal chain that will benefit the interlocutor's purposes.",
        "Or, at the very least, it will be easier for them to repeat linguistic choices than to actively discuss their terminology and keep track of each other's current knowledge of the situation in order to come to a mutual understanding.",
        "The repetition effect at the center ofthis paper, priming, is defined as a tendency to repeat linguistic decisions.",
        "Priming has been shown to affect language production and, to a lesser extent, comprehension, at different levels of linguistic analysis.",
        "This tendency may show up in various ways, for instance in the case of lexical priming as a shorter response time in lexical decision making tasks, or as a preference for one syntactic construction over an alternative one in syntactic priming (Bock, 1986).",
        "In an experimental study (Branigan et al., 1999), subjects were primed by completing either sentence (1a) or (1b):",

        "The racing driver showed the torn overall... 1b.",
        "The racing driver showed the helpful mechanic...",
        "Sentence (1a) was to be completed with a prepositional object (\"to the helpful mechanic\"), while (1b) required a double object construction (\"the torn overall\").",

        "The shorter the distance between prime (3) and target (4), the more likely were rules to re-occur.",
        "In a conversation, priming may lead a speaker to choose a verb over a synonym because their interlocutor has used it a few seconds before.",
        "This, in turn, will increase the likelihood of the structural form of the arguments in the governed verbal phrase-simply because lexical items have their preferences for particular syntactic structures, but also because structural priming may be stronger if lexical items are repeated (lexical boost, Pickering and Branigan (1998)).",
        "Additionally, the structural priming effects introduced above will make a previously observed or produced syntactic structure more likely to be re-used.",
        "This chain reaction leads interlocutors in dialogue to reach a common situation model.",
        "Note that the IAM, in which interlocutors automatically and cheaply build a common representation of common knowledge, is at odds with views that afford each dialogue participant an explicit and separate representation of their interlocutor's knowledge.",

        "The predictions arising from this, however, have eluded testing so far.",

        "Switchboard contains spontaneous conversation over the telephone, while the task-oriented Map Task corpus was recorded with interlocutors co-present.",

        "From the whole interaction (very rarely more than five turns), 87% accuracy can be achieved (36% of dialogues had been hand-labeled \"problematic\").",
        "However, the most predictive features, which related to automatic speech recognition errors, are neither available in the human-human dialogue we are concerned with, nor are they likely to be the cause of communication problems there.",
        "Moreover, failures in the Map Task dialogues are due to the actual goings-on when two interlocutors engage in collaborative problem-solving to jointly reach an understanding.",
        "In such dialogues, interlocutors work over a period of about half an hour.",
        "To predict their degree of success, we will leverage the phenomenon of persistence, or priming.",
        "In previous work, two paradigms have seen extensive use to measure repetition and priming effects.",
        "Experimental studies expose subjects to a particular syntactic construction, either by having them produce the construction by completing a sample sentence, or by having an experimenter or confederate interlocutor use the construction.",
        "Then, subjects are asked to describe a picture or continue with a given task, eliciting the target construction or a competing, semantically equivalent alternative.",
        "The analysis then shows an effect of the controlled condition on the subject's use of the target construction.",
        "Observational studies use naturalistic data, such as text and dialogue found in corpora.",
        "Here, the prime construction is not controlled-but again, a correlation between primes and targets is sought.",
        "Specific competing constructions such as active/passive, verbal particle placement or that-deletion in English are often the object of study (Szmrecsanyi, 2005; Gries, 2005; Dubey et al., 2005; Jager, 2006), but the effect can also be generalized to syntactic phrase-structure rules or combinatorial categories (Reitter et al., 2006a).",
        "Church (2000) proposes adaptive language models to account for lexical adaptation.",
        "Each document is split into prime and target halves.",
        "Then, for selected words w, the model estimates P(+adapt) = P(w e target\\w e prime)",

        "Thus, it is not very likely that task success caused alignment to improve at large.",
        "We suspect such a possibility, however, for very unsuccessful dialogues.",
        "A closer look at the correlation (Figure 1) reveals that while adaptation indeed decreases as task success decreases, adaptation increased again for some of the least successful dialogues.",
        "It is possible that here, miscoordination became apparent to the participants, who then tried to switch strategies.",
        "Or, simply put: too much alignment (and too little risk-taking) is unhelpful.",
        "Further, qualitative, work needs to be done to investigate this hypothesis.",
        "From an applied perspective, the correlation shows that of the repetition effects included in our task-success prediction model, it is long-term syntactic adaptation as opposed to the more automatic short-term priming effect that contributes to prediction accuracy.",
