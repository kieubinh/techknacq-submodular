        "Words are the basic units to process for most nlp tasks.",
        "The problem of Chinese word segmentation (cws) is to find these basic units for a given sentence, which is written as a continuous sequence of characters.",
        "It is the initial step for most Chinese processing applications.",
        "Chinese character sequences are ambiguous, often requiring knowledge from a variety of sources for disambiguation.",
        "Out-of-vocabulary (oov) words are a major source of ambiguity.",
        "For example, a difficult case occurs when an oov word consists of characters which have themselves been seen as words; here an automatic segmentor may split the OOV word into individual single-character words.",
        "Typical examples of unseen words include Chinese names, translated foreign names and idioms.",
        "The segmentation of known words can also be ambiguous.",
        "For example, \"ilcjillf' should be \"i>C ML (here) If (flour)\" in the sentence Mffif UMU ij.i\" (flour and rice are expensive here) or \"ii (here) Mil (inside)\" in the sentence \"iiJIlM \" (it's cold inside here).",
        "The ambiguity can be resolved with information about the neighboring words.",
        "In comparison, for the sentences \" \", possible segmentations include \"tni$l (the discussion) (will) (very) fjfc (be successful)\" and \"Jctiife (the discussion meeting) (very) fjfc (be successful)\".",
        "The ambiguity can only be resolved with contextual information outside the sentence.",
        "Human readers often use semantics, contextual information about the document and world knowledge to resolve segmentation ambiguities.",
        "There is no fixed standard for Chinese word segmentation.",
        "Experiments have shown that there is only about 75% agreement among native speakers regarding the correct word segmentation (Sproat et al., 1996).",
        "Also, specific nlp tasks may require different segmentation criteria.",
        "For example, \" fl\" could be treated as a single word (Bank of Beijing) for machine translation, while it is more naturally segmented into \"Jb (Beijing) HI If (bank)\" for tasks such as text-to-speech synthesis.",
        "Therefore, supervised learning with specifically defined training data has become the dominant approach.",
        "Following Xue (2003), the standard approach to supervised learning for cws is to treat it as a tagging task.",
        "Tags are assigned to each character in the sentence, indicating whether the character is a single-character word or the start, middle or end ofa multicharacter word.",
        "The features are usually confined to a five-character window with the current character in the middle.",
        "In this way, dynamic programming algorithms such as the Viterbi algorithm can be used for decoding.",
        "Several discriminatively trained models have recently been applied to the cws problem.",
        "Examples include Xue (2003), Peng et al.",
        "(2004) and Shi and Wang (2007); these use maximum entropy (me) and conditional random field (crf) models (Ratna-parkhi, 1998; Lafferty et al., 2001).",
        "An advantage of these models is their flexibility in allowing knowledge from various sources to be encoded as features.",
        "Contextual information plays an important role in word segmentation decisions; especially useful is information about surrounding words.",
        "Consider the sentence \" \", which can be from \" (among which) 15 (foreign) (companies)\", or \" H (in China) (foreign companies)",
        "(business)\".",
        "Note that the five-character window surrounding \" \" is the same in both cases, making the tagging decision for that character difficult given the local window.",
        "However, the correct decision can be made by comparison of the two three-word windows containing this character.",
        "In order to explore the potential of word-based models, we adapt the perceptron discriminative learning algorithm to the cws problem.",
        "Collins (2002) proposed the perceptron as an alternative to the crf method for hmm-style taggers.",
        "However, our model does not map the segmentation problem to a tag sequence learning problem, but defines features on segmented sentences directly.",
        "Hence we use a beam-search decoder during training and testing; our idea is similar to that of Collins and Roark (2004) who used a beam-search decoder as part of a perceptron parsing model.",
        "Our work can also be seen as part of the recent move towards search-based learning methods which do not rely on dynamic programming and are thus able to exploit larger parts of the context for making decisions (Daumé III, 2006).",
        "We study several factors that influence the performance of the perceptron word segmentor, including the averaged perceptron method, the size of the beam and the importance of word-based features.",
        "We compare the accuracy of our final system to the state-of-the-art CWS systems in the literature using the first and second sighan bakeoff data.",
        "Our system is competitive with the best systems, obtaining the highest reported F-scores on a number of the bakeoff corpora.",
        "These results demonstrate the importance of word-based features for CWS.",
        "Furthermore, our approach provides an example of the potential of search-based discriminative training methods for nlp tasks."

        "Our algorithm is not based on an HMM.",
        "For a given input sequence x, even the length of different candidates y (the number of words) is not fixed.",
        "Because the output sequence y (the segmented sentence) contains all the information from the input sequence x (the raw sentence), the global feature vector $(x, y) is replaced with <J>(y), which is extracted from the candidate segmented sentences directly.",
        "Despite the above differences, since the theorems of convergence and their proof (Collins, 2002) are only dependent on the feature vectors, and not on the source of the feature definitions, the perceptron algorithm is applicable to the training of our CW S model.",
        "The averaged perceptron algorithm (Collins, 2002) was proposed as a way of reducing overfitting on the training data.",
        "It was motivated by the voted-perceptron algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1999) and has been shown to give improved accuracy over the non-averaged perceptron on a number of tasks.",

        "In the averaged perceptron algorithm, 7 is used instead of a as the final parameter vector.",
        "With a large number of features, calculating the total parameter vector an't after each training example is expensive.",

        "Define an update vector r to record the number of the training sentence n and iteration t when each dimension of the averaged parameter vector was last updated.",

        "This model is an alternative to the existing character-based tagging models, and allows word information to be used as features.",
        "One attractive feature of the perceptron training algorithm is its simplicity, consisting of only a decoder and a trivial update process.",
        "We use a beam-search decoder, which places our work in the context of recent proposals for search-based discriminative learning algorithms.",
        "Closed tests using the first and second sighan cws bakeoff data demonstrated our system to be competitive with the best in the literature.",
        "Open features, such as knowledge ofnumbers and European letters, and relationships from semantic networks (Shi and Wang, 2007), have been reported to improve accuracy.",
        "Therefore, given the flexibility of the feature-based perceptron model, an obvious next step is the study of open features in the segmentor.",
        "Also, we wish to explore the possibility of incorporating POS tagging and parsing features into the discriminative model, leading to joint decoding.",
        "The advantage is two-fold: higher level syntactic information can be used in word segmentation, while joint decoding helps to prevent bottom-up error propagation among the different processing steps."
