        "This paper proposed a novel method for phrase-based SMT on language pairs with a small bilingual corpus by bringing in pivot languages.",
        "To perform translation between Lf and Le, we bring in a pivot language Lp, via which the large corpora of Lf-Lp and Lp-Le can be used to induce a translation model for Lf-Le.",
        "The advantage of this method is that it can perform translation between the language pair Lf-Le even if no bilingual corpus for this pair is available.",
        "Using BLEU as a metric, our method achieves an absolute improvement of 0.06 (22.13% relative) as compared with the model directly trained with 5,000 sentence pairs for French-Spanish translation.",
        "And the translation quality is comparable with that of the model directly trained with 30,000 French-Spanish sentence pairs.",
        "The results also indicate that using more pivot languages leads to better translation quality.",
        "With a small bilingual corpus available for Lf-Le, we built a translation model, and interpolated it with the pivot model trained with the large Lf-Lp and Lp-Le bilingual corpora.",
        "The results on both the Europarl corpus and Chinese-Japanese translation indicate that the interpolated models achieve the best results.",
        "Results also indicate that our pivot language approach is suitable for translation on language pairs with a small bilingual corpus.",
        "The less the Lf-Le bilingual corpus is, the bigger the improvement is.",
        "We also performed experiments using Lf-Lp and Lp-Le corpora of different sizes.",
        "The results indicate that using larger training corpora to train the pivot model leads to better translation quality."
