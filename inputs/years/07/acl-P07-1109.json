        "Transliterations are words that are converted from one writing script to another on the basis of their pronunciation, rather than being translated on the basis of their meaning.",
        "Transliterations include named entities (e.g. JL»^\\ <j\\a-/Jane Austen) and lexical loans (e.g. <jy_television).",
        "An algorithm to detect transliterations automatically in a bitext can be an effective tool for many tasks.",
        "Models of machine transliteration such as those presented in (Al-Onaizan and Knight, 2002) or (AbdulJaleel and Larkey, 2003) require a large set of sample transliterations to use for training.",
        "If such a training set is unavailable for a particular language pair, a detection algorithm would lead to a significant gain in time over attempting to build the set manually.",
        "Algorithms for cross-language information retrieval often encounter the problem of out-of-vocabulary words, or words not present in the algorithm's lexicon.",
        "Often, a significant proportion of these words are named entities and thus are candidates for transliteration.",
        "A transliteration detection algorithm could be used to map named entities in a query to potential transliterations in the target language text.",
        "The main challenge in transliteration detection lies in the fact that transliteration is a lossy process.",
        "In other words, information can be lost about the original word when it is transliterated.",
        "This can occur because of phonetic gaps in one language or the other.",
        "For example, the English [p] sound does not exist in Arabic, and the Arabic [Y] sound (made by the letter ) does not exist in English.",
        "Thus, Paul is transliterated as [bul], and [ ali] is transliterated as Ali.",
        "Another form of loss occurs when the relationship between the orthographic and phonetic representations of a word are unclear.",
        "For example, the [k] sound will always be written with the letter in Arabic, but in English it can be written as c, k ch, ck, cc or kk (not to mention being one of the sounds produced by x).",
        "Finally, letters may be deleted in one language or the other.",
        "In Arabic, short vowels will often be omitted (e.g. <-e.^yJYousef), while in English the Arabic c and ^ are often deleted (e.g. J-^IH/Ismae/).",
        "We explore the use of word similarity metrics on the task of Arabic-English transliteration detection and extraction.",
        "One of our primary goals in exploring these metrics is to assess whether it is possible maintain high performance without making the algorithms language-specific.",
        "Many word-similarity metrics require that the strings being compared be written in the same script.",
        "Levenshtein edit distance, for example, does not produce a meaningful score in the absence of character identities.",
        "Thus, if these metrics are to be used for transliteration extraction, modifications must be made to allow them to compare different scripts.",

        "(2006) take the approach of manually encoding a great deal of language knowledge directly into their Arabic-English fuzzy matching algorithm.",
        "They define equivalence classes between letters in the two scripts and perform several rule-based transformations to make word pairs more comparable.",
        "This approach is unattractive for two reasons.",
        "Firstly, predicting all possible relationships between letters in English and Arabic is difficult.",
        "For example, allowances have to be made for unusual pronunciations in foreign words such as the chin cliché or the c in Milosevic.",
        "Secondly, the algorithm becomes completely language-specific, which means that it cannot be used for any other language pair.",
        "We propose a method to learn letter relationships directly from the bitext containing the transliterations.",
        "Our model is based on the memoriless stochastic transducer proposed by Ristad and Yian-ilos (1998), which derives a probabilistic word-similarity function from a set of examples.",
        "The transducer is able to learn edit distance costs between disjoint sets of characters representing different writing scripts without any language-specific knowledge.",
        "The transducer approach, however, requires a large set of training examples, which is a limitation not present in the fuzzy matching algorithm.",
        "Thus, we propose a bootstrapping approach (Yarowsky, 1995) to train the stochastic transducer iteratively as it extracts transliterations from a bitext.",
        "The bootstrapped stochastic transducer is completely language-independent, and we show that it is able to perform at least as well as the Arabic-English specific fuzzy matching algorithm.",

        "They outline a forward-backward algorithm to train the model and show that it outperforms Lev-enshtein edit distance on the task of pronunciation classification.",

        "The forward value at each position (i, j) in the F matrix signifies the sum of the probabilities of all paths through the transducer that produce the prefix pair (s1,tj), while B(i, j) contains the sum of the probabilities of all paths through the transducer that generate the suffix pair (s+1,tJ+1).",
        "These tables can then be used to collect partial counts to update the probabilities.",
        "For example, the mapping (si; tj) would contribute a count according to Equation 3.",
        "These counts are then normalized to produce the updated probability distribution.",
        "The major issue in porting the memoriless transducer over to our task of transliteration extraction is that its training is supervised.",
        "In other words, it would require a relatively large set of known transliterations for training, and this is exactly what we would like the model to acquire.",

        "Their model first transcribes the Japanese word expressed in the katakana syllabic script as the concatenation of all possible transliterations of the individual symbols.",
        "A depth-first search is then applied to compute the number of matches between this transcription and a candidate English transliteration.",
        "The method requires a manual enumeration of the possible transliterations for each katakana symbol, which is unfeasible for many language pairs.",
        "In the method developed by Tsuji (2002), katakana strings are first split into their mora units, and then the transliterations of the units are assessed manually from a set of training pairs.",
        "For each katakana string in a bitext, all possible transliterations are produced based on the transliteration units determined from the training set.",
        "The transliteration candidates are then compared to the English words according to the Dice score.",
        "The manual enumeration of possible mappings makes this approach unattractive for many language pairs, and the generation of all possible transliteration candidates is problematic in terms of computational complexity.",
        "Lee and Chang (2003) detect transliterations with a generative noisy channel transliteration model similar to the transducer presented in (Knight and Graehl, 1998).",
        "The English side of the corpus is tagged with a named entity tagger, and the model is used to isolate the transliterations in the Chinese translation.",
        "This model, like the transducer proposed by Ristad and Yianilos (1998), must be trained on a large number of sample transliterations, meaning it cannot be used if such a resource is not available.",

        "We presented a bootstrapping approach to training a stochastic transducer, which learns scoring parameters automatically from a bitext.",
        "The approach is completely language-independent, and was shown to perform as well or better than an Arabic-English specific similarity metric on the task of Arabic-English transliteration extraction.",
        "Although the bootstrapped transducer is language-independent, it learns only one-to-one letter relationships, which is a potential drawback in terms of porting it to other languages.",
        "Our model is able to capture English digraphs and trigraphs, but, as of yet, we cannot guarantee the model's success on languages with more complex letter relationships (e.g. a logographic writing system such as Chinese).",
        "More research is necessary to evaluate the model's performance on other languages.",
        "Another area open to future research is the use of more complex transducers for word comparison.",
        "For example, Linden (2006) presents a model which learns probabilities for edit operations by taking into account the context in which the characters appear.",
        "It remains to be seen how such a model could be adapted to a bootstrapping setting."
