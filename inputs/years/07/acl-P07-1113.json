        "Passages of written text can be classified into modes of discourse - Narrative, Description, Argument, Information, and Report - by examining concrete linguistic cues in the text (Smith, 2003).",
        "These cues are of two forms: the distribution of situation entity types and the mode of progression (either temporal or metaphorical) through the text.",
        "For example, the Narration and Report modes both contain mainly events and temporally bounded states; they differ in their principles of temporal progression.",
        "Report passages progress with respect to (deictic) speech time, whereas Narrative passages progress with respect to (anaphoric) reference time.",

        "Table 5 shows the performance on Brown when training on Brown and/or MUC using the wtlg feature set with simple labeling and with sequence prediction with a lookback of two.",
        "A number of things are suggested by these figures.",
        "First, the labeling model (lookback of zero), beats the baseline even when training on out-of-domain texts (43.1% vs. 38.5%), but this is unsurprisingly far below training on in-domain texts (43.1% vs. 50.6%).",
        "Second, while sequence prediction helps with indomain training (53.1% vs 50.6%), it makes no difference with out-of-domain training (42.9% vs 43.1%).",
        "This indicates that the patterns of SEs in a text do indeed correlate with domains and their discourse modes, in line with case-studies in the discourse modes theory (Smith, 2003).",
        "Finally, mixing out-of-domain training material with in-domain material does not hurt labelling accuracy (50.4% vs 50.6%), but it does take away the gains from sequencing (49.5% vs 53.1%).",
        "These genre effects are suggestive, but inconclusive.",
        "A similar setup with much larger training and testing sets would be necessary to provide a clearer picture of the effect of mixed domain training."

        "Situation entity classification is a little-studied but important classification task for the analysis of discourse.",
        "We have presented the first data-driven models for SE classification, motivating the treatment of SE classification as a sequencing task.",
        "We have shown that linguistic correlations to situation entity type are useful features for probabilistic models, as are grammatical relations and CCG supertags derived from syntactic analysis of clauses.",
        "Models for the task perform poorly given very basic feature sets, but minimal linguistic processing in the form of part-of-speech tagging improves performance even on small data sets used for this study.",
        "Performance improves even more when we move beyond simple feature sets and incorporate linguistically-motivated features and grammatical relations from deep syntactic analysis.",
        "Finally, using sequence prediction by adapting a POS-tagger further improves results.",
        "The tagger we adapted uses beam search; this allows tractable use of maximum entropy for each labeling decision but forgoes the ability to find the optimal label sequence using dynamic programming techniques.",
        "In contrast, Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) allow the use of maximum entropy to set feature weights with efficient recovery of the optimal sequence.",
        "Though CRFs are more computationally intensive, the small set of SE labels should make the task tractable for CRFs.",
        "In future, we intend to test the utility of SEs in discourse parsing, discourse mode identification, and discourse relation projection."
