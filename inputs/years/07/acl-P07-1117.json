        "It is usually implemented by a finite-state transducer.",
        "Relations are not oriented, so the same transducer may be used both for analysis and generation.",
        "They may be non-deterministic, when the same form belongs to several pairs.",
        "Furthermore, finite state machines have interesting properties, they are composable and efficient.",
        "There are two main trends in Finite-State Morphology: rewrite-rule systems and two-level rule systems.",
        "Rewrite-rule systems describe the morphology of languages using contextual rewrite rules which are easily applied in cascade.",
        "Rules are compiled into finite-state transducers and merged using transducer composition (Kaplan and Kay, 1994).",
        "The other important trend of Finite-State Morphology is Two-Level Morphology (Koskenniemi, 1983).",
        "In this approach, not only pairs of lexical and surface strings are related, but there is a one-to-one correspondence between their symbols.",
        "It means that the two strings of a given pair must have the same length.",
        "Whenever a symbol of one side does not have an actual counterpart in the other string, a special symbol 0 is inserted at the relevant position in order to fulfill the same-length constraint.",
        "For example, the correspondence between the surface form spies and the morpheme concatenation",
        "spy+s is given as follows: .",
        "Same-length relations are closed under intersection, so two-level grammars describe a system as the simultaneous application of local constraints.",
        "A third approach, Partition-Based Morphology, consists in splitting the strings ofa pairinto the same number of substrings.",
        "The same-length constraint does not hold on symbols but on substrings.",
        "For example, spies and spy+s may be partitioned as",
        "follows: s p y + ss pie e s",

        "(Barthelemy, 2005) proposed a more powerful framework, where the relations are defined by concatenating tuples of independent regular expressions and operations on partitioned n-relations such as intersection and complementation are considered.",
        "In this paper, we propose to use Mazurkiewicz Trace Languages instead of partitioned relation as the semantics of partition-based morphological formalisms.",
        "The benefits are twofold: firstly, there is an extension of the formal power which allows the combination of morphological description using different partitionings of forms.",
        "Secondly, the compilation of such languages into finite-state machines has been exhaustively studied.",
        "Their closure properties provide operations useful for morphological purposes.",
        "They include the concatenation (for instance for compound words), the intersection used to merge local constraints, the union (modular lexicon), the composition (cascading descriptions, form recognition and generation), the projection (to extract one level of the relation), the complementation and set difference, used to compile contextual rules following the algorithms in (Kaplan and Kay, 1994), (Grimley-Evans et al., 1996) and (Yli-Jyra and Koskenniemi, 2004).",

        "Describing a rule with an irrelevant one is sometimes difficult and inelegant.",
        "For instance, describing vowel harmony using a partitioning based on morphemes takes necessarily several rules corresponding to the cases where the harmony is within a morpheme or across several morphemes.",

        "Previous partition-based formalisms use a unique partitioning which is used in all the contextual rules.",
        "Our proposition is to use several partitionings in order to express constraints with the proper granularity.",
        "Typically, these partitionings correspond to the notions of morphemes, phonemes and graphemes.",
        "Partition-based grammars have the same theoretical power as two-level morphology, which is the power of regular languages.",
        "It was designed to remain finite-state and closed under intersection.",
        "It is compiled in finite-state automata which are formally equivalent to the epsilon-free letter transducers used by two-level morphology.",
        "It is simply more easy to use in some cases, just like two-level rules are more convenient than simple regular expressions for some applications.",
        "Partition-Based morphology is convenient whenever the different levels use very different representations, like feature structures and strings, or different writing systems (e.g. Japanese hiragana and transcription).",
        "Two-level rules on the other hand are convenient whenever the related strings are variants of the same representation like in the example (spy+s,spies).",
        "Note that multi-partition morphology may use a one-to-one correspondence as one of its partitionings, and therefore is compatible with usual two-level morphology.",
        "With respect to rewrite rule systems, partition-based morphology gives better support to parallel rule application and context definition may involve several levels.",
        "The counterpart is a risk of conflicts between contextual rules.",
