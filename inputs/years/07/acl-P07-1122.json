        "Treebank parsers are trained on syntactically annotated sentences and a major part of their success can be attributed to extensive manipulations of the training data as well as the output of the parser, usually in the form of various tree transformations.",
        "This can be seen in state-of-the-art constituency-based parsers such as Collins (1999), Charniak (2000), and Petrov et al.",
        "(2006), and the effects of different transformations have been studied by Johnson (1998), Klein and Manning (2003), and Bikel (2004).",
        "Corresponding manipulations in the form of tree transformations for dependency-based parsers have recently gained more interest (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005; Hall and Novak, 2005; McDonald and Pereira, 2006; Nilsson et al., 2006) but are still less studied, partly because constituency-based parsing has dominated the field for a long time, and partly because dependency structures have less structure to manipulate than constituent structures.",
        "Most of the studies in this tradition focus on a particular parsing model and a particular data set, which means that it is difficult to say whether the effect of a given transformation is dependent on a particular parsing strategy or on properties of a particular language or treebank, or both.",
        "The aim of this study is to further investigate some tree transformation techniques previously proposed for data-driven dependency parsing, with the specific aim of trying to generalize results across languages/treebanks and parsers.",
        "More precisely, we want to establish, first of all, whether the transformation as such makes specific assumptions about the language, treebank or parser and, secondly, whether the improved parsing accuracy that is due to a given transformation is constant across different languages, treebanks, and parsers.",
        "The three types of syntactic phenomena that will be studied here are non-projectivity, coordination and verb groups, which in different ways pose problems for dependency parsers.",
        "We will focus on tree transformations that combine preprocessing with post-processing, and where the parser is treated as a black box, such as the pseudo-projective parsing technique proposed by Nivre and Nilsson (2005) and the tree transformations investigated in Nilsson et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "To study the influence of language and treebank specific properties we will use data from Arabic, Czech, Dutch, and Slovene, taken from the CoNLL-X shared task on multilingual dependency parsing (Buchholz and Marsi, 2006).",
        "To study the influence of parsing methodology, we will compare two different parsers: MaltParser (Nivre et al., 2004) and MSTParser (McDonald et al., 2005).",
        "Note that, while it is possible in principle to distinguish between syntactic properties of a language as such and properties of a particular syntactic annotation of the language in question, it will be impossible to tease these apart in the experiments reported here, since this would require having not only multiple languages but also multiple treebanks for each language.",
        "In the following, we will therefore speak about the properties of treebanks (rather than languages), but it should be understood that these properties in general depend both on properties of the language and of the particular syntactic annotation adopted in the treebank.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 surveys tree transformations used in dependency parsing and discusses dependencies between transformations, on the one hand, and treebanks and parsers, on the other.",

        "The tree transformations that have attracted most interest in the literature on dependency parsing are those concerned with recovering non-projectivity.",
        "The definition of non-projectivity can be found in Kahane et al.",
        "(1998).",
        "Informally, an arc is projective if all tokens it covers are descendants of the arc's head token, and a dependency tree is projective if all its arcs are projective.",
        "The full potential of dependency parsing can only be realized if non-projectivity is allowed, which pose a problem for projective dependency parsers.",
        "Direct non-projective parsing can be performed with good accuracy, e.g., using the Chu-Liu-Edmonds algorithm, as proposed by McDonald et al.",
        "(2005).",
        "On the other hand, non-projective parsers tend, among other things, to be slower.",
        "In order to maintain the benefits of projective parsing, tree transformations techniques to recover non-projectivity while using a projective parser have been proposed in several studies, some described below.",
        "In discussing the recovery of empty categories in data-driven constituency parsing, Campbell (2004) distinguishes between approaches based on pure post-processing and approaches based on a combination of preprocessing and post-processing.",
        "The same division can be made for the recovery of non-projective dependencies in data-driven dependency parsing.",
        "Pure Post-processing",
        "Hall and Novak (2005) propose a corrective modeling approach.",
        "The motivation is that the parsers of to Czech are not able to create the non-projective arcs present in the treebank, which is unsatisfactory.",
        "They therefore aim to correct erroneous arcs in the parser's output (specifically all those arcs which should be non-projective) by training a classifier that predicts the most probable head of a token in the neighborhood of the head assigned by the parser.",
        "Another example is the second-order approximate spanning tree parser developed by McDonald and Pereira (2006).",
        "It starts by producing the highest scoring projective dependency tree using Eisner's algorithm.",
        "In the second phase, tree transformations are performed, replacing lower scoring projective arcs with higher scoring non-projective ones.",
        "Preprocessing with Post-processing",
        "The training data can also be preprocessed to facilitate the recovery of non-projective arcs in the output of a projective parser.",
        "The pseudo-projective transformation proposed by Nivre and Nilsson (2005) is such an approach, which is compatible with different parser engines.",
        "First, the training data is projectivized by making non-projective arcs projective using a lifting operation.",
        "This is combined with an augmentation of the dependency labels of projectivized arcs (and/or surrounding arcs) with information that probably reveals their correct non-projective positions.",
        "The out-",

        "put of the parser, trained on the projectivized data, is then deprojectivized by a heuristic search using the added information in the dependency labels.",
        "The only assumption made about the parser is therefore that it can learn to derive labeled dependency structures with augmented dependency labels.",
        "The second type of transformation concerns linguistic phenomena that are not impossible for a projective parser to process but which may be difficult to learn, given a certain choice of dependency analysis.",
        "This study is concerned with two such phenomena, coordination and verb groups, for which tree transformations have been shown to improve parsing accuracy for MaltParser on Czech (Nils-son et al., 2006).",
        "The general conclusion of this study is that coordination and verb groups in the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT), based on theories of the Prague school (PS), are annotated in a way that is difficult for the parser to learn.",
        "By transforming coordination and verb groups in the training data to an annotation similar to that advocated by Mel'cuk (1988) and then performing an inverse transformation on the parser output, parsing accuracy can therefore be improved.",
        "This is again an instance of the black-box idea.",
        "Schematically, coordination is annotated in the Prague school as depicted in PS in figure 1, where the conjuncts are dependents of the conjunction.",
        "In Mel'cuk style (MS), on the other hand, conjuncts and conjunction(s) form a chain going from left to right.",
        "A third way of treating coordination, not discussed by Nilsson et al.",
        "(2006), is used by the parser of Collins (1999), which internally represents coordination as a direct relation between the conjuncts.",
        "This is illustrated in CS in figure 1, where the conjunction depends on one of the conjuncts, in this case on the rightmost one.",
        "Nilsson et al.",
        "(2006) also show that the annotation of verb groups is not well-suited for parsing PDT using MaltParser, and that transforming the dependency structure for verb groups has a positive impact on parsing accuracy.",
        "In PDT, auxiliary verbs are dependents of the main verb, whereas it according to Mel'cuk is the (finite) auxiliary verb that is the head of the main verb.",
        "Again, the parsing experiments in this study show that verb groups are more difficult to parse in PS than in MS.",

        "The pseudo-projective transformation is independent not only of parsing methodology but also of treebank (and language) specific properties, as long as the target representation is a (potentially non-projective) labeled dependency structure.",
        "By contrast, the coordination and verb group transformations presuppose not only that the language in question contains these constructions but also that the treebank adopts a PS annotation.",
        "In this sense, they are more limited in their applicability than pseudo-projective parsing.",

        "The first thing to note is that pseudo-projective parsing gives a significant improvement for PDT, as previously reported by Nivre and Nilsson (2005), but also for Alpino, where the improvement is even larger, presumably because of the higher proportion of non-projective dependencies in the Dutch treebank.",
