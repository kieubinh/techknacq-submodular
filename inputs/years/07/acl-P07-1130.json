        "Career guidance is important both for the person involved and for the state.",
        "Not well informed decisions may cause people to drop the training program they are enrolled in, yielding loss of time and financial investments.",
        "However, there is a mismatch between what people know about existing professions and the variety of professions, which exist in reality.",
        "Some studies report that school leavers typically choose the professions known to them, such as policeman, nurse, etc.",
        "Many other professions, which can possibly match the interests ofthe person very well, are not chosen, as their titles are unknown and people seeking career advice do not know about their existence, e.g. electronics installer, or chemical laboratory worker.",
        "However, people are very good at describing their professional interests in natural language.",
        "That is why they are even asked to write a short essay prior to an appointment with a career guidance expert.",
        "Electronic career guidance is, thus, a supplement to career guidance by human experts, helping young people to decide which profession to choose.",
        "The goal is to automatically compute a ranked list ofpro-fessions according to the user's interests.",
        "A current system employed by the German Federal Labour Office (GFLO) in their automatic career guidance front-end is based on vocational trainings, manually annotated using a tagset of 41 keywords.",
        "The user must select appropriate keywords according to her interests.",
        "In reply, the system consults a knowledge base with professions manually annotated with the keywords by career guidance experts.",
        "Thereafter, it outputs a list of the best matching professions to the user.",
        "This approach has two significant disadvantages.",
        "Firstly, the knowledge base has to be maintained and steadily updated, as the number of professions and keywords associated with them is continuously changing.",
        "Secondly, the user has to describe her interests in a very restricted way.",
        "At the same time, GFLO maintains an extensive database with textual descriptions of professions, called BERUFEnet.",
        "Therefore, we cast the problem of ECG as an IR task, trying to remove the disadvantages of conventional ECG outlined above by letting the user describe her interests in a short natural language essay, called a professional profile.",
        "has been discovered as a promising lexical semantic resource and successfully used in such different NLP tasks as question answering (Ahn et al., 2004), named entity disambiguation (Bunescu and Paşca, 2006) , and information retrieval (Katz et al., 2005).",
        "Further research (Zesch et al., 2007b) indicates that German wordnet and Wikipedia show different performance depending on the task at hand.",
        "Departing from this, we first compare two semantic relatedness (SR) measures based on the information either in the German wordnet (Lin, 1998) called LIN, or in Wikipedia (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007) called Explicit Semantic Analysis, or ESA.",
        "We evaluate their performance intrinsically on the tasks of (T-1) computing semantic relatedness, and (T-2) solving Reader's Digest Word Power (RDWP) questions and make conclusions about the ability of the measures to model certain aspects of semantic relatedness and their coverage.",
        "Furthermore, we follow the approach by Muller and Gurevych (2006), who proposed to utilize the LIN measure and a set of heuristics as an IR model (IR-1).",
        "Additionally, we utilize the ESA measure in a semantic information retrieval model, as this measure is significantly better at vocabulary coverage and at modelling cross part-of-speech relations (Gabrilovich and Markovitch, 2007).",
        "We compare the performance of ESA and LIN measures in a task-based IR evaluation and analyze their strengths and limitations.",
        "Finally, we apply ESA to directly compute text similarities between topics and documents (IR-2) and compare the performance of two semantic IR models and a baseline Extended Boolean (EB) model (Salton et al., 1983) with query expansion.",
        "To summarize, the contributions of this paper are three-fold: (i) we present a novel system, utilizing NLP and IR techniques to perform Electronic Career Guidance, (ii) we study the properties and intrinsically evaluate two SR measures based on GermaNet and Wikipedia for the tasks of computing semantic relatedness and solving Reader's Digest Word Power Game questions, and (iii) we investigate the performance of two semantic IR models in a task based evaluation.",

        "I would like to work with animals, to treat and look after them, but I cannot stand the sight of blood and take too much pity on them.",
        "On the other hand, I like to work on the computer, can program in C, Python and VB and so I could consider software development as an appropriate profession.",
        "I cannot imagine working in a kindergarden, as a social worker or as a teacher, as I am not very good at asserting myself.",
        "Textual descriptions of professions are ranked given such an essay by using NLP and IR techniques.",
        "As essays and descriptions of professions display a mismatch between the vocabularies oftop-ics and documents and there is lack of contextual information, due to the documents being fairly short as compared to standard IR scenarios, lexical semantic information should be especially beneficial to an IR system.",
        "For example, the profile can contain words about some objects or activities related to the profession, but not directly mentioned in the description, e.g. oven, cakes in the profile and pastries, baker, or confectioner in the document.",
        "Therefore, we propose to utilize semantic relatedness as a ranking function instead of conventional IR techniques, as will be substantiated below."

        "Its designers relied mainly on linguistic evidence, such as corpus frequency, rather than psycholinguistic motivations.",
        "Also, GermaNet employs artificial, i.e. non-lexicalized concepts, and adjectives are structured hierarchically as opposed to WordNet.",
        "Currently, GermaNet includes about 40000 synsets with more than 60000 word senses modelling nouns, verbs and adjectives.",
        "We use the semantic relatedness measure by Lin (1998) (referred to as LIN), as it consistently is among the best performing wordnet based measures (Gurevych and Niederlich, 2005; Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006).",
        "Lin defined semantic similarity using a formula derived from information theory.",
        "This measure is sometimes called a universal semantic similarity measure as it is supposed to be application, domain, and resource independent.",
        "Lin is computed where c\\ and c2 are concepts (word senses) corresponding to w\\ and w2, log p(c) is the information content, and LCS(c\\, c2) is the lowest common sub-sumer of the two concepts.",
        "The probability p is computed as the relative frequency of words (representing that concept) in the taz corpus.",
        "Wikipedia based measures Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that is constructed in a collaborative effort of voluntary contributors and still grows exponentially.",
        "During this process, Wikipedia has probably become the largest collection of freely available knowledge.",
        "Wikipedia shares many of its properties with other well known lexical semantic resources (like dictionaries, thesauri, semantic wordnets or conventional encyclopedias) (Zesch et al., 2007a).",
        "As Wikipedia also models relatedness between concepts, it is better suited for computing semantic relatedness than GermaNet (Zesch et al., 2007b).",
        "In very recent work, Gabrilovich and Markovitch (2007) introduce a SR measure called Explicit Semantic Analysis (ESA).",
        "The ESA measure represents the meaning of a term as a high-dimensional concept vector.",
        "The concept vector is derived from Wikipedia articles, as each article focuses on a certain topic, and can thus be viewed as expressing a concept.",
        "The dimension of the concept vector is the number of Wikipedia articles.",
        "Each element of the vector is associated with a certain Wikipedia article (or concept).",
        "If the term can be found in this article, the term's tfidf score (Salton and McGill, 1983) in this article is assigned to the vector element.",
        "Otherwise, 0 is assigned.",
        "As a result, a term's concept vector represents the importance of the term for each concept.",
        "Semantic relatedness oftwo terms can then be easily computed as the cosine of their corresponding concept vectors.",
        "If we want to measure the semantic relatedness of texts instead of terms, we can also use ESA concept vectors.",
        "A text is represented as the average concept vector of its terms' concept vectors.",
        "Then, the relatedness of two texts is computed as the cosine of their average concept vectors.",
        "As ESA uses all textual information in Wikipedia, the measure shows excellent coverage.",
        "Therefore, we select it as the second measure for integration into our IR system.",
        "Semantic relatedness datasets for German employed in our study are presented in Table 1.",
        "Gurevych (200 ) conducted experiments with two datasets: i) a German translation of the English dataset by Rubenstein and Goodenough (196 ) (Gur65), and ii) a larger dataset containing 350 word pairs (Gur350).",

        "However, word pairs for this dataset are biased towards strong classical relations, as they were manually selected from a corpus.",
        "ZG222 does not have this bias.",
        "Following the work by Jarmasz and Szpakow-icz (2003) and Turney (2006), we created a second dataset containing multiple choice questions.",

        "This indicates that the information provided by both measures, based on different knowledge bases, might be complementary for the IR task.",
        "When ESA is applied to directly compute semantic relatedness between topics and documents, it outperforms IR-1 and the baseline EB model by a large margin for QT-1 and QT-2 queries.",
        "For QT-3, i.e., the shortest type of query, it performs worse than IR-1 utilizing ESA and a set of heuristics.",
        "Also, the performance of the baseline EB model is very strong in this experimental setting.",
        "This result indicates that IR-2 utilizing conventional information retrieval techniques and semantic information from Wikipedia is better suited for longer queries providing enough context.",
        "For shorter queries, soft matching techniques utilizing semantic relatedness tend to be beneficial.",
        "It should be born in mind, that the construction of QT-3 queries involved a manual step of assigning the keywords to a given essay.",
        "In this experimental setting, all models show the best performance.",
        "This indicates that professional profiles contain a lot of noise, so that more sophisticated NLP analysis of topics is required.",
        "This will be improved in our future work, whereby the system will incorporate an information extraction component for automatically mapping the professional profile to a set of keywords.",
        "We will also integrate a component for analyzing the sentiment structure of the profiles.",
        "We believe that the findings from our work on applying IR techniques to the task of Electronic Career Guidance generalize to similar application domains, where topics and documents display similar properties (with respect to their length, free-text structure and mismatch of vocabularies) and domain and lexical knowledge is required to achieve high levels of performance."
