      "text": [
        "For extraction of social networks and biographical facts, our approach relies on three standard IE modules – entity detection and recognition, relation detection, and event detection – and a fusion module that integrates the output from the three IE systems.",
        "We use the term entity to refer to a person, an organization, or other real world entities, as adopted in the Automatic Content Extraction (ACE) Workshops (ACE, 2005).",
        "A mention is a reference to a real world entity.",
        "It can be named (e.g. \"John Lennon\"), nominal (e.g. \"mother\"), or pronominal (e.g. \"she\").",
        "Entity detection is generally accomplished in two steps: first, a mention detection module identifies all the mentions of interest; second, a co-reference module merges mentions that refer to the same entity into a single co-reference chain.",
        "A relation detection system identifies (typically) binary relationships between pairs of mentions.",
        "For instance, for the sentence \"I'm in New York\", the following relation exists: locatedAt (I, New York).",
        "An event detection system identifies events of interest and the arguments of the event.",
        "For example, from the sentence \"John married Eva in 1940\", the system should identify the marriage event, the people who got married and the time of the event.",
        "The latest ACE evaluations involve all of the above tasks.",
        "However, as shown in the next section, our focus is quite different from ACE – we are particularly interested in improving performance for conversational speech and building on top of ACE tasks to produce social networks and biographies.",
        "The fusion module merges the output from IE modules to extract social networks and biographical facts.",
        "For example, if a relation detection system has identified the relation motherOf (mother, my) from the input sentence \"my mother is a cook\", and if an entity recognition module has generated entities referenced by the mentions {my, Rosa......}, then by replacing my and mother with the named mentions within the same co-reference chains, the fusion module produces the following nodes and ties in a social network: motherOf (Rosa, Josh).",
        "We generate the nodes ofsocial networks by selecting all the PERSON entities produced by the entity recognition system.",
        "Typically, we only include entities that contain at least one named mention.",
        "To identify ties between nodes, we retrieve all relations that indicate social relationships between a pair of nodes in the network.",
        "We extract biographical profiles by selecting the events (extracted by the event extraction module) and corresponding relations (extracted by the relation extraction module) that involve a given individual as an argument.",
        "When multiple documents are used, then we employ a cross-document co-reference system."

        "Extracting information from conversational speech transcripts is uniquely challenging.",
        "In this section, we describe the data collection used in our experiments, and explain specific techniques we used to improve IE performance on this data.",
        "We use a corpus of videotaped, digitized oral interviews with Holocaust survivors in our experiments.",
        "This data was collected by the USC Shoah Foundation Institute (formerly known as the Visual History Foundation), and has been used in many research activities under the Multilingual Access to Large Spoken Archives (MALACH) project (Gustman et al., 2002; Oard et al., 2004).",
        "The collection contains oral interviews in 32 languages from 52,000 survivors, liberators, rescuers and witnesses of the Holocaust.",
        "This data is very challenging.",
        "Besides the usual characteristics of conversational speech, such as speaker turns and speech repairs, the interview transcripts contain a large percentage of ungrammatical, incoherent, or even incomprehensible clauses (a sample interview segment is shown in Figure 1).",
        "In addition, each interview covers many people and places over a long time period, which makes it even more difficult to extract social networks and biographical facts.",
        "speaker2 in on that ninth of November nineteen hundred thirty eight I was with my parents at home we heard not through the we heard even through the windows the crashing of glass the crashing of and and they are our can't",
        "Our initial attempts at social network extraction for the above data set resulted in a very poor score of 0.06 f-measure for finding the relations within a network (as shown in Table 3 as baseline performance).",
        "An error analysis indicated poor co-reference resolution to be the chief culprit for the low performance.",
        "For instance, suppose we have two clauses: \"his mother's name is Mary\" and \"his brother Mark went to the army\".",
        "Further suppose that \"his\" in the first clause refers to a person named \"John\" and \"his\" in the second clause refers to a person named \"Tim\".",
        "If the co-reference system works perfectly, the system should find a social network involving four people: {John, Tim, Mary, Mark}, and the ties: moth-erOf (Mary, John), and brotherOf (Mark, Tim).",
        "However, if the co-reference system mistakenly links \"John\" to \"his\" in the second clause and links \"Tim\" to \"his\" in the first clause, then we will still have a network with four people, but the ties will be: motherOf(Mary, Tim), and brotherOf(Mark, John), which are completely wrong.",
        "This example shows that co-reference errors involving mentions that are relation arguments can lead to very bad performance in social network extraction.",
        "Our existing co-reference module is a state-of-the-art system that produces very competitive results compared to other existing systems (Luo et al., 2004).",
        "It traverses the document from left to right and uses a mention-synchronous approach to decide whether a mention should be merged with an existing entity or start a new entity.",
        "However, our existing system has shortcomings for this data: the system lacks features for handling conversational speech, and the system often makes mistakes in pronoun resolution.",
        "Resolving pronominal references is very important for extracting social networks from conversational speech, as illustrated in the previous example.",
        "We developed a new co-reference resolution system for conversational speech transcripts.",
        "Similar to many previous works on co-reference (Ng, 2005), we cast the problem as a classification task and solve it in two steps: (1) train a classifier to determine whether two mentions are co-referent or not, and (2) use a clustering algorithm to partition the mentions into clusters, based on the pairwise predictions.",
        "We added many features to our model specifically designed for conversational speech, and significantly improved the agglomerative clustering used for co-reference, including integrating relations as constraints, and designing better cluster linkage methods and clustering stopping criteria.",
        "We added many features to our model specifically designed for conversational speech:",
        "Speaker role identification.",
        "In manual transcripts, the speaker turns are given and each speaker is labeled differently (e.g. \"speakerl\", \"speaker2\"), but the identity of the speaker is not given.",
        "An interview typically involves 2 or more speakers and it is useful to identify the roles of each speaker (e.g. interviewer, interviewee, etc.).",
        "For instance, \"you\" spoken by the interviewer is likely to be linked with \"I\" spoken by the interviewee, but \"you\" spoken by the third person in the interview is more likely to be referring to the interviewer than to the interviewee.",
        "We developed a program to identify the speaker roles.",
        "The program classifies the speakers into three categories: interviewer, interviewee, and others.",
        "The algorithm relies on three indicators – number of turns by each speaker, difference in number of words spoken by each speaker, and the ratio of first-person pronouns such as \"I\", \"me\", and \"we\" vs. second-person pronouns such as \"you\" and \"your\".",
        "This speaker role identification program works very well when we checked the results on the development and test set – the interviewers and survivors in all the documents in the development set were correctly identified.",
        "Speaker turns.",
        "Using the results from the speaker role identification program, we enrich certain features with speaker turn information.",
        "For example, without this information, the system cannot distinguish \"I\" spoken by an interviewer from \"I\" spoken by an interviewee.",
        "Spelling features for speech transcripts.",
        "We add additional spelling features so that mentions such as \"Cyla CYLALewin\" and \"Cyla Lewin\" are considered as exact matches.",
        "Names with spelled-out letters occur frequently in our data collection.",
        "Name Patterns.",
        "We add some features that capture frequent syntactic structures that speakers use to express names, such as \"her name is Irene\", \"my cousin Mark\", and \"interviewer Ellen\".",
        "Pronoun features.",
        "To improve the performance on pronouns, we add features such as the speaker turns of the pronouns, whether the two pronouns agree in person and number, whether there exist other mentions between them, etc.",
        "Other miscellaneous features.",
        "We also include other features such as gender, token distance, sentence distance, and mention distance.",
        "We trained a maximum-entropy classifier using these features.",
        "For each pair of mentions, the classifier outputs the probability that the two mentions are co-referent.",
        "We also modified existing features to make them more applicable to conversational speech.",
        "For instance, we added pronoun-distance features taking into account the presence of other pronominal references in between (if so, the types of the pronouns), other mentions in between, etc.",
        "We use an agglomerative clustering approach for partitioning mentions into entities.",
        "This is a bottom-up approach which joins the closest pair of clusters (i.e., entities) first.",
        "Initially, each mention is placed into its own cluster.",
        "If we have N mentions to cluster, we start with N clusters.",
        "The intuition behind choosing the agglomerative method is to merge the most confident pairs first, and use the properties of existing clusters to constrain future clustering.",
        "This seems to be especially important for our data collection, since conversational speech tends to have a lot of repetitions or local structures that indicate co-reference.",
        "In such cases, it is beneficial to merge these closely related mentions first.",
        "Cluster linkage method.",
        "In agglomerative clustering, each cycle merges two clusters into a single cluster, thus reducing the number of clusters by one.",
        "We need to decide upon a method of measuring the distance between two clusters.",
        "At each cycle, the two mentions with the highest co-referent probability are linked first.",
        "This results in the merging of the two clusters that contain these two mentions.",
        "We improve upon this method by imposing minimal distance criteria between clusters.",
        "Two clusters C1 and C2 can be combined only if the distance between all the mentions from C1 and all the mentions from C2 is above the minimal distance threshold.",
        "For instance, suppose C1 = {he, father}, and C2 = {he, brother}, and \"he\" from Ci and \"he\" from C2 has the highest linkage probability.",
        "The standard single linkage method will combine these two clusters, despite the fact that \"father\" and \"brother\" are very unlikely to be linked.",
        "Imposing minimal distance criteria can solve this problem and prevent the linkage of clusters which contain very dissimilar mentions.",
        "In practice, we used multiple minimal distance thresholds, such as minimal distance between two named mentions and minimal distance between two nominal mentions.",
        "We chose not to use complete or average linkage methods.",
        "In our data collection, the narrations contain a lot of pronouns and the focus tends to be very local.",
        "Whereas the similarity model may be reasonably good at predicting the distance between two pronouns that are close to each other, it is not good at predicting the distance between pronouns that are furthur apart.",
        "Therefore, it seems more reasonable to use single linkage method with modifications than complete or average linkage methods.",
        "Using relations to constrain clustering.",
        "Another novelty of our co-reference system is the use of relations for constraining co-reference.",
        "The idea is that two clusters should not be merged if such merging will introduce contradictory relations.",
        "For instance, if we know that person entity A is the mother of person entity B, and person entity C is the sister of B, then A and C should not be linked since the resulting entity will be both the mother and the sister ofB.",
        "We construct coexistent relation sets from the training data.",
        "For any two pairs ofentities, we collect all the types of relations that exist between them.",
        "These types of relations are labeled as co-existent.",
        "For instance, \"motherOf\" and \"par-entOf\" can co-exist, but \"motherOf\" and \"sis-terOf\" cannot.",
        "By using these relation constraints, the system refrains from generating contradictory relations in social networks.",
        "Speed improvement.",
        "Suppose the number of mentions is N, the time complexity ofsimple linkage method is O(N).",
        "With the minimal distance criteria, the complexity is O(N).",
        "However, N can be dramatically reduced for conversational transcripts by first linking all the first-person pronouns by each speaker."

        "In addition, we transcribed and annotated 20 complete interviews (each interview is about 2 hours) for building the development and test sets, in order to give a more accurate assessment of extraction performance.",

        "We have improved the performance of social network extraction five-fold, compared to a baseline system that already uses state-of-the-art technology.",
        "In particular, we improved the performance ofco-reference resolution for conversational speech, by feature engineering and improving the clustering algorithm.",
        "Although our application data consists of conversational speech transcripts in this paper, the same extraction approach can be applied to general-domain text as well.",
        "Extracting general, rich social networks is very important in many applications, since it provides the knowledge ofwho is connected to whom and how they are connected.",
        "There are many interesting issues involved in biography generation from a large data collection, such as how to resolve contradictions.",
        "The counts from the corpus certainly help to filter out false information which would otherwise be difficult to filter.",
        "But better technology at detecting and resolving contradictions will definitely be beneficial.",
