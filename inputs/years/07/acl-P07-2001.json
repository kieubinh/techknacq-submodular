        "This work updates the description and includes a life demo.",
        "MIMUS follows the Information State Update approach to dialogue management, and has been developed under the EU-funded TALK project (Talk Project, 2004).",
        "Its architecture consists of a set of OAA agents (Cheyer and Martin, 1972) linked through a central Facilitator, as shown in figure 1:",
        "The main agents in MIMUS are briefly described hereafter:",
        "• The system core is the Dialogue Manager,",
        "which processes the information coming from the different input modality agents by means of a natural language understanding module and provides output in the appropriate modality.",
        "• The main input modality agent is the ASR Manager, which is obtained through an OAA",
        "wrapper for Nuance.",
        "Currently, the system supports English, Spanish and German, with the possibility of changing languages on-the-fly without affecting the dialogue history.",
        "• The HomeSetup agent displays the house layout, with all the devices and their state.",
        "Whenever a device changes its state, the HomeSetup is notified and the graphical layout is updated.",
        "• The Device Manager controls the physical devices.",
        "When a command is sent, the Device Manager notifies it to the HomeSetup and the Knowledge Manager, guaranteeing coherence in all the elements in MIMUS.",
        "• The GUI Agents control each of the device-specific GUIs.",
        "Thus, clicking on the telephone icon, a telephone GUI will be displayed, and so on for each type of service.",
        "• The Knowledge Manager connects all the agents to the common knowledge resource by",
        "means of an OWL Ontology.",
        "• The Talking Head.",
        "MIMUS virtual character is synchronized with Loquendo's TTS, and has the ability to express emotions and play some animations such as nodding or shaking the head."

        "As pointed out above, MIMUS follows the ISU approach to dialogue management (Larsson and Traum, 2000).",
        "The main element of the ISU approach in MIMUS is the dialogue history, represented formally as a list of dialogue states.",
        "Dialogue rules update this information structure either by producing new dialogue states or by supplying arguments to existing ones.",
        "The information state in MIMUS is represented as a feature structure with four main attributes: Dialogue Move, Type, Arguments and Contents.",
        "• DMOVE: Identifies the kind of dialogue move.",
        "• TYPE: This feature identifies the specific dialogue move in the particular domain at hand.",
        "• ARGS: The ARGS feature specifies the argument structure of the DMOVE/TYPE pair.",
        "Modality and Time features have been added in order to implement fusion strategies at dialogue level.",
        "This section provides an example of how the Information State Update approach is implemented in MIMUS.",
        "Update rules are triggered by dialogue moves (any dialogue move whose DTAC structure unifies with the Attribute-Value pairs defined in the TriggeringCondition field) and may require additional information, defined as dialogue expectations (again, those dialogue moves whose DTAC structure unify with the Attribute-Value pairs defined in the DeclareExpectations field).",

        "However, since two declared expectations are still missing (Location and DeviceType), the dialogue manager will activate the ActionExpectations and prompt the user for the kind of device she wants to switch on, by means of a call to the natural language generation module NLG(DeviceType).",
        "Once all expectations have been fulfilled, the PostActions can be executed over the desired device(s)."

        "Initially, OWL Ontologies were integrated in MIMUS in order to improve its knowledge management module.",

        "OWL ontologies play a central role in MIMUS.",
        "This role is limited, though, to the input side of the system.",
        "The domain-dependent part of multimodal and multilingual production rules for context-free grammars is semi-automatically generated from an OWL ontology.",
        "This approach has achieved several goals: it leverages the manual work of the linguist, and ensures coherence and completeness between the Domain Knowledge (Knowledge Manager Module) and the Linguistic Knowledge (Natural Language Understanding Module) in the application.",
        "A detailed explanation of the algorithm and the results obtained can be found in (Perez et al., 2006a)",
        "MIMUS home layout does not consist of a predefined static structure only usable for demonstration purposes.",
        "Instead, it is dynamically loaded at execution time from the OWL ontology where all the domain knowledge is stored, assuring the coherence of the layout with the rest of the system.",
        "This is achieved by means of an OWL-RDQL wrapper.",
        "It is through this agent that the Home Setup enquires for the location of the walls, the label of the rooms, the location and type of devices per room and so forth, building the 3D graphical image from these data."

        "MIMUS approach to multimodal fusion involves combining inputs coming from different multimodal channels at dialogue level (Perez et al., 2005).",
        "The idea is to check the multimodal input pool before launching the actions expectations while waiting for an \"inter-modality\" time.",
        "This strategy assumes that each individual input can be considered as an independent dialogue move.",
        "In this approach, the multimodal input pool receives and stores all inputs including information such as time and modality.",
        "The Dialogue Manager checks the input pool regularly to retrieve the corresponding input.",
        "If more than one input is received during a certain time frame, they are considered simultaneous or pseudo-simultaneous.",
        "In this case, further analysis is needed in order to determine whether those independent multimodal inputs are truly related or not.",
        "Another, improved strategy has been proposed at (Manchon et al., 2006), which combines the advantages of this one, and those proposed for unification-based grammars (Johnston et al., 1997; Johnston, 1998)."

        "As pointed out by (Wahlster et al., 1993), the CP cannot determine the content independently from the presentation planner (PP).",
        "In MIMUS, the CP generates a set of possibilities, from which the PP will select one, depending on their feasibility.",
        "• Presentation Planner (PP): The PP receives the set of possible content representations and selects the \"best\" one.",
        "• Realization Module (RM): This module takes the presentation generated and selected by the CP-PP, divides the final DTAC structure and sends each substructure to the appropriate agent for rendering."

        "Throughout the dialogue, the dialogue manager may see it fit to reinforce the communication channel with gestures and expressions, which may or may not imply synthesized utterances.",
