        "Blogs have become popular and are used in a variety of settings not only for personal use, but are also used in the internal communications of organizations.",
        "A multimedia blog, which contains videos, music, and illustrations, is increasing in popularity because it enables users to express their thoughts creatively.",
        "However, users are unsatisfied with the current multimedia blog creation methods.",
        "Users have three requirements.",
        "First, they need easier methods to create blogs.",
        "Most multimedia blogs are created in one of two ways: 1) A user creates audiovisual contents by cameras and or some other recording devices, and then assigns a text description to the contents as indexes.",
        "2) A user creates a text blog, and then searches for multimedia contents on the internet and databases to attach them to his blog.",
        "Both methods require high-level information literacy skills.",
        "Second, they would like to reduce their blog-creation time.",
        "Even skilled users have to waste time assigning text description and searching related multimedia contents.",
        "Third, they like to be encouraged by other peoples' comments on their blogs.",
        "Although some users utilize pet-type agents making automatic comments to their blogs, the agents do not always satisfy them because the comments do not consider users' moods.",
        "To meet the three requirements, we developed a multimedia blog creation system using Japanese dialogue with an intelligent robot.",
        "The system was developed on a prototype robot called PaPeRo (Fujita, 2002), which has the same CPU and memory as a mobile PC.",
        "In this paper, we describe the multimedia blog creation method and the evaluation results in a practical setting."

        "The system has four sequential processes: video message recording, continuous speech recognition, natural language text retrieval, and blog coordination.",
        "The first process is activated when a user begins a conversation with PaPeRo.",
        "The process stores a video message recorded on PaPeRo's microphones and CCD cameras, and the second process converts the speech contents of the video message into a text description to extract important keywords.",
        "Then, the third process searches for suitable multimedia contents on pre-specified web sites and databases based on the text description.",
        "The first three processes can simplify multimedia blog creation and reduce creation costs.",
        "The last process detects a user's mood, such as delight, anger, sorrow, and pleasure, by extracting typical expressions from the text description, and then chooses appropriate sympathetic comments to encourage the user.",
        "Finally, the last process coordinates uploading the recorded video message, the text description, the extracted keywords, the searched contents, and the sympathetic comments on the user's blog.",
        "The system converts the speech content of the video message into text descriptions and extracts important keywords based on their lexical information.",
        "The system should, therefore, be equipped with a large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition engine capable of dealing with spontaneous speech.",
        "This is because blog messages usually contain various kinds of words and expressions.",
        "As this kind of engine needs a large amount of memory and computational resources, it is generally difficult to install the engine on small intelligent robots because the robot requires its own computational resources for their own intelligent operations, such as image recognition and movement control.",
        "To solve this problem, we used a compact and scalable large-vocabulary continuous speech recognition framework, which has been shown to work on low-power devices, such as PDAs (Isotani et al.,2005).",
        "The framework achieves compact and high-speed processing by the following techniques:",
        "- Efficient reduction of Gaussian components using MDL criterion (Shinoda, et al., 2002)",
        "- High-speed likelihood calculation using tree-structured probability density functions (Wata-nabe, et al., 1995)",
        "- Compaction of search algorithm using lexical prefix tree and shared usage of calculated language model scores (Isotani et al., 2005)",
        "The framework we developed contained a Japanese lexicon of 50,000 words typically used in travel conversations based on a speech translation system (Isotani, et al., 2002).",
        "We were able to evaluate the developed system by making a travel blog using Japanese dialogue with PaPeRo.",
        "The system generates a query sentence from a text description converted using the above-mentioned framework.",
        "As few multimedia contents contain retrieval keywords, the system matches the query to text in web pages and documents containing multimedia contents.",
        "The system then chooses multimedia contents located adjacent to the highly-matched text as retrieval results.",
        "To achieve high precision for avoiding user interaction with the retrieved results, the system is enhanced using the Okapi BM25 model (Robertson, et al., 1995) by the following techniques (Ikeda, et al., 2005):",
        "(1) Utilization of syntactic relationships The system needs to distinguish illustrations based on the context.",
        "For example, an illustration of fish to be eaten in a restaurant should be different from that of fish to be seen in an aquarium.",
        "To achieve this, the system utilizes the syntactic relationships between a pair of words.",
        "The system produces a higher score for text containing the same syntactic relationship as that of a pair of words in a query sentence when calculating the matching score.",
        "(2) Distinction of negation and affirmation The system needs to distinguish negative and affirmative expressions because their meanings are clearly opposite.",
        "To achieve this, the system checks adjuncts attached to the expressions when matching a query sentence and text.",
        "(3) Identification of synonyms As different expressions have the same meaning, the system normalizes expressions by using a synonym dictionary containing 500 words before matching a query sentence and text.",
        "The system detects users' mood to choose encouraging comments.",
        "Users' moods are sometimes detected by the expressions used and the manner in which the utterances are spoken.",
        "Although speaking manner can clearly detect emotions, such as laughing or crying, some emotions are not always indicated.",
        "Expressions that clearly identify a person's mood can be indicated (Nakamura, 1993).",
        "By studying moods that are easily detectable from expressions, including modality, we developed a database of 10 moods (delight, anger, sorrow, pleasure, desire, fear, shame, relief, surprise, and normal) individually linked with 100 kinds of specific expressions.",
        "The database is searched based on the above-mentioned natural language text retrieval, which considers syntactic relationships, negative and affirmative responses, and synonyms.",
        "The database is also linked to PaPeRo' s response to convey the most appropriate sympathy for each mood.",
        "The response includes verbal comments, such as \"I'm happy for you\" and \"It's really too bad\", and gestures, such as dancing and crying depicted using GIF animation files.",
        "Responses are chosen based on the mood detected.",
        "Finally, the system coordinates uploading a recorded video message, the text description, the extracted important keywords, the searched multimedia contents, and PaPeRo' s responses on the user's blog."

        "As performance has been evaluated using different application systems, such as an automatic speech translation system (Isotani, et al., 2002) and a speech-activated text retrieval system (Ikeda, et al., 2005), we concentrated on evaluating the total performance based on surveying users' opinions about the blogs they created using the developed system.",

        "Some users expected that the system could promote spread of multimedia contents with index keywords, even though few multimedia contents currently have indexes for retrieval.",
        "(2) Robustness and tolerability for low accuracy Users understood the results when low speech recognition accuracy was used because the multimedia content search is still fairly successful when keywords are accurately recognized, even though the total accuracy is not high.",
        "Users can appreciate the funny side of speech recognition errors and unexpected multimedia contents from PaPeRo' s mistakes.",
        "However, as the errors do not always lead to amusing results, an edit interface should be equipped to improve keywords, illustrations and the total blog page layout.",
        "(3) More expectations of dialogue with PaPeRo Users would like to more enjoy themselves with",
        "PaPeRo, regardless of the speech recognition accuracy.",
        "They expect PaPeRo to give them more information, such as track-back and comments, based on dialogue history.",
        "As PaPeRo stores all the messages in himself, he has the ability to generate more sophisticated comments and trackback messages with users.",
