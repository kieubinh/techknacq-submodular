        "Given a user's query, the system will produce tables of the salient information about the topic in structured form.",
        "It produces the tables in less than one minute without any knowledge engineering by hand, i.e. pattern creation or paraphrase knowledge creation, which was the largest obstacle in traditional IE.",
        "This demonstration is based on the idea and technologies reported in (Sekine 06).",
        "A substantial speed-up over the previous system (which required about 15 minutes to analyze one year of newspaper) was achieved through a new approach to handling pattern candidates; now less than one minute is required when using 11 years of newspaper corpus.",
        "In addition, functionality was added to facilitate investigation of the extracted information."

        "The goal of information extraction (IE) is to extract information about events in structured form from unstructured texts.",
        "In traditional IE, a great deal of knowledge for the systems must be coded by hand in advance.",
        "For example, in the later MUC evaluations, system developers spent one month for the knowledge engineering to customize the system to the given test topic.",
        "Improving portability is necessary to make Information Extraction technology useful for real users and, we believe, lead to a breakthrough for the application of the technology.",

        "Sekine (Sekine 06) proposed 'On-demand information extraction (ODIE)': a system which automatically identifies the most salient structures and extracts the information on the topic the user demands.",
        "This new IE paradigm becomes feasible due to recent developments in machine learning for NLP, in particular unsupervised learning methods, and is created on top of a range of basic language analysis tools, including POS taggers, dependency analyzers, and extended Named Entity taggers.",

        "We will present an overview of the algorithm in this section.",
        "The details can be found in (Sekine 06).",
        "The basic functionality of the system is the following.",
        "The user types a query / topic description in keywords (for example, \"merge, acquire, purchase\").",
        "Then tables will be created automatically while the user is waiting, rather than in a month of human labor.",
        "These tables are expected to show information about the salient relations for the topic.",
        "There are six major components in the system.",
        "1) IR system: Based on the query given by the user, it retrieves relevant documents from the document database.",
        "We used a simple TF/IDF IR system we developed.",
        "2) Pattern discovery: The texts are analyzed using a POS tagger, a dependency analyzer and an Extended Named Entity (ENE) tagger, which will be explained in (5).",
        "Then sub-trees of dependency trees which are relatively frequent in the retrieved documents compared to the entire corpus are identified.",
        "The sub-trees to be used must satisfy some restrictions, including having",
        "between 2 and 6 nodes, having a predicate or nominalization as the head of the sub-tree, and having at least one NE.",
        "We introduced upper and lower frequency bounds for the sub-trees to be used, as we found the medium frequency sub-trees to be the most useful and least noisy.",
        "We compute a score for each pattern based on its frequency in the retrieved documents and in the entire collection.",
        "The top scoring sub-trees will be called patterns, which are expected to indicate salient relationships of the topic and which will be used in the later components.",
        "We pre-compute such information as much as possible in order to enable usably prompt response to queries.",
        "3) Paraphrase discovery: In order to find semantic relationships between patterns, i.e. to find patterns which should be used to build the same table, we use lexical knowledge such as WordNet and paraphrase discovery techniques.",
        "The paraphrase discovery was conducted off-line and created a paraphrase knowledge base.",
        "4) Table construction: In this component, the patterns created in (2) are linked based on the paraphrase knowledge base created by (3), producing sets of patterns which are semantically equivalent.",
        "Once the sets of patterns are created, these patterns are applied to the documents retrieved by the IR system (1).",
        "The matched patterns pull out the entity instances from the sentences and these entities are aligned to build the final tables.",
        "5) Extended NE tagger: Most of the participants in events are likely to be Named Entities.",
        "However, the traditional NE categories are not sufficient to cover most participants of various events.",
        "For example, the standard MUC's 7 NE categories (i.e. person, location, organization, percent, money, time and date) miss product names (e.g. Windows XP, Boeing 747), event names (Olympics, World War II), numerical expressions other than monetary expressions, etc.",
        "We used the Extended NE with 140 categories and a tagger developed for these categories."

        "The largest computational load in this system is the extraction and scoring of the topic-relevant subtrees.",
        "In the previous system, 1,000 top-scoring sub-trees are extracted from all possible (on the order of hundreds of thousands) sub-trees in the top 200 relevant articles.",
        "This computation took about 14 minutes out of the total 15 minutes of the entire process.",
        "The difficulty is that the set of top articles is not predictable, as the input is arbitrary and hence the list of sub-trees is not predictable, too.",
        "Although a state-of-the-art tree mining algorithm (Abe et al.",
        "02) was used, the computation is still impracticable for a real system.",
        "The solution we propose in this paper is to pre-compute all possibly useful sub-trees in order to reduce runtime.",
        "We enumerate all possible subtrees in the entire corpus and store them in a database with frequency and location information.",
        "To reduce the size of the database, we filter the patterns, keeping only those satisfying the constraints on frequency and existence of predicate and named entities.",
        "However, it is still a big challenge, because in this system, we use 11 years of newspaper (AQUAINT corpus, with duplicate articles removed) instead of the one year of newspaper (New York Times 95) used in the previous system.",
        "With this idea, the response time of the demonstration system is reduced significantly.",
        "The statistics of the corpus and sub-trees are as follows.",
        "The entire corpus includes 1,031,124 articles and 24,953,026 sentences.",
        "The frequency thresholds for sub-trees to be used is set to more than 10 and less than 10,000; i.e. sub-trees of those frequencies in the corpus are expected to contain most of the salient relationships with minimum noise.",
        "The sub-trees with frequency less than 11 account for a very large portion of the data; 97.5% of types and 66.3% of instances, as shown in Table 1.",
        "The sub-trees of frequency of 10,001 or more are relatively small; only 76 kinds and only 2.5% of the instances.",
        "We assign ID numbers to all 1 million sub-trees and 25 million sentences and those are mutually linked in a database.",
        "Also, 60 million NE occurrences in the sub-trees are identified and linked to the sub-tree and sentence IDs.",
        "In the process, the sentences found by the IR component are identified.",
        "Then the sub-trees linked to those sentences are gathered and the scores are calculated.",
        "Those processes can be done by manipulation of the database in a very short time.",
