        "1 Introduction",
        "The statistical modelling of language, together with advances in wide-coverage grammar development, have led to high levels of robustness and efficiency in NLP systems and made linguistically motivated large-scale language processing a possibility (Mat-suzaki et al., 2007; Kaplan et al., 2004).",
        "This paper describes an NLP system which is based on syntactic and semantic formalisms from theoretical linguistics, and which we have used to analyse the entire Gigaword corpus (1 billion words) in less than 5 days using only 18 processors.",
        "This combination of detail and speed of analysis represents a breakthrough in NLP technology.",
        "The system is built around a wide-coverage Combinatory Categorial Grammar (ccg) parser (Clark and Curran, 2004b).",
        "The parser not only recovers the local dependencies output by treebank parsers such as Collins (2003), but also the long-range dep-dendencies inherent in constructions such as extraction and coordination.",
        "ccg is a lexicalized grammar formalism, so that each word in a sentence is assigned an elementary syntactic structure, in CCG's case a lexical category expressing subcategorisation information.",
        "Statistical tagging techniques can assign lexical categories with high accuracy and low ambiguity (Curran et al., 2006).",
        "The combination of finite-state supertagging and highly engineered C++ leads to a parser which can analyse up to 30 sentences per second on standard hardware (Clark and Curran, 2004a).",
        "The C&C tools also contain a number of Maximum Entropy taggers, including the CCG supertagger, a pos tagger (Curran and Clark, 2003a), chun- Proceedings of the ACL 2007 Demo Prague, June 2007.",
        "©2007 Associat ker, and named entity recogniser (Curran and Clark, 2003b).",
        "The taggers are highly efficient, with processing speeds of over 100,000 words per second.",
        "Finally, the various components, including the morphological analyser morpha (Minnen et al., 2001), are combined into a single program.",
        "The output from this program – a ccg derivation, pos tags, lemmas, and named entity tags – is used by the module Boxer (Bos, 2005) to produce interpretable structure in the form of Discourse Representation Structures (drss)."

        "The grammar used by the parser is extracted from CCGbank, a CCG version of the Penn Treebank (Hockenmaier, 2003).",
        "The grammar consists of 425 lexical categories, expressing subcategorisation information, plus a small number of combinatory rules which combine the categories (Steedman, 2000).",
        "A Maximum Entropy supertagger first assigns lexical categories to the words in a sentence (Curran et al., 2006), which are then combined by the parser using the combinatory rules and the CKY algorithm.",
        "Clark and Curran (2004b) describes log-linear parsing models for CCG.",
        "The features in the models are defined over local parts of ccg derivations and include word-word dependencies.",
        "A disadvantage of the log-linear models is that they require cluster computing resources for practical training (Clark and Curran, 2004b).",
        "We have also investigated per-ceptron training for the parser (Clark and Curran, 2007b), obtaining comparable accuracy scores and similar training times (a few hours) compared with the log-linear models.",
        "The significant advantage of",
        "d Poster Sessions, pages 33-36, i for Computational Linguistics",
        "the perceptron training is that it only requires a single processor.",
        "The training is online, updating the model parameters one sentence at a time, and it converges in a few passes over the CCGbank data.",
        "A packed chart representation allows efficient decoding, with the same algorithm – the Viterbi algorithm – finding the highest scoring derivation for the log-linear and perceptron models.",
        "The supertagger uses Maximum Entropy tagging techniques (Section 3) to assign a set of lexical categories to each word (Curran et al., 2006).",
        "Supertag-ging has been especially successful for ccg: Clark and Curran (2004a) demonstrates the considerable increases in speed that can be obtained through use of a supertagger.",
        "The supertagger interacts with the parser in an adaptive fashion: initially it assigns a small number of categories, on average, to each word in the sentence, and the parser attempts to create a spanning analysis.",
        "If this is not possible, the supertagger assigns more categories, and this process continues until a spanning analysis is found.",
        "The parser produces various types of output.",
        "Figure 1 shows the dependency output for the example sentence But Mr. Barnum called that a worst-case scenario.",
        "The ccg dependencies are defined in terms of the arguments within lexical categories; for example, {(S[del\\\\NPt)/NP2,2) represents the direct object of a transitive verb.",
        "The parser also outputs grammatical relations (grs) consistent with Briscoe et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "The grs are derived through a manually created mapping from the ccg dependencies, together with a python post-processing script which attempts to remove any differences between the two annotation schemes (for example the way in which coordination is analysed).",
        "The parser has been evaluated on the predicate-argument dependencies in CCGbank, obtaining labelled precision and recall scores of 84.8% and 84.5% on Section 23.",
        "We have also evaluated the parser on DepBank, using the Grammatical Relations output.",
        "The parser scores 82.4% labelled precision and 81.2% labelled recall overall.",
        "Clark and Curran (2007a) gives precison and recall scores broken down by relation type and also compares the performance of the ccg parser with the rasp parser (Briscoe etal.,2006)."

        "drt (Kamp and Reyle, 1993), and is capable of generating the boxlike structures of drt known as Discourse Representation Structures (drss).",
        "drt is a formal semantic theory backed up with a model theory, and it demonstrates a large coverage of linguistic phenomena.",
        "Boxer follows the formal theory closely, introducing discourse referents for noun phrases and events in the domain of a drs, and their properties in the conditions of a drs.",
        "one deviation with the standard theory is the adoption of a Neo-Davidsonian analysis of events and roles.",
        "Boxer also implements Van der Sandt's theory of presupposition projection treating proper names and defininite descriptions as anaphoric expressions, by binding them to appropriate previously introduced discourse referents, or accommodating on a suitable level of discourse representation.",

        "drs-conditions are either basic or complex.",
        "The basic drs-conditions supported by Boxer are: equality, stating that two discourse referents refer to the same entity; one-place relations, expressing properties of discourse referents; two place relations, expressing binary relations between discourse referents; and names and time expressions.",
        "Complex drs-conditions are: negation of a drs; disjunction of two drss; implication (one drs implying another); and propositional, relating a discourse referent to a drs.",
        "Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs introduce one-place relations, whose meaning is represented by the corresponding lemma.",
        "Verb roles and prepositions introduce two-place relations.",
        "The input for Boxer is a list of ccg derivations decorated with named entities, pos tags, and lemmas for nouns and verbs.",
        "By default, each ccg derivation produces one drs.",
        "However, it is possible for one drs to span several ccg derivations; this enables Boxer to deal with cross-sentential phenomena such as pronouns and presupposition.",
        "Boxer provides various output formats.",
        "The default output is a drs in Prolog format, with discourse referents represented as Prolog variables.",
        "Other output options include: a flat structure, in which the recursive structure of a drs is unfolded by labelling each drs and drs-condition; an XML format; and an easy-to-read boxlike structure as found in textbooks and articles on drt.",
        "Figure 2 shows the easy-to-read output for the sentence But Mr. Barnum called that a worst-case scenario.",
        "The semantic representations can also be output as first-order formulas.",
        "This is achieved using the standard translation from drs to first-order logic (Kamp and Reyle, 1993), and allows the output to be pipelined into off-the-shelf theorem provers or model builders for first-order logic, to perform consistency or informativeness checking (Blackburn and Bos, 2005)."

        "Another feature of the input/output is that other fields can be read in which are not used in the tagging process, and also form part of the output.",
        "The c&c tools use a configuration management system which allows the user to override all of the default parameters for training and running the taggers and parser.",
