        "With increasing usages of messenger and SMS, we need an efficient text normalizer that processes colloquial style sentences.",
        "As in the case of general literary sentences, correcting word spacing error and spelling error is the very essential problem with colloquial style sentences.",
        "In order to correct word spacing errors, many algorithms were used, which can be divided into statistical algorithms and rule-based algorithms.",
        "Statistical algorithms generally use character n-gram (Eojeol or Eumjeol n-gram in Korean) (Kang and Woo, 2001; Kwon, 2002) or noisy-channel model (Gao et.",
        "al., 2003).",
        "Rule-based algorithms are mostly heuristic algorithms that reflect linguistic knowledge (Yang et al., 2005) to solve word spacing problem.",
        "Word spacing problem is treated especially in Japanese or Chinese,",
        "Eumjeol is a Korean syllable.",
        "which does not use word boundary, or Korean, which is normally segmented into Eojeols, not into words or morphemes.",
        "The previous algorithms for spelling error correction basically use a word dictionary.",
        "Each word in a sentence is compared to word dictionary entries, and if the word is not in the dictionary, then the system assumes that the word has spelling errors.",
        "Then corrected candidate words are suggested by the system from the word dictionary, according to some metric to measure the similarity between the target word and its candidate word, such as edit-distance (Kashyap and Oommen, 1984; Mays et al., 1991).",
        "But these previous algorithms have a critical limitation: They all corrected word spacing errors and spelling errors separately.",
        "Word spacing algorithms define the problem as a task for determining whether to insert the delimiter between characters or not.",
        "Since the determination is made according to the characters, the algorithms cannot work if the characters have spelling errors.",
        "Likewise, algorithms for solving spelling error problem cannot work well with word spacing errors.",
        "To cope with the limitation, there is an algorithm proposed for Japanese (Nagata, 1996).",
        "Japanese sentence cannot be divided into words, but into chunks (bunsetsu in Japanese), like Eojeol in Korean.",
        "The proposed system is for sentences recognized by OCR, and it uses character transition probabilities and POS (part of speech) tag n-gram.",
        "However it needs a word dictionary and takes long time for searching many character combinations.",
        "We propose a new algorithm which can correct both word spacing error and spelling error simultaneously for Korean.",
        "This algorithm is based on noisy-channel model, which uses Jaso transition probabilities and Eojeol transition probabilities to create spelling correction candidates.",
        "Candidates are increased in number by inserting the blank characters on the created candidates, which cover the spacing error correction candidates.",
        "We find the best candidate sentence from the networks of Ja-so/Eojeol candidates.",
        "This method decreases the size of Eojeol transition pattern dictionary and corrects the patterns which are not in the dictionary.",
        "The remainder of this paper is as follows: Section 2 describes why we use Jaso transition probability for Korean.",
        "Section 3 describes the proposed model in detail.",
        "Section 4 provides the experiment results and analyses.",
        "Finally, section 5 presents our conclusion.",
        "2 Spelling Error Correction with Jaso Transition Probabilities",
        "We can use Eumjeol transition probabilities or Jaso transition probabilities for spelling error correction for Korean.",
        "We choose Jaso transition probabilities because there are several advantages.",
        "Since an Eumjeol is a combination of 3 Jasos, the number of all possible Eumjeols is much larger than that of all possible Jasos.",
        "In other words, Jaso-based language model is smaller than Eumjeol-based language model.",
        "Various errors in Eumjeol (even if they do not appear as an Eumjeol pattern in a training corpus) can be corrected by correction in Jaso unit.",
        "Also, Jaso transition probabilities can be extracted from relatively small corpus.",
        "This merit is very important since we do not normally have such a huge corpus which is very hard to collect, since we have to pair the spelling errors with corresponding corrections.",
        "We obtain probabilities differently for each case: single Jaso transition case, two Jaso's transition case, and more than two Jasos transition case.",
        "In single Jaso transition case, the spelling errors are corrected by only one Jaso transition (e.g. ^jjo^^oj-o^ / Of).",
        "The case of correcting by deleting Jaso is also one of the single Jaso transition case (M^^M-^- / ^^X).",
        "The Jaso transition probabilities are calculated by counting the transition frequencies in a training corpus.",
        "In two Jaso's transition case, the spelling errors are corrected by adjacent two Jasos transition (#_2_^2iiL / yo y).",
        "In this case, we treat two Jaso's as one transition unit.",
        "The transition probability calculation is the same as above.",
        "In more than two Jaso's transition case, the spelling errors cannot be corrected only by Jaso transition (^-^H^).",
        "In this case, we treat the whole Eojeols as one transition unit, and build an Eojeol transition pattern dictionary for these special cases.",
        "3 A Joint Statistical Model for Word Spacing and Spelling Error Correction",
        "Given a sentence T which includes both word spacing errors and spelling errors, we create correction candidates C from T, and find the best candidate C' that has the highest transition probability from C .",
        "A given sentence T and candidates C consist of Eumjeol s: and the blank character b:.",
        "T = S1b1S2b2S3b3.",
        "..Snbn .",
        "(n is the number of Eumjeols) Eumjeol s: consists of 3 Jasos, Choseong (onset), Jungseong (nucleus), and Jongseong (coda).",
        "The empty Jaso is defined as 'X'.",
        "b: is ' B ' when the blank exists, and ' O ' when the blank does not exist.",
        "= argmaxCP(T | C)P(C).",
        "5 'X' indicates that there is no Jaso in that position.",
        "P(C) can be obtained using trigrams of Eum-jeols (with the blank character) that C includes.",
        "And P(T \\ C) can be written as multiplication of each Jaso transition probability and the blank character transition probability.",
        "= n[P(i \\ Jn)P(in \\ Jl2)P(i \\ ja)P(bi \\ bi)].",
        "We use logarithm of P(C \\ T) in implementation.",
        "Figure 1 shows how the system creates the Jaso candidates network.",
        "In Figure 1, the topmost line is the sequence of Jasos of the input sentence.",
        "Each Eumjeol in the sentence is decomposed into 3 Jasos as above, and each Jaso has its own correction candidates.",
        "For example, Jaso ' o' at 4th column has its candidates 'l' and 'X'.",
        "And two jaso's eX=i' at 13thand 14th column has its candidates '-&=)', '=\"-&', and 'no'.",
        "The undermost gray square is an Eojeol (which is decomposed into Jasos) candidate ' o-] Xtc^-Sr-H] X' created from ' o-H, X=H]X'.",
        "Each jaso candidate has its own transition probability, log P( jik \\ jk ) , that is used for calculating P(C \\ T) .",
        "In order to calculate P(C) , we need Eumjeolbased candidate network.",
        "Hence, we convert the above Jaso candidate network into Eumjeol/Eojeol candidate network.",
        "Figure 2 shows part of the final network briefly.",
        "At this time, the blank characters ' B ' and ' O ' are inserted into each Eum-jeol/Eojeol candidates.",
        "To find the best path from the candidates, we conduct viterbi-search from leftmost node corresponding to the beginning of the sentence.",
        "When Eumjeol/Eojeol candidates are selected, the algorithm prunes the candidates according to the accumulated probabilities, doing beam search.",
        "Once the best path is found, the sentence corrected by both spacing and spelling errors is extracted by backtracking the path.",
        "In Figure 2, thick squares represent the nodes selected by the best path.",

        "If test sentences have no or few blank characters, then we simply use joint algorithm to correct both errors.",
