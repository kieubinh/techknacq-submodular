        "However, these dimensions as well as the implicit metadata for the corpus are difficult to exploit by NLP tools due to their particular coding schemes.",
        "This paper describes work on the generation of annotation and metadata databases in order to increase the usability of these components of the AMI Corpus.",
        "In the following sections we describe the problem, present the current solutions and give future directions."

      "text": [
        "The AMI Meeting Corpus is publicly available at http://corpus.amiproject.org and contains the following media files: audio (headset mikes plus lapel, array and mix), video (close up, wide angle), slides capture, whiteboard and paper notes.",
        "In addition, all annotations described in Section 1 are available in one large bundle.",
        "Annotators followed dimension-specific guidelines and used the it is encoded in the file or folder names or appears to be split in several resource files.",
        "We define here annotations as the time-dependent information which is abstracted from the input media, i.e. \"higher-level\" phenomena derived from low-level mono-or multi-modal features.",
        "Conversely, metadata is defined as the static information about a meeting that is not directly related to its content (see examples in Section 4).",
        "Therefore, though not necessarily time-dependent, structural information derived from meeting-related documents would constitute an annotation and not metadata.",
        "These definitions are not universally accepted, but they allow us to separate the two types of information.",
        "The main goal of the present work is to facilitate the use of the AMI Corpus metadata and annotations as part of the larger objective of automating the generation of annotation and metadata databases to enhance search and browsing of meeting recordings.",
        "This goal can be achieved by providing plug-and-play databases, which are much easier to access than NXT files and provide declarative rather than implicit metadata.",
        "One of the challenges in the NXT-to-database conversion is the extraction of relevant information, which is done here by solving NXT pointers and discarding NXT-specific markup to group all information for a phenomenon in only one structure or table.",
        "The following criteria were important when defining the conversion procedure and database tables:",
        "• Simplicity: the structure of the tables should be easy to understand, and should be close to the annotation dimensions – ideally one table per annotation.",
        "Some information can be duplicated in several tables to make them more intelligible.",
        "This makes the update of this information more difficult, but as this concerns a recorded corpus, changes are less likely to occur; if such changes do occur, they would first be input in the annotation files, from which a new set of tables can easily be generated.",
        "• Reusability: the tools allow anyone to recreate the tables from the official distribution of the annotation files.",
        "Therefore, if the format of the annotation files or folders changes, or if a different format is desired for the tables, it is quite easy to change the tools to generate a new ver-",
        "sion of the database tables.",
        "• Applicability: the tables are ready to be loaded into any SQL database, so that they can be immediately used by a meeting browser plugged into the database.",
        "Although we report one solution here, there are other approaches to the same problem relying, for example, on different database structures using more or fewer tables to represent this information."

      "heading": "3. Annotations: Generation of Tables",
      "text": [
        "The first goal is to convert the NXT files from the AMI Corpus into a compact tabular representation (tab-separated text files), using a simple, declarative and easily updatable conversion procedure.",
        "The conversion principle is the following: for each type of annotation, which is generally stored in a specific folder of the data distribution, an XSLT stylesheet converts the NXT XML file into a tab-separated text file, possibly using information from one or more annotations.",
        "The stylesheets resolve most of the NXT pointers, by including redundant information into the tables, in order to speed up queries by avoiding frequent joins.",
        "A Perl script applies the respective XSLT stylesheet to each annotation file according to its type, and generates the global tab-separated files for each annotation.",
        "The script also generates an SQL script that creates a relational annotation database and populates it with data from the tab-separated files.",
        "The Perl script also summarizes the results into a log file named <timestamp> .log.",

        "As mentioned in Section 2, metadata denotes here any static information about a meeting, not directly related to its content.",
        "The main metadata items are: date, time, location, scenario, participants, participant-related information (codename, age, gender, knowledge of English and other languages), relations to media-files (participants vs. audio channels vs. files), and relations to other documents produced during the meeting (slides, individual and whiteboard notes).",
        "This important information is spread in many places, and can be found as attributes of a meeting in the annotation files (e.g. start time) or obtained by parsing file names (e.g. audio channel, camera).",
        "The relations to media files are gathered from different resource files: mainly the meetings.xml and participants.xml files.",
        "An additional problem in reconstructing such relations (e.g. files generated by a specific participant) is that information about the media resources must be obtained directly from the AMI Corpus distribution web site, since the media resources are not listed explicitly in the annotation files.",
        "This implies using different strategies to extract the metadata: for example, stylesheets are the best option to deal with the above-mentioned XML files, while a crawler script is used for HTTP access to the distribution site.",
        "However, the solution adopted for annotations in Section 3 can be reused with one major extension and applied to the construction of the metadata database.",
        "The standard chosen for the explicit metadata files is the IMDI format, proposed by the ISLE Meta Data Initiative (Wittenburg et al., 2002; Broeder et al., 2004a) (see http://www.mpi.nl/IMDI/tools), which is precisely intended to describe multimedia recordings of dialogues.",
        "This standard provides a flexible and extensive schema to store the defined metadata either in specific IMDI elements or as additional key/value pairs.",
        "The metadata generated for the AMI Corpus can be explored with the IMDI BC-Browser (Broeder et al., 2004b), a tool that is freely available and has useful features such as search or metadata editing.",

        "with no need to repeatedly parse file names or analyse folders.",
        "Moreover, the advantage of creating IMDI files is that the metadata is compliant with a widely used standard accompanied by freely available tools such as the metadata browser.",
        "These results will also help disseminating the AMI Corpus.",
        "As a by-product of the development of annotation and metadata conversion tools, we performed a consistency checking and reported a number of to the corpus administrators.",
        "The automatic processing of the entire annotation and metadata set enabled us to test initial hypotheses about annotation structure.",
        "In the future we plan to include the AMI Corpus metadata in public catalogues, through the Open (Language) Archives Initiatives network (Bird and Simons, 2001), as well as through the IMDI network (Wittenburg et al., 2004).",
        "The metadata repository will be harvested by answering the OAI-PMH protocol, and the AMI Corpus website could become itself a metadata provider."
