        "In task-manipulation situations where the listener manipulates objects by following the speaker's instructions, correct task manipulation by the listener serves as more direct evidence of understanding (Brennan 2000, Clark and Krych 2004), and affects the speaker's dialogue control strategies.",

        "nothing, the instructor gives the instruction in small pieces, simultaneously modifying her gestures and utterances according to the learner's mouse movements.",
        "To accomplish such interaction between human users and animated help agents, and to assist the user through natural conversational interaction, this paper proposes a probabilistic model that computes timing dependencies among different types of behaviors in different modalities: speech, gestures, and mouse events.",
        "The model predicts (a) whether the instructor's current utterance will be successfully understood by the learner and grounded (Clark and Schaefer 1989), and (b) whether the learner will successfully manipulate the object in the near future.",
        "These predictions can be used as constraints in determining agent actions.",
        "For example, if the current utterance will not be grounded, then the help agent must add more information.",
        "In the following sections, first, we collect human-agent conversations by employing a Wizard-of-Oz method, and annotate verbal and nonverbal behaviors.",
        "The annotated corpus is used to build a Bayesian network model for the multimodal instruction dialogues.",
