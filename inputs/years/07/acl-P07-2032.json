        "Web 2.0 leads to the proliferation of user generated content, such as blogs, wikis and forums.",
        "Key properties of user generated content are: low publication threshold and a lack of editorial control.",
        "Therefore, the quality of this content may vary.",
        "The end user has problems to navigate through large repositories of information and find information of high quality quickly.",
        "In order to address this problem, many forum hosting companies like Google Groups and Nabble introduce rating mechanisms, where users can rate the information manually on a scale from 1 (low quality) to 5 (high quality).",
        "The ratings have been shown to be consistent with the user community by Lampe and Resnick (2004).",
        "However, the percentage of manually rated posts is very low (0.1% in Nabble).",
        "Departing from this, the main idea explored in the present paper is to investigate the feasibility of automatically assessing the perceived quality of user generated content.",
        "We test this idea for online forum discussions in the domain of software.",
        "The perceived quality is not an objective measure.",
        "Rather, it models how the community at large perceives post quality.",
        "We choose a machine learning approach to automatically assess it.",
        "Our main contributions are: (1) An algorithm for automatic quality assessment of forum posts that learns from human ratings.",
        "We evaluate the system on online discussions in the software domain.",
        "(2) An analysis of the usefulness of different classes of features for the prediction of post quality."
