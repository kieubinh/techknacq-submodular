        "(Demetriou et al., 2000) generated N-best lists from phoneme confusion data acquired from a speech recognizer, and a pronunciation lexicon.",
        "Then sentence hypotheses of varying Word-Error-Rate (WER) were generated based on sentences from different genres from the British National Corpus (BNC).",
        "It was shown by them that the semantic model can improve recognition, where the amount of improvement varies with context length and sentence length.",
        "Thereby it was shown that these models can make use of long-term information.",
        "In this paper the best performing measures from (Pucher, 2005), which outperform baseline models on word prediction for conversational telephone speech are used for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in multi-party meetings.",
        "Thereby we want to investigate if WordNet-based models can be used for rescoring of 'real' N-best lists in a difficult task.",
        "The standard n-gram approach in language modeling for speech recognition cannot cope with long-term dependencies.",
        "Therefore (Bellegarda, 2000) proposed combining n-gram language models, which are effective for predicting local dependencies, with Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) based models for covering long-term dependencies.",

        "S(w) are the senses of word w. Definition 2 also performs wordsense disambiguation.",
        "The relatedness of a word and a context (relw) is defined as the average of the relatedness of the word and all words in the context.",
        "The performance of the word-context relatedness (Definition 3) shows how well the measures work for algorithms that proceed in a left-to-right manner, since the context is restricted to words that have already been seen.",
        "For the rescoring of N-best lists it is not necessary to proceed in a left-to-right manner.",
        "The word-utterance-context relatedness can be used for the rescoring of N-best lists.",
        "This relatedness does not only use the context of the preceding words, but the whole utterance.",
        "Suppose U = (wi,..., wn) is an utterance.",
        "Let pre(wi, U) be the set [jj<i Wj and post(wi, U) be the set (Jj>i Wj.",

        "It is based on the word-utterance-context relatedness (Definition 4).",
        "The second coherence measure (Definition 9) is a pure inner-utterance-coherence, which means that no history apart from the utterance is needed.",

        "If only the elements in an N-best list are considered, log-linear interpolation can be used since it is not necessary to normalize over all sentences.",
        "Then there is only one parameter A to optimize, which is done with a brute force approach.",
        "For this optimization a small part of the test data is taken and the WER is computed for different values ofA.",
        "As a baseline the n-gram mixture model trained on all available training data 1 billion words) is used.",

        "We showed how to define more and more complex relatedness measures on top of the basic relatedness measures between word senses.",

        "It was shown that speech recognition of multi-party meetings cannot be improved compared to a 4-gram baseline model, when using WordNet models.",
        "One reason for the poor performance of the models could be that the task of rescoring simulated N-best lists, as presented in (Demetriou et al., 2000), is significantly easier than the rescoring of 'real' N-best lists.",
        "(Pucher, 2005) has shown that WordNet models can outperform simple random models on the task of word prediction, in spite of the noise that is introduced through word-sense disambiguation and POS tagging.",
        "To improve the wordsense disambiguation one could use the approach proposed by (Basili et al., 2004).",
        "In the above WER experiments a 4-gram baseline model was used, which was trained on nearly 1 billion words.",
        "In (Demetriou et al., 2000) a simpler baseline has been used.",
        "650 sentences were used there to generate sentence hypotheses with different WER using phoneme confusion data and a pronunciation lexicon.",
        "Experiments with simpler baseline models ignore that these simpler models are not used in today's recognition systems.",
        "We think that these prediction models can still be useful for other tasks where only small amounts of training data are available.",
        "Another possibility of improvement is to use other interpolation techniques like the maximum entropy framework.",
        "WordNet-based models could also be improved by using a trigger-based approach.",
        "This could be done by not using the whole WordNet and its similarities, but defining word-trigger pairs that are used for rescoring."
