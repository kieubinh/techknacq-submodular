        "Related word sets are useful linguistic resources for language understanding and generation, information retrieval, and so on.",
        "In previous research on natural language processing, many methodologies for extracting various relations from corpora have been developed, such as the \"is-a\" relation (Hearst 1992), \"part-oP relation (Berland and Charniak 1999), causal relation (Girju 2003), and entailment relation (Geffet and Dagan 2005).",
        "Related words can be used to support retrieval in order to lead users to high-quality information.",
        "One simple method is to provide additional words related to the key words users have input, such as an input support function within the Google search engine.",
        "What kind of relation between the key words that have been input and the additional word is effective for information retrieval?",
        "As for the relations among words, at least two kinds of relations exist: the taxonomical relation and the thematic relation.",
        "The former is a relation representing the physical resemblance among objects, which is typically a semantic relation such as a hierarchal, synonymic, or antonymic relation; the latter is a relation between objects through a thematic scene, such as \"milk\" and \"cow\" as recollected in the scene \"milking a cow,\" and \"milk\" and \"baby,\" as recollected in the scene \"giving baby milk,\" which include causal relation and entailment relation.",
        "Wisniewski and Bassok (1999) showed that both relations are important in recognizing those objects.",
        "However, while taxonomical relations are comparatively easy to identify from linguistic resources such as dictionaries and thesauri, thematic relations are difficult to identify because they are rarely maintained in linguistic resources.",
        "In this paper, we sought to extract word sets with a thematic relation from documents by employing case-marking particles derived from syntactic analysis.",

      "text": [
        "In order to derive word sets that direct users to obtain information, we applied a method based on the Complementary Similarity Measure (CSM), which can determine a relation between two words in a corpus by estimating inclusive relations between two vectors representing each appearance pattern for each words (Yamamoto et al.",
        "2005).",
        "We first extracted word pairs having an inclusive relation between the words by calculating the CSM values.",
        "Extracted word pairs are expressed by a tuple <wi5 Wj>, where CSM(Vi, Vj) is greater than CSM(Vj, V,) when words wi and wj have each appearance pattern represented by each binary vector Viand Vj.",
        "Then, we connected word pairs with CSM values greater than a certain threshold and constructed word sets.",
        "A feature of the CSM-based method is that it can extract not only pairs of related words but also sets of related words because it connects tuples consistently.",
        "Suppose we have <A, B>, <B, C>, <Z, B>, <C, D>, <C, E>, and <C, F> in the order of their CSM values, which are greater than the threshold.",
        "For example, let <B, C> be an initial word set {B, C}.",
        "First, we find the tuple with the greatest CSM value among the tuples in which the word C at the tail of the current word set is the left word, and connect the right word behind C. In this example, word \"D\" is connected to {B, C} because <C, D> has the greatest CSM value among the three tuples <C, D>, <C, E>, and <C, F>, making the current word set {B, C, D}.",
        "This process is repeated until no tuples exist.",
        "Next, we find the tuple with the greatest CSM value among the tuples in which the word B at the head of the current word set is the right word, and connect the left word before B.",
        "This process is repeated until no tuples exist.",
        "In this example, we obtain the word set {A, B, C, D}.",
        "Finally, we removed ones with a taxonomical relation by using thesaurus.",
        "The rest of the word sets have a non-taxonomical relation – including a thematic relation – among the words.",
        "We then extracted those word sets that do not agree with the thesaurus as word sets with a thematic relation."

        "Recently, there has been a study on query expansion with this thesaurus as domain information (Friberg 2007).",
        "We extracted word sets by utilizing inclusive relations of the appearance pattern between words based on a modified/modifier relationship in documents.",
        "The Japanese language has case-marking particles that indicate the semantic relation between two elements in a dependency relation.",
        "Then, we collected from documents dependency relations matching the following five patterns; \"A <no (of)> B,\" \"P <wo (object)> V,\" \"Q <ga (subject)> V,\" \"R <ni (dative)> V,\" and \"S <ha (topic)> V,\" where A, B, P, Q, R, and S are nouns, V is a verb, and <X> is a case-marking particle.",
        "From such collected dependency relations, we compiled the following types of experimental data; NN-data based on co-occurrence between nouns for each sentence, NV-data based on a dependency relation between noun and verb for each case-marking particle <wo>, <ga>, <ni>, and <ha>, and SO-data based on a collocation between subject and object that depends on the same verb V as the subject.",
        "These data are represented with a binary vector which corresponds to the appearance pattern of a noun and these vectors are used as arguments of CSM.",
        "We translated descriptors in the MeSH thesaurus into Japanese and used them as Japanese medical terms.",
        "The number of terms appearing in this experiment is 2,557 among them.",
        "We constructed word sets consisting of these medical terms.",
        "Then, we chose 977 word sets consisting of three or more terms from them, and removed word sets with a taxonomical relation from them with the MeSH thesaurus in order to obtain the rest 847 word sets as word sets with a thematic relation."
