        "We examine techniques for extending WordNets.",
        "In this section we describe the relation we focus on, introduce our evaluation approach and explain the query format used for obtaining web results.",
        "We concentrate on a particular semantic relation: hypernymy.",
        "One term is a hypernym of another if its meaning both covers the meaning of the second term and is broader.",
        "For example, furniture is a hy-pernym of table.",
        "The opposite term for hypernym is hyponym.",
        "So table is a hyponym of furniture.",
        "Hy-pernymy is a transitive relation.",
        "If term A is a hyper-nym of term B while term B is a hypernym of term",
        "C then term A is also a hypernym of term C.",
        "In WordNets, hypernym relations are defined between senses of words (synsets).",
        "The Dutch WordNet (Vossen, 1998) contains 659,284 of such hy-pernym noun pairs of which 100,268 are immediate links and 559,016 are inherited by transitivity.",
        "More importantly, the resource contains hypernym information for 45,979 different nouns.",
        "A test with a Dutch newspaper text revealed that the WordNet only covered about two-thirds of the noun lemmas in the newspaper (among the missing words were e-mail, euro and provider).",
        "Proper names pose an even larger problem: the Dutch WordNet only contains 1608 words that start with a capital character.",
        "In order to find evidence for the existence of hyper-nym relations between words, we search the web for fixed patterns like H such as A, B and C. Following Snow et al.",
        "(2006), we derive two types of evidence from these patterns:",
        "• H is a hypernym of A, B and C",
        "• A, B and C are siblings of each other",
        "Here, sibling refers to the relative position of the words in the hypernymy tree.",
        "Two words are siblings of each other if they share a parent.",
        "We compute a hypernym evidence score S(h, w) for each candidate hypernym h for word w. It is the sum of the normalized evidence for the hypernymy relation between h and w, and the evidence for sibling relations between w and known hyponyms s of h:",
        "where fhw is the frequency of patterns that predict that h is a hypernym of w, gsw is the frequency of patterns that predict that s is a sibling of w, and x and y are arbitrary words from the WordNet.",
        "For each word w, we select the candidate hypernym h with the largest score S(h, w).",
        "For each hyponym, we only consider evidence for hypernyms and siblings.",
        "We have experimented with different scoring schemes, for example by including evidence from hypernyms ofhypernyms and remote siblings, but found this basic scoring scheme to perform best.",
        "We use the Dutch part of EuroWordNet (DWN) (Vossen, 1998) for evaluation of our hypernym extraction methods.",
        "Hypernym-hyponym pairs that are present in the lexicon are assumed to be correct.",
        "In order to have access to negative examples, we make the same assumption as Snow et al.",
        "(2005): the hy-pernymy relations in the WordNets are complete for the terms that they contain.",
        "This means that if two words are present in the lexicon without the target relation being specified between them, then we assume that this relation does not hold between them.",
        "The presence of positive and negative examples allows for an automatic evaluation in which precision, recall and F values are computed.",
        "We do not require our search method to find the exact position of a target word in the hypernymy tree.",
        "Instead, we are satisfied with any ancestor.",
        "In order to rule out identification methods which simply return the top node of the hierarchy for all words, we also measure the distance between the assigned hypernym and the target word.",
        "The ideal distance is one, which would occur if the suggested ancestor is a parent.",
        "Grandparents are associated with distance two and so on.",
        "In order to collect evidence for lexical relations, we search the web for lexical patterns.",
        "When working with a fixed corpus on disk, an exhaustive search can be performed.",
        "For web search, however, this is not possible.",
        "Instead, we rely on acquiring interesting lexical patterns from text snippets returned for specific queries.",
        "The format of the queries has been based on three considerations.",
        "First, a general query like such as is insufficient for obtaining much interesting information.",
        "Most web search engines impose a limit on the number of results returned from a query (for example 1000), which limits the opportunities for assessing the performance of such a general pattern.",
        "In order to obtain useful information, the query needs to be more specific.",
        "For the pattern such as, we have two options: adding the hypernym, which gives hypernym such as, or adding the hyponym, which results in such as hyponym.",
        "Both extensions of the general pattern have their limitations.",
        "A pattern that includes the hypernym may fail to generate enough useful information if the hypernym has many hyponyms.",
        "And patterns with hyponyms require more queries than patterns with hypernyms (one per child rather than one per parent).",
        "We chose to include hyponyms in the patterns.",
        "This approach models the real world task in which one is looking for the meaning of an unknown entity.",
        "The final consideration regards which hyponyms to use in the queries.",
        "Our focus is on evaluating the approach via comparison with an existing WordNet.",
        "Rather than submitting queries for all 45,979 nouns in the lexical resource to the web search engine, we will use a random sample of nouns."

        "In earlier work (Tjong Kim Sang and Hofmann, 2007), we have applied different methods for obtaining hypernym candidates for words.",
        "First, we extracted hypernyms from a large text corpus (300Mwords) following the approach of Snow et al.",
        "(2006).",
        "We collected 16728 different contexts in which hypernym-hyponym pairs were found and evaluated individual context patterns as well as a combination which made use of Bayesian Logistic Regression.",
        "We also examined a single pattern predicting only sibling relations: A en(and) B.",
        "Additionally, we have applied a corpus-independent morphological approach which takes advantage of the fact that in Dutch, compound words often have the head in the final position (like blackbird in English).",
        "The head is a good hypernym candidate for the compound and therefore long words which end with a legal Dutch word often have this suffix as hypernym (Sabou et al., 2005).",
        "The results of the approaches can be found in Table 1.",
        "The corpus approaches achieve reasonable precision rates.",
        "The recall scores are low because we attempt to retrieve a hypernym for all nouns in the WordNet.",

        "Predicting valid suffixes of words as their hypernyms, outperforms the corpus approaches.",
        "ods, both with respect to precision and recall.",
        "For our web extraction work, we used the same individual extraction patterns as in the corpus work: zoals (such as) and en (and), but not the combined hypernym patterns because the expected performance did not make up for the time complexity involved.",
        "We added randomly selected candidate hyponyms to the queries to improve the chance to retrieve interesting information.",
        "This approach worked well.",
        "As Table 2 shows, for both patterns the recall score improved in comparison with the corpus experiments.",
        "Additionally, the single web hypernym pattern zoals outperformed the combination of corpus hypernym patterns with respect to recall and distance.",
        "Again, the conjunctive pattern outperformed the hypernym pattern.",
        "We assume that the frequency of the two patterns plays an important role (the frequency of pages with the conjunctive pattern is five times the frequency of pages with zoals).",
        "Finally, we combined word-internal information with the conjunctive pattern approach by adding the morphological candidates to the web evidence before computing hypernym pair scores.",
        "This approach achieved the highest recall score at only slight precision loss (Table 2).",
        "We have inspected the output of the conjunctive web extraction with word-internal information.",
        "For this purpose we have selected the ten most frequent hy-pernym pairs (Table 3), the ten least frequent and the ten pairs exactly between these two groups.",
