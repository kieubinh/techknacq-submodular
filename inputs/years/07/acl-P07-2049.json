        "Recently the task of multi-document summarization in response to a complex user query has received considerable attention.",
        "In generic summarization, the summary is meant to give an overview of the information in the documents.",
        "By contrast, when the summary is produced in response to a user query or topic (query-focused, topic-focused, or generally focused summary), the topic/query determines what information is appropriate for inclusion in the summary, making the task potentially more challenging.",
        "In this paper we present an analytical study of two questions regarding aspects of the topic-focused scenario.",
        "First, two estimates of importance on words have been used very successfully both in generic and query-focused summarization: frequency (Luhn, 1958; Nenkova et al., 2006; Vanderwende et al., 2006) and loglikelihood ratio (Lin and Hovy, 2000; Conroy et al., 2006; Lacatusu et al., 2006).",
        "While both schemes have proved to be suitable for summarization, with generally better results from log-likelihood ratio, no study has investigated in what respects and by how much they differ.",
        "Second, there are many little-understood aspects of the differences between generic and query-focused summarization.",
        "For example, we'd like to know if a particular word weighting scheme is more suitable for focused summarization than others.",
        "More significantly, previous studies show that generic and focused systems perform very similarly to each other in query-focused summarization (Nenkova, 2005) and it is of interest to find out why.",
        "To address these questions we examine the two weighting schemes: raw frequency (or word probability estimated from the input), and log-likelihood ratio (LLR) and two of its variants.",
        "These metrics are used to assign importance to individual content words in the input, as we discuss below.",
        "Word probability R(w) = NN, where n is the number of times the word w appeared in the input and N is the total number of words in the input.",
        "Log-likelihood ratio (LLR) The likelihood ratio A (Manning and Schütze, 1999) uses a background corpus to estimate the importance of a word and it is proportional to the mutual information between a word w and the input to be summarized; A(w) is defined as the ratio between the probability (under a binomial distribution) of observing w in the input and the background corpus assuming equal probability of occurrence of w in both and the probability of the data assuming different probabilities for w in the input and the background corpus.",
        "LLR with cut-off (LLR(C)) A useful property of the log-likelihood ratio is that the quantity",
        "Poster Sessions, pages 193-196, i for Computational Linguistics",
        " – 2 log(A) is asymptotically well approximated by X distribution.",
        "A word appears in the input significantly more often than in the background corpus when – 2 log(A) > 10.",
        "Such words are called signature terms in Lin and Hovy (2000) who were the first to introduce the log-likelihood weighting scheme for summarization.",
        "Each descriptive word is assigned an equal weight and the rest of the words have a weight of zero:",
        "R(w) = 1 if ( – 2log(A(w)) > 10), 0 otherwise.",
        "This weighting scheme has been adopted in several recent generic and topic-focused summarizers (Con-roy et al., 2006; Lacatusu et al., 2006).",
        "LLR(CQ) The above three weighting schemes assign a weight to words regardless of the user query and are most appropriate for generic summarization.",
        "When a user query is available, it should inform the summarizer to make the summary more focused.",
        "In Conroy et al.",
        "(2006) such query sensititivity is achieved by augmenting LLR(C) with all content words from the user query, each assigned a weight of 1 equal to the weight of words defined by LLR(C) as topic words from the input to the summarizer.",
        "We used the data from the 2005 Document Understanding Conference (DUC) for our experiments.",
        "The task is to produce a 250-word summary in response to a topic defined by a user for a total of 50 topics with approximately 25 documents for each marked as relevant by the topic creator.",
        "In computing LLR, the remaining 49 topics were used as a background corpus as is often done by DUC participants.",
        "A sample topic (d301) shows the complexity of the queries:",
        "Identify and describe types of organized crime that crosses borders or involves more than one country.",
        "Name the countries involved.",
        "Also identify the perpetrators involved with each type of crime, including both individuals and organizations if possible."

        "In the focused condition there was little (for LLR weighting) or no (for frequency) improvement over generic.",
        "One possible explanation for the lack of clear improvement in the focused setting is that there are not enough relevant sentences, making it impossible to get stable estimates of word importance.",
        "Alternatively, it could be the case that many of the sentences are relevant, so estimates from the relevant portion of the input are about the same as those from the entire input.",
        "To distinguish between these two hypotheses, we conducted an oracle experiment.",
        "We modified the focused condition by expanding the topic words from the user query with all content words from any of the human-written summaries for the topic.",
        "This increases the number of relevant sentences for each topic.",
        "No automatic method for query expansion can be expected to give more accurate results, since the content of the human summaries is a direct indication of what information in the input was important and relevant and, moreover, the ROUGE evaluation metric is based on direct n-gram comparison with these human summaries.",
        "Even under these conditions there was no significant improvement for the summarizers, each getting better by 0.002: the frequency summarizer gets R-SU4 of 0.12048 and the LLR(CQ) summarizer achieves R-SU4 of 0.12717.",

        "These numbers indictate that rather than finding ways for query expansion, it might instead be more important to find techniques for constraining the query, determining which parts of the input are directly related to the user questions.",
        "Such techniques have been described in the recent multi-strategy approach of Lacatusu et al.",
        "(2006) for example, where one of the strategies breaks down the user topic into smaller questions that are answered using robust question-answering techniques.",
        "Frequency and log-likelihood ratio weighting for content words produce similar results when applied to rank all words in the input, while the cut-off for topicality in LLR(C) does have a positive impact on content selection.",

        "The Spearman correlation coefficient between the weights for words assigned by the two schemes is on average 0.64.",
        "At the same time, it is likely that the weights of sentences are dominated by only the top most highly weighted words.",
        "In order to see to what extent the two schemes identify the same or different words as the most important ones, we computed the overlap between the 250 most highly weighted words according to LLR and frequency.",

        "In this paper we examined two weighting schemes for estimating word importance that have been successfully used in current systems but have not to-date been directly compared.",
        "Our analysis confirmed that log-likelihood ratio leads to better results, but not because it defines a more accurate assignment of importance than raw frequency.",
        "Rather, its power comes from the use of a known distribution that makes it possible to determine which words are truly descriptive of the input.",
        "Only when such words are viewed as equally important in defining the topic does this weighting scheme show improved performance.",
        "Using the significance cut-off and considering all words above it equally important is key.",
        "Log-likelihood ratio summarizer is more sensitive to topicality or relevance and produces summaries that are better when it take the user request into account than when it does not.",
        "This is not the case for a summarizer based on frequency.",
        "At the same time it is noteworthy that the generic summarizers perform about as well as their focused counterparts.",
        "This may be related to our discovery that on average 57% of the sentences in the document are relevant and that ideal query expansion leads to a situation in which almost all sentences in the input become relevant.",
        "These facts could be an unplanned side-effect from the way the test topics were produced: annotators might have been influenced by information in the input to be sum-marizied when defining their topic.",
        "Such observations also suggest that a competitive generic summarizer would be an appropriate baseline for the topic-focused task in future DUCs.",
        "In addition, including some irrelavant documents in the input might make the task more challenging and allow more room for advances in query expansion and other summary focusing techniques."
