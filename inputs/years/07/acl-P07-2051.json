        "The trials are independent of each other, thus, local decisions are taken such that e.g. a unique GR of a verb might (erroneously) get multiply instantiated etc.",
        "Moreover, if there are alternative subcategorization frames of a verb, they must not be confused by mixing up GR from different frames to a non-existent one.",
        "Often, a subsequent filter is used to repair such inconsistent solutions.",
        "But usually there are alternative solutions, so the demand for an optimal repair arises.",
        "We apply the optimization method Integer Linear Programming (ILP) to (shallow) dependency labeling in order to generate a globally optimized consistent dependency labeling for a given sentence.",
        "A maximum entropy classifier, trained on vectors with morphological, syntactic and positional information automatically derived from the TIGER treebank (German), supplies probability vectors that are used as weights in the optimization process.",
        "Thus, the probabilities of the classifier do not any longer provide (as usually) the solution (i.e. by picking out the most probable candidate), but count as probabilistic suggestions to a - globally consistent - solution.",
        "More formally, the dependency labeling problem is: given a sentence with (i) verbs, V#, (ii) NP and PP chunks ,CU, label all pairs (VB U CU) x ) with a dependency relation (including a class for the null assignment) such that all chunks get attached and for each verb exactly one subcate-gorization frame is instantiated."
