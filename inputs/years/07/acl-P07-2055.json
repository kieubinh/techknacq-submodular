        "However, in Chinese and Japanese, words are not separated by spaces, and word boundaries must be identified before or during POS tagging.",

        "A large problem in word segmentation and POS tagging is the existence of unknown words.",

        "Many methods have been studied for Chinese and Japanese word segmentation, which include word-based methods and character-based methods.",
        "Nak-agawa (2004) studied a method which combines a word-based method and a character-based method.",
        "Given an input sentence in the method, a lattice is constructed first using a word dictionary, which consists of word-level nodes for all the known words in the sentence.",
        "These nodes have POS tags.",
        "Then, character-level nodes for all the characters in the sentence are added into the lattice (Figure 1).",
        "These nodes have position-of-character (POC) tags which indicate word-internal positions of the characters (Xue, 2003).",
        "There are four POC tags, B, I, E and S, each of which respectively indicates the beginning of a word, the middle of a word, the end of a word, and a single character word.",
        "In the method, the word-level nodes are used to identify known words, and the character-level nodes are used to identify unknown words, because generally wordlevel information is precise and appropriate for processing known words, and character-level information is robust and appropriate for processing unknown words.",
        "Extended hidden Markov models are used to choose the best path among all the possible candidates in the lattice, and the correct path is indicated by the thick lines in Figure 1.",
        "The POS tags and the POC tags are treated equally in the method.",
        "Thus, the word-level nodes and the character-level nodes are processed uniformly, and known words and unknown words are identified simultaneously.",
        "In the method, POS tags of known words as well as word boundaries are identified, but POS tags of unknown words are not identified.",
        "Therefore, we extend the method in order to conduct unknown word POS tagging too:",
        "Hybrid Method",

        "There are also two other methods capable of conducting unknown word POS tagging (Ng and Low, Word-based Post-Processing Method",
        "This method receives results of word segmentation and known word POS tagging, and predicts POS tags of unknown words using words as units (Figure 2, B).",
        "This approach is the same as the approach widely used in English POS tagging.",
        "In the method, the process of unknown word POS tagging is separated from word segmentation and known word POS tagging, and information of parts-of-speech of unknown words cannot be used for word segmentation.",
        "In later experiments, maximum entropy models were used deterministically to predict POS tags of unknown words.",
        "As features for predicting the POS tag of an unknown word w, we used the preceding and the succeeding two words of w and their POS tags, the prefixes and the suffixes of up to two characters of w, the character types contained in w, and the length of w.",
        "Character-based Post-Processing Method",
        "This method is similar to the word-based postprocessing method, but in this method, POS tags of unknown words are predicted using characters as units (Figure 2, C).",
        "In the method, POS tags of unknown words are predicted using exactly the same probabilistic models as the hybrid method, but word boundaries and POS tags of known words are fixed in the postprocessing step.",
        "Ng and Low (2004) studied Chinese word segmentation and POS tagging.",
        "They compared several approaches, and showed that character-based approaches had higher accuracy than word-based approaches, and that conducting word segmentation and POS tagging all at once performed better than conducting these processing separately.",
        "Our hybrid method is similar to their character-based all-at-once approach.",
        "However, in their experiments, only word-based and character-based methods were examined.",
        "In our experiments, the combined method of word-based and character-based processing was examined.",
