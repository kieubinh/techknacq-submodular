        "In this work, we explore supervised and semi-supervised bi-gram",
        "HMM and a ME based model.",
        "The bi-gram assumption states that the POS-tag of a word depends on the current word and the POS tag of the previous word.",
        "An ME model estimates the probabilities based on the imposed constraints.",
        "Such constraints are derived from the training data, maintaining some relationship between features and outcomes.",
        "The most probable tag sequence for a given word sequence satisfies equation (1) and (2) respectively for HMM and ME model:",
        "Here, hi is the context for word w,.",
        "Since the basic bigram model of HMM as well as the equivalent ME models do not yield satisfactory accuracy, we wish to explore whether other available resources like a morphological analyzer can be used appropriately for better accuracy.",
        "Three taggers have been implemented based on bigram HMM and ME model.",
        "The first tagger (we shall call it HMM-S) makes use of the supervised HMM model parameters, whereas the second tagger (we shall call it HMM-SS) uses the semi supervised model parameters.",
        "The third tagger uses ME based model to find the most probable tag sequence for a given sequence of words.",
        "In order to further improve the tagging accuracy, we use a Morphological Analyzer (MA) and integrate morphological information with the models.",
        "We assume that the POS-tag of a word w can take values from the set TMA(w), where TMA(w) is computed by the Morphological Analyzer.",
        "Note that the size of TMA(w) is much smaller than T. Thus, we have a restricted choice of tags as well as tag sequences for a given sentence.",
        "Since the correct tag t for w is always in TMA(w) (assuming that the morphological analyzer is complete), it is always possible to find out the correct tag sequence for a sentence even after applying the morphological restriction.",
        "Due to a much reduced set of possibilities, this model is expected to perform better for both the HMM (HMM-S and HMM-SS) and ME models even when only a small amount of labeled training text is available.",
        "We shall call these new models HMM-S+MA, HMM-SS+ MA and ME+MA.",
        "Our MA has high accuracy and coverage but it still has some missing words and a few errors.",
        "For the purpose of these experiments we have made sure that all words of the test set are present in the root dictionary that an MA uses.",
        "While MA helps us to restrict the possible choice of tags for a given word, one can also use suffix information (i.e., the sequence of last few characters of a word) to further improve the models.",
        "For HMM models, suffix information has been used during smoothing of emission probabilities, whereas for ME models, suffix information is used as another type of feature.",
        "We shall denote the models with suffix information with a '+suf' marker.",
