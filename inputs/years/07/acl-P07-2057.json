        "Dependency parsing is a way of structurally analyzing a sentence from the viewpoint of modification.",
        "In Japanese, relationships of modification between phrasal units called bunsetsu segments are analyzed.",
        "A number of studies have focused on parsing of Japanese as well as of other languages.",
        "Popular parsers are CaboCha (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002) and KNP (Kurohashi and Nagao, 1994), which were developed to analyze formal written language expressions such as that in newspaper articles.",
        "Generally, the syntactic structure of a sentence is represented as a tree, and parsing is carried out by maximizing the likelihood of the tree (Charniak, 2000; Uchimoto et al., 1999).",
        "Units that do not modify any other units, such as fillers, are difficult to place in the tree structure.",
        "Conventional parsers have forced such independent units to modify other units.",
        "Documents published by end users (e.g., blogs) are increasing on the Internet along with the growth of Web 2.0.",
        "Such documents do not use controlled written language and contain fillers and emoticons.",
        "This implies that analyzing such documents is difficult for conventional parsers.",
        "This paper presents a new method of Japanese dependency parsing that utilizes sequential labeling based on conditional random fields (CRFs) in order to analyze semi-spoken language.",
        "Concretely, sequential labeling assigns each segment a dependency label that indicates its relative position of dependency.",
        "If the label set includes self-dependency, the fillers and emoticons would be analyzed as segments depending on themselves.",
        "Therefore, since it is not necessary for the parsing result to be a tree, our method is suitable for semi-spoken language."

        "Japanese dependency parsing for written language is based on the following principles.",

        "Dependencies do not cross each other.",
        "3.",
        "Each segment, except for the top of the parsed tree, modifies at most one other segment.",
        "Our method is based on the cascaded chunking method (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2002) proposed as the CaboCha parser .",
        "CaboCha is a sort of shift-reduce parser and determines whether or not a segment depends on the next segment by using an http://www.chasen.org/~taku/software/cabocha/",
        "SVM-based classifier.",
        "To analyze long-distance dependencies, CaboCha shortens the sentence by removing segments for which dependencies are already determined and which no other segments depend on.",
        "CaboCha constructs a tree structure by repeating the above process.",
        "Sequential labeling is a process that assigns each unit of an input sequence an appropriate label (or tag).",
        "In natural language processing, it is applied to, for example, English part-of-speech tagging and named entity recognition.",
        "Hidden Markov models or conditional random fields (Lafferty et al., 2001) are used for labeling.",
        "In this paper, we use linear-chain CRFs.",
        "In sequential labeling, training data developers can design labels with no restrictions.",
        "The method proposed in this paper is a generalization of CaboCha.",
        "Our method considers not only the next segment, but also the following N segments to determine dependencies.",
        "This area, including the considered segment, is called the window, and N is called the window size.",
        "The parser assigns each segment a dependency label that indicates where the segment depends on the segments in the window.",
        "The flow is summarized as follows:",
        "1.",
        "Extract features from segments such as the part-of-speech of the headword in a segment (c.f.",

        "If not, return to Step 1.",
        "An example of dependency parsing for written language is shown in Figure 1 (a).",
        "In Steps 1 and 2, dependency labels are supplied to each segment in a way similar to that used by other sequential labeling methods.",
        "However, our sequential labeling has the following characteristics since this task is dependency parsing.",
        "• The labels indicate relative positions of the dependent segment from the current segment (Table 1).",
        "Therefore, the number of labels changes according to the window size.",
        "Long-distance dependencies can be parsed by one labeling process if we set a large window size.",
        "However, growth of label variety causes data sparseness problems.",
        "• One possible label is that of self-dependency (noted as '0Q' in this paper).",
        "This is assigned to independent segments in a tree.",
        "• Also possible are two special labels.",
        "Label '-1O' denotes a segment that is the top of the parsed tree.",
        "Label ' – ' denotes a segment that depends on a segment outside of the window.",
        "When the window size is two, the segment depends on a segment that is over two segments ahead.",
        "• The label for the current segment is determined based on all features in the window and on the label of the previous segment.",
        "In Step 4, segments, which no other segments depend on, are removed in a way similar to that used by CaboCha.",
        "The principle that dependencies do not cross each other is applied in this step.",
        "For example, if a segment depends on a segment after the next, the next segment cannot be modified by other segments.",
        "Therefore, it can be removed.",
        "Similarly, since the ' – ' label indicates that the segment depends on a segment after N segments, all intermediate segments can be removed if they do not have ' – ' labels.",
