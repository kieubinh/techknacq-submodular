        "The discovery of grammars from unannotated material is an important problem which has received much recent research.",
        "We propose a novel approach to this effort by leveraging the theoretical insights of Combinatory Categorial Grammars (CCG) (Steed-man, 2000), and their potential affinity with Genetic Algorithms (GA) (Goldberg, 1989).",
        "Specifically, CCGs utilize an extremely small set of grammatical rules, presumed near-universal, which operate over a rich set of grammatical categories, which are themselves simple and straightforward data structures.",
        "A search for a CCG grammar for a language can be construed as a search for accurate category assignments to the words of that language, albeit over a large landscape of potential solutions.",
        "GAs are biologically-inspired general purpose search/optimization methods that have succeeded in these kinds of environments: wherein solutions are straightforwardly coded, yet nevertheless the solution space is complex and difficult.",
        "We evaluate a system that uses a GA to successively refine a population of categorial lexicons given a collection of unannotated training material.",
        "This is an important problem for several reasons.",
        "First of all, the development of annotated training material is expensive and difficult, and so schemes to discover linguistic patterns from unannotated text may help cut down the cost of corpora development.",
        "Also, this project is closely related to the problem of resolving lexical gaps in parsing, which is a dogged problem for statistical parsing systems in CCG, even trained in a supervised manner.",
        "Carrying over techniques from this project to that could help solve a major problem in CCG parsing technology.",
        "Statistical parsing with CCGs is an active area of research.",
        "The development of CCGbank (Hock-enmaier and Steedman, 2005) based on the Penn Treebank has allowed for the development of wide-coverage statistical parsers.",
        "In particular, Hock-enmaier and Steedman (2001) report a generative model for CCG parsing roughly akin to the Collins parser (Collins, 1997) specific to CCG.",
        "Whereas Hockenmaier's parser is trained on (normal-form) CCG derivations, Clark and Curran (2003) present a CCG parser trained on the dependency structures within parsed sentences, as well as the possible derivations for them, using a log-linear (Maximum-Entropy) model.",
        "This is one of the most accurate parsers for producing deep dependencies currently available.",
        "Both systems, however, suffer from gaps in lexical coverage.",
        "The system proposed here was evaluated against a small corpus of unannotated English with the goal of inducing a categorial lexicon for the fragment.",
        "The system is not ultimately successful and fails to achieve the baseline category assignment accuracy, however it does suggest directions for improvement."

      "heading": "2. Background",
      "text": [
        "The basic insight of a GA is that, given a problem domain for which solutions can be straightforwardly encoded as chromosomes, and for which candidate solutions can be evaluated using a faithful fitness function, then the biologically inspired operations of reproduction, crossover and mutation can in certain cases be applied to multisets or populations of candidate solutions toward the discovery of true or approximate solutions.",
        "Among the applications of GA to computational linguistics, (Smith and Witten, 1995) and (Korkmaz and Ucoluk, 2001) each present GAs for the induction of phrase structure grammars, applied successfully over small data-sets.",
        "Similarly, (Losee, 2000) presents a system that uses a GA to learn part-of-speech tagging and syntax rules from a collection of documents.",
        "Other proposals related specifically to the acquisition of categorial grammars are cited in §2.3.",
        "CCG is a mildly context sensitive grammatical formalism.",
        "The principal design features ofCCG is that it posits a small set of grammatical rules that operate over rich grammatical categories.",
        "The categories are, in the simplest case, formed by the atomic categories s (for sentence), np (noun phrase), n (common noun), etc., closed under the slash operators /, \\.",
        "There is not a substantive distinction between lexical and phrasal categories.",
        "The intuitive interpretation of non-atomic categories is as follows: a word for phrase of type A/B is looking for an item of type B on the right, to form an item of type A.",
        "Likewise, an item of type A\\B is looking for an item of type B on the left.",
        "type A.",
        "For example, in the derivation in Figure 1, \"scores\" combines with the np \"another goal\" to form the verb phrase \"scores",
        "another goal scores np/n n",
        "Application",
        "another goal\".",
        "This, in turn, combines with the np \"Ronaldinho\" to form a sentence.",
        "The example illustrates the rule of Application, denoted with < and > in derivations.",
        "The schemata for this rule, along with the Composition rule (B) and the Crossed-Composition rule (Bx), are given in Figure 2.",
        "The rules of CCG are taken as universals, thus the acquisition of a CCG grammar can be seen as the acquisition of a categorial lexicon.",
        "In addition to the supervised grammar systems outlined in §1, the following proposals have been put forward toward the induction of categorial grammars.",
        "Watkinson and Mandahar (2000) report a Catego-rial Grammar induction system related to that proposed here.",
        "They generate a Categorial Grammar using a fixed and limited set of categories and, utilizing an unannotated corpus, successively refine the lexicon by testing it against the corpus sentences one at a time.",
        "Using a constructed corpus, their strategy worked extremely well: 100% accuracy on lexical category selection as well as 100% parsing accuracy with the resulting statistical CG parser.",
        "With naturally occurring text, however, their system does not perform as well: approximately 77% lexical accuracy and 37% parsing accuracy.",
        "One fundamental difference between the strategy proposed here and that of Watkinson and Mandahar is that we propose to successively generate and evaluate populations of candidate solutions, rather than refining a single solution.",
        "Also, while Watkin-son and Mandahar use logical methods to construct a probabilistic parser, the present system uses approximate methods and yet derives symbolic parsing systems.",
        "Finally, Watkinson and Mandahar utilize an extremely small set of known categories, smaller than the set used here.",

        "The proposed strategy is not implemented and tested, however.",
        "Briscoe (2000) models the acquisition of catego-rial grammars using evolutionary techniques from a different perspective.",
        "In his experiments, language agents induced parameters for languages from other language agents generating training material.",
        "The acquisition of languages is not induced using GA per se, but the evolutionary development of languages is modeled using GA techniques.",
        "Also closely related to the present proposal is the work of Villavicencio (2002).",
        "Villavicencio presents a system that learns a unification-based categorial grammar from a semantically-annotated corpus of child-directed speech.",
        "The learning algorithm is based on a Principles-and-Parameters language acquisition scheme, making use of logical forms and word order to induce possible categories within a typed feature-structure hierarchy.",
        "Her system has the advantage of not having to pre-compile a list of known categories, as did Watkinson and Mandahar as well as the present proposal.",
        "However, Villav-icencio does make extensive use of the semantics of the corpus examples, which the current proposal does not.",
        "This is related to the divergent motivations of two proposals: Villavicencio aims to present a psychologically realistic language learner and takes it as psychologically plausible that logical forms are accessible to the language learner; the current proposal is preoccupied with grammar induction from unannotated text, and assumes (sentence-level) logical forms to be inaccessible.",

        "The probability a candidate was selected is 10%.",
        "In the implementation of this strategy, the following simplifying assumptions were made:",
        "• A given candidate solution only posits a single CCG category for each lexical item.",
        "• The CCG categories to assign to the lexical items are known a priori.",
        "• The parser only used a subset of CCG - pure CCG (Eisner, 1996) - consisting of the Application and Composition rules.",

        "The system creates a candidate solution by assigning lexical items a random category selection, as in:",
        "Given the fixed vocabulary, and the fixed category list, the representation can be simplified to lists of indices to categories, indexed to the full vocabulary list:",
        "Then the category assignment can be construed as a finite function from word-indices to category-indices {0 – 15,1 – 42,2 – 37,...} or simply the vector (15,42,37,...).",
        "The chromosome encodings for the GA scheme described here are just this: vectors of integer category indices.",
        "The parser used is straightforward implementation of the normal-form CCG parser presented by Eisner (1996).",
        "The fitness of the parser is evaluated on its parsing coverage on the individual strings, which is a score based on the chart output.",
