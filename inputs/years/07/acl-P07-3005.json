        "Cognates are words that have similar spelling and meaning across different languages.",
        "They account for a considerable portion of technical lexicons, and they found application in several NLP domains.",
        "Some major applications fields include relevant areas such as bilingual terminology compilation and statistical machine translation.",
        "So far algorithms for cognate recognition have been focussing predominantly on the detection of cognate words in a text, e.g. (Kondrak and Dorr 2004).",
        "Sometimes, though, the detection of cognates in free-flowing text is rather impractical: being able to predict the possible translation in the target language would optimize algorithms that make extensive use of the Web or very large corpora, since there would be no need to scan the whole data each time in order to find the correspondent item.",
        "The proposed approach aims to look at the same problem from a totally different perspective, that is to produce an information repository about the target language that could then be exploited in order to predict how the orthography of a \"possible\" cognate in the target language should look like.",
        "This is necessary when no plain word list is available in the target language or the list is incomplete.",
        "The proposed algorithm merges for the first time two otherwise well-known methods, adopting a specific tagger implementation which suggests new areas of application for this tool.",
        "Furthermore, once language portability will be in place, the cognate generation exercise will allow to reformulate the recognition exercise as well, which is indeed a more straightforward one.",
        "The algorithm described in this paper is based on the assumption that linguistic mappings show some kind of regularity and that they can be exploited in order to draw a net of implicit rules by means of a machine learning approach.",
        "Section 2 deals with previous work done on the field of cognate recognition, while Section 3 describes in detail the algorithm used for this study.",
        "An evaluation scenario will be drawn in Section 4, while Section 5 will outline the directions we intend to take in the next months."

      "text": [
        "The identification of cognates is a quite challenging NLP task.",
        "The most renowned approach to cognate recognition is to use spelling similarities between the two words involved.",
        "The most important contribution to this methodology has been given by Levenshtein (1965), who calculated the changes needed in order to transform one word into another by applying four different edit operations - match, substitution, insertion and deletion - which became known under the name of edit distance (ED).",
        "A good case in point of a practical application of ED is represented by the studies in the field of lexicon acquisition from comparable corpora carried out by Koehn and Knight (2002) - who expand a list of English-German cognate words by applying well-established transformation rules (e.g. substitution of k or z by c and of tat by -ty, as in German Elektizitat - English electricity) - as well as those that focused on word alignment in parallel corpora (e.g. Melamed (2001) and Simard et al.",
        "(1999)).",
        "Furthermore, Laviosa (2001) showed that cognates can be extremely helpful in translation studies, too.",
        "Among others, ED was extensively used also by Mann and Yarowsky (2001), who try to induce translation lexicons between cross-family languages via third languages.",
        "Lexicons are then expanded to intrafamily languages by means of cognate pairs and cognate distance.",
        "Related techniques include a method developed by Danielsson and Muhlenbock (2000), who associate two words by calculating the number of matching consonants, allowing for one mismatched character.",
        "A quite interesting spin-off was analysed by Kondrak (2004), who first highlighted the importance of genetic cognates by comparing the phonetic similarity of lexemes with the semantic similarity of the glosses.",
        "A general overview of the most important statistical techniques currently used for cognate detection purposes was delivered by Inkpen et al.",
        "(2005), who addressed the problem of automatic classification of word pairs as cognates or false friends and analysed the impact of applying different features through machine learning techniques.",
        "In her paper, she also proposed a method to automatically distinguish between cognates and false friends, while examining the performance of seven different machine learning classifiers.",
        "Further applications of ED include Mulloni and Pekar (2006), who designed an algorithm based on normalized edit distance aiming to automatically extract translation rules, for then applying them to the original cognate list in order to expand it, and Brew and McKelvie (1996), who used approximate string matching in order to align sentences and extract lexicographically interesting word-word pairs from multilingual corpora.",
        "Finally, it is worth mentioning that the work done on automatic named entity transliteration often crosses paths with the research on cognate recognition.",
        "One good pointer leads to Kashani et al.",
        "(2006), who used a three-phase algorithm based on HMM to solve the transliteration problem between Arabic and English.",
        "All the methodologies described above showed good potential, each one in its own way.",
        "This paper aims to merge some successful ideas together, as well as providing an independent and flexible framework that could be applied to different scenarios."

        "When approaching the algorithm design phase, we were faced with two major decisions: firstly, we had to decide which kind of machine learning (ML) approach should be used to gather the necessary information, secondly we needed to determine how to exploit the knowledge base gathered in the most appropriate and productive way.",
        "As it turned out, the whole work ended up to revolve around the intuition that a simple tagger could lead to quite interesting results, if only we could scale down from sentence level to word level, that is to produce a tag for single letters instead of whole words.",
        "In other words, we wanted to exploit the analogy between PoS tagging and cognate prediction: given a sequence of symbols - i.e. source language unigrams - and tags aligned with them - i.e. target language n-grams -, we aim to predict tags for more symbols.",
        "Thereby the context provided by the neighbors of a symbol and the previous tags are used as evidence to decide its tag.",
        "After an extensive evaluation of the major ML-based taggers available, we decided to opt for SVMTool, a generator of sequential taggers based on Support Vector Machines developed by Gimenez and Marquez (2004).",
        "In fact, various experiments carried out on similar software showed that SVMTool was the most suitable one for the type of data being examined, mainly because of its flexible approach to our input file.",
        "Also, SVMTool allows to define context by providing an adjustable sliding window for the extraction of features.",
        "Once the model was trained, we went on to create the most orthographically probable cognate in the target language.",

        "While all words are in lower case, we identified the spaces with a capital X, which would have allowed us to subsequently discard it without running the risk to delete useful letters in the last step of the algorithm.",

        "Nonetheless, we soon realized that the space feature outweighed all other features and biased the output towards shorter words.",
        "Also, the input word was so interspersed that it did not allow the learning machine to recognize recurrent patterns.",
        "Further empirical activity showed that far better results could be achieved by sticking to the original letter sequence in the source word and allow for an indefinite number of feature to be learned.",

        "An alternative evaluation setting could have been based on a scenario which included a scrambling and matching routine, but after the good results showed by Mulloni and Pekar (2006), we thought that yet a different environment would have offered more insight into the field.",
        "Also, we wanted to evaluate the actual strength of our approach, in order to decide if future work should be heading this way.",
        "The method was evaluated on an English-German cognate list including 2105 entries.",
        "Since we wanted to keep as much data available for testing as possible, we decided to split the list in 80% training (1683 entries) and 20% (422 entries) testing.",
        "The list used for training/testing purposes included cognates only.",
        "Therefore, the optimal outcome would have been a word in the target language that perfectly matched the cognate of the corresponding source language word in the original file.",
        "The task was therefore a quite straightforward one: train the SVM tagger using the training data file and starting from a list of words in the source language (English) - produce a word in the target language (German) that looked as close as possible to the original cognate word.",
        "Also, we counted all occurrences where no changes across languages took place - i.e. the target word was spelled in the very same way as the source word - and we set this number as a baseline for the assessment of our results.",
        "Preparation of the Training and Test Files",
        "The training file was formatted as described in Section 3.1.",
        "In addition to that, the training and test files featured a START/START delimiter at the beginning of the word and ./END delimiter at the end of it (Figure 1, Line 6).",
        "Learning Parameters",
        "Once formatting was done, the training file was passed on to SVMTlearn.",
        "Notably, SVMTool comes with a standard configuration: for the purpose of this exercise we decided to keep most of the standard default parameters, while tuning only the settings related to the definition of the feature set.",
        "Also, because of the choices made during the design of the training file - i.e. to stick to a strict linear layout in the L1 word - we felt that a rather small context window of 5 with the core position set to 2 - that is, considering a context of 2 features before and 2 features after the feature currently examined - could offer a good trade-off between accuracy and acceptable working times.",
        "Altogether 185 features were learnt, which confirmed the intuition mentioned in Section 3.1.",
        "Furthermore, when considering the feature definition, we decided to stick to unigrams, bigrams and trigrams, even if up to five-grams were obviously possible.",

        "At this stage, we grouped test instances together to form words and associated each L1 word with its newly generated counterpart in L2 (Figure 1, Line8).",
        "The generated words were then compared with the words included in the original cognate file.",
        "When evaluating the results we decided to split the data into three classes, rather than two: \"Yes\" (correct), \"No\" (incorrect) and \"Very Close\".",
        "The reason why we chose to add an extra class was that when analysing the data we noticed that many important mappings were correctly detected, but the word was still not perfect because of minor orthographic discrepancies that the tagging module did get right in a different entry.",
        "In such cases we felt that more training data would have produced a stronger association score that could have eventually led to a correct output.",
