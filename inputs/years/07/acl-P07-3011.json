        "Computational dialectometry is a multidisciplinary field that uses quantitative methods in order to measure linguistic differences between the dialects.",
        "The distances between the dialects are measured at different levels (phonetic, lexical, syntactic) by aggregating over entire data sets.",
        "The aggregate analyses do not expose the underlying linguistic structure, i.e. the specific linguistic elements that contributed to the differences between the dialects.",
        "This is very often seen as one of the main drawbacks of the dialec-tometry techniques and dialectometry itself.",
        "Two attempts to overcome this drawback are presented in Nerbonne (2005) and Nerbonne (2006).",
        "In both of these papers the identification of linguistic structure in the aggregate analysis is based on the analysis of the pronunciation of the vowels found in the data set.",
        "In work presented in this paper the identification of linguistic structure in the aggregate analysis is based on the automatic extraction of regular sound correspondences which are further quantified in order to characterize each site based on the frequency of a certain sound extracted from the pool of the site's pronunciation.",
        "The results show that identification of regular sound correspondences can be successfully applied to the task of identifying linguistic structure in the aggregate analysis of dialects based on word pronunciations.",
        "The rest of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "Section 2 gives an overview of the work previously done in the areas covered in this paper.",
        "In Section 3 more information on the aggregate analysis of Bulgarian dialects is given.",
        "Work done on the identification of regular sound correspondences and their quantification is presented in Section 4.",

        "The work presented in this paper can be divided in two parts: the aggregate analysis of Bulgarian dialects on one hand, and the identification of linguistic structure in the aggregate analysis on the other.",
        "In this section the work closely related to the one presented in this paper will be described in more detail.",
        "Dialectometry produces aggregate analyses of the dialect variations and has been done for different languages.",
        "For several languages aggregate analyses have been successfully developed which distinguish various dialect areas within the language area.",
        "The most closely related to the work presented in this paper is quantitative analysis of Bulgarian dialect pronunciation reported in Osenova et al.",
        "(2007).",
        "In work done by Osenova et al.",
        "(2007) aggregate analysis of pronunciation differences for Bulgarian was done on the data set that comprised 36 word pronunciations from 490 sites.",
        "The data was digitalized from the four-volume set of Atlases of Bulgarian Dialects (Stojkov and Bernstein, 1964; Stojkov, 1966; Stojkov et al., 1974; Stojkov et al., 1981).",
        "Pronunciations of the same words were aligned and compared using L04.",
        "Results were analyzed using cluster analysis, composite clustering, and multidimensional scaling.",
        "The analyses showed that results obtained using aggregate analysis of word pronunciations mostly conform with the traditional phonetic classification of Bulgarian dialects as presented in Stojkov (2002).",
        "Although techniques in dialectometry have shown to be successful in the analysis of the dialect variation, all of them aggregate over the entire available data, failing to extract linguistic structure from the aggregate analysis.",
        "Two attempts to overcome this withdraw are presented inNerbonne (2005) andNerbonne (2006).",
        "Nerbonne (2005) suggests aggregating over a linguistically interesting subset of the data.",
        "Nerbonne compares aggregate analysis restricted to vowel differences to those using the complete data set.",
        "Results have shown that vowels are probably responsible for a great deal of aggregate differences, since there was high correlation between differences obtained only by using vowels and by using complete transcriptions (r = 0.936).",
        "Two ways of aggregate analysis also resulted in comparable maps.",
        "However, no other subset has been analyzed in this paper, making it impossible to conclude how successful other subsets would be if similar analysis was done.",
        "The second paper (Nerbonne, 2006) applies factor analysis to the result of the dialectometric analysis in order to extract linguistic structure.",
        "The study focuses on the pronunciation of vowels found in the data.",
        "Out of 1132 different vowels found in the data 204 vowel positions are investigated, where a vowel position is, e.g., the first vowel in the word 'Washington' or the second vowel in the word 'thirty'.",
        "Factor analysis has shown that 3 factors are most important, explaining 35% of the total amount of variance.",
        "The main drawback ofapplying this technique in dialectometry is that it is not directly related to the aggregate analysis, but is rather an independent step.",
        "Just as in Nerbonne (2005), only vowels were examined.",
        "In his PhD thesis Kondrak (Kondrak, 2002) presents techniques and algorithms for the reconstruction of the proto-languages from cognates.",
        "In Chapter 6 the focus is on the automatic determination of sound correspondences in bilingual word lists and the identification of cognates on the basis of extracted correspondences.",
        "Kondrak (2002) adopted Melamed's parameter estimation models (Melamed, 2000) used in statistical machine translation and successfully applied them to determination of sound correspondences, i.e. diachronic phonology.",
        "Kondrak induced a model of sound correspondence in bilingual word lists, where phoneme pairs with the highest scores represent the most likely correspondences.",
        "The more regular sound correspondences the two words share, the more likely it is that they are cognates and not borrowings.",
        "In this paper the identification of sound correspondences will be used to extract linguistic elements (i.e. phones) responsible for the dialect divisions.",
        "The method presented in this study differs greatly from Kondrak's in that he uses regular sound correspondences to directly compare two words and determine if they are cognates.",
        "In this study extracted sound correspondences are further quantified in order to characterize each site in the data set by assigning it a unique index.",
        "This is the first time that this method has been applied in dialectometry."

        "An example of the alignment of two pronunciations is given in Figure 1.",
        "The alignments were carried out using the Leven-sthein algorithm, which also results in the calculation of a distance between each pair of words.",

        "In this work all three operations were assigned the same value – 1.",
        "All words are represented as series of phones which are not further defined.",
        "The result of comparing two phones can be 1 or 0; they either match or they don't.",
        "In Figure 1 the cheapest way to transform one pronunciation to the other would be by making two substitutions: [ a] should be replaced by [a], and [a] by [ y], meaning that the distance between these two pronunciations is 2.",
        "The distance between each pair of pronunciations was further normalized by the length of the longest alignment that gives the minimal cost.",
        "After normalization, we get the final distance between two strings, which is 0.4 (2/5) in the example shown in Figure 1.",
        "If there are more plausible alignments with the minimal cost, the longest is preferred.",
        "Word pronunciations collected from all sites are aligned and compared in this fashion, allowing us to calculate the distance between each pair of sites.",
        "The difference between two locations is the mean of all differences between words collected from these two sites.",
        "The results were analyzed using clustering (Figure 2) and multidimensional scaling (Figure 3).",
        "Clustering is a common technique in a statistical data analysis based on a partition of a set of objects into groups or clusters (Manning and Schütze, 1999).",
        "Multidimensional scaling is data analysis technique that provides a spatial display of the data revealing relationships between the instances in the data set (Davison, 1992).",
        "On both the maps the biggest division is between East and West.",
        "The border between these two areas goes around Pleven and Teteven, and it is the border of \"yat\" realization as presented in the traditional dialectological atlases (Stojkov, 2002).",
