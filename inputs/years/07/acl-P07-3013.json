        "There are a number of reasons why the interpretation of noun-noun compounds has long been a topic of interest for NLP researchers.",
        "Compounds occur very frequently in English and many other languages, so they cannot be avoided by a robust semantic processing system.",
        "Compounding is a very productive process with a highly skewed type frequency spectrum, and corpus information may be very sparse.",
        "Compounds are often highly ambiguous and a large degree of \"world knowledge\" seems necessary to understand them.",
        "For example, knowing that a cheese knife is (probably) a knife for cutting cheese and (probably) not a knife made of cheese (cf. plastic knife) does not just require an ability to identify the senses of cheese and knife but also knowledge about what one usually does with cheese and knives.",
        "These factors combine to yield a difficult problem that exhibits many of the challenges characteristic of lexical semantic processing in general.",
        "Recent research has made significant progress on solving the problem with statistical methods and often without the need for manually created lexical resources (Lauer, 1995; Lapata and Keller, 2004; Girju, 2006; Turney, 2006).",
        "The work presented here is part of an ongoing project that treats compound interpretation as a classification problem to be solved using machine learning."

        "For many classification tasks, such as part-of-speech tagging or word sense disambiguation, there is general agreement on a standard set of categories that is used by most researchers.",
        "For the compound interpretation task, on the other hand, there is little agreement and numerous classification schemes have been proposed.",
        "This hinders meaningful comparison of different methods and results.",
        "One must therefore consider how an appropriate annotation scheme should be chosen.",
        "One of the problems is that it is not immediately clear what level of granularity is desirable, or even what kind of units the categories should be.",
        "Lauer (1995) proposes a set of 8 prepositions that can be used to paraphrase compounds: a cheese knife is a knife FOR cheese but a kitchen knife is a knife (used) IN a kitchen.",
        "An advantage of this approach is that preposition-noun co-occurrences can efficiently be mined from large corpora using shallow techniques.",
        "On the other hand, interpreting a paraphrase requires further disambiguation as one preposition can map onto many semantic relations.",
        "Girju et al.",
        "(2005) and Nastase and Szpakow-icz (2003) both present large inventories of semantic relations that describe noun-noun dependencies.",
        "Such relations provide richer semantic information, but it is harder for both humans and machines to identify their occurrence in text.",
        "Larger inventories can also suffer from class sparsity; for example, 14 of Girju et al.",
        "'s 35 relations do not occur in their dataset and 7 more occur in less than 1% of the data.",
        "Nastase and Szpakowicz' scheme mitigates this problem by the presence of 5 supercategories.",
        "Each of these proposals has its own advantages and drawbacks, and there is a need for principled criteria for choosing one.",

        "It has been suggested that classifiers trained on skewed data may perform poorly on minority classes (Zhang and Oles, 2001).",
        "Of course, this is not a justification for conflating concepts with little in common, and it may well be that the natural distribution of data is inherently skewed.",

        "Not all the criteria are easily evaluable.",
        "It is difficult to prove generalisability and usefulness conclusively, but it can be maximised by building on more general work on semantic representation; for example, the guidelines introduced here use a conception of events and participants compatible with that of FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998).",
        "Good results on agreement and baseline classification will provide positive evidence for the coherence and balance of the classes; agreement measures can confirm ease of annotation.",
        "In choosing an appropriate level of granularity, I wished to avoid positing a large number of detailed but rare categories.",
        "Levi's (1978) set of nine semantic relations was used as a starting point.",
        "The development process involved a series of revisions over six months, aimed at satisfying the six criteria above and maximising interannotator agreement in annotation trials.",
        "The nature of the decisions which had to be made is exemplified by the compound car factory, whose standard referent seems to qualify as FOR, CAUSE, FROM and IN in Levi's scheme (and causes similar problems for the other schemes I am aware of).",
