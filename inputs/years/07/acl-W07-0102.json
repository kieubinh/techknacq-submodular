        "This investigation is situated within the framework of the Hamburg Metaphor Database (HMD) (Lonneker and Eilts, 2004), which collects manual annotations of metaphors in context.",
        "HMD annotation terminology refers to cognitive linguistic accounts of metaphor.",
        "These suggest that abstract \"target\" concepts are often thought and talked of in terms of less abstract \"source\" concepts (Section 2).",
        "On these accounts, the paper presents a method for finding metaphorically used lexical items and characterizing the conceptual source domains they belong to, given a target domain corpus.",
        "After mentioning related work on metaphor annotation (Section 3), we exemplify our method by a case study on the target domain of European politics, for which a French 800,000 token corpus is prepared and imported into a corpus manager (Section 4).",
        "Using corpus manager functions, a small set of highly salient collocates of Europe are classified as candidates of metaphorical usages; after assessing their metaphoricity in context, these lexemes are grouped into semantico-conceptual domains for which, in a final step, additional lexical instantiations are searched (Section 5).",
        "Two important source domains (building and motion) are detected, which are supported by over 1,000 manual corpus annotations.",
        "The domains can be characterized as small networks of EuroWordNet synsets (nodes) and lexical as well as conceptual relations (Section 6).",

        "The Conceptual Theory of Metaphor (CTM) worked out originally by (Lakoff and Johnson, 1980) claims that conceptual metaphors such as good is up and time is money structure the way we think and influence the way we use language.",
        "Conceptual metaphors are mappings between conceptual domains, for example between the target domain good and the less abstract source domain up, or between time (target) and money (source).",
        "Conceptual metaphors are rarely directly referred to in speech or writing: Whereas time is money is a standing expression in English, this is much less so for many other conceptual mappings (cf. ?good is up).",
        "Consequently, corpus analysis cannot have as a goal finding conceptual mappings as such.",
        "Rather, it can find their manifestations through non-literal usages of lexical items - i.e., contexts in which source domain words are used to refer to elements in the target domain.",
        "For example, high (a word from the up source domain) means 'good' in the expression high marks; and spend or save, used in the source domain to refer to actions involving money, refer to actions in the target domain of time when used in contexts such as spend time or save time.",
        "Adopting a broad notion of metaphor based on CTM, we refer to such non-literal usages (though often conventionalized) as lexical metaphors in this paper.",
        "prominent conceptual metaphors are illustrated by a larger number of lexical metaphors, which support the systematicity of their mapping."

        "Our method is different from automated work on metaphor recognition such as (Mason, 2004) and (Gedigian et al., 2006) in that it includes nouns as parts of speech.",
        "Implementing it in an automated system would require more sophisticated lexical-conceptual resources, representing information on concrete domains (possible source domains).",
