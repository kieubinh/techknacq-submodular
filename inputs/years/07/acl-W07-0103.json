        "In this paper we show that we can use the hyponym relation in WordNet and word co-occurrence information for detecting metaphoric uses in subject-object, verb-noun and adjective-noun relationships.",
        "According to (Cameron and Deignan, 2006), non literal expressions with relatively fixed forms and highly specific semantics are overrepresented in the metaphor literature in comparison to corpora occurrences.",
        "Therefore as part of future work we would be studying the effect of our algorithms for naturally occurring text.",
        "We are also interested in increasing the confidence of the labels using more and diverse annotators and see how the techniques perform.",
        "The study can then be extended to incorporate the role of prepositions in metaphoric uses."
