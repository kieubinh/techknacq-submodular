        "Results on the two other datasets, which contain a majority ofword pairs connected by non-classical semantic relations, show that the WCG is better suited than GermaNet to estimate SR.",
        "Performance ofWCG based measures depends on the dataset and the kind of knowledge used.",
        "IIC based measures (Res, JC and Lin) outperform path based measures (PL, LC and WP) on the Gur65 dataset, while path based measures are clearly better on SR datasets (Gur350 and ZG222).",
        "The impressive performance of the simple PL measure on the SR datasets cannot be explained with the structural properties of the WCG, as they are very similar to those of other semantic networks.",
        "Semantically related terms are very likely to be categorized under the same category, resulting in short path lengths leading to high SR.",
        "The generalization process that comes along with classification seems to capture the phenomenon of SR quite well.",
        "As each article can have many categories, different kinds of semantic relations between terms can be established, but the type of relation remains unknown.",
        "If the WCG is to be used as a lexical semantic resource in large scale NLP applications, it should provide broad coverage.",
        "As was described in section 3.2, computing SR using the WCG relies on categories assigned to articles.",
        "Thus, we consider a word to be covered by the WCG, if there is a categorized article with matching title.",
        "Table 3 gives an overview of the number of word pairs covered in GermaNet or the WCG.",
        "Only few words from Gur65 were not found in one of the resources.",
        "This proportion is much higher for Gur350 and ZG222, as these datasets contain many domain specific terms that are badly covered in GermaNet, and many word pairs containing verbs and adjectives that are badly covered in the WCG.",
        "A number of word pairs (mostly containing combinations of verbs or adjectives) were found neither in GermaNet nor",
        "Wikipedia (see GNU WCG).",
        "If we consider only noun-noun pairs (NN), the coverage of Wikipedia exceeds that of GermaNet.",
        "The high proportion of word pairs that are either only found in GermaNet or in the WCG indicates that they are partially complementary with respect to covered vocabulary."

        "In this paper, we performed a graph-theoretic analysis of the Wikipedia Category Graph and showed that it is a scale-free, small-world graph, like other semantic networks such as WordNet or Roget's thesaurus.",
        "From this result, we concluded that the WCG can be used for NLP tasks, where other semantic networks have been traditionally employed.",
        "As Wikipedia is a multilingual resource, this enables the transfer of NLP algorithms to languages that do not have well-developed semantic wordnets.",
        "To substantiate this claim, we described how measures of semantic relatedness operating on semantic wordnets, like WordNet or GermaNet, can be adapted to work on the WCG.",
        "We showed that the WCG is well suited to estimate SR between words.",
        "This is due to the categorization process that connects terms which would not be closely related in a taxonomic wordnet structure.",
        "Consequently, Ger-maNet outperforms the WCG on the task of estimating semantic similarity.",
        "Furthermore, the WCG cannot be used for tasks that require knowledge about the exact type of semantic relation.",
        "We performed an analysis of the coverage of Wikipedia.",
        "It covers nouns very well, but is less suited to compute semantic relatedness across parts-of-speech.",
        "In this case, conventional semantic wordnets are likely to provide a better knowledge source.",
        "In Zesch et al.",
        "(2007b), we show that knowledge from wordnets and from Wikipedia is complementary, and can be combined to improve the performance on the SR task.",
        "As the simple PL measure performs remarkably well on the SR datasets, in our future work, we will also consider computing SR using the path length on the Wikipedia article graph rather than on the WCG."
