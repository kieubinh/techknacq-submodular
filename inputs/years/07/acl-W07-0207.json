        "Practically, it has the potential to supersede techniques requiring structured text, like treebanks.",
        "Finding structure in text with little or no prior knowledge is therefore a fundamental issue in the study of language.",
        "However, UGI is still a largely unsolved problem.",
        "Recent work (Klein and Manning, 2002; Klein and Manning, 2004) has renewed interest by using a UGI model to parse sentences from the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank (WSJ).",
        "These parsing results are exciting because they demonstrate real-world applicability to English UGI.",
        "While other contemporary research in this area is promising, the case for real-world English UGI has not been as convincingly made (van Zaanen, 2000; Solan et al., 2005).",
        "This paper weaves together two threads of inquiry.",
        "The first thread is latent semantics, which have not been previously used in UGI.",
        "The second thread is dependency-based UGI, used by Klein and Manning (2004), which nicely dovetails with our semantic approach.",

      "text": [
        "Previous work has focused on syntax to the exclusion of semantics (Brill and Marcus, 1992; van Zaa-",
        "Klein and Manning, 2004; Solan et al., 2005).",
        "However, results from the speech recognition community show that the inclusion of latent semantic information can enhance the performance of their models (Coccaro and Jurafsky, 1998; Bellegarda, 2000; Deng and Khudanpur, 2003).",
        "Using latent semantic information to improve UGI is therefore both novel and relevant.",
        "The latent semantic information used by the speech recognition community above is produced by latent semantic analysis (LSA), also known as latent semantic indexing (Deerwester et al., 1990; Landauer et al., 1998).",
        "LSA creates a semantic representation of both words and collections of words in a vector space, using a two part process.",
        "First, a term by document matrix is created in which the frequency of word Wj in document dj is the value of cell Cj.",
        "Filters may be applied during this process which eliminate undesired terms, e.g. common words.",
        "Weighting may also be applied to decrease the contributions of frequent words (Dumais, 1991).",
        "Secondly, singular value decomposition (SVD) is applied to the term by document matrix.",
        "The resulting matrix decomposition has the property that the removal of higher-order dimensions creates an optimal reduced representation of the original matrix in the least squares sense (Berry et al., 1995).",
        "Therefore, SVD performs a kind of dimensionality reduction such that words appearing in different documents can acquire similar row vector representations (Landauer and Dumais, 1997).",
        "Words can be compared by taking the cosine of their corresponding row vectors.",
        "Collections of words can likewise be compared by first adding the corresponding row vectors in each collection, then taking the cosine between the two collection vectors.",
        "A stumbling block to incorporating LSA into UGI is that grammars are inherently ordered but LSA is not.",
        "LSA is unordered because the sum of vectors is the same regardless of the order in which they were added.",
        "The incorporation of word order into LSA has never been successfully carried out before, although there have been attempts to apply word order post-hoc to LSA (Wiemer-Hastings and Zipitria, 2001).",
        "A straightforward notion of incorporating word order into LSA is to use n-grams instead of individual words.",
        "In this way a unigram, bigram, and trigram would each have an atomic vector representation and be directly comparable.",
        "It may seem counterintuitive that such an n-gram scheme has never been used in conjunction with LSA.",
        "Simple as this scheme may be, it quickly falls prey to memory limitations of modern day computers for computing the SVD.",
        "The standard for computing the SVD in the NLP sphere is Berry (1992)'s SVDPACK, whose single vector Lanczos recursion method with re-orthogonalization was incorporated into the BellCore LSI tools.",
        "Subsequently, either SVDPACK or the LSI tools were used by the majority of researchers in this area (Sch√ºtze, 1995; Landauer and Dumais, 1997; Landauer et al., 1998; Coccaro and Jurafsky, 1998; Foltz et al., 1998; Bel-legarda, 2000; Deng and Khudanpur, 2003).",

        "the equation reported in Larsen (1998), a standard orthogonal SVD of a unigram/bigram by sentence matrix of the LSA Touchstone Applied Science Associates Corpus (Landauer et al., 1998) requires over 60 gigabytes of random access memory.",
        "This estimate is prohibitive for all but current supercomputers.",
        "However, it is possible to use a non-orthogonal SVD approach with significant memory savings (Cullum and Willoughby, 2002).",
        "A non-orthogonal approach creates the same matrix decomposition as traditional approaches, but the resulting memory savings allow dramatically larger matrix decompositions.",
        "Thus a non-orthongonal SVD approach is key to the inclusion of ordered latent semantics into our UGI model."

        "For example, Figure 1 has three dependencies {( John, likes ), ( cheese, likes ), ( string, cheese ) }, so the trial parse {(John, likes ), ( string, likes), (cheese, string)} has 1/3 directed dependencies correct and 2/3 undirected dependencies correct.",

        "Since Paskin (2001)'s previous attempt using words as basic elements was unsuccessful, it is not clear whether parts ofspeech are necessary prior knowledge in this context.",
        "Projectivity is an additional constraint that may not be necessary for successful UGI.",
        "English is a projective language, but other languages, such as Bulgarian, are not (Pericliev and Ilarionov, 1986).",

        "Figure 3 gives an example of a nonprojective construction: not all heads and their dependents are a contiguous sequence.",
        "The core ofseveral UGI approaches is distributional analysis (Brill and Marcus, 1992; van Zaanen, 2000; Klein and Manning, 2002; Paskin, 2001; Klein and Manning, 2004; Solan et al., 2005).",
        "The key idea in such distributional analysis is that the function of a word may be known if it can be substituted for another word (Harris, 1954).",
        "If so, both words have the same function.",
        "Substitutability must be defined over a context.",
        "In UGI, this context has typically been the preceding and following words of the target word.",
        "However, this notion of context has an implicit assumption of word order.",
        "This assumption is true for English, but is not true for other languages such as Latin.",
        "Therefore, it is not clear how dependent English UGI is on local linear context, e.g. preceding and following words, or whether an unordered notion of context would also be effective.",
        "Klein and Manning (2004) point their model in the right direction by initializing the probability of dependencies inversely proportional to the distance between the head and the dependent.",
        "This is a very good initialization: Figure 4 shows the actual distances for the dataset used, WSJ10.",
        "Klein (2005) states that, \"It should be emphasized that this initialization was important in getting reasonable patterns out of this model.\"",
        "(p. 89).",
        "However, it is not clear that this is necessarily true for all UGI models.",

        "The WSJ10 dataset was used for evaluation to be comparable to previous results (Klein and Manning, 2004).",
        "WSJ10 is a subset of the Wall Street Journal section of the Penn Treebank, containing only those sentences of 10 words or less after punctuation has been removed.",
        "WSJ10 contains 7422 sentences.",
        "To counteract the data sparsity encountered by using ngrams instead of parts of speech, we used the entire WSJ and year 1994 of the North American News Text Corpus.",
        "These corpora were formatted according to the same rules as the WSJ10, split into sentences (as documents) and concatenated.",
        "The combined corpus contained roughly 10 million words and 460,000 sentences.",
        "Dependencies, rather than the original bracketing, were used as the gold standard for parsing performance.",
        "Since the Penn Treebank does not label dependencies, it was necessary to apply rules to extract dependencies from WSJ10 (Collins, 1999).",
        "The first step is unsupervised latent semantic grammar induction.",
        "This was accomplished by first creating n-gram by context feature matrices, where the feature varies as per Section 4.3.",
        "The Context global approach uses a bigram by document matrix such that word order is eliminated.",
        "Therefore the value of cellij is the number of times ngrami occurred in document j.",
        "The matrix had approximate dimensions 2.2 million by 460,000.",
        "The Contextlocal approach uses a bigram by local window matrix.",
        "If there are n distinct unigrams in the corpus, the first n columns contain the counts of the words preceding a target word, and the last n columns contain the counts of the words following a target word.",
        "For example, the value of at cellij is the number of times unigramj occurred before the target ngrami.",
        "The value of celli(j+n) is the number of times unigramj occurred after the target ngrami.",
        "The matrix had approximate dimensions 2.2 million by 280,000.",
        "After the matrices were constructed, each was transformed using SVD.",
        "Because the nonorthogonal SVD procedure requires a number of Lanczos steps approximately proportional to the square of the number of dimensions desired, the number of dimensions was limited to 100.",
        "This kept running time and storage requirements within reasonable limits, approximately 4 days and 120 gigabytes of disk storage to create each.",
        "Next, a parsing table was constructed.",
        "For each bigram, the closest unigram neighbor, in terms of cosine, was found, cf. Brill and Marcus (1992).",
        "The neighbor, cosine to that neighbor, and cosines ofthe bigram's constituents to that neighbor were stored.",
        "The constituent with the highest cosine to the neighbor was considered the likely head, based on classic head test arguments (Hudson, 1987).",
        "This data was stored in a lookup table so that for each bigram the associated information may be found in constant time.",
        "Next, the WSJ10 was parsed using the parsing table described above and a minimum spanning tree algorithm for dependency parsing (McDonald et al., 2005).",
        "Each input sentence was tokenized on whitespace and lowercased.",
        "Moving from left to right, each word was paired with all remaining words on its right.",
        "If a pair existed in the parsing table, the associated information was retrieved.",
        "This information was used to populate the fully connected graph that served as input to the minimum spanning tree algorithm.",
        "Specifically, when a pair was retrieved from the parsing table, the arc from the stored head to the dependent was given a weight equal to the cosine between the head and the nearest unigram neighbor for that bigram pair.",
        "Likewise the arc from the dependent to the head was given a weight equal to the cosine between the dependent and the nearest unigram neighbor for that bigram pair.",
        "Thus the weight on each arc was based on the degree of substitutability between that word and the nearest unigram neighbor for the bigram pair.",
        "If a bigram was not in the parsing table, it was given maximum weight, making that dependency maximally unlikely.",
        "After all the words in the sentence had been processed, the average of all current weights was found, and this average was used as the weight from a dummy root node to all other nodes (the dummy ROOT is further motivated in Section 5.3).",
        "Therefore all words were given equal likelihood of being the root of the sentence.",
        "The end result of this graph construction process is an n by n + 1 matrix, where n is the number of words and there is one dummy root node.",
        "Then this graph was input to the minimum spanning tree algorithm.",
        "The output of this algorithm is a non-projective dependency tree, which was directly compared to the gold standard dependency tree, as well as the respective baselines discussed in Section 5.3.",
        "To gauge the differential effects of projectivity and prior knowledge, the above procedure was modified in additional evaluation trials.",
        "Projectivity was incorporated by using a bottom-up algorithm (Cov-ington, 2001).",
        "The algorithm was applied in two stages.",
        "First, it was applied using the nonprojective parse as input.",
        "By comparing the output parse to the original nonprojective parse, it is possible to identify independent words that could not be incorporated into the projective parse.",
        "In the second stage, the projective algorithm was run again on the nonpro-jective input, except this time the independent words were allowed to link to any other words defined by the parsing table.",
        "In other words, the first stage identifies unattached words, and the second stage \"repairs\" the words by finding a projective attachment for them.",
        "This method of enforcing projectivity was chosen because it makes use of the same information as the nonprojective method, but it goes a step further to enforce projectivity.",
        "Prior distributions of dependencies, as depicted in Figure 4, were incorporated by inversely weighting",
        "ROOT John likes string cheese graph edges by the distance between words.",
        "This modification transparently applies to both the non-projective case and the projective case.",
        "Two performance baselines for dependency parsing were used in this experiment, the so-called right and left branching baselines.",
        "A right branching baseline predicts that the head of each word is the word to the left, forming a chain from left to right.",
        "An example is given in Figure 5.",
        "Conversely, a left branching baseline predicts that the head of each word is the word to the right, forming a chain from right to left.",
        "An example is given in Figure 6.",
        "Although perhaps not intuitively very powerful baselines, the right and left branching baselines can be very effective for the WSJ10.",
        "For WSJ10, most heads are close to their dependents, as shown in Figure 4.",
        "For example, the percentage of dependencies with a head either immediately to the right or left is 53%.",
        "Of these neighboring heads, 17% are right branching, and 36% are left branching.",
        "By using the sign test, the statistical significance of parsing results can be determined.",
        "The sign test is perhaps the most basic non-parametric tests and so is useful for this task because it makes no assumptions regarding the underlying distribution of data.",
        "Consider each sentence.",
        "Every word must have exactly one head.",
        "That means that for n words, there is a 1/n chance of selecting the correct head (excluding self-heads and including a dummy root head).",
        "If all dependencies in a sentence are independent, then a sentence's dependencies follow a binomial distribution, with n equal to the number of words, p equal to 1/n, and k equal to the number of correct dependencies.",
        "From this it follows that the expected number of correct dependencies per sentence is np, or 1.",
        "Thus the random baseline for nonprojective dependency parsing performance is one dependency per sentence.",
        "Using the gold standard of the WSJ10, the number of correct dependencies found by the latent semantic model can be established.",
        "The null hypothesis is that one randomly generated dependency should be correct per sentence.",
        "Suppose that r+ sentences have more correct dependencies and r-sentences have fewer correct dependencies (i.e. 0).",
