        "Data mining can be defined as the process of finding new and potentially useful knowledge from data.",
        "An enhanced trend of data mining is chance discovery, which in spite of being an emergent field of research has been applied to different branches of science.",
        "Recently, data crystallization (Ohsawa, 2005) has been proposed as a chance discovery extension devoted to find desired unobservable events within a given data.",
        "This method of data mining has been intended for revealing events that are significant but are not included in the analyzed data (sparseness).",
        "The knowledge database of a conversational partner computer program is a good example of data sparseness, making very difficult to realize a humanlike conversation between a user and a computer, since the database is missing relevant or coherent answers for a given user input, e.g., ELIZA system (Weizenbaum, 1966), corpus-based dialogue systems (Inui et al., 2003), and so forth.",
        "Herring (1999) noticed the weak sequential coherence during human-computer interaction that is caused by weak local relevance, pointing out the violation of the Gricean maxim of local relevance during the dialogue.",
        "However, we argue that conversational responses - often of very weak local relevance - generated by a conversational partner computer program (or \"chatbot\") could successfully simulate humanlike coherent dialogue (see example given by (Herring, 1999), where topical coherence is stated in spite of violation of local relevance Gricean maxim).",
        "Moreover, we argue that weak local relevance utterances could be regarded as topic-shifting utterances.",
        "These utterances are vital in order to keep the flow of the dialogue and its overall coherence.",
        "Determining the moment when the topic-shifting utterances are needed is hence essential to the success of a chatbot.",
        "In this paper KeyGraph and data crystallization techniques are applied to analyze human-computer trivial dialogue, chat, considering as chances to discover the missing topic-shifting utterances, used to improve the overall sequential coherence and the flow of the computer dialogue."

        "Analysis Approach",
        "During the process of dialogue mining, in order to analyze the behavior of human-computer conversational interaction, the interrelationship of utterances of a dialogue section was obtained.",
        "The following is a fragment of an analyzed dialogue section between a user and ALICE chatbot (Wallace, 2005):",
        "[17] User: what do you mean by robot?",
        "there are lots of different robots [18] Chatbot: It is a good question.",
        "Have you tried a web search?",
        "Would you like to know more?",
        "[19] User: sure [20] Chatbot: Ok let's do it.",
        "What would you like to know?",
        "[21] User: what Alice thinks a robot means [22] Chatbot: is that a rhetorical question?",
        "I would search for it [23] User: when I hear robot, I think of something that moves [24] Chatbot: you never know what to expect from life.",
        "Why?",
        "oh yeah, we are talking about something that moves [.... ]",
        "For the analysis, the application of data crystallization is introduced in order to identify the missing topic-shifting utterances.",
        "The interrelationship of utterances (user-chatbot) is represented in a cooccurrence document created as described below.",
        "The KeyGraph has been used as a data-mining tool for extracting patterns of the appearance of chance events (Ohsawa et al.(2003)).",
        "The KeyGraph identifies relationships between terms in a document particularly focusing on co-occurrence relationships of both high-probability and low-probability events.",
        "Montero et al.",
        "(2005) have applied this tool for analyzing the dynamic behavior of human-human chat, identifying criticality.",
        "In this paper the KeyGraph is applied in combination with data crystallization in order to visualized utterances that do not appear during humancomputer chat.",
        "The interrelationship of utterances (user-chatbot) is represented in a co-occurrence document created by the following algorithm: a) Each utterance (from both, the user and the chatbot) was considered as one sentence.",
        "b) Each sentence was segmented into words.",
        "c) High frequency words were eliminated, i.e., I, you, is, follow-ups and the like, as to avoid false co-occurrence.",
        "d) A vectorial representation of each sentence (at word level) was obtained and sentences co-occurrence relationship was determined as:",
        "where: wk (fc = 1, 2, 3,n), represents a word in a sentence.",
        "S; (l = 1, 2, 3,m), represents a sentence.",
        "Then it could be said that the obtained D document contains the co-occurrence relationship of the utterances during the analyzed dialogue section.",
        "In the graph, the most frequent items in D are shown as black nodes and the most strongly co-occurring item-pairs are linked by black lines according to the Jaccard coefficient:",
        "where p(SX n Sy) is the probability that both elements Sx and Sy co-occur in a line in D, and p(SX U Sy) is the probability that either Sx or Syappears in a line.",
        "In the graph, nodes are interpreted as sentences (from D) and clusters of nodes as particular topics (Figure 1).",
        "Data crystallization (Ohsawa, 2005), is dedicated to experts working in real domains where discoveries of events that are important but are not included in the analyzed data are desired.",
        "The process of data crystallization involves to insert dummy items in the given data in order to represent unobservable events.",
        "In this paper, each dummy item inserted in the D document (one in each vector of D) is named XY, where X represents the level of the insertion and Y represents the line where the dummy item was inserted.",
        "The KeyGraph is applied to the new D document and all of the dummy nodes that did not appear linking clusters in the graph are eliminated from the data, and then the cycle is iterated to higher levels.",
        "In the case of the D document of Sec.2.1, after the first level of insertion it becomes:",
        "W3:: Si, S3, Sio ...I3 /... / wn:: S24, S25, ... Sm 1nwhere (o = 1, 2, 3, ...,n), represents each dummy item inserted in each vector ofD.",
        "After feeding the KeyGraph with D', all the dummy items that did not appear linking clusters as bridges in the outputted graph are deleted.",
        "At this point new dummy items with higher hierarchy (2X) are inserted in D', and the cycle iterates.",
        "Unobservable events and their relations with other events are to be visualized by the application of KeyGraph iteratively to the data that is been crystallized (Figure 2)."

        "The performed experiment was carried out in three stages.",
        "In the first stage of the experiment, three different dialogue sections (including the one shown in Sec.2) between three native English speakers and a chatbot (Wallace, 2005) were analyzed in order to find co-occurrence between the users' utterance and the chatbot replies, i.e., D document.",
        "This D document was then examined by the KeyGraph (unsuper-vised process).",
        "Figure 1 shows the graphical view of the dialogue in Sec.2 (48 turns, user - chatbot, in total).",
        "A characteristic of the KeyGraph is the visualization of co-occurring events by means of clusters.",
        "In Figure 1, the nodes represent sentences from the D document, the clusters represent the relationship among those sentences, i.e., a specific topic, and the nodes that link the clusters represent the transition from one topic to the next.",
        "It can be observed that the main clusters are not interconnected, leading to the conclusion that the chatbot in many cases could not keep a smooth and natural flow of the dialogue.",
        "In the second stage of the experiment, a crystallized document of utterance co-occurrence, i.e., D' document, was obtained for the same dialogue sections, following the process described in Sec.2.2.",
        "The graphical output of the dialogue in Sec.2, after crystallization, can be observed in Figure 2.",
        "It can be seen in this figure how the two main clusters appear to be interconnected by the dummy item 13.",
        "Although this dummy item was inserted in the third line of the D document, it appears in the graph connecting the two main clusters.",
        "The dummy item 13 branches from utterance [24].",
        "This interconnecting point can be regarded as the system considering it appropriate to insert a topic-shifting utterance at this point of the conversation.",
        "In doing so, a well interconnected graph is obtained (Figure 2).",
        "This information is valuable for making the chatbot to ask \"intelligent questions\" as a mean of conversational responses to keep the interest from the user.",
        "In the third stage of the experiment, the information yielded by the previous analysis, i.e., regarding the timing where a topic-shifting utterance might be needed, was used to feed the chatbot database.",
        "Topic-shifting responses were inserted by hand (supervised process) as general patterns (around one hundred patterns) for smoothly change the topic when there is not a pattern that matches a given utterance.",
        "In this way a bridge, represented in Figure 2 by the dummy item, is created giving to the dialogue the desired smoothness.",
        "Seven users (four native English speakers, three non native speakers) were requested to perform a chat with the plain chatbot and with the enhanced chatbot (the users did not know which chatbot was plain or which was enhanced).",
        "The time set up was maximum 30 minuteschat with each program, the user was free to stop at any time before the time limit.",

        "The four native English speaker users globally agreed ranking enhanced chatbot as having \"good\" accurate/relevant responses during the overall dialogue, giving remarks like \"interesting to talk with\", \"better at keeping the conversation going\", \"easier to talk to\", and \"more impression of consciousness\".",
        "In the case of the plain chatbot, the native speakers showed \"dissatisfied\" at its performance, giving remarks like \"loop responses\", \"slow in keeping the conversation going\", \"no so nice responses\", \"no constant memory\".",
        "Table 1 shows a resume of the average performance of the chatbot for all of the users.",
        "An example of a vague reply is given in the following fragment:",

        "[vague reply]",
        "Two non native English speaker users ranked the enhanced chatbot as having \"fair\" and \"average\" accurate/relevant responses while the plain chatbot was ranked as having \"poor\" and \"fair\" accurate/relevant responses.",
        "The third non native English speaker user ranked both chatbots as \"poor\" due to \"the chatbots lack of understanding deixis, and anaphor\".",
        "As a mean of discussion, in Figure 2 it could be expected that the dummy item 1_3 would branch from utterance [25] {User: no, you asked me who is the",
        "best robot}, which is in the same cluster with utterance [24].",
        "However, under closer examination it becomes clear that utterance [24] has stronger co-occurrence",

        "Hence, the algorithm suggests",

        "In other aspect, based on the feedback given by the seven users of the experiment, the overall performance of the enhanced chatbot can be considered better than the plain chatbot.",
        "It is worth noticing that the evaluation of the non native English speaker users tended to emphasize the grammatical aspect of the chatbots responses.",
        "On the other hand, the evaluation of the native English speaker users tended to emphasize the smoothness of the dialogue.",
