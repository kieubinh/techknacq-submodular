        "Spell-checking is a well researched area in NLP, which deals with detection and automatic correction of spelling errors in an electronic text document.",
        "Several approaches to spell-checking have been described in the literature that use statistical, rule-based, dictionary-based or hybrid techniques (see (Kukich, 1992) for a dated but substantial survey).",
        "Spelling errors are broadly classified as non-word errors (NWE) and real word errors (RWE).",
        "If the misspelt string is a valid word in the language, then it is called an RWE, else it is an NWE.",
        "For example, in English, the word \"fun\" might be misspelt as \"gun\" or \"vun\"; while the former is an RWE, the latter is a case of NWE.",
        "It is easy to detect an NWE, but correction process is non-trivial.",
        "RWE, on the other hand are extremely difficult to detect as it requires syntactic and semantic analysis of the text, though the difficulty of correction is comparable to that of NWE (see (Hirst and Budanitsky, 2005) and references therein).",
        "Given a lexicon of a particular language, how hard is it to develop a perfect spell-checker for that language?",
        "Since context-insensitive spell-checkers cannot detect RWE and neither they can effectively correct NWE, the difficulty in building a perfect spell-checker, therefore, is reflected by quantities such as the probability of a misspelling being RWE, probability of more than one word being orthographically closer to an NWE, and so on.",
        "In this work, we make an attempt to understand and formalize some of these issues related to the challenges of spell-checking through a complex network approach (see (Albert and Barabasi, 2002; Newman, 2003) for a review of the field).",
        "This in turn allows us to provide language-specific quantitative bounds on the performance level of spell-checkers.",
        "In order to formally represent the orthographic structure (spelling conventions) of a language, we conceptualize the lexicon as a weighted network, where the nodes represent the words and the weights of the edges indicate the orthoraphic similarity between the pair of nodes (read words) they connect.",
        "We shall call this network the Spelling Network or SpellNet for short.",
        "We build the SpellNets for three languages - Bengali, English and Hindi, and carry out standard topological analysis of the networks following complex network theory.",
        "Through appropriate mathematical analysis and/or intuitive justification, we interpret the different topological metrics of SpellNet from the perspective of difficulties related to spell-checking.",
        "Finally, we make several cross-linguistic observations, both invariances and variances, revealing quite a few interesting facts.",
        "For example, we see that among the three languages studied, the probability of RWE is highest in Hindi followed by Bengali and English.",
        "A similar observation has been previously reported in (Bhatt et al., 2005) for RWEs in Bengali and English.",
        "Apart from providing insight into spell-checking, the complex structure of SpellNet also reveals the self-organization and evolutionary dynamics underlying the orthographic properties of natural languages.",
        "In recent times, complex networks have been successfully employed to model and explain the structure and organization of several natural and social phenomena, such as the foodweb, protien interaction, formation of language inventories (Choudhury et al., 2006), syntactic structure of languages (i Cancho and Sole, 2004), WWW, social collaboration, scientific citations and many more (see (Albert and Barabaasi, 2002; Newman, 2003) and references therein).",
        "This work is inspired by the aforementioned models, and more specifically a couple of similar works on phonological neighbors' network of words (Kapatsinski, 2006; Vite-vitch, 2005), which try to explain the human perceptual and cognitive processes in terms of the organization of the mental lexicon.",
        "The rest of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 defines the structure and construction procedure of SpellNet.",
        "Section 3 and 4 describes the degree and clustering related properties of Spell-Net and their significance in the context of spell-checking, respectively.",

        "Moreover, the orthography of the two Indian languages are highly phonemic in nature, in contrast to the morpheme-based orthography of English.",
        "Another point of disparity lies in the fact that while the English alphabet consists of 26 characters, the alphabet size of both Hindi and Bengali is around 50.",

        "For English it has been obtained from the website www.audiencedialogue.org/susteng.html; for Hindi and Bengali, the word lists as well as the unigram frequencies have been estimated from the monolingual corpora published by Central Institute of Indian Languages.",
        "We chose to work with the most frequent 10000 words, as the medium size of the two Indian language corpora (around 3M words each) does not provide sufficient data for estimation of the unigram frequencies of a large number of words (say 50000).",
        "Therefore, all the results described in this work pertain to the SpellNets corresponding to the most frequent 10000 words.",
        "However, we believe that the trends observed do not reverse as we increase the size of the networks.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the networks at three different thresholds, that is for 6 = 1, 3, 5, and study the properties of Ge for the three languages.",

        "Nevertheless, we can provide an approximate estimate of the same as follows.",
        "Let us conceive of a hypothetical node vw'.",
        "By definition of SpellNet, there should be an edge connecting vw' and vw in Ge.",
        "A crude estimate of k(vw') can be (kwt) of Ge.",
        "Due to the assortative nature of the network, we expect to see a high correlation between the values of k(vw) and k(vw'), and therefore, a slightly better estimate of k(vw') could be k(vw).",
        "However, as vw' is not a part of the network, it's behavior in SpellNet may not resemble that of a real node, and such estimates can be grossly erroneous.",
        "One way to circumvent this problem is to look at the local neighborhood of the node vw.",
        "Let us ask the question - what is the probability that two randomly chosen neighbors of vw in Ge are connected to each other?",
        "If this probability is high, then we can expect the local neighborhood of vw to be dense in the sense that almost all the neighbors of vw are connected to each other forming a clique-like local structure.",
        "Since vw' is a neighbor of vw, it is a part of this dense cluster, and therefore, its degree k(vw') is of the order of k(vw).",
        "On the other hand, if this probability is low, then even if k(vw) is high, the space around vw is sparse, and the local neighborhood is star-like.",
        "In such a situation, we expect k(vw') to be low.",
        "The topological property that measures the probability of the neighbors of a node being connected is called the clustering coefficient (CC).",
        "One of the ways to define the clustering coefficient C(v) for a vertex v in a network is number of triangles connected to vertex v number of triplets centered on v",
        "For vertices with degree 0 or 1, we put C(v) = 0.",
        "Then the clustering coefficient for the whole network (CC) is the mean CC of the nodes in the network.",
        "A corresponding weighted version of the CC (CCwt) can be defined by taking the node weights into account.",
        "Implication: The higher the value of k(vw)C(vw) for a node, the higher is the probability that an NWE made while typing w is hard to correct due to the presence of a large number of orthographic neighbors of the misspelling.",
        "Therefore, in a way (CCwt) reflects the level of difficulty in correcting NWE for the language in general.",
        "Observation and Inference: At threshold 1, the values of (CC) as well as (CCwt) is higher for Hindi (0.172 and 0.341 respectively) and Bengali (0.131 and 0.229 respectively) than that of English (0.101 and 0.221 respectively), though for higher thresholds, the difference between the CC for the languages reduces.",
        "This observation further strengthens our claim that the level of difficulty in spelling error detection and correction are language dependent, and for the three languages studied, it is hardest for Hindi, followed by Bengali and English.",
        "As an aside, it is interesting to see whether the Spell-Nets exhibit the so called small world effect that is prevalent in many social and natural systems (see (Albert and Barabaasi, 2002; Newman, 2003) for definition and examles).",
        "A network is said to be a small world if it has a high clustering coefficient and if the average shortest path between any two nodes of the network is small.",
        "Observation: We observe that SpellNets indeed feature a high CC that grows with the threshold.",
        "The average shortest path, denoted by (l) in Table 1, for 6 = 1 is around 7 for all the languages, and reduces to around 3 for 6 = 3; at 6 = 5 the networks are near-cliques.",
        "Thus, SpellNet is a small world network.",
        "Implication: By the application of triangle inequality of edit distance, it can be easily shown that (l) x 6 provides an upper bound on the average edit distance between all pairs of the words in the lexicon.",
        "Thus, a small world network, which implies a small (l), in turn implies that as we increase the error bound (i.e. 6), the number of edges increases sharply in the network and soon the network becomes fully connected.",
        "Therefore, it becomes increasingly more difficult to correct or detect the errors, as any word can be a possible suggestion for any misspelling.",
        "In fact this is independently observed through the exponential rise in M - the number of edges, and fall in ( l) as we increase 6.",

        "However, the networks vary to a large extent in terms of the actual values of some of these metrics.",
        "Arguably, the language-invariant properties of SpellNet can be attributed to the organization of the human mental lexicon (see (Kapatsinski, 2006) and references therein), self-organization of orthographic systems and certain properties of edit distance measure.",
        "The differences across the languages, perhaps, are an outcome of the specific orthographic features, such as the size of the alphabet.",
        "Another interesting observation is that the phonemic nature of the orthography strongly correlates with the difficulty of spell-checking.",
        "Among the three languages, Hindi has the most phonemic and English the least phonemic orthography.",
        "This correlation calls for further investigation.",
        "Throughout the present discussion, we have focussed on spell-checkers that ignore the context; consequently, many of the aforementioned results, especially those involving spelling correction, are valid only for context-insensitive spell-checkers.",
        "Nevertheless, many of the practically useful spell-checkers incorporate context information and the current analysis on SpellNet can be extended for such spell-checkers by conceptualizing a network of words that capture the word co-occurrence patterns (Biemann, 2006).",
        "The word co-occurrence network can be superimposed on SpellNet and the properties of the resulting structure can be appropriately analyzed to obtain similar bounds on hardness of context-sensitive spell-checkers.",
        "We deem this to be a part of our future work.",
        "Another way to improve the study could be to incorporate a more realistic measure for the orthographic similarity between the words.",
        "Nevertheless, such a modification will have no effect on the analysis technique, though the results of the analysis may be different from the ones reported here.",
        "We take a noisy channel approach, which is a common technique in NLP (for example (Brown et al., 1993)), including spellchecking (Kernighan et al., 1990).",
        "Depending on the situation.",
        "the channel may modeltyping orOCRerrors.",
        "Suppose thatawordw, while passing through the channel, gets transformed to a word w'.",
        "Therefore, the aim of spelling correction is to find the w* G A (the lexicon), which maximizes p(w*\\w'), that is",
        "The likelihood p(w'\\w) models the noisy channel, whereas the term p(w) is traditionally referred to as the language model (see (Jurafsky and Martin, 2000) for an introduction).",
        "In this equation, as well as throughout this discussion, we shall assume a unigram language model, where p(w) is the normalized frequency of occurrence of w in a standard corpus.",
        "We define the probability of RWE for a word w, prwe(w), as follows",
        "Stated differently, prwe(w) is a measure of the probability that while passing through the channel, w gets transformed into a form w', such that w' A and w' = w. The probability of RWE in the language, denoted by prwe(A), can then be defined in terms of the probability prwe(w) as follows.",
        "In order to obtain an estimate of the likelihood p(w'\\ w), we use the concept of edit distance (also known as Levenstein distance (Levenstein, 1965)).",
        "We shall denote the edit distance between two words w and w' by ed(w, w').",
        "If we assume that the probability of a single error (i.e. a character deletion, substitution or insertion) is p and errors are independent of each other, then we can approximate the likelihood estimate as follows.",
        "Exponentiation of edit distance is a common measure of word similarity or likelihood (see for example (Bailey and Hahn, 2001)).",
        "Substituting for p(w'\\w) in Eqn 11, we get"
