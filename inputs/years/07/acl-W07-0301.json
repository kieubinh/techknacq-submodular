        "In the troubleshooting domain, a spoken dialog system (SDS) helps a user to restore a malfunctioning product such as a DSL connection to a working state.",
        "Building dialog systems for this domain presents several new challenges.",
        "First, the user may make mistakes such as misinterpreting the meaning of a status light or pressing the wrong button, so even if no speech recognition errors are made, the user's response may be misleading.",
        "Next, in addition to the speech recognizer, input is also received from running network tests such as pinging the user's DSL modem.",
        "Input from both sources may contain errors, and a dialog system must cope with conflicting information from two channels.",
        "In sum, the dialog system never knows the true state of the product nor the user's true actions, yet must still instruct the user to successfully restore the product to a working state.",
        "Dialog models which explicitly model uncertainty have been shown to significantly outperform baseline models which do not, primarily because they cope better with conflicting evidence introduced by speech recognition errors (Roy et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2001; Williams and Young, 2007).",
        "However, past work has been confined to slot-filling tasks and has not tackled the troubleshooting domain.",
        "Conversely, dialog systems for troubleshooting in the literature have not attempted to model uncertainty directly (Grosz and Sidner, 1986; Lochbaum, 1998).",
        "The contribution of this paper is to show how to model a troubleshooting spoken dialog system as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP).",
        "We argue that past work in the general troubleshooting literature represents simplifications or special cases of a POMDP, then we show how a troubleshooting POMDP can be combined with a dialog system POMDP to create a unified framework that admits global optimization.",
        "Experiments with simulated users show how the POMDP formulation effectively balances diagnostic actions (such as a network test) with communicative actions (such as giving the user instructions), and how the POMDP formulation outperforms a hand-crafted baseline both in terms of efficiency and task completion.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 reviews POMDPs, the general troubleshooting problem, and POMDP-based spoken dialog systems; section 3 explains how these two POMDPs can be combined to model a troubleshooting spoken dialog system; sections 4-5 present results from simulation; and section 6 concludes."

        "A POMDP is a model for control when there is uncertainty in the effects of actions and in the state of the environment.",
        "Formally, a POMDP p is defined as a tuple p = (S, A, T, R, O, Z, 7, bo) where S is a set of states s describing the environment with s G S; A is a set of actions a G A which operate on the environment; T defines a transition probability P(s'|s,a); R defines the expected (immediate, real-valued) reward r(s,a) G 99; O is a set of observations o G O which describe the state of the environment; Z defines an observation probability P(o'|s',a); 7 is a geometric discount factor 0 < 7 < 1; and b0 is an initial belief state, defined below.",
        "The POMDP operates as follows.",
        "At each timestep, the environment is in some unobserved state s. Since s is not known exactly, a distribution over possible states called a belief state b is maintained where b(s) indicates the probability of being in a particular state s, with b0 denoting the initial belief state.",
        "Based on b, a control algorithm (also called a policy) selects an action a, receives a reward r, and the environment transitions to (unobserved) state s', where s' depends only on s and a.",
        "The environment then generates an observation o' which is dependent on s' and a.",
        "At each time-step, b is updated as where n is a normalization constant (Kaelbling et al., 1998).",
        "The process of maintaining b at each time step is called belief monitoring.",
        "The cumulative, ininite-horizon, discounted reward is called the return and written V = ^£=0 7*r(st, at), where stand at indicate the state of the environment and the action taken at time t, respectively.",
        "The goal of the control algorithm is to choose actions that maximize the expected return E[V] given b and the POMDP parameters p, and the process of searching for such a control algorithm is called optimization.",
        "The goal of the general (non-dialog) problem of automated troubleshooting is for a control algorithm to fix a product by taking a sequence of diagnosis and repair actions.",
        "Different actions have different reliabilities and different costs, and the aim is to ind the sequence that minimizes the total cost.",

        "The product then produces an observation y according to P(y'|x',am).",
        "Replacing cost with reward, the control algorithm receives reward r(x, am) and the goal is to ind the sequence of actions which maximizes the cumulative sum of reward.",
        "When viewed in this way, automated troubleshooting can be readily viewed as a POMDP (Shakeri et al., 1997).",
        "Figure 1 shows the automated troubleshooting task as an influence diagram.",
        "Although POMDPs are an elegant model for troubleshooting, they are also notoriously dificult to optimize and much of the troubleshooting literature seeks appropriate constraints which render the optimization tractable, such as assuming that each action affects at most one product state component, that actions have deterministic effects, and that there is only fault present (Heckerman et al., 1995).",
        "More recently, advances in the POMDP literature have radically increased the scalability of optimization algorithms: for example, Poupart optimizes a substantial network troubleshooting problem cast as a generic POMDP (Poupart and Boutilier, 2004).",

        "A model was constructed for values of perr ranging from 0.0 to 0.5; each model was optimized and then evaluated using 5000 simulated dialogs.",

        "In general when HC receives an unexpected answer or confidence score below the equal-error rate threshold, it treats this as a likely speech recognition error and remains in the same dialog state.",
        "Next, optimization was performed as described in (Williams et al., 2005).",
        "This technique takes as input a POMDP model and a state-based dialog controller, and produces an improved dialog controller.",
        "Space limitations prevent a full description here; the intuition is that the algorithm uses the POMDP belief state at runtime to \"rewire\" the dialog controller to achieve an improvement in reward.",
        "Because this optimization algorithm improves a standard state-based dialog controller (in this case the HC baseline), it provides an indication of the value of adding the POMDP machinery.",
        "First, 500 simulated dialogs were run with the POMDP, and then 500 simulated dialogs were run with the HC baseline controller.",
        "Finally, as a further comparison, the ASR simulation was changed so that no ASR errors were made, and HC was run for 500 dialogs in this configuration, which we call HC(0).",

        "Examination of the dialog transcripts found that the main source of failure for HC(0) was exceeding 100 turns.",
        "In other words, quantitatively, the POMDP is both more robust to ASR errors and (independent of ASR errors) more efficient.",
        "The dialog transcripts were inspected to determine qualitatively how the POMDP attained better performance.",
        "An example is shown in Table 3.",
        "At the start of the conversation, the belief (probability) that the connection is working p(allOk) is 56% and the belief that the power to the DSL modem is on p(pwrOn) is 98.0% (these are 2 of the 19 components in the product state x).",
        "As the dialog progresses, belief monitoring updates these to account for the evidence received.",
        "For example, the unsuccessfulping in S1 causes p(allOk) to drop from 56% to 14%.",
        "The belief monitoring process also naturally makes use of indirect evidence - for example, in U14 the user indicates the network light is \"red\": since the network light will only be on if the power to the DSL modem is on, this causes an increase in the belief that the power is on, from 99.1% to 99.8%.",
        "The key benefit of the POMDP approach is that the dialog manager can exploit the belief state to make better progress in the face of low-confidence or even nonsensical replies, without sacrificing overall task completion.",
        "For example, in S1 through S9 the POMDP policy differs from the baseline controller: the baseline controller would have ignored the lower-confidence recognitions in U4 and U8, but the POMDP policy moves ahead.",
        "When the policy receives a nonsensical reply, for example in U6, it reverts back to an earlier stage of the troubleshooting procedure it had previously skipped.",
        "This latter behavior ensures that omitting steps to move faster through the procedure doesn't ultimately sacrifice task completion."
