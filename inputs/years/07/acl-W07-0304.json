      "text": [
        "Since the beginning of the telephony spoken dialog industry, in the mid 1990, we have been witnessing the evolution of at least three generations of systems.",
        "What differentiates each generation is not only the increase of complexity, but also the different architectures used.",
        "Table 1 provides a summary of the features that distinguish each generation.",
        "The early first generation systems were mostly informational, in that they would require some information from the user, and would provide information in return.",
        "Examples of those systems, mostly developed during the mid and late 1990s, are package tracking, simple financial applications, and flight status information.",
        "At the time there were no standards for developing dialog systems, (VoiceXML 1.0 was published as a recommendation in year 2000) and thus the first generation dialog applications were implemented on proprietary platforms, typically evolutions of existing touch-tone IVR (Interactive Voice Response) architectures.",
        "Since the early developments, spoken dialog systems were implemented as a graph, called call-flow.",
        "The nodes of the call-flow typically represent actions performed by the system and the arcs represent an enumeration of the possible outcomes.",
        "Playing a prompt and interpreting the user response through a speech recognition grammar is a typical action.",
        "Dialog modules (Barnard et al., 1999) were introduced in order to reduce the complexity and increase reusability of call-flows.",
        "A Dialog Module (or DM) is defined as a call-flow object that encapsulates many of the interactions needed for getting one piece of information from the user, including retries, timeout handling, disambiguation, etc.",
        "Modern commercial dialog systems use DMs as their active call-flow nodes.",
        "The number of DMs in a call-flow is generally an indication of the application complexity.",
        "First generation applications showed a range of complexity of a few to tens of DMs, typically spanning a few turns of interaction.",
        "The dialog modality is another characterization of applications.",
        "Early applications supported strict directed dialog interaction, meaning that at each turn the system would direct the user by proposing a finite – and typically small – number of choices.",
        "That would also result in a limited grammar or vocabulary at each turn.",
        "The applications of the second generation were typically transactional, in the sense that they could perform a transaction on behalf of the user, like moving funds between bank accounts, trading stocks, or buying tickets.",
        "Most of those applications were developed using the new standards, typically as collections of VoiceXML documents.",
        "The complexity moved to the range of dozens of dialog modules, spanning a number of turns of interactions of the order of ten or more.",
        "At the same time, some of the applications started using a technology known as Statistical Spoken Language Understanding, or SSLU (Gorin et al., 1997, Chu-Carroll et al., 1999, Goel et al., 2005), for mapping loosely constrained user utterances to a finite number of predefined semantic categories.",
        "The natural language modality – as opposed to directed dialog – was initially used mostly for call-routing, i.e. to route calls to the appropriate call center based on a more or less lengthy description of the reason for the call by the user.",
        "While the model behind the first and second generations of dialog applications can be described by the form-filling paradigm, and the interaction follows a predetermined simple script, the systems of the third generation have raised to a qualitatively different level of complexity.",
        "Problem solving applications, like customer care, help desk, and technical support, are characterized by a level of complexity ranging in the thousands of DMs, for a number of turns of dynamic interaction that can reach into the dozens.",
        "As the sophistication of the applications evolved, so did the system architecture by moving the logic from the client (VoiceXML browser, or voice-browser) to the server (Pieraccini and Huerta, 2005).",
        "More and more system are today based on generic dialog application server which interprets a dialog specification described by a – typically proprietary – markup language and serve the voice-browser with dynamically generated VoiceXML documents.",
        "Finally, the interaction modality of the third generation systems is moving from the strictly directed dialog application, to directed dialog, with some natural language (SSLU) turns, and some limited mixed-initiative (i.e. the possibility for the user to change the course of the dialog by making an unsolicited request)."

        "When something goes wrong with the service, the only choice for subscribers is to call a technical support center.",
        "Unfortunately, staffing a call center with enough agents trained to help solve even the most common problems results in prohibitive costs for the provider, even when outsourcing to less costly locations End users often experience long waiting times and poor service from untrained agents.",
        "With the magnitude of the daily increase in the number of subscribers of those services, the situation with human agents is bound to worsen.",

        "- It may be difficult to instruct non-technically savvy users on how to perform a troubleshooting step (e.g. Now renew your IP address) or request technical information (e.g. Are you using a Voice over IP phone service?)",
        "- Certain events cannot be controlled.",
        "For instance, the time it would take for a user to complete a troubleshooting step, like rebooting a PC, is often unpredictable.",
        "- The acoustic environment may be challenging.",
        "Users may be asked to switch their TV on, reboot their PC, or check the cable connections.",
        "All these operations can cause noise that can trigger the speech recognizer and affect the course of the interaction.",
        "On the other hand, one can leverage the automated diagnosis or troubleshooting tools that are currently used by human agent and improve the efficiency of the interaction.",
        "For instance, if the IP address of the digital devices at the user premises is available, one can ping them, verify their connectivity, download new firmware, and perform automated troubleshooting steps in the background without the intervention of the user.",

        "A specific prompt enumerates all the possible reasons for a call, and the user would choose one of them.",

        "Directed dialog would be the preferred choice in terms of accuracy and cost of development.",
        "Unfortunately, in most technical support applications, the number of call-reasons can be very large, and thus prompting the caller through a directed dialog menu would be impractical.",
        "Besides, even though a long menu can be structured hierarchically as a cascade of several shorter menus, the terms used for indicating the different choices may be misleading or meaningless for some of the users (e.g. do you have a problem with hardware, software, or networking?).",
        "Natural language with SSLU is generally the best choice for problem identification.",
        "In practice, users mostly don't know what the actual problem with their service is (e.g. modem is wrongly configured), but typically they describe their observations – or symptoms – which are observable manifestations of the problem.",
        "and not the problem itself (e.g. symptom: I can't connect to the Web, problem: modem wrongly configured).",
        "Correctly identifying the symptom expressed in natural language by users is the goal of the SSLU module.",
        "SSLU provides a mapping between input utterances and a set of predetermined categories.",
        "SSLU has been effectively used in the past to enable automatic call-routing.",
        "Typically call-routing applications have a number of categories, of the order of a dozen or so, which are designed based on the different routes to which the IVR is supposed to dispatch the callers.",
        "So, generally, in callrouting applications, the categories are known and determined prior to any data collection.",
        "One could follow the same approach for the problem identification SSLU, i.e. determine a number of a-priori problem categories and then map a collection of training symptom utterances to each one of them.",
        "There are several issues with this approach.",
        "First, a complete set of categories – the problems – may not be known prior to the acquisition and analysis of a significant number of utterances.",
        "Often the introduction of new home devices or services (such as DVR, or HDTV) creates new problems and new symptoms that can be discovered only by analyzing large amounts of utterance data.",
        "Then, as we noted above, the relationship between the problems – or broad categories of problems – and the manifestations (i.e. the symptoms) may not be obvious to the caller.",
        "Thus, confirming a broad category in response to a detailed symptom utterance may induce the user to deny it or to give a verbose response (e.g. Caller: I cannot get to the Web.",
        "System: I understand you have a problem with your modem configuration, is that right?",
        "Caller: Hmm... no.",
        "I said I cannot get to the Web.",
        ").",
        "Finally, caller descriptions have different degrees of specificity (e.g.",
        "I have a problem with my cable service vs.",
        "The picture on my TV is pixilated on all channels).",
        "Thus, the categories should reflect a hierarchy of symptoms, from vague to specific, that need to be taken into proper account in the design of the interaction.",
        "As a result from the above considerations, SSLU for symptom identification needs to be designed in order to reflect the high-resolution multitude and specificity hierarchy of symptoms that emerge from the analysis of a large quantity of utterances.",
        "Figure 1 shows an excerpt from the hierarchy of symptoms for a cable TV troubleshooting application derived from the analysis of almost 100,000 utterance transcriptions.",
        "Each node of the tree partially represented by Figure 1 is associated with a number of training utterances from users describing that particular symptom in their own words.",
        "For instance the topmost node of the hierarchy, \"TV Problem\", corresponds to vague utterances such as I have a problem with my TV or My cable TV does not work.",
        "The\" Ordering\" node represents requests of the type I have a problem with ordering a show, which is still a somewhat vague request, since one can order \"Pay-per-view\" or \"On-demand\" events, and they correspond to different processes and troubleshooting steps.",
        "Finally, at the most detailed level of the hierarchy, for instance for the node \"TV Problem-Ordering-On Demand-Error\", one finds utterances such as I tried to order a movie on demand, but all I get is an error code on the TV.",

        "The utterances were transcribed and initially annotated based on an initial set of symptoms.",
        "The annotation was carried out by creating an annotation guide document which includes, for each symptom, a detailed verbal description, a few utterance examples, and relevant keywords.",
        "Human annotators were instructed to label each utterance with the correct category based on the annotation guide and their work was monitored systematically by the system designer.",
        "After a first initial annotation of the whole corpus, the annotation consistency was measured by computing a cluster similarity distance between the utterances corresponding to all possible pairs of symptoms.",
        "When the consistency between a pair of symptoms was below a given threshold, the clusters were analyzed, and actions taken by the designer in order to improve the consistency, including reassign utterances and, if necessary, modifying the annotation guide.",

        "Table 2 summarizes the results on an independent test set of 10,332 utterances.",

        "Improvement in the classification performance can result by better language models (i.e. some of the errors are due to incorrect word recognition by the ASR) and better classifiers, which need to take into account more features of the incoming utterances, such as word order and contextual information.",
        "Accuracy is not the only measure to provide an assessment of how the symptom described by the caller is effectively captured.",

        "The full symptom identification interactions following the initial open prompt was transcribed and annotated for 895 calls.",
        "The SSLU used in this application consisted of 36 symptoms structured in a hierarchy with a maximum depth of 3.",
        "For each interaction we tracked the following events:",
        "- the first user response to the open question",
        "- successive responses in case of re-prompting because of speech recognition rejection or timeout",

        "The following rows are the number of calls where the identified symptom was wrong and the caller still accepted it during confirmation, the symptom was correct and the caller denied it, and the symptom was wrong and denied, respectively.",
        "Finally there were 57 calls where the caller did not provide any confirmation (e.g. hung up, timed out, ASR rejected the confirmation utterance even after re-prompting, etc.",
        "), and 100 calls in which it was not possible to collect the symptom (e.g. rejections of first and second re-prompts, timeouts, etc.)",
        "In both cases – i.e.",
        "no confirmation or no symptom collection at all – the call continued with a different strategy (e.g. moved to a directed dialog, or escalated the call to a human agent).",
        "The interesting result from this experiment is that the SSLU returned a correct symptom 59.8 + 2.5 = 62.3% of the times (considering both in-domain and out-of-domain utterances), but the actual \"perceived\" accuracy (i.e. when the user accepted the result) was higher, and precisely 59.8 + 13.2 = 73%.",
