        "The bulk of the literature on spoken dialog systems is based on the simple architecture in which the input speech is processed by a statistical language model-based recognizer (SLM-based recognizer) to produce a word string.",
        "This word string is further processed by a robust parser (Ward, 1990) or call router (Gorin et al., 1997) to be converted in a semantic interpretation.",
        "However, it is striking to see that a large portion of deployed commercial applications do not follow this architecture and approach the recognition/interpretation problem by relying on hand-crafted rules (context-free grammars - CFGs).",
        "The apparent reasons for this are the upfront cost and additional delays of collecting domain-specific utterances to properly train the SLM (not to mention semantic tagging needed to train the call router) (Hemphill et al., 1990; Knight et al., 2001; Gorin et al., 1997).",
        "Choosing to use a grammar-based approach also makes the application predictable and relatively easy to design.",
        "On the other hand, these applications are usually very rigid: the users are allowed only a finite set of ways to input their requests and, by way of consequences, these applications suffer from high out-of-grammar (OOG) rates or out-of-coverage rates.",
        "A few studies have been published comparing grammar-based and SLM-based approaches to speech understanding.",
        "In (Knight et al., 2001), a comparison of grammar-based and robust approaches is presented for a user-initiative home automation application.",
        "The authors concluded that it was relatively easy to use the corpus collected during the course of the application development to train a SLM which would perform better on out-of-coverage utterances, while degrading the accuracy on in-coverage utterances.",
        "They also reported that the SLM-based system showed slightly lower word error rate but higher semantic error rate for the users who know the application's coverage.",
        "In (Rayner et al., 2005), a rigorous test protocol is presented to compare grammar-based and robust approaches in the context of a medical translation system.",
        "The paper highlights the difficulties to construct a clean experimental set-up.",
        "Efforts are spent to control the training set of both approaches to have them align.",
        "The training sets are defined as the set of data available to build each system: for a grammar-based system, it might be a series of sample dialogs.",
        "(ten Bosch, 2005) presents experiments comparing grammar-based and SLM-based systems for naive users and an expert user.",
        "They conclude that the SLM-based system is most effective in reducing the error rate for naive users.",
        "Recently (see (Balakrishna et al., 2006)), a process was presented to automatically build SLMs from a wide variety of sources (in-service data, thesaurus, WordNet and worldwide web).",
        "Results on data from commercial speech applications presented therein echo earlier results (Knight et al., 2001) while reducing the effort to build interpretation rules.",
        "Most of the above studies are not based on data collected on deployed applications.",
        "One of the conclusions from previous work, based on the measured fact that in-coverage accuracy ofthe grammar-based systems was far better than the SLM one, was that as people get more experience with the applications, they will naturally learn its coverage and gravitate towards it.",
        "While this can be an acceptable option for some types of applications (when the user population tends to be experienced or captive), it certainly is not a possibility for large-scale commercial applications that are targeted at the general public.",
        "A few examples of such applications are public transit schedules and fares information, self-help applications for utilities, banks, telecommunications business, and etc.",
        "Steering application design and research based on in-coverage accuracy is not suitable for these types of applications because a large fraction of the users are naives and tend to use more natural and unconstrained speech inputs.",
        "This paper exploits techniques known since the 90's (SLM with robust parsing, (Ward, 1990)) and applies them to build robust speech understanding into existing large scale directed dialog grammar-based applications.",
        "This practical application of (Ward, 1990; Knight et al., 2001; Rayner et al., 2005; ten Bosch, 2005) is cast as an upgrade problem which must obey the following constraints.",

        "The wordSLM benefits from the full prior information all along the search.",
        "We have solved this by training a small wordSLM within each grammar (class): for each grammar, the training set for the small wordSLM is composed of the set of fragments from all utterances in the main training set that fire that specific rule.",
