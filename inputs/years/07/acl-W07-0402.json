        "Nesson and Shieber (2006) showed how a now-standard variant of the tree-adjoining grammar (TAG) formalism (multi-component, multiple adjunction, finite-feature-based TAG), when synchronized, leads to a natural analysis of the syntax-semantics relation, including handling of syntactic movement phenomena such as wh questions and rel-ativization, semantic \"movement\" phenomena such as quantification, quantifier scope ambiguity, and even their interactions as found in pied-piped relative clauses.",
        "phenomena were previously viewed as problematic for TAG analyses, leading to the hypothesizing of various extensions to the TAG formalism (Kallmeyer and Romero, 2004, and work cited therein).",

        "We emphasize that no novel formal devices are postulated to achieve this increased coverage â€“ just a simple, natural and uniform change to the canonical structure of NPs and their semantics.",

        "In order to allow the scope-giving part of the wh-word to percolate up to the root of the semantics of the main verb, each tree set that it adjoins into on its way must also have a scope part in the semantics to which it can adjoin.",
