        "In this paper, we propose a discriminative re-ranking approach for word alignment which allows us to make use of structural features effectively.",
        "The alignment algorithm first generates a list of k-best alignments using local features.",
        "Then it re-ranks this list of k-best alignments using global features which consider the entire alignment structure (set of alignment links) and the syntactic divergence that exists between the sentence pair.",
        "Use of structural information associated with the alignment can be particularly helpful for language pairs for which a large amount of unsupervised data is not available to measure accurately the word cooccurence values but which do have a small set of supervised data to learn the structure and divergence across the language pair.",
        "We have tested our model on the English-Hindi language pair.",
        "Here is an example of an alignment between English-Hindi which shows the complexity of the alignment task for this language pair.",
        "To learn the weights associated with the parameters used in our model, we have used a learning framework called MIRA (The Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm) (McDonald et al., 2005; Crammer and Singer, 2003).",
        "This is an online learning algorithm which looks at one sentence pair at a time and compares the k-best predictions of the alignment algorithm with the gold alignment to update the parameter weights appropriately.",
        "In the past, popular approaches for doing word alignment have largely been generative (Och and Ney, 2003; Vogel et al., 1996).",
        "In the past couple of years, the discriminative models for doing word alignment have gained popularity because of the flexibility they offer in using a large variety of features and in combining information from various sources.",
        "(Taskar et al., 2005) cast the problem of alignment as a maximum weight bipartite matching problem, where nodes correspond to the words in the two sentences.",
        "The link between a pair of words, (ep,hq) is associated with a score (score(ep ,hq)) reflecting the desirability of the existence of the link.",
        "The matching problem is solved by formulating it as a linear programming problem.",
        "The parameter estimation is done within the framework of large margin estimation by reducing the problem to a quadratic program (QP).",
        "The main limitation of this work is that the features considered are local to the alignment links joining pairs of words.",
        "The score of an alignment is the sum of scores of individual alignment links measured independently i.e., it is assumed that there is no dependence between the alignment links.",
        "(Lacoste-Julien et al., 2006) extend the above approach to include features for fertility and first-order correlation between alignment links of consecutive words in the source sentence.",
        "They solve this by formulating the problem as a quadratic assignment problem (QAP).",
        "But, even this algorithm cannot include more general features over the entire alignment.",
        "In contrast to the above two approaches, our approach does not impose any constraints on the feature space except for fertility (<1) of words in the source language.",
        "In our approach, we model the one-to-one and many-to-one links between the source sentence and target sentence.",
        "The many-to-many alignment links are inferred in the post-processing stage using simple generic rules.",
        "Another positive aspect of our approach is the application of MIRA.",
        "It, being an online approach, converges fast and still retains the generalizing capability of the large margin approach.",
        "(Moore, 2005) has proposed an approach which does not impose any restrictions on the form of model features.",
        "But, the search technique has certain heuristic procedures dependent on the types of features used.",
        "For example, there is little variation in the alignment search between the LLR (Log-likelihood ratio) based model and the CLP (Conditional-Link Probability) based model.",
        "LLR and CLP are the word association statistics used in Moore's work (Moore, 2005).",
        "In contrast to the above approach, our search technique is more general.",
        "It achieves this by breaking the search into two steps, first by using local features to get the k-best alignments and then by using structural features to re-rank the list.",
        "Also, by using all the k-best alignments for updating the parameters through MIRA, it is possible to model the entire inference algorithm but in Moore's work, only the best alignment is used to update the weights of parameters.",
        "(Fraser and Marcu, 2006) have proposed an algorithm for doing word alignment which applies a discriminative step at every iteration of the traditional Expectation-Maximization algorithm used in IBM models.",
        "This model still relies on the generative story and achieves only a limited freedom in choosing the features.",
        "(Blun-som and Cohn, 2006) do word alignment by combining features using conditional random fields.",
        "Even though their approach allows one to include overlapping features while training a discriminative model, it still does not allow us to use features that capture information of the entire alignment structure.",
        "In Section 2, we describe the alignment search in detail.",
        "Section 3 describes the features that we have considered in our paper.",
        "Section 4 talks about the Parameter optimization.",
