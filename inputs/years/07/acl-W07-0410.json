        "One obvious reason is the comparable ease, which with data-driven systems can be built once some parallel data is available.",

        "In our Rule-Based MT (RBMT) system, translation rules include parsing, transfer, and generation information, similar to the modified transfer approach used in the early Metal system (Hutchins and Somers, 1992).",
        "The initial lexicon (479 entries) and grammar (40 rules) used in our experiments were manually written to cover the syntactic structures and the vocabulary of the first 400 sentences of the",
        "AVENUE Elicitation Corpus (Probst et al. 2001).",
        "The Elicitation Corpus contains sets of minimal pairs in English and it was designed to cover a variety of linguistic phenomena.",
        "Building these two language-dependent components took a computational linguist 2-3 months.",
        "Figures 1 and 2 show examples of a translation rules in the grammar and the lexicon.",
        "(VP).",
        "The original grammar and lexicon were automatically improved with an Automatic Rule Refiner, guided by a few bilingual speaker corrections (Font Llitjos & Ridmann 2007).",
        "In this approach, automatic refinements only affect the target language side of translation rules, namely transfer and generation information.",
        "The refined MT system used in our experiments is the result of adding 30 agreement constraints to the grammar rules, which makes the grammar tighter (leading to an increase in precision), as well as adding three new rules to cover new syntactic structures and five lexical entries for new senses and forms of existing words (leading to an increase in recall).",
        "The Transfer Engine, or Xfer engine for short, combines the translation grammar and lexicon in order to produce translations of a source language sentence into a target language.",
        "The Xfer engine incorporates the three main processes involved in Transfer-based MT: parsing of the source language input, transfer of the parsed constituents of the source sentence to their corresponding structured constituents on the target language side, and generation of the target sentence.",
        "The currently implemented algorithm is similar to bottom-up chart parsing as described for example in Allen (1995).",
        "A chart is first populated with all constituent structures that were created in the course of parsing the source language sentence with the source-side portion of the transfer grammar.",
        "Transfer and generation are applied to each constituent entry.",
        "The transfer rules associated with each entry in the chart are used in order to determine the corresponding constituent structure on the target language side.",
        "At the word level, lexical transfer rules are used in order to get the different lexical choices.",
        "Often, no parse for the entire source sentence can be found.",
        "Partial parses are concatenated sequentially to generate complete translations.",
        "In the current version of the Xfer system, the output can be a first-best translation or a n-best list, which can be used for additional n-best list rescor-ing.",
        "The alternatives arise from lexical ambiguity and multiple synonymous choices for lexical items in the dictionary, but also from syntactic ambiguity and multiple competing hypotheses from the grammar.",
        "For our experiments, we used version 3 of the Xfer engine.",
        "An older version of the Xfer engine is described in detail in Peterson (2002).",
        "The Xfer engine can generate multiple translations.",
        "This requires a quality score to be assigned to all the alternatives.",
        "Based on these scores, the 1-best translation will be selected by the system.",
        "Fragmentation Penalty",
        "In the original Xfer system the only score used to rank translation alternatives was a heuristic fragmentation penalty.",
        "The fragmentation penalty is essentially the number of different chunks (rules or lexical entries not embedded in another rule) that span the whole translation.",
        "The intuition behind this score is that the more partial parses are necessary to span the entire sentence the less likely the resulting translation will be a good one.",
        "N-gram LM",
        "The fragmentation feature is rather weak.",
        "It does not distinguish between words which are more likely to be seen in the target language and words which are less likely to be used.",
        "To generate sentences which are not only grammatically correct, but also use words and word sequences that are more natural and more common, data-driven machine translation systems use a n-gram language model.",
        "To get the same benefit in the Xfer system, an n-gram LM has been integrated with the engine.",
        "This has the advantage that in the case of pruning, the LM score can be used to avoid pruning good hypotheses, in addition to re re-rank the final translations.",
        "For our experiments, a suffix array language model based on the SALM toolkit (Zhang & Vogel, 2006) is used.",
        "Length Model",
        "To adjust for the length of the translations generated by the system, the difference between the number of words generated and the expected number of words is added as a very simple feature.",
        "The expected length is calculated by multiplying the source sentence length by the ratio of the number of target and source words in the training corpus.",
        "The effect of this feature is to balance globally the length of the translations.",
        "To deal with the combinatorial explosion during the parsing/translation process, pruning has to be applied.",
        "Only the n top-ranking hypotheses are kept in each cell of the chart.",
        "The ranking of these partial translations is based on their language model score, which at this time is only an approximation, as the true history has not been seen and cannot be taken into account."
