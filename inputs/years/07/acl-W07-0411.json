        "Since their appearance, string-based evaluation metrics such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and NIST (Doddington, 2002) have been the standard tools used for evaluating MT quality.",
        "Both score a candidate translation on the basis of the number of n grams shared with one or more reference translations.",
        "Automatic measures are indispensable in the development of MT systems, because they allow MT developers to conduct frequent, cost-effective, and fast evaluations of their evolving models.",
        "These advantages come at a price, though: an automatic comparison of n-grams measures only the string similarity of the candidate translation to one or more reference strings, and will penalize any divergence from them.",
        "In effect, a candidate translation expressing the source meaning accurately and fluently will be given a low score if the lexical and syntactic choices it contains, even though perfectly legitimate, are not present in at least one of the references.",
        "Necessarily, this score would differ from a much more favourable human judgement that such a translation would receive.",
        "The limitations of string comparison are the reason why it is advisable to provide multiple references for a candidate translation in BLEU- or NIST-based evaluations.",
        "While Zhang and Vogel (2004) argue that increasing the size of the test set gives even more reliable system scores than multiple references, this still does not solve the inadequacy of BLEU and NIST for sentence-level or small set evaluation.",
        "In addition, in practice even a number of references do not capture the whole potential variability of the translation.",
        "Moreover, when designing a statistical MT system, the need for large amounts of training data limits the researcher to collections of parallel corpora such as Europarl (Koehn, 2005), which provides only one reference, namely the target text; and the cost of creating additional reference translations of the test set, usually a few thousand sentences long, is often prohibitive.",
        "Therefore, it would be desirable to find an evaluation method that accepts legitimate syntactic and lexical differences between the translation and the reference, thus better mirroring human assessment.",
        "In this paper, we present a novel method that automatically evaluates the quality of translation based on the dependency structure of the sentence, rather than its surface form.",
        "Dependencies abstract away from the particulars of the surface string (and CFG tree) realization and provide a \"normalized\" representation of (some) syntactic variants of a given sentence.",
        "The translation and reference files are analyzed by a treebank-based, probabilistic Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) parser (Cahill et al., 2004), which produces a set of dependency triples for each input.",
        "The translation set is compared to the reference set, and the number of matches is calculated, giving the precision, recall, and f-score for that particular translation.",
        "In addition, to allow for the possibility of valid lexical differences between the translation and the references, we follow Kauchak and Barzilay (2006) and Owczarzak et al.",
        "(2006) in adding a number of paraphrases in the process of evaluation to raise the number of matches between the translation and the reference, leading to a higher score.",
        "Comparing the LFG-based evaluation method with other popular metrics: BLEU, NIST, General Text Matcher (GTM) (Turian et al., 2003), Translation Error Rate (TER) (Snover et al., 2006), and METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), we show that combining dependency representations with paraphrases leads to a more accurate evaluation that correlates better with human judgment.",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a basic introduction to LFG; Section 3 describes related work; Section 4 describes our method and gives results of two experiments on different sets of data: 4,000 sentences from Spanish-English Europarl and 16,800 sentences of Chinese-English newswire text from the Linguistic Data Consortium's (LDC) Multiple Translation project; Section 5 discusses ongoing work; Section 6 concludes.",

        "In Lexical-Functional Grammar (Bresnan, 2001) sentence structure is represented in terms of c(onstituent)-structure and f(unctional)-structure.",
        "C-structure represents the surface string word order and the hierarchical organisation of phrases in terms of CFG trees.",
        "F-structures are recursive feature (or attribute-value) structures, representing abstract grammatical relations, such as subj(ect), obj(ect), obl(ique), adj'(unct), approximating to predicate-argument structure or simple logical forms.",
        "C-structure and f-structure are related in terms of functional annotations (attribute-value structure equations) in c-structure trees, describing f-structures.",
        "While c-structure is sensitive to surface word order, f-structure is not.",

        "Even the creators of BLEU point out that it may not correlate particularly well with human judgment at the sentence level (Papineni et al., 2002).",
        "A side effect of this phenomenon is that BLEU is less reliable for smaller data sets, so the advantage it provides in the speed of evaluation is to some extent counterbalanced by the time spent by developers on producing a sufficiently large test set in order to obtain a reliable score for their system.",
        "Recently a number of attempts to remedy these shortcomings have led to the development of other automatic MT evaluation metrics.",
        "Some of them concentrate mainly on word order, like General Text Matcher (Turian et al., 2003), which calculates precision and recall for translation-reference pairs, weighting contiguous matches more than non-sequential matches, or Translation Error Rate (Snover et al., 2005), which computes the number of substitutions, inserts, deletions, and shifts necessary to transform the translation text to match the reference.",
        "Others try to accommodate both syntactic and lexical differences between the candidate translation and the reference, like CDER (Leusch et al., 2006), which employs a version of edit distance for word substitution and reordering; or METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005), which uses stemming and WordNet synonymy.",

        "The process underlying the evaluation of f-structure quality against a gold standard can be used in automatic MT evaluation as well: we parse the translation and the reference, and then, for each sentence, we check the set of translation dependencies against the set of reference dependencies, counting the number of matches.",
        "As a result, we obtain the precision and recall scores for the translation, and we calculate the f-score for the given pair.",
        "Because we are comparing two outputs that were produced automatically, there is a possibility that the result will not be noise-free.",
        "To assess the amount of noise that the parser may introduce we conducted an experiment where 100 English Europarl sentences were modified by hand in such a way that the position of adjuncts was changed, but the sentence remained grammatical and the meaning was not changed.",

        "Using the standard GIZA++ software and the refined word alignment strategy of Och and Ney (2003) on our test set of 4,000 Spanish-English sentences, the method generated paraphrases for just over 1100 items.",
        "These paraphrases served to create new individual best-matching references for the Logomedia and Pharaoh translations.",
        "Due to the small size of the paraphrase set, only about 20% of reference sentences were actually modified to better reflect the translation.",
        "This, in turn, led to little difference in scores.",

        "To maximize the number of matches between a translation and a reference, Kauchak and Barzilay (2006) use WordNet synonyms during evaluation.",

        "This time, given the extensive database containing synonyms for over 150,000 items, around 70% of reference sentences were modified: 67% for Pharaoh, and 75% for Logomedia.",
        "Note that the number of substitutions is higher for Logomedia; this confirms the intuition that the translation produced by Pharaoh, trained on the domain which is also the source of the reference text, will need fewer lexical replacements than Logomedia, which is based on a general non-domain-specific model.",
        "Table 3 shows the difference between the scores which Pharaoh's and Logomedia's translations obtained from each metric: a positive number shows by how much Pharaoh's score was higher than Logomedia's, and a negative number reflects Logomedia's higher score (the percentages are absolute values).",
        "As can be seen, all the metrics scored Pharaoh higher, inlcuding METEOR and the dependency-based method that were boosted with WordNet.",

        "However, the dependency-based method in almost all its versions has decidedly the highest correlation in this area.",

        "Second, and somewhat surprisingly, in this detailed examination the relative order of the metrics changed.",
        "The predicate-only version of the dependency-based method appears to be less adequate for correlation with human scores than its non-restricted versions.",
        "As to the correlation with human evaluation of translation accuracy, our method currently falls short of METEOR and even NIST.",
        "This is caused by the fact that both",
        "METEOR and NIST assign relatively little importance to the position of a specific word in a sentence, therefore rewarding the translation for content rather than linguistic form.",
        "For our dependency-based method, the noise introduced by the parser might be the reason for low correlation: if even one side of the translation-reference pair contains parsing errors, this may lead to a less reliable score.",
        "An obvious solution to this problem, which we are examining at the moment, is to include a number of best parses for each side of the evaluation.",
        "High correlation with human judgements of fluency and lower correlation with accuracy results in a high second place for our dependency-based method when it comes to the average correlation coefficient.",
        "The WordNet-boosted dependency-based method scores only slightly lower than METEOR with WordNet.",

        "First, we would also like to adapt the process of translation-reference dependency comparison to include n-best parsers for the input sentences, as well as some basic transformations which would allow an even deeper logical analysis of input (e.g. passive to active voice transformation).",

        "While retaining the advantage of having a similar size to a corresponding set of WordNet synonyms, this set will also capture low-level syntactic variations, which can increase the number of matches and the correlation with human scores.",
        "Finally, we want to take advantage of the fact that the score produced by the dependency-based method is the proportional average of f-scores for a group of up to 32 (but usually far fewer) different dependency types.",

        "The dependency-based method can be further augmented by using paraphrases or WordNet synonyms, and is available in full version and predicate-only version.",
        "In our experiments we showed that the dependency-based method correlates higher than any other metric with human evaluation of translation fluency, and shows high correlation with the average human score.",
        "The use of dependencies in MT evaluation is a rather new idea and requires more research to improve it, but the method shows potential to become an accurate evaluation metric.",
