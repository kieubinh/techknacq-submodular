        "In this paper, we provide a conceptual basis for thinking of machine translation in terms of synchronous grammars in general, and probabilistic synchronous tree-adjoining grammars in particular.",
        "The basis is conceptual in that the arguments are based on generalizations about the translation relation at a conceptual level, and not on empirical results at an engineering level.",
        "Nonetheless, the conceptual idea is consistent with current efforts in MT, and in fact may be seen as underlying so-called syntax-aware MT.",
        "We will argue that the nature of the translation relation is such that an appropriate formalism for realizing it should have a set of properties – expressivity, trainability, efficiency – that we will characterize more precisely below.",
        "There may be multiple formalisms that can achieve these ends, but one, at least, is probabilistic synchronous tree-adjoining grammar, and to our knowledge, no other qualitatively distinct formalism has been argued to display all of the requisite properties.",
        "Below, we will discuss the various properties, with particular attention to an examination of a particular source of data about the translation relation, namely bilingual dictionaries.",
        "Multilingual lexicography has a history of some four millennia or more.",
        "In that time, a great deal of knowledge about particular translation relations has been explicitly codified in multilingual dictionaries.",
        "More interestingly for our present purposes, multilingual dictionaries through their own structuring implicitly express information about translation relations in general.",
        "In Section 2, we introduce the Construction Principle, a property of the translation relation implicit in the structure of bilingual dictionaries throughout their four millennium history.",
        "Section 3 provides a review of synchronous tree-adjoining grammars showing that this formalism directly incorporates the Construction Principle and allows the formal implementation of bilingual dictionary relations.",
        "In Section 4, we argue that the probabilistic variant of STAG (PSTAG) inherits the expressivity advantages of STAG while adding the trainability of statistical MT.",
        "Section 5 concerns the practical efficacy of STAG.",
        "We conclude (Section 6) with an overall proposal for the use of PSTAG in a statistical MT system.",
        "By virtue of its fundamentality to the modeling of the translation relation, PSTAG or its formal relatives merits empirical examination as a basis for statistical MT."

        "The phenomenon that underlies the use of synchronous grammars for MT is simply this:",
        "The Construction Principle:",
        "Words and phrases translate differently in construction with other words.",
        "The notion of in construction with is a structural notion.",
        "A word is in construction with another if they are related by a structural relation of some sort dependent on the identity or role of the word.",
        "For example, the English word take is prototypically translated with a form of the Italian prendere {take / prendere) 661.",
        "But when its object is a bath, as in the sentence \"I like to take several long bubble baths every day\", the word is translated with a form of fare.",
        "More accurately, the construction typified by the phrase take a bath is translated by the corresponding construction typified by the phrase fare un bagno ({take a bath / fare un bagno)662).",
        "One may think that we are still in the realm of the Phrase Principle; the phrase take a bath translates as the phrase fare un bagno.",
        "But the generalization is clearly much more general than that in several ways.",
        "First, the notion of in construction with does not necessarily lead to contiguous phrases because of variability within the constructions.",
        "Bilingual dictionaries have developed notational conventions for such cases.",
        "When freely variable objects can intervene between the words in construction, a kind of variable word is used in dictionary entries, such as sb (somebody), sth (something), qn (qualcuno), qc (qualcosa).",
        "The word take participates in another construction {take sb by surprise / cogliere [literally \"catch\"] qn di sorpresa).",
        "The phenomenon is widespread.",
        "We find entries for light verb phrases such as take sb by surprise, idiomatic constructions such as {pull SB's leg / prendere in giro qn)507, and particle constructions such as {call sb up / chiamare qn)86.",
        "These variable notations not only stand in for variable textual material and categorize that material (as specifying an entity (qc) or human (qn)) but also provide links between the portions of the two constructions.",
        "Whatever lexical material instantiates a sb variable on the English side, its translation instantiates the qn in the Italian.",
        "Thus translations require not only structure in the monolingual representations, but structure bilingually across them.",
        "Second, even constructions that are in and of themselves contiguous may become discontiguous by intervention of other lexical material: modifiers, appositives, and the like.",
        "An example has already been seen in the example \"I like to take several long bubble baths every day\".",
        "There is no contiguity between take and bath here.",
        "A formalism based purely on concatenation of contiguous phrases will be unable to model such constructions.",
        "These two aspects of variability and intervention within and between constructions preclude simple concatenative formalisms such as finite-state or context-free formalisms.",
        "A natural question arises as to the prevalence of such nontrivial bilingual constructions.",
        "Presumably, if they are sufficiently rare and exotic, it may be acceptable, and in fact optimal, from an engineering point of view to ignore them and stay with simpler formalisms.",
        "We can ask the prevalence question at the level of types or tokens.",
        "At the type level, a simple examination of a comprehensive modern bilingual dictionary reveals a quite high frequency of non-word-for-word translations.",
        "Analysis of a small random subsam-ple of HCICD yielded only 34% of entries of the {acqua / water) 10 sort.",
        "In contrast, 52% were contiguous multi-word translations, e.g., {guarda caso / strangely enough) 100.",
        "An additional 11% of entries had variable content, split about equally between entries with overt marking of variability ({ prendere qn in castagna / to catch sb in the act)100) and implicit variability ({haifatto caso al suo cappello?",
        "/ did you notice his hat?)",
        "100, in which the {suo cap-pello / his hat) pair serves as a placeholder for other translates.",
        "(The remaining 3% is accounted for by entries providing monolingual equivalences and untranslated proper names.)",
        "The line between implicit variability and multi-word translations is quite permeable, so that many of the 54% of entries classified as the latter might in fact be better thought of as the former, and in any case many of the multi-word en-",

        "tries would be subject to noncontiguity through insertion of other lexical material.",
        "At the type level, then, there is plenty of evidence for the Phrase Principle and the Construction Principle.",
        "At the token level, the general interest in so-called syntax-aware statistical MT approaches is itself evidence that researchers believe that the tokens accounting for the performance gap in current systems based on the Word and Phrase Principles transcend those principles in some way, presumably because they manifest the Construction Principle.",

        "Expressing this relation in other frameworks involves either limiting its scope (for instance, to particular objects and intervening material), expanding its scope (by separating the translations of the contiguous portions of the constructions), or mimicking the structure of the STAG (as described at the end of Section 5).",
        "The basic idea of using synchronous TAG for machine translation dates from the original definition (Shieber and Schabes, 1990), and has been pursued by several researchers (Abeille et al., 1990; Dras, 1999; Prigent, 1994; Palmer et al., 1999), but only recently in its probabilistic form (Nesson et al., 2006).",
        "The directness with which the formalism follows from the structure of bilingual dictionaries has not to our knowledge been previously noted.",
        "It leads to the possibility of making direct use of bilingual dictionary material in a statistical machine translation system.",
        "But even if the formalism is not used in that way, there is import to the fact that its expressivity matches that thought by lexicographers of the last several millennia to be needed for capturing the translation relation; this fact indicates at least that STAG's use as a substrate for MT systems may be a promising research direction to pursue, should other necessary properties be satisfiable as well.",
