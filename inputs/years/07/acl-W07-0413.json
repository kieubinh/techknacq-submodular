        "The problem of machine translation can be viewed as consisting of two subproblems: (a) lexical selection, where appropriate target language lexical items are chosen for each source language lexical item and (b) lexical reordering, where the chosen target language lexical items are rearranged to produce a meaningful target language string.",
        "Most of the previous work on statistical machine translation, as exemplified in (Brown et al., 1993), employs word-alignment algorithm (such as GIZA++ (Och et al., 1999)) that provides local associations between source words and target words.",
        "The source-to-target word-alignments are sometimes augmented with target-to-source word alignments in order to improve the precision of these local associations.",
        "Further, the word-level alignments are extended to phrase-level alignments in order to increase the extent of local associations.",
        "The phrasal associations compile some amount of (local) lexical reordering of the target words â€“ those permitted by the size of the phrase.",
        "Most of the state-of-the-art machine translation systems use these phrase-level associations in conjunction with a target language model to produce the target sentence.",
        "There is relatively little emphasis on (global) lexical reordering other than the local re-orderings permitted within the phrasal alignments.",
        "A few exceptions are the hierarchical (possibly syntax-based) transduction models (Wu, 1997; Alshawi et al., 1998; Yamada and Knight, 2001; Chiang, 2005) and the string transduction models (Kanthak et al., 2005).",
        "In this paper, we present three models for doing discriminative machine translation using global lexical selection and lexical reordering.",

        "Bag-of-Words model: Given a source sentence, each of the target words are chosen by looking at the entire source sentence.",
        "The target language words are then permuted in various ways and then, the best permutation is chosen using the language model on the target side.",
        "The size of the search space of these permutations can be set by a parameter called the permutation window.",
        "This model does not allow long distance re-orderings of target words unless a very large permutation window chosen which is very expensive.",
        "2.",
        "Sequential Lexical Choice model : Given a source sentence, the target words are predicted in an order which is faithful to the order of words in the source sentence.",
        "Now, the number of permutations that need to be examined to obtain the best target language strings are much less when compared to the Bag-of-Words model.",
        "This model is expected to give good results for language pairs such as English-French for which only local word order variations exist between sentences.",
        "3.",
        "Hierarchical lexical association and reordering model : For language pairs such as English-Hindi or English-Japanese where there is a high degree of global reordering (Figure 1), it is necessary to be able to handle long distance movement of words/phrases.",
        "In this approach, the target words predicted through global lexical selection are associated with various nodes of the source dependency tree and then, hierarchical reordering is done to obtain the order of words in the target sentence.",

      "text": [
        "For global lexical selection, in contrast to the local approaches of associating target words to the source words, the target words are associated to the entire source sentence.",
        "The intuition is that there may be lexico-syntactic features of the source sentence (not necessarily a single source word) that might trigger the presence of a target word in the target sentence.",
        "Furthermore, it might be difficult to exactly associate a target word to a source sentence in many situations - (a) when translations are not exact but paraphrases (b) the target language does not have one lexical item to express the same concept that is expressed in the source word.",
        "The extensions of word alignments to phrasal alignments attempt to address some of these situations in additional to alleviating the noise in word-level alignments.",
        "As a consequence of the global lexical selection approach, we no longer have a tight association between source language words/phrases and target language words/phrases.",
        "The result of lexical selection is simply a bag of words(phrases) in the target language and the target sentence has to be reconstructed using this bag of words.",
        "The target words in the bag, however, might be enhanced with rich syntactic information that could aid in the reconstruction of the target sentence.",
        "This approach to lexical selection and sentence reconstruction has the potential to circumvent the limitations of word-alignment based methods for translation between significantly different word order languages.",
        "However, in this paper, to handle large word order variations, we associate the target words with source language dependency structures to enable long distance reordering.",
        "3 Training the discriminative models for lexical selection and reordering",
        "In this section, we present our approach for a global lexical selection model which is based on discriminatively trained classification techniques.",
        "Discriminant modeling techniques have become the dominant method for resolving ambiguity in speech and natural language processing tasks, outperforming generative models for the same task.",
        "We expect the discriminatively trained global lexical selection models to outperform generatively trained local lexical selection models as well as provide a framework for incorporating rich mor-pho-syntactic information.",
        "Statistical machine translation can be formulated as a search for the best target sequence that maximizes P(T | S), where S is the source sentence and T is the target sentence.",
        "Ideally, P(T | S) should be estimated directly to maximize the conditional likelihood on the training data (discriminant model).",
        "However, T corresponds to a sequence with a exponentially large combination of possible labels, and traditional classification approaches cannot be used directly.",
        "Although",
        "Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001) train an exponential model at the sequence level, in translation tasks such as ours the computational requirements of training such models are prohibitively expensive.",
        "This model doesn't require the sentences to be word aligned in order to learn the local associations.",
        "Instead, we take the sentence aligned corpus as before but we treat the target sentence as a bag-of-words or BOW assigned to the source sentence.",
        "The goal is, given a source sentence S, to estimate the probability that we find a given word (tj) in its translation ie.., we need to estimate the probabilities P(trueltj, S) and P(falseltj, S).",
        "To train such a model, we need to build binary classifiers for all the words in the target language vocabulary.",
        "The probability distributions of these binary classifiers are learnt using maximum entropy model (Berger et al., 1996; Haffner, 2006).",
        "For the word tj, the training sentence pairs are considered as positive examples where the word appears in the target, and negative otherwise.",
        "Thus, the number of training examples for each binary classifier equals the number of training examples.",
        "In this model, classifiers are training using n-gram features (BOgrams(S)).",
        "During decoding, instead of producing the target sentence directly, what we initially obtain is the target bag of words.",
        "Each word in the target vocabulary is detected independently, so we have here a very simple use of binary static classifiers.",
        "Given a sentence S, the bag of words (BOW(T) contains those words whose distributions have the positive probability greater than a threshold (t).",
        "In order to reconstruct the proper order ofwords in the target sentence, we consider various permutations of words in BOW(T) and weight them by a target language model.",
        "Considering all possible permutations of the words in the target sentence is computationally not feasible.",
        "But, the number of permutations examined can be reduced by using heuristic forward pruning or by constraining the permutations to be within a local window of adjustable size (also see (Kanthak et al., 2005)).",
        "We have chosen to constrain permutations here.",
        "Constraining the permutation using a local window can provide us some very useful local reorderings.",
        "The bag-of-words approach can also be modified to allow for length adjustments of target sentences, if we add optional deletions in the final step of permutation decoding.",
        "The parameter t and an additional word deletion penalty 6 can then be used to adjust the length of translated outputs.",
        "The previous approach gives us a predetermined order of words initially which are then permuted to obtain the best target string.",
        "Given that we would not be able to search the entire space, it would be a helpful if we could start searching various permutations using a more definite string.",
        "One such definite order in which the target words can be placed is the order of source words itself.",
        "In this model, during the lexical selection, we try to place the target words in an order which is faithful to the source sentence.",
        "This model associates sets of target words with every position in the source sentence and yet retains the power of global lexical selection.",
        "For every position (i) of the source sentence, a prefix string is formed which consists of the sequence of words from positions 1 to i.",
        "Each of these prefix strings are used to predict bags of target words using the global lexical selection.",
        "Now, these bags generated using the prefix strings are processed in the order of source positions.",
        "Let Tj be the bag of target words generated by prefix string i (Figure2).",
        "The goal is to associate a set of target words with every source position.",
        "A target word t is attached to the ith source position if it is present in T but not in Ti_1 and the probability P(true\\t,Ti) > t. The intuition behind this approach is that a word t is associated with a position i if there was some information present at the ithsource position that triggered the probability ofthe t to exceed the threshold t.",
        "Hence, the initial target string is the sequence of target language words associated with the sequence of source language positions.",
        "This string is now permuted in all possible ways (section 3.1) and the best target string is chosen using the language model.",
        "The Sequential Lexical Choice Model presented in the last section is expected to work best for language pairs for which there are mostly local word order variations.",
        "For language pairs with significant word order variation, the search for the target string may still fail examine the best target language string given the source sentence.",
        "The model proposed in this section should be able to handle such long distance movement of words/phrases.",
        "In this model, the goal is to search for the best target string T which maximizes the probability P(T^S^D^S)), where S is the source sentence and D(S) is the dependency structure associated with the source sentence S. The probabilities of the target words given the source sentence are estimated in the same way as the bag-of-words model.",
        "The only main difference during the estimation stage is that we consider the dependency tree based features apart from the n-gram features.",
        "The decoding of the source sentence S takes place in three steps,",
        "1.",
        "Predict the bag-of-words : Given a source sentence S, predict the bag of words BOW(T) whose distributions have a positive probabilities greater than a threshold (t).",
        "2.",
        "Attachment to Source nodes : These target words are now attached to the nodes ofsource dependency trees.",
        "For making the attachments, the probability distributions of target words conditioned on features local to the source nodes are used.",
        "3.",
        "Ordering the target language words : Traverse the source dependency tree in a bottom-up fashion to obtain the best target string.",
        "Given a source sentence S, all the target words whose positive probability distributions are above t are included in the bag.",
        "In addition to the n-gram features, this model uses cues provided by the dependency structure to predict the target bag-of-words.",
        "Hence, the features that we have considered in the model are (Figure 3),",
        "1.",
        "N-grams.",
        "For example, in Figure 2, 's1', 's2 s3 s4', 's4 s5' etc.",
        "s2' etc.",
        "3.",
        "Dependency treelet (The triplet of a node, it's parent and sibling).",
        "For example, 's3 s2 s4', 's2 s1 s5' etc.",
        "For every target word tj in the bag, the most likely source nodes are determined by measuring the positive distribution of the word tj given the features of the particular node (Figure 4).",
        "Let S(tj) denote the set of source nodes to which the word tj can be attached to, then S(tj) is determined as,",
        "where f (s) denotes the features of S in which only those features are active which contain the lexical item representing the node s. The target words are in the global bag are processed in the order of their global probabilities p(t^S).",
        "While attaching the target words, it is ensured that no source node had more than p target words attached to it.",
        "Also, a target word should not be attached to more to more than a number of times.",
        "There is another constraint that can be applied to ensure that the ratio of the total target words (which are attached to source nodes) to the total number of words in the source sentence does exceed a value OA",
        "In this step, the source sentence dependency tree is traversed in a bottom-up fashion.",
        "At every node, the best possible order of target words associated with the sub-tree rooted at the node is determined.",
        "This string is then used as a cohesive unit by the superior nodes.",
        "Figure 5: The target string associated with node S1 is determined by permuting strings attached to the children (in rectangular boxes, to signify that they are frozen) and the lexical items attached to",
        "For example, in Figure 5, let 't1 t2 t3', 't4 t5' be the best strings associated with the children of nodes s2 and s3 respectively.",
        "Let t6 and t7 be the words that are attached to node s1.",
        "The best string for the node s1 is determined by permuting the strings 't1 t2 t3', 't4 t5', 't6' 't7' in all possible ways and then choosing the best string using the language model."
