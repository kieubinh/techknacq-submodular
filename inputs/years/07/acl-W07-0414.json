        "While earlier work has trained and tested instantiations of different reordering models and then compared the translation results (Zens and Ney, 2003) we provide a more general mechanism to evaluate the potential efficacy of reordering constraints, independent of specific training paradigms.",
        "Our technique attempts to answer the question: What is the highest Bleu score that a given translation system could reach when using reordering constraints X?",
        "Using this oracle approach, we abstract away from issues that are not inherent in the reordering constraints, but may nevertheless influence the comparison results, such as model and feature design, feature selection, or parameter estimation.",
        "In fact, we compare several sets of reordering constraints empirically, but do not train them as models.",
        "We merely decode by efficiently searching over possible translations allowed by each model and choosing the reordering that achieves the highest Bleu score.",
        "We start by introducing popular reordering constraints (Section 2).",
        "Then, we present dynamic-programming algorithms that find the highest-scoring permutations of sentences under given reordering constraints (Section 3).",

        "We have presented a training-independent method to compare different reordering constraints for machine translation.",
        "Given a sentence in foreign word order, its reference translation(s) and reordering constraints, our dynamic-programming algorithms efficiently find the oracle reordering that has the approximately highest Bleu score.",
        "This allows evaluating different reordering constraints experimentally, but abstracting away from specific features, the probability model or training methods of the reordering strategies.",
        "The presented method evaluates the theoretical capabilities of reordering constraints, as opposed to more arbitrary accuracies of specifically trained instances of reordering models.",
        "using our oracle method, we presented an empirical evaluation of different reordering constraints for a German-english translation task.",
        "The results show that a good reordering of a given monotone translation can improve the translation quality dramatically.",
        "Both short-and long-distance reorderings contribute to the Bleu score improvements, which are generally greater for longer sentences.",
        "Reordering constraints that allow global reorderings tend to reach better oracles scores than ones that search more locally.",
        "The ITG constraints and the IBM(4) constraints both give the highest oracle scores.",
        "The presented Bleu decoder algorithms can be useful in many ways: They can generally help decide what reordering constraints to choose for a given translation system.",
        "They can be used for discriminative training of reordering models (Tillmann and Zhang, 2006).",
        "Furthermore, they can help detecting insufficient parameterization or incapable training algorithms: If two trained reordering model instances show similar performances on a given task, but the oracle scores differ greatly then the training methods might not be optimal."
