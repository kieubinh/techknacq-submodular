        "While advances in NLP achieve improved results for NLP applications such as machine translation, question answering and document summarization, there are other fields of research that can benefit from the methods used by the NLP community.",
        "Second Language Acquisition (SLA), a major area in Applied Linguistics and Cognitive Science, is one such field.",
        "In this paper we demonstrate how modern machine learning tools can contribute to SLA theory.",
        "In particular, we address the major SLA topic of language transfer, the effect of native language on second language learners.",
        "Using an SVM for the computational problem of native language classification, we study in detail the effects of various SVM features.",
        "Surprisingly, character bi-grams alone lead to a classification accuracy of about 66% in a 5-class task, even when accounting for differences in content and function words.",
        "This result leads us to form a novel hypothesis on the role of language transfer in SLA: that the choice of words people make when writing in a second language is strongly influenced by the phonology of their native language.",
        "As far as we know, this is the first time that such a hypothesis has beed formulated.",
        "Moreover, this is the first statistical learning-supported hypothesis in language transfer.",
        "Our results should be further substantiated by additional psycholinguistic and computational experiments; nonetheless, we provide a strong starting point.",
        "The next section provides some essential background.",
        "In Section 3 we describe our experimental setup and feature selection, and in Section 4 we detail an array of variations of experiments for ruling out some possible types of bias that might have affected the results.",
        "In Section 5 we discuss our hypothesis in the context of psycholinguistic theory.",
        "We conclude with directions for future research."

        "Our hypothesis is tested within an algorithm addressing the practical problem of determining the native language of an anonymous writer writing in a foreign language.",
        "The problem is applicable to different fields, such as language instructing, tailored error correction, security applications and psycholinguistic research.",
        "As background, we start from the somewhat related problem of authorship attribution.",
        "The authorship attribution problem was addressed by linguists and other literary experts trying to pinpoint an anonymous author, such as that of The Federalist Papers (Holmes and Forsyth, 1995).",
        "Traditionally, authorship experts analyzed topics, stylistic idiosyncrasies and personal information about the possible candidates in order to determine an author.",
        "While authorship is usually addressed with deep human inspection of the texts in question, it has already been shown that automatic text analysis based on various stylistic features can identify the gender of an anonymous author with accuracy above 80% (Argamon et al., 2003).",
        "Various papers (Diedrich et al., 2003; Koppel and Schler, 2003; Koppel et al., 2005 a; Stamatatos et al., 2004) report relative success in machine based authorship attribution tasks for small sets of known candidates.",
        "Native language detection is a harder problem than the authorship attribution problem, since we wish to characterize the writing style of a set of writers rather than the unique style of a single person.",
        "There are several works presenting non-native speech recognition and dialect analysis systems (Bouselmi et al., 2005; Bouselmi et al., 2006; Hansen et al., 2004).",
        "However, all those works are based on acoustic signals, not on written texts.",
        "Koppel et al. (2005a) report an accuracy of 80% in the task of determining a writer's native language.",
        "To the best of our knowledge, this is the only published work on automated classification of an author's native language (along with another version of the paper by the same authors (Koppel et al., 2005b)).",
        "Koppel et al. used an SVM (Scholkopf and Smola, 2002) and a combination of features in their system (such as errors analysis and POS-error cooccurrences, as described in section 2.2), but surprisingly, it appears that a very naive set of features achieves a relatively high accuracy.",
        "The character bi-gram frequencies feature performs rather well, and definitely outperforms the intuitive contribution of frequent bigrams in this type of task."

        "The corpus that served for all of the experiments described in this paper is the International Corpus of Learner English (ICLE) (Granger et al., 2002), which was also the one used by Koppel et al. (2005a; 2005b).",
        "The corpus was compiled for the purpose of studying the English writing of non-native speakers.",
        "All contributors to the corpus are advanced English students and are roughly the same age.",
        "The corpus is combined from a number of sub-corpora, each containing one native language.",
        "The corpus was assembled in ten years of international collaboration between a number of universities and it contains more than 2 million words of writing by students from 19 different native language backgrounds.",
        "We followed Koppel et al. (2005a) and worked on 5 sub-corpora, each containing 238 randomly selected essays by native speakers of the following languages: Bulgarian, Czech, French, Russian and Spanish.",
        "Each of the texts in the corpus was written by a different author and is of length between 500 to 1,000 words.",
        "Each of the sub corpora contains about 180,000 (unique) types, for a total of 886,677 tokens.",
        "Essays in the corpus are of two types: argumentative essays and literature examination papers.",
        "Descriptive, narrative or technical subjects were not included in the corpus.",
        "The literature examination essays were restricted to no more than 25% of each sub-corpus.",
        "Each contributor was requested to fill a learner profile that was used to fine-proof the corpus as needed.",
        "In order to verify our results we used another control corpus containing the Dutch and Italian sub-corpora contained in the ICLE instead of the Bulgarian and French ones.",
        "In the original experiment by Koppel et al. (2005a) each document was represented by a numerical vector of 1,035 dimensions.",
        "Each vector entry represented the frequency (relative to the document's length) of a given feature.",
        "The features were of 4 types:",
        "â€¢ 200 most frequent letter n-grams",
        "While the first three types of attributes are relatively straightforward, the fourth is more complex.",
        "It represents clusters of families of spelling errors as well as co-occurrences of errors and POS tags.",
        "Document representation is described in detail in (Koppel et al., 2005a; Koppel et al., 2005b).",
        "A multi-class SVM (Witten and Frank, 2005) was employed for learning and evaluating the classification model.",
        "The experiment was run in a 10-fold cross validation manner in order to test the effectiveness of the model.",
        "Koppel et al. (2005a) report that when all features types were used in tandem, an accuracy of 80.2% was achieved.",
        "In the discussion section they analyze the frequency of a few function words, error types, the co-occurrences of POS tags and errors, and the co-occurrences of POS tags and certain function words that seem to have significance in the support vectors learnt by the SVM.",
        "The goal of their research was to obtain the best classification, therefore the results obtained by using only bi-grams of characters were not particularly noted, although, surprisingly, representing each document by only using the relative frequency of the top 200 characters bi-grams achieves an accuracy of about 66%.",
        "We believe that this surprising fact exposes some fundamental phenomenon of human language behavior.",

        "However, using classification based on the relative frequency of top 200 bi-grams achieves about 66%in all experiments, substantially higher than the random baseline.",

        "We first implemented a naive baseline classifier.",
        "We represented each document by the normalized frequencies of the (de-capitalized) letters it contains.",
        "These frequencies are simply a unigram model of the sub-corpora.",
        "Using the multi-class SVM (Witten and Frank, 2005) we obtained 46.78% accuracy.",
        "This accuracy is more than twice the random baseline accuracy.",
        "This result is in accordance with our bi-grams results.",
        "Our discussion focuses on bi-grams rather than unigrams because the former's results are much higher and because bi-grams are much closer to the phonology of the language (for alphabetic scripts, of course).",
        "Choosing the 200 most frequent character bi-grams in the corpus, we used a vector of the same dimension.",

        "achieved 65.60% accuracy with standard deviation of3.99.",
        "The bi-grams features in the 200 dimensional vector are the 200 most frequent bi-grams in the whole corpus, regardless of their frequency in each subcorpus.",
        "We note that the effect of misspelled words on the 200 most frequent bi-grams is negligible.",
        "A more sophisticated feature selection could reduce the dimension of the representation vector without detracting from the results.",
        "Careful feature selection can also give a better intuition regarding the support vectors.",
        "We performed feature selection in the following manner: we chose the top 200 bi-grams of each sub-corpus, getting 245 unique bi-grams in total.",
        "We then chose all the bi-grams that were ranked significantly higher or significantly lower in one language than in at least one other language, assuming that those bi-grams have strong separating power.",
        "With the threshold of significance set to 20 we obtained 84 separating bi-grams.",
        "Table 1 shows some of the separating bi-grams thus found.",
        "For example, 'la' is a good separator between Russian and Spanish (its rank in the Spanish corpus is much higher than that in the Russian corpus), but not between other pairs.",
        "Using only those 84 bigrams we obtained classification accuracy of 61.38%, a drop of only 4% compared to the results achieved with the 200 dimensional vectors.",
        "These results show that increasing the dimension of the representation vector using additional bi-grams contribute a marginal improvement while it does not introduce substantial noise.",
        "Repeating the same experiment with the top 200 tri-grams, we obtained an accuracy of 59.67%, which is 40% higher than the expected baseline and 15% higher than the uni-grams baseline.",
        "These results show that the texts in our corpus can be classified by only using naive n-gram models, while the optimal n of the n-gram is a different question that might be addressed in a different work (and might be language-dependent).",
        "Function words are words that have a little lexical meaning but instead serve to express grammatical relations within a sentence or specify the attitude of the speaker (function words should not be confused with stopwords, although the lists of most frequent function words and the stopword list share a large subset).",
        "We used the same list of 460 function words used by Koppel et al. (2005a).",

        "In this variation ofthe experiment, we represented each document only by the relative frequencies of the function words it contained.",
        "Using the same experimental setup as before, we achieved an accuracy of 66.7%.",
        "These results are less surprising than the results obtained by the character n-grams vectors, since we do expect native speakers of a certain language to use, misuse or ignore certain function words as a result from language transfer mechanisms (Odlin, 1989).",
        "For example, it is well known that native speakers of Russian tend to omit English articles.",
        "The previous results suggest that the n-gram based classification is simply the result of the different uses of function words by speakers of different native languages.",
        "In order to rule out the effect of the function words on the bi-gram-based classification, we removed all function words from the corpus, recalculated the bi-gram frequencies and ran the experiment once again, this time achieving an accuracy of 62.92% in the 10-fold cross validation test.",

        "The role of the first language in second language acquisition is under a continuous debate (Ellis, 1999).",
        "Language Transfer between L1 and L2 is the process in which a language learner of L2 whose native language is L1, is influenced by L1 when using L2 (actually, when building his/her inter-language).",
        "This influence might appear helpful when L2 is relatively close to L1, but it interferes with the learning process due to over-and under-generalization or other problems.",
        "Although there is clear evidence that language learners use constructs of their first language when learning a foreign language (James, 1980; Odlin, 1989), it is not clear that the majority of learner errors can be attributed to the L1 transfer (Ellis, 1999).",
        "For alphabetic scripts, character bi-grams reflect basic sounds and sound sequences of the language.",
        "We have shown that native language strongly correlates with character bi-grams when people write in English as a second language.",
        "After ruling out usage of function words, content bias, and morphology-related influences, the most plausible explanation is that these are language transfer effects related to L1 sounds.",
        "We hypothesize that there are language transfer effects related to L1 sounds and manifested by the words that people choose to use when writing in a second language.",
        "(We say 'writing' because we have only experimented with written texts; a more general hypothesis covering speaking and writing can be formulated as well.)",
        "Furthermore, since the acquisition and representation of phonology is strongly influenced by statistical considerations (Section 5.1), we speculate that the general language transfer phenomenon might be related to frequency.",
        "This does not directly follow from our findings, of course, but is an exciting direction to investigate, and it is in accordance with the growing body of work on the effects of frequency on language learning and the emergence of syntax (Ellis, 2002; Bybee, 2006).",
        "We note that there is one obvious and well-known lexical transfer effect: the usage of cognates (words that have similar form (sound) and meaning in two different languages).",
        "However, the languages we used in our experiments contain radically differing amounts of cognates of English words (just consider French vs. Bulgarian, for example), while the classification results were about the same for all 5 languages.",
        "Hence, cognates might play a role, but they do not constitute a single major explaining factor for our findings.",
        "We note that the hypothesis put forward in the present paper is the first that attributes a language transfer phenomenon to a cognitive representation (phonology) whose statistical nature has been seriously substantiated."

        "In this paper we have demonstrated how modern machine learning can aid other fields, here the important field of Second Language Acquisition (SLA).",
        "Our analysis of the features useful for a multi-class SVM in the task of native language classification has resulted in the formulation of a hypothesis of potential significance in the theory of language transfer in SLA.",
        "We hypothesize language transfer effects at the level of basic sounds and short sound sequences, manifested by the words that people choose when writing in a second language.",
        "In other words, we hypothesize that use of L2 words is strongly influenced by L1 sounds and sound patterns.",
        "As noted above, further experiments (psychological and computational) must be conducted for validating our hypothesis.",
        "In particular, construction of a wide-scale learners' corpus with tight control over content bias is essential for reaching stronger conclusions.",
        "Additional future work should address sound sequences vs. the orthographic sequences that were used in this work.",
        "If our hypothesis is correct, then using spoken language corpora should produce even stronger results, since (1) writing systems rarely show a 1-1 correspondence with how words are at the phonological level; and (2) writing allows more conscious thinking that speaking, thus potentially reduces transfer effects.",
        "Our eventual goal is creating a unified model of statistical transfer mechanisms."
