        "Thanks to corpora and tools such as those developed in the context of the CHILDES project (http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/), researchers in areas such as morphology and syntax have enjoyed a convenient and powerful method to analyze the morphosyntactic properties of adult languages and their acquisition by first and second language learners.",
        "In the area of phonetics, the Praat system (http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/) has expanded our abilities to conduct phonological modeling, computational simulations based on a variety of theoretical approaches, and articulatory synthesis.",
        "In this rapidly-expanding software universe, phonologists interested in the organization of sound systems (e.g. phones, syllables, stress and intonational patterns) and their acquisition have not yet enjoyed the same level of computational support.",
        "There is no developed platform for phonological analysis and no system for datasharing parallel to that found in CHILDES.",
        "Unfortunately, this situation negatively affects the study of natural language phonology and phonological development.",
        "It also undermines potential studies pertaining to interfaces between various components of the grammar or the elaboration of computational models of language or language development.",
        "It is largely accepted that the grammar is hierarchically organized such that larger domains (e.g. a sentence or a phrase) provide the conditioning environments for patterns occurring in the domains",
        "Empirical studies of natural language and language acquisition will always be required in most types of linguistic research.",
        "These studies provide the basis for describing languages and linguistic patterns.",
        "In addition to providing us with baseline data, empirical data allow us to test theoretical, neurological, psychological and computational models.",
        "However, the construction of natural language corpora is an extremely tedious and resourceconsuming process, despite tremendous advances located lower in the hierarchy (e.g. the word or the syllable), as indicated in Figure 1.",

        "This hierarchical view of grammatical organization allows us to make reference to factors that link phonology to syntax.",
        "For example, in English, the phonological phrase, a domain that constrains phonological phenomena such as intonation, is best described using syntactic criteria (e.g. Selkirk 1986).",

      "text": [
        "PhonBank, the latest initiative within the CHILDES project, focuses on the construction of corpora suitable for phonological and phonetic analysis.",
        "In this section we first describe the goals and orientations of PhonBank.",
        "We then describe Phon, the software project designed to facilitate this endeavor.",
        "The PhonBank project seeks to broaden the scope of the current CHILDES system to include the analysis of phonological development in first and second languages for language learners with and without language disorders.",
        "To achieve this goal, we will create a new phonological database called PhonBank and a program called Phon to facilitate analysis of PhonBank data.",
        "Using these tools, researchers will be in position to conduct a series of developmental, crosslinguistic, and methodological analyses based on large-scale corpora.",
        "Phon consists of interconnected modules that offer functionality to assist the researcher in important tasks related to corpus transcription, coding and analysis.",
        "(The main functions supported are discussed in the next section.)",
        "The application is developed in Java and is packaged to run on Macintosh (Mac OS X 10.4+) and Windows (Vista not tested yet) platforms.",
        "Phon is Unicode-compliant, a required feature for the sharing of data transcribed with phonetic symbols across computer platforms.",
        "Phon can share data with programs which utilize the TalkBank XML schema for their documents such as those provided by the TalkBank and CHILDES projects.",
        "Phon is available as free download directly from CHILDES (http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/phon/).",
        "At the time of writing these lines, Phon is available in its version 1.1, an iteration of the program that offered a proof of concept for the application envisioned (see Rose et al., 2006).",
        "Over the past year, however, we have thoroughly revised significant portions of the code to refine the functionality, ensure further compatibility with other TalkBank-compliant applications, and streamline the interface for better user experience and improved workflow.",
        "Despite what the minor version increment (1.1 to 1.2) may imply, the new version, which is currently being tested internally and due for public release in June 2007, offers significant improvements as well as novel and innovative functionality.",
        "As illustrated in Figure 2, the general interface of Phon 1.2 consists of a media centre (top left of the interface), a section for metadata (e.g. recorded participants and their linguistic profiles; bottom left) and a Transcript Editor, the interface that provides access to most of the functionality (right).",
        "One of the most significant improvements brought to version 1.2 comes from the integration of common tasks within the same user interface.",
        "In the previous version, completely separate interfaces had to be accessed to achieve the following tasks, all of which are required in the elaboration of any corpus:",
        "• Media linkage and segmentation.",
        "• Data transcription and validation (including support for multiple-blind transcriptions).",
        "• Segmentation of transcribed utterances (into e.g. phrases, words).",
        "• Labeling of transcribed forms for syllabification.",
        "• Phone and syllable alignment between target (expected) and actual (produced) forms.",
        "As a result the user often had to navigate between various modules in order to accomplish relatively simple operations.",
        "For example, a simple modification to a transcription required, in addition to the modification itself, revalidation of the data, and then a verification of the syllabification and alignment data generated from this revised transcription, each of these steps requiring access to and subsequent exit from a separate module.",
        "In Phon 1.2, most of this hurdle has been alleviated through an integration of most of the functions into the Transcript Editor, while the others (e.g. media linkage and segmentation; transcript validation) are accessed directly from the general interface, without a need to exit the Transcript Editor.",
        "In the next subsections, we describe the main functions supported by the application.",
        "As mentioned above, linkage of multimedia data and subsequent identification of the portions of the recorded media that are relevant for analysis are now available directly from the application's main interface.",
        "These tasks follow the same logic as similar systems in programs like CLAN (http://childes.psy.cmu.edu/clan/).",
        "In addition to its integrated interface, Phon 1.2 offers support for linking different portions to a single transcript to different media files.",
        "The Transcript Editor now incorporates in a single interface access to data transcription and annotation, transcription segmentation, syllabification and alignment.",
        "This module is illustrated in more detail with the screen shot of a data record (corresponding to an utterance) in Figure 3.",
        "As can be seen, the interface incorporates tiers for orthographic and phonetic transcriptions as well as other textual annotations.",
        "Phon also provides support for an unlimited number of user-defined fields that can be used for all kinds of textual annotations that may be relevant to the coding of a particular dataset.",
        "All fields can be ordered to accommodate specific data visualization needs.",
        "Phonetic transcriptions are based on the phonetic symbols and conventions of the International Phonetic Association (IPA).",
        "A useful IPA character map is easily accessible from within the application, in the shape of a floating window within which IPA symbols and diacritics are organized into intuitive categories.",
        "This map facilitates access to the IPA symbols for which there is no keyboard equivalent.",
        "Target and actual IPA transcriptions are stored internally as strings of phonetic symbols.",
        "Each symbol is automatically associated with a set of descriptive features generally accepted in the fields of phonetics and phonology (e.g. bilabial, alveolar, voiced, voiceless, aspirated) (Ladefoged and Mad-dieson, 1996).",
        "These features are extremely useful in the sense that they provide series of descriptive labels to each transcribed symbol.",
        "The availability of these labels is essential for research involving the grouping of various sounds into natural classes (e.g. voiced consonants; non-high front vowels).",
        "The built-in set of features can also be reconfigured as needed to fit special research needs.",
        "Phon 1.2 is also equipped with functionality to automatically insert IPA Target transcriptions based on the orthographic transcriptions.",
        "Citation form IPA transcriptions of these words are currently available for English and French.",
        "The English forms were obtained from the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary (www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict); the French forms were obtained from the Lexique Project database (www.lexique.org).",
        "In cases when more than one pronunciation are available from the built-in dictionaries for a given written form (e.g. the present and past tense versions of the English word 'read'), the application provides a quick way to select the wanted form.",
        "Of course, idealized citation forms do not provide accurate fine-grained characterizations of variations in the target language (e.g. dialect-specific pronunciation variants; phonetic details such as degree of aspiration in obstruent stops).",
        "They however typically provide a useful general baseline against which patterns can be identified.",
        "Actual forms (e.g. the forms produced by a language learner) must be transcribed manually.",
        "Transcript validation, the task described in the next section, also requires access to the recorded data.",
        "To facilitate these tasks, Phon provides direct access to the segmented portions of the media for playback in each record (see the 'Segment' tier in Figure 3).",
        "The beginning and end times of these segments can be edited directly from the record, which facilitates an accurate circumscription of the relevant portions of the recorded media.",
        "Finally, Phon can export the segmented portions of the media into a sound file, which enables quick acoustic verifications using sound visualizing software such as Praat (http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/), SFS (http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/resource/sfs/), Signa-lyze (http://www.signalyze.com/) or CSL (http://www.kayelemetrics.com/).",
        "In projects where only a single transcription of the recorded data is utilized, this transcription can be entered directly in the Transcript Editor.",
        "In projects that rely on a multiple-blind transcription method, each transcription for a given form is stored separately.",
        "To appear in the Transcript Editor, a blind transcription must be selected through the Transcript Validation mode.",
        "This interface allows the transcription supervisor (or, in a better setting, a team of supervisors working together) to compare competing transcriptions and resolve divergences.",
        "Alternative, non-validated transcriptions are preserved for data recoverability and verification purposes.",
        "They are however unavailable for further processing, coding or analysis.",
        "Researchers often wish to divide transcribed utterances into specific domains such as the phrase or the word.",
        "Phon fulfills this need by incorporating a text segmentation module that enables the identification of strings of symbols corresponding to such morphosyntactic and phonological domains.",
        "For example, using the syllabification module described immediately below, the researcher can test hypotheses about what domains are relevant for resyllabification processes across words.",
        "Wordlevel segmentation is exemplified in Figure 3, as can be seen from the gray bracketing circumscribing each word.",
        "Not readily visible from this interface however is the important fact that the bracketing enforces a logical organization between Orthographic, IPA Target and IPA Actual forms, the latter two being treated as daughter nodes directly related to their corresponding parent bracketed form in the Orthography tier.",
        "This system of tier dependency offers several analytical advantages, for example for the identification of patterns that can relate to a particular grammatical category or position within the utterance.",
        "In addition to the textual entry fields just described, the Transcript Editor contains color-coded graphical representations of syllabification information for both IPA Target and IPA Actual forms as well as for the segmental and syllabic alignment of these forms.",
        "Once the researcher has identified the domains that are relevant for analysis, segmentation at the level of the syllable is performed automatically: segments are assigned descriptive syllable labels (visually represented with colors) such as 'onset' or 'coda' for consonants and 'nucleus' for vowels.",
        "The program also identifies segmental sequences within syllable constituents (e.g. complex onsets or nuclei).",
        "Since controversy exists in both phonetic and phonological theory regarding guidelines for syllabification, the algorithm is parameterized to allow for analytical flexibility.",
        "The availability of different parameter settings also enables the researcher to test hypotheses on which analysis makes the best prediction for a given dataset.",
        "Phon 1.2 contains built-in syllabification algorithms for both English and French.",
        "The algorithm for English incorporates fine distinctions such as those proposed by Davis and Hammond (1995) for the syllabification of on-glides.",
        "Both algorithms are based on earlier work by, e.g. Selkirk (1982) and Kaye and Lowenstamm (1984), the latter also documenting the most central properties of French syllabification.",
        "While these algorithms use specific syllable positions such as the left appendix (utilized to identify strident fricatives at the left-edge of triconsonantal onset clusters; e.g. 'strap'), a simple syllabification algorithm is also supplied, which restricts syllable position to onset, nucleus and coda only.",
        "Additional algorithms (for other languages or assuming different syllable constructs) can easily be added to the program.",
        "Our currently-implemented syllabification algorithms use a scheme based on a composition-cascade of seven deterministic FSTs (Finite State Tools).",
        "This cascade takes as input a sequence of phones and produces a sequence of phones and associated syllable-constituent symbols, which is subsequently parsed to create the full multilevel metrical structure.",
        "The initial FST in the cascade places syllable nuclei and the subsequent FSTs establish and adjust the boundaries of associated onset-and coda-domains.",
        "Changes in the definition of syllable nuclei in the initial FST and/or the ordering and makeup of the subsequent FSTs give language-specific syllabification algorithms.",
        "To ease the development of this cascade, initial FST prototypes were written and tested using the Xerox Finite-State Tool (xFST) (Beesley and Karttunen 2003).",
        "However, following the requirements of easy algorithm execution within and integration into Phon, these FSTs were subsequently coded in Java.",
        "To date, the implemented algorithm has been tested on corpora from English and French, and has obtained accuracies of almost 100%.",
        "Occasionally, the algorithm may produce spurious results or flag symbols as unsyllabified.",
        "This is particularly true in the case of IPA Actual forms produced by young language learners, which sometimes contain strings of sounds that are not attested in natural languages.",
        "Syllabification is generated on the fly upon transcription of IPA forms; the researcher can thus quickly verify all results and modify them through a contextual menu (represented in Figure 3) whenever needed.",
        "Segments that are left unsyllabified are available for all queries on segmental features and strings of segments, but are not available for queries referring to aspects of syllabification (see also Figure 4 for a closer look at the display of syllabification).",
        "The syllabification labels can then be used in database query (for example, to access specific information about syllable onsets or codas).",
        "In addition, because the algorithm is sensitive to main and secondary stress marks and domain edges (i.e. first and final syllables), each syllable identified is given a prosodic status and position index.",
        "Using the search functions, the researcher can thus use search criteria as precisely defined as, for example, complex onsets realized in word-medial, secondary-stressed syllables.",
        "This level of functionality is central to the study of several phenomena in phonological acquisition that are determined by the status of the syllable as stressed or unstressed, or by the position of the syllable within the word (e.g. Inkelas and Rose 2003).",
        "After syllabification, a second algorithm performs automatic, segment-by-segment and syllable-by-syllable alignment of IPA-transcribed target and actual forms.",
        "Building on featural similarities and differences between the segments in each syllable and on syllable properties such as stress, this algorithm automatically aligns corresponding segments and syllables in target and actual forms.",
        "It provides alignments for both corresponding sounds and syllables.",
        "For example, in the target-actual word pair 'apricot' > 'a_cot', the algorithm aligns the first and final syllables of each form, and identifies the middle syllable ('pri') as truncated.",
        "This is illustrated in Figure 4.",
        "Similarly, in cases of renditions such as 'blow' > 'bolow' the alignment algorithm relates both syllables of the actual form to the only syllable of the target form and diagnoses a case of vowel epenthesis.",
        "In this alignment algorithm, forms are viewed as sequences of phones and syllable-boundary markers and the alignment is done on the phones in a way that preserves syllable integrity.",
        "This algorithm is a variant of the standard dynamic programming algorithm for pairwise global sequence alignment (see Sankoff and Kruskal 1983 and references therein); as such, it is similar to but extends the phone-alignment algorithm described in Kondrak (2003).",
        "At the core of the Phon alignment algorithm is a function sim(x, y) that assesses the degree of similarity of a symbol x from the first given sequence and a symbol y from the second given sequence.",
        "In our sim() function, the similarity value of phones x and y is a function of a basic score (which is the number of phonetic features shared by x and y) and the associated values of various applicable reward and penalty conditions, each of which encodes a linguistically-motivated constraint on the form of the alignment.",
        "There are nine such reward and penalty conditions, and the interaction of these rewards and penalties on phone matchings effectively simulates syllable integrity and matching constraints.",
        "Subsequent to this enhanced phone alignment, a series of rules is invoked to reintroduce the actual and target form syllable boundaries.",
        "A full description of the alignment algorithm is given in Maddocks (2005) and Hedlund et al.",
        "(2005).",
        "Preliminary tests on attested data from the published literature on Dutch-and English-learning children (Fikkert, 1994; Pater, 1997) indicate an accuracy rate above 95% (96% for a Dutch corpus and 98% for an English corpus).",
        "As it is the case with the other algorithms included in the program, the user is able to perform manual adjustments of the computer-generated syllable alignments whenever necessary.",
        "This process was made as easy as possible: it consists of clicking on the segment that needs to be realigned and moving it leftward or rightward using keyboard arrows.",
        "The alignment algorithm, as well as the data processing steps that precede it (especially, syllabification), are essential to any acquisition study that requires pairwise comparisons between target and actual forms, from both segmental and syllabic perspectives.",
        "Implicit to the description of the implementation of the syllabification and alignment functions is a careful approach whereby the algorithms implemented at this stage are used to assist data compilation; because every result generated by the algorithms can be modified by the user, no data analysis directly depends on them.",
        "The user thus has complete control on the processing of the data being readied for analysis.",
        "After extensive testing on additional types of data sets, we will be able to optimize their degree of reliability and then determined how they can be used in truly automated analyses.",
        "Phon sports a simple search function built directly in the main interface (see Figure 2 above).",
        "More complex queries are now supported through a series of built-in analysis and reporting functions.",
        "Using these functions, the research can identify records that contain:",
        "• Phones and phone sequences (defined with IPA symbols or descriptive feature sets).",
        "• Word types (e.g. number of syllables and the stress patterns that they compose).",
        "• Segmental processes (obtained through fea-tural comparisons between Target-Actual aligned phones; e.g. devoicing, gliding).",
        "• Syllabic processes (obtained through comparisons between target-actual aligned syllables e.g. complex onset reduction).",
        "Using these functions, the researcher can quickly identify the records that match the search criteria within the transcript.",
        "The reported data are visualized in tables which can be saved as comma-separated value text files (.csv) that can subsequently be open in statistical or spreadsheet applications.",
        "Using an expression builder, i.e. a system to combine simple searches using functions such as intersection and union, the researcher can also take advantage of more elaborate search criteria.",
        "The expression builder thus enables the study of interaction between factors such as feature combinations, stress, position within the syllable, word or any other larger domain circumscribed through the utterance segmentation function described above."
