        "Large empirical data containing children's speech are the key to developing and evaluating different theories of child language acquisition (cla).",
        "Particularly important are data related to syntactic complexity of child language since considerable evidence suggests that syntactic information plays a central role during language acquisition, e.g. (Lenneberg, 1967; Naigles, 1990; Fisher etal., 1994).",
        "The standard corpus in the study of cla is the childes database (MacWhinney, 2000) which provides 300MB of transcript data of interactions between children and parents over 25 human languages.",
        "childes is currently available in raw, part-of-speech-tagged and lemmatized formats.",
        "However, adequate investigation of syntactic complexity requires deeper annotations related to e.g. syntactic parses, subcatego-rization frames (scfs), lexical classes and predicate-argument structures.",
        "Although manual syntactic annotation is possible, it is extremely costly.",
        "The alternative is to use natural language processing (nlp) techniques for annotation.",
        "Automatic techniques are now viable, cost effective and, although not completely error-free, are sufficiently accurate to yield annotations useful for linguistic purposes.",
        "They also gather important qualitative and quantitative information, which is difficult for humans to obtain, as a side-effect of the acquisition process.",
        "For instance, state-of-the-art statistical parsers, e.g. (Charniak, 2000; Briscoe et al., 2006), have wide coverage and yield grammatical representations capable of supporting various applications (e.g. summarization, information extraction).",
        "in addition, lexical information (e.g. subcategorization, lexical classes) can now be acquired automatically from parsed data (McCarthy and Carroll, 2003; schulte im Walde, 2006; Preiss et al., 2007).",
        "This information complements the basic grammatical analysis and provides access to the underlying predicate-argument structure.",
        "Containing considerable ellipsis and error, spoken child language can be challenging for current nlp techniques which are typically optimized for written adult language.",
        "Yet Sagae et al.",
        "(2005) have recently demonstrated that existing statistical parsing techniques can be usefully modified to analyse childes with promising accuracy.",
        "Although further improvements are still required for optimal accuracy, this research has opened up the exciting possibility of automatic grammatical annotation of the entire childes database in the future.",
        "However, no work has yet been conducted on automatic acquisition of lexical information from child speech.",
        "The only automatic lexical acquisition study involving childes that we are aware of is that of Buttery and Korhonen (2005).",
        "The study involved extracting subcategorization information from (some of) the adult (child-directed) speech in the database, and showing that this information differs from that extracted from the spoken part of the British National Corpus (bnc) (Burnard, 1995).",
        "in this paper, we investigate whether state-of-the-art subcategorization acquisition technology can be used – without any domain-specific tuning – to obtain large-scale verb subcategorization frequency information from childes which is accurate enough to show differences and similarities between child and adult speech, and thus be able to provide support for syntactic complexity studies in cla.",
        "We use the new system of Preiss et al.",
        "(2007) to extract scf frequency data from the (i) child and (ii) child-directed speech within childes.",
        "We show that the acquired information is sufficiently accurate to confirm and extend previously reported scf (dis)similarities between the two types of data.",
        "in particular, we demonstrate that children and adults have different preferences for certain types of verbs, and that these preferences seem to influence the way children acquire subcategorization.",
        "in addition, we report qualitative results which can be used to further improve parsing and lexical acquisition technology for spoken child language data in the future."

        "We used for subcategorization acquisition the new system of Preiss, Briscoe and Korhonen (2007) which is essentially a much improved and extended version of Briscoe and Carroll's (1997) system.",
        "It incorporates 168 scf distinctions, a superset of those found in the comlex Syntax (Grishman et al., 1994) and anlt (Boguraev et al., 1987) dictionaries.",
        "Currently, scfs abstract over specific lexically governed particles and prepositions and specific predicate selectional preferences but include some derived semi-predictable bounded dependency constructions, such as particle and dative movement – this will be revised in future versions of the scf system.",
        "The system tokenizes, tags, lemmatizes and parses input sentences using the recent (second) release of the rasp (Robust Accurate Statistical Parsing) system (Briscoe et al., 2006) which parses arbitrary English text with state-of-the-art levels of accuracy.",
        "scfs are extracted from the grammatical relations (grs) output of the parser using a rule-based classifier.",
        "This classifier operates by exploiting the close correspondence between the dependency relationships which the grs embody and the head-complement structure which subcategorization acquisition attempts to recover.",
        "Lexical entries of extracted scfs are constructed for each word in the corpus data.",
        "Finally, the entries may be optionally filtered to obtain a more accurate lexicon.",
        "This is done by setting empirically determined thresholds on the relative frequencies of scfs.",
        "When evaluated on cross-domain corpora containing mainly adult language, this system achieves 68.9 F-measure in detecting scf types – a result which compares favourably to those reported with other comparable scf acquisition systems.",
        "The English (British and American) sections of the childes database (MacWhinney, 2000) were used to create two corpora: 1) child and 2) cds.",
        "Both corpora contained c. 1 million utterances which were selected from the data after some utterances containing un-transcribable sections were removed.",
        "speakers were identified using speaker-id codes within the chat transcriptions of the data: child contained the utterances of speakers identified as target children; cds contained input from speakers identified as parents/caretakers.",
        "The mean utterance length (measured in words) in child and cds were 3.48 and 4.61, respectively.",
        "The mean age of the child speaker in child is around 3 years 6 months.",
        "years.",
        "We selected a set of 161 verbs for experimentation.",
        "The words were selected at random, subject to the constraint that a sufficient number of scfs would be extracted (> 100) from both corpora to facilitate maximally useful comparisons.",
        "All sentences containing an occurrence of one of the test verbs were extracted from the two corpora and fed into the scf acquisition system described earlier in section 2.",
        "in some of our experiments the two lexicons were compared against the valex lexicon (Korhonen et al., 2006) – a large subcategorization lexicon for English which was acquired automatically from several cross-domain corpora (containing both written and spoken language).",
        "valex includes scf and frequency information for 6,397 English verbs.",
        "We employed the most accurate version of the lexicon here (87.3 F-measure) – this lexicon was obtained by selecting high frequency scfs and supplementing them with lower frequency scfs from manually built lexicons."

        "Yet some of the lower ranked verbs turned out to have large rank differences between the two corpora.",
        "Two such relatively highly ranked verbs are included in the table – think which has a notably higher rank in CDS than in CHILD, and break which has a higher rank in CHILD than in CDS.",

        "We discovered that the most frequent classes among the verbs that children prefer are HIT (e.g. bump, hit, kick), BREAK (e.g. crash, break, rip), HURT (e.g. hurt, burn, bite) and MOTION (e.g. fly, jump, run) verbs.",
        "Overall, many of the preferred verbs (regardless of the class) express negative actions or feelings (e.g. shoot, die, scare, hate).",
        "Table 2: 20 verbs ranked higher in (i) child speech and (ii) child-directed speech.",
        "in contrast, adults have a preference for verbs from classes expressing cognitive processes (e.g. remember, suppose think wonder guess believe hope learn)or those that can be related to the education of children, e.g. the wipe verbs wash, wipe and brush and the performance verbs draw, dance and sing.",
        "In contrast to children, adults prefer verbs which express positive actions and feelings (e.g. share, help, love, kiss).",
        "It is commonly reported that child CLA is motivated by a wish to communicate desires and emotions, e.g. (Pinker, 1994), but a relative preference in child speech over child-directed speech for certain verb types or verbs expressing negative actions and feelings has not been explicitly shown on such a scale before.",
        "While this issue requires further investigation, our findings already demonstrate the value of using large scale corpora in producing novel data and hypotheses for research in cla.",
        "The average number of scfs taken by studied verbs in the two corpora proved quite similar.",
        "In unfiltered scf distributions, verbs in CDS took on average a larger number of SCFs (29) than those in CHILD (24), but in the lexicons filtered for accuracy the numbers were identical (8-10, depending on the filtering threshold applied).",
        "The intersection between the child / CDS scfs and those in the valex lexicon was around 0.5, indicating that the two lexicons included only 50% of the SCFs in the lexicon extracted from general (cross-domain) adult language corpora.",
        "Recall against VALEX was consequently low (between 48% and 68% depending on the filtering threshold) but precision was around 50-60% for both childes and CDS lexicons (also depending on the filtering threshold), which is a relatively good result for the challenging childes data.",
        "however, it should be remembered that with this type of data it would not be expected for the scf system to achieve as high precision and recall as it would on, for instance, adult written text and that the missing scfs and/or misclassified scfs are likely to provide us with the most interesting information.",

        "• scf is a fp in child but not present in cds - children should not have been exposed to this frame but they have acquired it.",
        "This indicates either i) a misuse of the verb's semantic class, or ii) error in the parsing/subcategorization technology with respect to the child-speech domain.",
        "These scenarios are illustrated in Figure 1 which graphically depicts the differences in tps and fps for the verb shoot.",
        "The scfs have been arranged in a complexity hierarchy where complexity is defined in terms of increasing argument structure scfs found within our anlt-comlex gold standard lexicon for shoot are indicated in bold-face.",
        "A right-angled rectangle drawn around a scf indicates that the frame is present in child – a solid line indicating a strong presence (relative frequency > 0.010) and a dotted line indicating a weak presence (relative frequency > 0.005).",
        "Rounded-edge rectangles represent the presence of scfs within cds similarly.",
        "For example, the frame np represents a tp in both child and cds and the frame np-np represents a fp within child.",
        "With reference to Figure 1, we notice that all of the scfs present in child are directly connected within the hierarchy and there is a tendency for weakly present scfs to inherit from those strongly present.",
        "A possible explanation for this is that children are exploring scfs – trying out frames that are slightly more complex than those already acquired (for a learning algorithm that exploits such a hypothesis in general see (Buttery, 2006)).",
        "The scf np-np is strongly present in child despite being a fp.",
        "Inspection of the associated utterances reveals that some instances np-np are legitimate but so uncommon in adult language that they are omitted from the gold-standard (e.g. \"can i shoot us all to pieces\".",
        "However, other instances demonstrate amis-understanding of the semantic class of the verb; there is possible confusion with the semantic class of send or throw (e.g. \"i shoot him home\").",
        "The frame np-inf is a fp in both corpora and a frequent fp in child.",
        "Inspection of the associated utterances flags up a parsing problem.",
        "Frame np-inf can be illustrated by the sentences \"he helped her bake the cake\" or \"he made her sing\", however, within child the np-inf has been acquired from utterances such as \"i want ta shoot him\".",
        "The rasp parser has mis-tagged the word \"ta\" leading to a misclassification by the scf extraction system.",
        "This problem could be solved by augmenting rasp's current grammar with a lexical entry specifying \"ta\" as an alternative to infinitival \"to\" .",
        "In summary, our analysis of tp and fp differences has confirmed previous studies regarding the nature of child speech (the overextension of the \"ing\" morpheme).",
        "it has also demonstrated that tp/fp analysis can be a useful diagnostic for pars-ing/subcategorization extraction problems within a new data domain.",
        "Further, we suggest that analysis of fps can provide empirical data regarding the manner in which children learn the semantic classes of verbs (a matter that has been much debated e.g. (Levin, 1993), (Brooks and Tomasello, 1999))."

        "We have reported the first experiment for automatically acquiring verbal subcategorization from both child and child-directed parts of the childes database.",
        "Our results show that a state-of-the-art subcategorization acquisition system yields useful results on challenging child language data even without any domain-specific tuning.",
        "it produces data which is accurate enough to confirm and extend several previous research findings in CLA.",
        "We explore the discovery that children and adults have different relative preferences for certain verb types, and that these preferences influence the way children acquire subcategorization.",
        "Our work demonstrates the value of using nlp technology to annotate child language data, particularly where manual annotations are not readily available for research use.",
        "Our pilot study yielded useful information which will help us further improve both parsing and lexical acquisition performance on spoken/child language data.",
        "in the future, we plan to optimize the technology so that it can produce higher quality data for investigation of syntactic complexity in this domain.",
        "Using the improved technology we plan to then conduct a more thorough investigation of the interesting CLA topics discovered in this study – first concentrating on SCF differences in child speech across age ranges."
