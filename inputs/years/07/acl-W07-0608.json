        "Humans, come to recognize an infinite variety of natural and man-made objects and make use of sounds to identify and categorize them.",
        "How do human beings arrive at this capacity?",
        "Different explanations have been offered to explain the processes, and those behind the learning of first words in particular.",
        "Evidence has made clear that object recognition and categorization in early infancy is much more sophisticated than was previously thought.",
        "By the time children are 8 to 10 months old their object categories are sufficiently stable and flexible to be used as the foundation for labeling and referencing actions.",
        "Increasing amounts of evidence point to the growing capacity of infants at this stage to reliably map arbitrary sounds onto meanings and this mapping process is crucial to the acquisition of language.",
        "The word-learning mechanisms used at this early phase of language learning could very well involve a mapping of words onto the most perceptually interesting objects in an infant's environment (Pruden et al., 2006).",
        "There are those that claim that early word learning is not purely associative and that it is based on a sensitivity to social intent (Tomasello, 1999), through joint attention phenomena (Bloom, 2000).",
        "Pruden et al.",
        "have demonstrated that 10-month-old infants \"are sensitive to social cues but cannot recruit them for word learning\" and therefore, at this age infants presumably have to learn words on a simple associative basis.",
        "It is not by chance, it seems, that early vocabulary is made up of the objects infants most frequently see (Gershkoff-Stowe and Smith, 2004).",
        "Early word-learning and object recognition can thus be explained, according to a growing group of researchers, by associational learning strategies alone.",
        "There are those such as Carey and Spelke that postulate that there must necessarily be innate constraints that have the effect of making salient certain features as opposed to others, so as to narrow the hypothesis space with respect to the kinds of objects to be categorized first (Carey and Spelke, 1996).",
        "They reject the idea that object categorization in infants could emerge spontaneously from the ability to grasp patterns of statistical regularities.",
        "Jean Mandler presents evidence that the first similarity dimensions employed in categorization processes are indeed extremely general (Mandler, 2004); in other words, these dimensions single out wide domains of objects, with further refinements coming only later.",
        "Mandler claims, however, that the early salience of these extremely general features could have a different explanation other than nativism: for example, that salience could emerge from physiological constraints.",
        "Using a connectionist model with backpropaga-tion, Rogers and McClelland have shown that quite general dimensions of similarity can emerge without appealing to either physiological or cognitive constraints, simply as the result of a coherent covariation of features, that is, as an effect of mere statistical regularities (Rogers and McClelland, 2006).",
        "What Rogers and McClelland say about the most general features obviously apply also to more specific features which become salient later on.",
        "However, interesting as it is from a computational point of view, this model is rather unrealistic as a simulation of biological categorization processes.",
        "Linda Smith, suggests that words can contribute to category formation, in that they behave as features which covary with other language-independent features of objects (Smith, 1999).",
        "In general, her idea is that the relevant features simply emerge from regularities in the input.",
        "Terry Regier, building upon the proposal offered by Smith, has shown that word learning might behave in analogy with what we have said about categorization (Regier, 2005): certain features of both objects and words (i.e., phonological forms) can be made more salient than others, simply as a consequence of regularities in objects, words, and their co-variation.",
        "Regier's training sets however, are constituted by wholly \"artificial phonological or semantic features\", rather than by \"natural features such as voicing or shape\".",
        "The positions mentioned above conflict with others, such as that of Lila Gleitman and her colleagues, according to which some innate constraints are needed in order to learn words.",
        "It should be noted, however, that even in Gleitman's proposal the need for innate constraints on syntax-semantic mapping mainly concerns verbs; moreover, the possibility to apprehend a core set of concrete terms without the contribution of any syntactic constraint is considered as a precondition for verb acquisition itself (Gillette et al., 1999).",
        "This paper describes a neural network model which attempts to simulate the process by which infants learn how to recognize objects and words in the first year of life through exposure to visual stimuli and vocal sounds.",
        "The approach here pursued is in line with the view that a coherent covariation of features is the major engine leading to object name acquisition, the attempt made however, is to rely on biological ways of capturing coherent covariation.",
        "The pre-established design of the mature functions of the organism is avoided, and the emergence of the final function of each component of the system is left to the plastic development of the neural circuits.",
        "In the cortex, there is very little differentiation in the computational capability that neural circuits will potentially perform in the mature stage.",
        "The interaction between environmental stimuli and some of the basic mechanisms of development is what drives differentiation in computational functions.",
        "This position has large empirical support (Katz and Callaway, 1992; Lowel and Singer, 2002), and is compatible with current knowledge on neural genetics (Quartz, 2003).",
        "The model here described, can be considered an implementation of the processes that emerge around the 10 month of age period.",
        "It can also be used to consider what happens in a hypothesized subsequent period, in which the phenomenon of joint attention provides the social cueing that leads to the increased ability to focus on certain objects as opposed to others."

        "In the visual path orientation selectivity emerged in the model's V1 map as demonstrated in (Sirosh and Miikkulainen, 1997) and (Plebe and Domenella, 2006).",
        "Orientation selectivity is the main organization in primary visual cortex, where the responsiveness of neurons to oriented segments is arranged over repeated patterns of gradually changing orientations, broken by few discontinuities (Vanduffel et al., 2002).",

        "Invariance indeed is one of the main requirements for an object-recognition area, and is found in human LOC (Grill-Spector et al., 2001; Kanwisher, 2003).",

        "It seems to be analogous to the situation described in (Smith, 1999), where the word contributes to the emergence of patterns of regularity.",
        "The 100% accuracy for the category, in this case, is better accounted for as an emergent example of synonymy, where coupling with the same word is accepted, despite the difference in the output of the visual process.",
        "In table 3 accuracy results for individual objects are listed, grouped by object shape.",
        "In this case category accuracy cannot be computed, because shapes cross category boundaries.",
        "It can be seen that the improvement A is proportional to the salience in shape: it is meaningless for common, obvious shapes, and higher when object shape is uncommon.",

        "The model here described attempts to simulate lexical acquisition from auditory and visual stimuli from a brain processes point of view.",
        "It models these processes in a biologically plausible way in that it does not begin with a predetermined design of mature functions, but instead allows final functions of the components to emerge as a result of the plastic development of neural circuits.",
        "It grounds this choice and its design principles in what is known of the cerebral cortex.",
        "In this model, the overall important result achieved so far, is the emergence of naming and recognition abilities exclusively through exposure of the system to environmental stimuli, in terms of activities similar to prenatal spontaneous activities, and later to natural images and vocal sounds.",
        "This result has interesting theoretical implications for developmental psychologists and may provide a useful computational tool for future investigations on phenomena such as the effects of shape on object recognition and naming.",
        "In conclusion this model represents a first step in simulating the interaction of the visual and the auditory cortex in learning object recognition and naming, and being a model of high level complex cognitive functions, it necessarily lacks several details of the biological cortical circuits.",
        "It lacks biological plausibility in the auditory path because of the state of current knowledge of the processes going on there.",
        "Future developments of the model will foresee the inclusion of backprojections between maps in the hierarchy, trials on preliminary categorization at the level of phonemes and syllables in the auditory path, as well as exposure to images with multiple objects in the scene."
