        "In these networks, words are connected by graph edges based on their semantic relations.",
        "In recent years, researchers have found that many semantic networks are small-world, scale-free networks, having a high degree of structure and a short distance between nodes (Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005).",
        "Early models were taxonomic and explained some aspects of human reasoning (Collins and Quillian, 1969) (and are still used in artificial reasoning systems), but were replaced by models that focused on general graph structures (e.g. Collins and Loftus, 1975).",
        "These better modelled many observed phenomena but explained only the searching of semantic space, not its generation or properties that exist at a whole-network level.",
        "Topological analyses, looking at the statistical regularities of whole semantic networks, can be used to model phenomena not easily explained from the smaller scale data found in human experiments.",
        "These networks are typically formed from corpora, expert compiled lexical resources, or human word-association data.",
        "Existing work has focused language acquisition (Steyvers and Tenenbaum, 2005) and generation (Cancho and Sole, 2001).",
        "These models use the general notion of semantic association which subsumes all specific semantic relations, e.g. synonymy.",
        "There is evidence that there are distinct cognitive processes for different semantic relations (e.g. Casenhiser, 2005).",
        "We perform a graph analysis of synonymy, nearness of meaning, and homonymy, shared lexicalisation.",
        "We find that synonymy and homonymy produce graphs that are topologically distinct from those produced using association.",
        "They still produce small-world networks with short path lengths but lack scale-free properties.",
        "Adding edges of different semantic relations, in particular hyponymy, produces graphs more similar to the association networks.",
        "We argue our analyses consistent with other semantic network models where nodes of a common type share edges of different types (e.g. Collins and Loftus, 1975).",
        "We further analyse the distributional model oflan-guage acquisition.",
        "We find that it does not well explain whole-language acquisition, but provides a model for synonym and homonym acquisition."

        "Although there is evidence that semantic relations are both directed (Tversky, 1977) and weighted (Collins and Loftus, 1975), we do not have access to this information in a consistent and meaningful format for all our resources.",
        "Two vertices connected by an edge are called neighbours.",
        "The degree k of a vertex is the count of it neighbours.",
        "From this we measure the average degree (k) for the graph and the degree distribution P(k) for all values of k. The degree distribution is the probability of a vertex having a degree k.",
        "The neighbourhood Tv of a vertex v is the set of all neighbours of v not including v. The neighbourhood rS of a subgraph S is the set of all neighbours of S, not including the members of S .",

        "We instead sample n' «; n nodes and find the mean values of L and D across the samples.",

        "We found n' = 100 to be most efficient.",
        "It is not a requirement that every vertex be reachable from every other vertex and in these cases both L and D will be infinite.",
        "In these cases we analyse the largest connected subgraph.",
        "Traditional network models assume that networks are either completely random or completely regular.",
        "Many natural networks are somewhere between these two extremes.",

        "Semantic networks represent the structure of human knowledge through the connections of words.",
        "Collins and Quillian (1969) proposed a taxonomic representation of knowledge, where words are connected by hyponym relations, like in the WordNet noun hierarchy (Fellbaum, 1998).",
        "While this structure predicted human reaction times for verifying facts it allows only a limited portion of knowledge to be expressed.",
        "Later models represented knowledge as semi-structured networks, and focused on explaining performance in memory retrieval tasks.",
        "One such model is spreading-activation, in which the degree to which a concept is able to be recalled is related to its similarity both to other concepts in general and to some particular prime or primes (Collins and Loftus, 1975).",
        "In this way, if one is asked to name a red vehicle, fire truck is more likely response than car: while both are strongly associated with vehicle, fire truck is more strongly associated with red than is car.",

        "Cancho and Sole (2001) examine graphs of English modelled from the British National Corpus.",
        "Since co-occurrence is non-trivial – words in a sentence must share some semantic content for the sentence to be coherent – edges were formed between adjacent words, with punctuation skipped.",
        "Two graphs were formed: one from all co-occurrences and the other from only those co-occurrences with a frequency greater than chance.",
        "Both models produced scale-free networks.",
        "They find this model compelling for word choice during speech, noting function words are the most highly connected.",
        "These give structure without conveying significant meaning, so can be omitted without rendering a sentence incoherent, but when unavailable render speech non-fluent.",
        "This is consistent with work by Albert et al.",

        "Beginning with synsets and the hyponym tree, they find adding polysemy both reduces the characteristic path length and increases the clustering coefficient, producing a small-world network.",
        "They propose, citing word priming experiments as evidence, that these changes in structure give polysemy a role in metaphoric thinking and generalisation by increasing the navigability of semantic networks.",

        "(1998), Wordnet and the 1911 Roget's thesaurus.",
        "All these produced scale-free networks, and, using an age of acquisition and frequency weighted preferential attachement model, show that this corresponds to age-of-acquisition norms for a small set of words.",
        "This is compared to networks produced by Latent Semantic Analysis (lsa, Landauer and Dumais, 1997), and conclude that LSA is an inadequate model for language growth as it does not produce the same scale-free networks as their association models.",
        "While there have been many studies using human subjects on the acquisition of particular semantic relations, there have been no topological studies differentiating these from the general notion of semantic association.",
        "This is interesting as psycholinguistic studies have shown that semantic relationships are distinguishable (e.g. Casenhiser, 2005).",
        "Here we consider synonymy and homonymy.",
        "There are very few cases oftrue synonymy, where two words are substitutable in all contexts.",
        "Near-synonymy, where two words share some close common meaning, is more common.",
        "Sets of synonyms can be grouped together into synsets, representing a common idea.",
        "Homonymy occurs when a word has multiple meanings.",
        "Formally, homonymy is occurs when words do not share an etymological root (in linguistics) or when the distinction between meanings is coarse (in cognitive science).",
        "When the words share a root or meanings are close, the relationship is called polysemy.",
        "This distinction is significant in language acquisition, but as yet little research has been performed on the learning of polysemes (Casenhiser, 2005).",
        "It is also significant for Natural Language Processing.",
        "The effect of disambiguating homonyms is markedly different from polysemes in Information Retrieval (Stokoe, 2005).",
        "We do not have access to these distinctions, as they are not available in most resources, nor are there techniques to automatically acquire these distinctions (Kilgarriff and Yallop, 2000).",
        "For simplicity, will conflate the categories under homonymy.",
        "There have been several studies into synonymy and homonymy acquisition in children, and these have shown that it lags behind vocabulary growth (Doherty and Perner, 1998; Garnham et al., 2000).",
        "A child will associate both rabbit and bunny with the same concept, but before the age of four, most children have difficulty in choosing the word bunny if they have already been presented with the word rabbit.",
        "Similarly, a young child asked to point to two pictures that have the same name but mean different things will have difficulty, despite knowing each of the things independently.",
        "Despite this improvement with age, there are tendencies for language to avoid synonyms and homonyms as a more general principle of economy (Casenhiser, 2005).",
        "This is balanced by the utility of ambiguous relations for mental navigation (Sigman and Cecchi, 2002) which goes some way to explaining why they still play such a large role in language."

        "Lexical semantic resources can be automatically extracted using distributional similarity.",
        "Here words are projected into a vector space using the contexts in which they appear as axes.",
        "Contexts can be as wide as document (Landauer and Dumais, 1997) or close as grammatical dependencies (Grefenstette, 1994).",
        "The distance between words in this space approximates the similarity measured by synonymy.",
        "We use the noun similarities produced by Gorman and Curran (2006) using the weighted Jac-card measure and the t-test weight and grammatical relations extracted from their LARGE corpus, the method found to perform best against their goldstandard evaluation.",
        "Only words with a corpus frequency higher than 100 are included.",
        "This method is comparable to that used in LSA, although using grammatical relations as context produces similarity much more like synonymy than those taken at a document level (Kilgarriff and Yallop, 2000).",
        "Distributional similarity produces a list of vocabulary words, their similar neighbours and the similarity to the neighbours.",
        "These lists approximate synonymy by measuring substitutability in context, and do not only find synonyms as near neighbours as both antonyms and hyponyms are frequently substitutable in a grammatical context (Weeds, 2003).",
        "From this we generate graphs by taking either the k nearest neighbours to each word (k-NN), or by using a threshold.",
        "To produce a threshold we take the mean similarity of the kth neighbour of all words (*k-NN).",
        "We compare both these methods.",
        "Figure 3 compares the degree distributions of these.",
        "Using k-NN produces a degree distribution that is close to a Gaussian, where as *k-NN produces a distribution much more like that of our expert compiled resources.",
        "This is unsurprising when the distribution of distributional distances is considered.",
        "Some words will have many near neighbours, and other few.",
        "In the first case, k-NN will fail to include some near neighbours, and in the second will include some distant neighbours that are note semantically related.",
        "This result is consistent between k = 5 and 50.",
        "Introduction of random edges from the noise of distant neighbours reduces the diameter and missing near neighbours reduces the clustering coefficient (Table 3).",
        "In Table 3 we also compare these to noun synonymy in Roget s, and to synonymy and hyponymy in WordNet.",
        "Distributional similarity (*k-NN) produces a network with similar degree, characteristic path length and diameter.",
        "The clustering coefficient is much less than that from expert resources, is still several orders of magnitude larger than an equivalent random graph (Table 1).",
        "Figure 4 compares a distributional network to networks WordNet and Moby.",
        "We can see the same broad-scale in the distributional and synonym networks, and a distinct difference with the scale-free WordNet hyponym distribution.",
        "The distributional similarity distribution is similar to that found in networks formed from LS A by Steyvers and Tenenbaum (2005).",
        "Steyvers and Tenenbaum hypothesise that the distributions produced by LSA might be due more to frequency distribution effects that correct language modelling.",
        "In light of our analysis of synonymy relations, we propose a new explanation.",
        "Given that: distributional similarity has been shown to approximate the semantic similarity in synonymy relations found in thesaurus type resources (Curran, 2004); distributional similarity produces networks with similar statistical properties to those formed by synonym and homonymy relations; and, the synonym and homonymy relations found in thesauri produce networks with different statistical properties to those found in the association networks analysed by Steyvers and Tenenbaum; it can be plausibly",
        "WordNet Hyponym Moby *k=5",
        "hypothesised that distributional techniques are modeling the acquisition of synonyms and homonyms, rather than all semantic relationships.",
        "This is given further credence by experimental findings that acquisition of homonyms occurs at a different rate to the acquisition of vocabulary.",
        "This indicates that there are different mechanisms for learning the meaning of lexical items and learning to relate the meanings of lexical items.",
        "Any whole-language model would then be composed of a common set of lexical items related by disparate relations, such as synonymy, homonymy and hyponymy.",
        "This type of model is predicted by spreading activation (Collins and Loftus, 1975).",
        "It is unfortunate that there is a lack of data with which to validate this model, or our constraint model, empirically.",
