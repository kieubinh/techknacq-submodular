        "Phrases allow for non-compositional translation, local reordering and contextual lexical choice.",
        "However the phrases are fully lexicalized, which means they generalize poorly to even slightly out-of-domain text.",
        "In an open competition (Koehn & Monz, 2006) systems trained on parliamentary proceedings were tested on text from 'news commentary' web sites, a very slightly different domain.",
        "The 9 phrasal systems in the English to Spanish track suffered an absolute drop in BLEU score of between 4.4% and 6.34% (14% to 27% relative).",
        "The treelet system of Menezes et al.",
        "(2006) fared somewhat better but still suffered an absolute drop of 3.61%.",
        "Clearly there is a need for approaches with greater powers of generalization.",
        "There are multiple facets to this issue, including handling of unknown words, new senses of known words etc.",
        "In this work, we will focus on the issue of reordering, i.e. can we learn how to transform the sentence structure of one language into the sentence structure of another, in a way that is not tied to a specific domain or sub-domains, or indeed, sequences of individual words.",
        "An early attempt at greater generality in a purely phrasal setting was the alignment template approach (Och & Ney 2004); newer approaches include formally syntactic (Chiang 2005), and linguistically syntactic approaches (Quirk et al.",
        "2005), (Huang et al.",
        "2006).",

        "Note that none of the multi-word phrases lead to the reference, so the local reordering often captured in the phrasal model is no help at all in ordering this sentence.",
        "The system is unable to learn the correct structure from the first sentence because the words are wrong, and from the second sentence even though the phrase old man has the right words in the right order, it does not lead to the reference translation because the translation of very cannot be inserted in the right place.",
        "Table 2.1: Relevant extracted phrases",
        "Looking at this as a sparse data issue we might suspect that generalization could solve the problem.",
        "The alignment template approach (Och & Ney, 2004) uses word classes rather than lexical items to model phrase translation.",
        "Yet this approach loses the advantage of context-sensitive lexical selection: the word translation model depends only on the word classes to subcategorize for translations, which leads to less accurate lexical choice in practice (Zens & Ney, 2004).",
        "Hierarchical systems (Chiang, 2005) induce a context-free grammar with one non-terminal directly from the parallel corpus, with the advantage of not requiring any additional knowledge source or tools, such as a treebank or a parser.",

        "In order to make the problem tractable and avoid spurious ambiguity, Chiang restricts the learned rules in several ways.",
        "The most problematic of these is that every rule must have at least one pair of aligned words, and that adjacent non-terminals are not permitted on the source side.",
        "In Table 2.2 we show the additional hierarchical phrases that would be learned from our training pairs under these restrictions.",
        "Again only those applicable to the test sentence are shown and the 'correct' rules, i.e. those that lead to the reference, are italicized.",
        "Table 2.2: Additional hierarchical phrases",

        "From the second pair, we learn a rule (X1 old man) that has the right contextual word choice, but does not lead to the reference, because the paucity of the grammar's single nonterminal causes this rule to incorrectly imply that the translation of very be placed before hombre.",

        "The difference is that because xRS rules provide both reordering and word choice, each rule must match all of the children at any given tree node.",
        "On the other hand, treelets are allowed to match more loosely.",
        "The translations of the unmatched children (un and muy in this case) are placed by exploring all possible orderings and scoring them with both order model and language model.",
        "Although this effectively decouples lexical selection from ordering, it comes at a huge cost in search space and translation quality may suffer due to search error.",

        "We introduced a new model of Dependency Order Templates that provides for separation of lexical choice and reordering knowledge, thus allowing for greater generality than the phrasal and xRS approaches, while drastically limiting the search space as compared to the treelet approach.",
        "We showed BLEU improvements over phrasal of over 1% in-domain and nearly 3.5% out-of-domain.",
        "As compared to the treelet approach we showed an improvement of about 0.5%, but a speedup of nearly 3x, despite loosening pruning parameters.",
        "Extraposition and long distance movement still pose a serious challenge to syntax-based machine translation systems.",
        "Most of the today's search algorithms assume phrasal cohesion.",
        "Even if our search algorithms could accommodate such movement, we don't have appropriate models to account for such phenomena.",
        "Our system already extracts extraposition templates, which are a step in the right direction, but may prove too sparse and brittle to account for the range of phenomena.",
