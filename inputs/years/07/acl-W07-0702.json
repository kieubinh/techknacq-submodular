        "In large-scale machine translation evaluations, phrase-based models generally outperform syntax-based models.",
        "Phrase-based models are effective because they capture the lexical dependencies between languages.",
        "However, these models, which are equivalent to finite-state machines (Kumar and Byrne, 2003), are unable to model long range word order differences.",
        "Phrase-based models also lack the ability to incorporate the generalisations implicit in syntactic knowledge and they do not respect linguistic phrase boundaries.",
        "This makes it difficult to improve reordering in phrase-based models.",
        "Syntax-based models can overcome some of the problems associated with phrase-based models because they are able to capture the long range structural mappings that occur in translation.",
        "Recently there have been a few syntax-based models that show performance comparable to the phrase-based models (Chiang, 2005; Marcu et al., 2006).",
        "However, reliably learning powerful rules from parallel data is very difficult and prone to problems with sparsity and noise in the data.",
        "These models also suffer from a large search space when decoding with an integrated language model, which can lead to search errors (Chiang, 2005).",
        "In this paper we investigate the idea of incorporating syntax into phrase-based models, thereby leveraging the strengths of both the phrase-based models and syntactic structures.",
        "This is done using CCG supertags, which provide a rich source of syntactic information.",
        "CCG contains most of the structure of the grammar in the lexicon, which makes it possible to introduce CCG supertags as a factor in a factored translation model (Koehn et al., 2006).",
        "Factored models allow words to be vectors of features: one factor could be the surface form and other factors could contain linguistic information.",
        "Factored models allow for the easy inclusion of supertags in different ways.",
        "The first approach is to generate CCG supertags as a factor in the target and then apply an n-gram model over them, increasing the probability of more frequently seen sequences of supertags.",
        "This is a simple way of including syntactic information in a phrase-based model, and has also been suggested by Hassan et al.",
        "(2007).",
        "For both Arabic-English (Hassan et al., 2007) and our experiments in Dutch-English, n-gram models over CCG supertags improve the quality of translation.",
        "By preferring more likely sequences of supertags, it is conceivable that the output of the decoder is more grammatical.",
        "However, its not clear exactly how syntactic information can benefit a flat structured model: the constraints contained within supertags are not enforced and relationships between supertags are not linear.",
        "We perform experiments to explore the nature and limits of the contribution of supertags, using different orders of n-gram models, reordering models and focussed manual evaluation.",
        "It seems that the benefit of using n-gram supertag sequence models is largely from improving reordering, as much of the gain is eroded by using a lexi-calised reordering model.",
        "This is supported by the manual evaluation which shows a 44% improvement in reordering Dutch-English verb final sentences.",
        "The second and novel way we use supertags is to direct the translation process.",
        "Supertags on the source sentence allows the decoder to make decisions based on the structure of the input.",
        "The sub-categorisation of a verb, for instance, might help select the correct translation.",
        "Using multiple dependencies on factors in the source, we need a strategy for dealing with sparse data.",
        "We propose using a logarithmic opinion pool (Smith et al., 2005) to combine the more specific models (which depend on both words and supertags) with more general models (which only depends on words).",
        "This paper is the first to suggest this approach for combining multiple information sources in machine translation.",
        "Although the addition of supertags to phrase-based translation does show some improvement, their overall impact is limited.",
        "Sequence models over supertags clearly result in some improvements in local reordering but syntactic information contains long distance dependencies which are simply not utilised in phrase-based models."

        "Added to these features is the word penalty e-1 which allows the model to learn a preference for longer or shorter sentences, the distortion model d that prefers monotone word order, and the language model probability Pr(t).",

        "One of the strengths of the factored model is it allows for n-gram distributions over factors on the target.",

        "Different backoff paths are possible, and it would be interesting but prohibitively slow to apply a strategy similar to generalised parallel backoff (Bilmes and Kirchhoff, 2003) which is used in factored language models.",

        "Our solution is to extract two translation models:",

        "Table 6 shows that the simple, general model (model sw ,tw) performs considerably better than the simple specific model, where there are multiple dependencies on both words and CCG supertags (model swc, tw).",
        "This is because there are words in the test sentence that have been seen before but not with the CCG supertag.",
        "Statistical evidence from multiple sources must be combined.",
        "The first way to combine them is to join them in one single loglinear model, which is trained over many features.",
        "This makes finding good weights difficult as the influence of the general model is greater, and its difficult for the more specific model to discover good weights.",
        "The second method for combining the information is to use the weights from the separately trained simple models and then combine them in a LOP.",
        "Held out data is used to set the multiplicative constant needed to balance the contribution of the two models.",
        "We can see that this second approach is more successful and this suggests that it is important to carefully consider the best ways of combining different sources of information when using ensembles of models.",
        "However, the results of this experiment are not very conclusive.",
        "There is no uncertainty in the source sentence and the value of modelling it using CCG supertags is still to be demonstrated."

        "The factored translation model allows for the inclusion of valuable sources of information in many different ways.",
        "We have shown that the syntactically rich CCG supertags do improve the translation process and we investigate the best way of including them in the factored model.",
        "using CCG supertags over the target shows the most improvement, especially when using targeted manual evaluation.",
        "However, this effect seems to be largely due to improved local reordering.",
        "Reordering improvements can perhaps be more reliably made using better reordering models or larger, more powerful language models.",
        "A further consideration is that supertags will always be limited to the few languages for which there are treebanks.",
        "Syntactic information represents embedded structures which are naturally incorporated into grammar-based models.",
        "The ability of a flat structured model to leverage this information seems to be limited.",
        "CCG supertags' ability to guide translation would be enhanced if the constraints encoded in the tags were to be enforced using combinatory operators."
