        "Statistical machine translation (SMT) from English-to-Turkish poses a number of difficulties.",

        "Another issue of practical significance is the lack of large scale parallel text resources, with no substantial improvement expected in the near future.",

        "Our previous experience with SMT into Turkish (Durgar El-Kahlout and Oflazer, 2006) hinted that exploiting sub-lexical structure would be a fruitful avenue to pursue.",
        "This was based on the observation that a Turkish word would have to align with a complete phrase on the English side, and that sometimes these phrases on the English side could be discontinuous.",
        "Figure 1 shows a pair of English and Turkish sentences that are aligned at the word (top) and morpheme (bottom) levels.",
        "At the morpheme level, we have split the Turkish words into their lexical morphemes while English words with overt morphemes have been stemmed, and such morphemes have been marked with a tag.",
        "The productive morphology of Turkish implies potentially a very large vocabulary size.",
        "Thus, sparseness which is more acute when very modest",
        "an accession partnership will be drawn up on the basis of previous european council conclusions daha Onceki avrupa zirve sonuclarina dayanilarak bir katihm ortakligi olusturulacaktir",
        "an accession partnership will be draw +vvn up on the basis of previous european council conclusion +nns",
        "parallel resources are available becomes an important issue.",
        "However, Turkish employs about 30,000 root words and about 150 distinct suffixes, so when morphemes are used as the units in the parallel texts, the sparseness problem can be alleviated to some extent.",
        "Our approach in this paper is to represent Turkish words with their morphological segmentation.",
        "We use lexical morphemes instead of surface morphemes, as most surface distinctions are manifestations of word-internal phenomena such as vowel harmony, and morphotactics.",
        "With lexical morpheme representation, we can abstract away such word-internal details and conflate statistics for seemingly different suffixes, as at this level of representation words that look very different on the surface, look very similar.",
        "For instance, although the words evinde 'in his house' and masasinda 'on his table look quite different, the lexical morphemes except for the root are the same: ev+sH+ndA vs.",
        "masa+sH+ndA.",
        "We should however note that although employing a morpheme based representations dramatically reduces the vocabulary size on the Turkish side, it also runs the risk of overloading distortion mechanisms to account for both word-internal morpheme sequencing and sentence level word ordering.",
        "The segmentation of a word in general is not unique.",
        "We first generate a representation that contains both the lexical segments and the morphological features encoded for all possible segmentations and interpretations of the word.",
        "For the word emeli for instance, our morphological analyzer generates the following with lexical morphemes bracketed with (..):",
        "(em)em+Verb+Pos(+yAlH)\"DB+Adverb+Since since (someone) sucked (something)",
        "(emel)emel+Noun+A3sg(+sH)+P3sg+Nom his/her ambition",
        "(emel)emel+Noun+A3sg+Pnon(+yH)+Acc ambition (as object of a transitive verb)",
        "These analyses are then disambiguated with a statistical disambiguator (Yiiret and Tiire, 2006) which operates on the morphological features.",
        "Finally, the morphological features are removed from each parse leaving the lexical morphemes.",
        "Using morphology in SMT has been recently addressed by researchers translation from or into morphologically rich(er) languages.",
        "Niessen and Ney (2004) have used morphological decomposition to improve alignment quality.",
        "Yang and Kirchhoff (2006) use phrase-based backoff models to translate words that are unknown to the decoder, by morphologically decomposing the unknown source word.",
        "They particularly apply their method to translating from Finnish - another language with very similar structural characteristics to Turkish.",
        "Corston-Oliver and Gamon (2004) normalize inflectional morphology by stemming the word for German-English word alignment.",
        "Lee (2004) uses a morphologically analyzed and tagged parallel corpus for Arabic-English SMT.",

        "(ii) We tag the English side using TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994), which provides a lemma and a part-of-speech for each word.",

        "The 1000-best sentences were then converted to \"words\" (by concatenating the morphemes) and then rescored with a 4-gram word-based language model with the hope of enforcing more distant word sequencing constraints.",
        "For this, we followed the following procedure: We tried various linear combinations of the word-based language model and the translation model scores on the tune corpus, and used the combination that performed best to evaluate the test corpus.",
        "We also experimented with both the default decoding parameters, and the modified parameters used in the baseline model decoding above.",
        "The results in Table 3 indicate that the default decoding parameters used by the Moses decoder provide a very dismal results - much below the baseline scores.",
        "We can speculate that as the constituent orders of Turkish and English are very different, (root) words may have to be scrambled to rather long distances along with the translations of functions words and tags on the English side, to morphemes on the Turkish side.",

        "Since we perform derivational morphological analysis on the Turkish side but not on the English side, we noted that most verbal nominalizations on the English side were just aligned to the verb roots on the Turkish side and the additional markers on the Turkish side indicating the nominalization and agreement markers etc., were mostly unaligned.",
        "For just these cases, we selectively attached such morphemes (and in the case of verbs, the intervening morphemes) to the root, but otherwise kept other morphemes, especially any case morphemes, still by themselves, as they almost often align with prepositions on the English side quite accurately.",

        "We have not included the content word corpus in these experiments, as (i) our few very preliminary experiments indicated that using a morpheme-based models in subsequent iterations would perform worse than word-based models, and (ii) that for word-based models adding the content word training data was not helpful as our baseline experiments indicated.",
        "The models were tested by decoding the output of the previous model for original test data.",
        "For word-based decoding in the additional iterations we used a 3-gram word-based language model but reranked the 1000-best outputs using a 4-gram language model.",
        "Table 6 provides the BLEU results for these experiments corresponding to two additional model iterations.",
        "The BLEU result for the second iteration, 25.08, represents a cumulative 4.86 points (24% relative) improvement over the initial fully morphologically segmented model using only the basic training set and no rescoring."

        "Translation into Turkish seems to involve processes that are somewhat more complex than standard statistical translation models: sometimes words on the Turkish side are synthesized from the translations of two or more (SMT) phrases, and errors in any translated morpheme or its morphotactic position render the synthesized word incorrect, even though the rest of the word can be quite fine.",
        "If we just extract the root words (not just for content words but all words) in the decoded test set and the reference set, and compute root word BLEU, we obtain 30.62, [64.6/35.7/23.4/16.3].",
        "The unigram precision score shows that we are getting almost 65% of the root words correct.",
        "However, the unigram precision score with full words is about 52% for our best model.",
        "Thus we are missing about 13% of the words although we seem to be getting their roots correct.",
        "With a tool that we have developed, BLEU+ (Tantug et al., 2007), we have investigated such mismatches and have found that most of these are actually morphologically bogus, in that, although they have the root word right, the morphemes are either not the applicable ones or are in a morphotactically wrong position.",
        "These can easily be identified with the morphological generator that we have.",
        "In many cases, such morphologically bogus words are one morpheme edit distance away from the correct form in the reference file.",
        "Another avenue that could be pursued is the use of skip language models (supported by the SRILM toolkit) so that the content word order could directly be used by the decoder.At this point it is very hard to compare how our results fare in the grand scheme of things, since there is not much prior results for English to Turkish SMT.",
        "Koehn (2005) reports on translation from English to Finnish, another language that is morphologically as complex as Turkish, with the added complexity of compounding and stricter agreement between modifiers and head nouns.",
        "A standard phrase-based system trained with 941,890 pairs of sentences (about 20 times the data that we have!)",
        "gives a BLEU score of 13.00.",
        "However, in this study, nothing specific for Finnish was employed, and one can certainly employ techniques similar to presented here to improve upon this.",

        "The fact that there are quite many erroneous words which are actually easy to fix suggests some ideas to improve unigram precision.",
        "One can utilize a morpheme level \"spelling corrector\" that operates on segmented representations, and corrects such forms to possible morphologically correct words in order to form a lattice which can again be rescored to select the contextually correct one.",
        "With the BLEU+ tool, we have done one experiment that shows that if we could recover all morphologically bogus words that are 1 and 2 morpheme edit distance from the correct form, the word BLEU score could rise to 29.86, [60.0/34.9/23.3/16.]",
        "and 30.48 [63.3/35.6/23.4/16.4] respectively.",
        "Obviously, these are upper-bound oracle scores, as subsequent candidate generation and lattice rescoring could make errors, but nevertheless they are very close to the root word BLEU scores above.",
        "Another path to pursue in repairing words is to identify morphologically correct words which are either OOVs in the language model or for which the language model has low confidence.",
        "One can perhaps identify these using posterior probabilities (e.g., using techniques in Zens and Ney (2006)) and generate additional morphologically valid words that are \"close\" and construct a lattice that can be rescored.",
        "BLEU is particularly harsh for Turkish and the morpheme based-approach, because of the all-or-none nature of token comparison, as discussed above.",
        "There are also cases where words with different morphemes have very close morphosemantics, convey the relevant meaning and are almost interchangeable:",
        "• gel+hyor (geliyor - he is coming) vs. gel+makta (gelmekte - he is (in a state of) coming) are essentially the same.",
        "On a scale of 0 to 1, one could rate these at about 0.95 in similarity.",
        "• gel+yacak (gelecek - he will come) vs. gel+yacak+dhr (gelecektir - he will come) in a sentence final position.",
        "Such pairs could be rated perhaps at 0.90 in similarity.",
        "• gel+dh (geldi - he came (past tense)) vs. gel+mhs (gelmi§ - he came (hearsay past tense)).",
        "These essentially mark past tense but differ in how the speaker relates to the event and could be rated at perhaps 0.70 similarity.",
        "Note that using stems and their synonyms as used in METEOR (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005) could also be considered for word similarity.",
        "Again using the BLEU+ tool and a slightly different formulation of token similarity in BLEU computation, we find that using morphological similarity our best score above, 25.08 BLEU increases to 25.14 BLEU, while using only root word synonymy and very close hypernymy from Wordnet, gives us 25.45 BLEU.",
        "The combination ofrules and Wordnet match gives 25.46 BLEU.",
        "Note that these increases are much less than what can (potentially) be gained from solving the word-repair problem above."

        "We have presented results from our investigation into using different granularity of sub-lexical representations for English to Turkish SMT.",
        "We have found that employing a language-pair specific representation somewhere in between using full word-forms and fully morphologically segmented representations and using content words as additional data provide a significant boost in BLEU scores, in addition to contributions of word-level rescoring of 1000-best outputs and model iteration, to give a BLEU score of 25.08 points with very modest parallel text resources.",
        "Detailed analysis of the errors point at a few directions such as word-repair, to improve word accuracy.",
        "This also suggests perhaps hooking into the decoder, a mechanism for imposing hard constraints (such as morphotactic constraints) during decoding to avoid generating morphologically bogus words.",
        "Another direction is to introduce exploitation of limited structures such as bracketed noun phrases before considering full-fledged syntactic structure."
