        "In this work we deal with finite-state models which constitute an important framework in syntactic pattern recognition for language and speech processing applications (Mohri et al., 2002; Pereira and Riley, 1997).",
        "One of their outstanding characteristics is the availability of efficient algorithms for both optimization and decoding purposes.",
        "Specifically, stochastic finite-state transducers (SFSTs) have proved to be useful for machine translation tasks within restricted domains.",
        "There are several approaches implemented over SFSTs which range from word-based systems (Knight and Al-Onaizan, 1998) to phrase-based systems (Perez et al., 2007).",
        "SFSTs usually offer high speed during the decoding step and they provide competitive results in terms of error rates.",
        "In addition, SFSTs have proved to be versatile models, which can be easily integrated with other finite-state models, such as a speech recognition system for speech-input translation purposes (Vidal, 1997).",
        "In fact, the integrated architecture has proved to work better than the decoupled one.",
        "Our main goal is, hence, to extend and assess these methodologies to accomplish spoken language multi-target translation.",
        "As far as multilingual translation is concerned, there are two main trends in machine translation devoted to translate an input string simultaneously into m languages (Hutchins and Somers, 1992): inter-lingua and parallel transfer.",
        "The former has historically been a knowledge-based technique that requires a deep-analysis effort, and the latter consists on m decoupled translators in a parallel architecture.",
        "These translators can be either knowledge or example-based.",
        "On the other hand, in (Gonzalez and Casacuberta, 2006) an example based technique consisting of a single SFST that cope with multiple target languages was presented.",
        "In that approach, when translating an input sentence, only one search through the multi-target SFST is required, instead of the m independent decoding processes required by the mono-target translators.",
        "The classical layout for speech-input multi-target translation includes a speech recognition system in a serial architecture with decoupled text-to-text translators.",
        "Thus, this architecture entails a decoding stage of the speech signal into the source language text, and further decoding stages to translate the source text into each of the target languages.",
        "If we supplant the m translators with the multi-target SFST, the problem would be reduced to 2 searching stages.",
        "Nevertheless, in this paper we propose a natural way for acoustic models to be integrated in the multilingual network itself, in such a way that the input speech signal can be simultaneously decoded and translated into m target languages.",
        "As a result, due to the fact that there is just a single searching stage, this novel approach entails less computational cost.",
        "The remainder of the present paper is structured as follows: section 2 describes both multi-target SF-STs and the inference algorithm from training examples; in section 3 a novel integrated architecture for speech-input multi-target translation is proposed; section 4 presents a practical application of these methods, including the experimental setup and the results they produced; finally, section 5 summarizes the main conclusions of this work."
