        "Viewed at a very high level, statistical machine translation involves four phases: language and translation model training, parameter tuning, decoding, and evaluation (Lopez, 2007; Koehn et al., 2003).",
        "Since their introduction in statistical MT by Och and Ney (2002), log-linear models have been a standard way to combine sub-models in MT systems.",
        "Typically such a model takes the form where <\\)i are features of the hypothesis e and Ai are weights associated with those features.",
        "Selecting appropriate weights Ai is essential in order to obtain good translation performance.",
        "Och (2003) introduced minimum error rate training (MERT), a technique for optimizing log-linear model parameters relative to a measure of translation quality.",
        "This has become much more standard than optimizing the conditional probability of the training data given the model (i.e., a maximum likelihood criterion), as was common previously.",
        "Och showed that system performance is best when parameters are optimized using the same objective function that will be used for evaluation; BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) remains common for both purposes and is often retained for parameter optimization even when alternative evaluation measures are used, e.g., (Banerjee and Lavie, 2005; Snover et al., 2006).",
        "Minimum error rate training – and more generally, optimization of parameters relative to a translation quality measure – relies on data sets in which source language sentences are paired with (sets of) reference translations.",
        "It is widely agreed that, at least for the widely used BLEU criterion, which is based on n-gram overlap between hypotheses and reference translations, the criterion is most accurate when computed with as many distinct reference translations as possible.",
        "Intuitively this makes sense: if there are alternative ways to phrase the meaning of the source sentence in the target language, then the translation quality criterion should take as many of those variations into account as possible.",
        "To do otherwise is to risk the possibility that the criterion might judge good translations to be poor when they fail to match the exact wording within the reference translations that have been provided.",
        "This reliance on multiple reference translations creates a problem, because reference translations are labor intensive and expensive to obtain.",
        "A common source of translated data for MT research is the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC), where an elaborate process is undertaken that involves translation agencies, detailed translation guidelines, and quality control processes (Strassel et al., 2006).",
        "Some efforts have been made to develop alternative processes for eliciting translations, e.g., from users on the Web (Oard, 2003) or from informants in low-density languages (Probst et al., 2002).",
        "However, reference translations for parameter tuning and evaluation remain a severe data bottleneck for such approaches.",
        "Note, however, one crucial property of reference translations: they are paraphrases, i.e., multiple expressions of the same meaning.",
        "Automatic techniques exist for generating paraphrases.",
        "Although one would clearly like to retain human translations as the benchmark for evaluation of translation, might it be possible to usefully increase the number of reference translations for tuning by using automatic paraphrase techniques?",
        "In this paper, we demonstrate that it is, in fact, possible to do so.",
        "Section 2 briefly describes our translation framework.",
        "Section 3 lays out a novel technique for paraphrasing, designed with the application to parameter tuning in mind.",
        "Section 4 presents evaluation results using a state of the art statistical MT system, demonstrating that half the human reference translations in a standard 4-reference tuning set can be replaced with automatically generated paraphrases, with no significant decrease in MT system performance.",
        "In Section 5 we discuss related work, and in Section 6 we summarize the results and discuss plans for future research."

        "The work described in this paper makes use of the Hiero statistical MT framework (Chiang, 2007).",
        "Hiero is formally based on a weighted synchronous context-free grammar (CFG), containing synchronous rules of the form where X is a symbol from the nonterminal alphabet, and e and f can contain both words (terminals) and variables (nonterminals) that serve as placeholders for other phrases.",
        "In the context of statistical MT, where phrase-based models are frequently used, these synchronous rules can be interpreted as pairs of hierarchical phrases.",
        "The underlying strength of a hierarchical phrase is that it allows for effective learning of not only the lexical re-orderings, but phrasal re-orderings, as well.",
        "Each 0(e, f, X) denotes a feature function defined on the pair of hierarchical phrases.",
        "Feature functions represent conditional and joint co-occurrence probabilities over the hierarchical paraphrase pair.",
        "The Hiero framework includes methods to learn grammars and feature values from unannotated parallel corpora, without requiring syntactic annotation of the data.",
        "Briefly, training a Hiero model proceeds as follows:",
        "• GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2000) is run on the parallel corpus in both directions, followed by an alignment refinement heuristic that yields a many-to-many alignment for each parallel sentence.",
        "• Initial phrase pairs are identified following the procedure typically employed in phrase based systems (Koehn et al., 2003; Och and Ney,",
        "2004).",
        "• Grammar rules in the form of equation (2) are induced by \"subtracting\" out hierarchical phrase pairs from these initial phrase pairs.",
        "• Fractional counts are assigned to each produced rule:",
        "where m is the number of initial phrase pairs that give rise to this grammar rule and njr is the number of grammar rules produced by the jth initial phrase pair.",
        "• Feature functions (/>k(f, e, X) are calculated for each rule using the accumulated counts.",
        "Once training has taken place, minimum error rate training (Och, 2003) is used to tune the parameters Ai.",
        "Finally, decoding in Hiero takes place using a CKY synchronous parser with beam search, augmented to permit efficient incorporation of language model scores (Chiang, 2007).",
        "Given a source language sentence f, the decoder parses the source language sentence using the grammar it has learned during training, with parser search guided by the model; a target-language hypothesis is generated simultaneously via the synchronous rules, and the yield of that hypothesized analysis represents the hypothesized string e in the target language."

      "heading": "3. Generating Paraphrases",
      "text": [
        "As discussed in Section 1, our goal is to make it possible to accomplish the parameter-tuning phase using fewer human reference translations.",
        "We accomplish this by beginning with a small set of human reference translations for each sentence in the development set, and expanding that set by automatically paraphrasing each member of the set rather than by acquiring more human translations.",
        "Most previous work on paraphrase has focused on high quality rather than coverage (Barzilay and Lee, 2003; Quirk et al., 2004), but generating artificial references for MT parameter tuning in our setting has two unique properties compared to other paraphrase applications.",
        "First, we would like to obtain 100% coverage, in order to avoid modifications to our minimum error rate training infrastructure.Second, we prefer that paraphrases be as distinct as possible from the original sentences, while retaining as much of the original meaning as possible.",
        "In order to satisfy these two properties, we approach sentence-level paraphrase for English as a problem of English-to-English translation, constructing the model using English-F translation, for a second language F, as a pivot.",
        "Following Bannard and Callison-Burch (2005), we first identify English-to-F correspondences, then map from English to English by following translation units from English to F and back.",
        "Then, generalizing their approach, we use those mappings to create a well defined English-to-English translation model.",
        "The parameters of this model are tuned using MERT, and then the model is used in an the (unmodified) statistical MT system, yielding sentence-level English paraphrases by means of decoding input English sentences.",
        "The remainder of this section presents this process in detail.",
        "We employ the following strategy for the induction of the required monolingual grammar.",
        "First, we train the Hiero system in standard fashion on a bilingual English-F training corpus.",
        "Then, for each existing production in the resulting Hiero grammar, we create multiple new English-to-English productions by pivoting on the foreign hierarchical phrase in the rule.",
        "For example, assume that we have the following toy grammar for English-F, as produced by Hiero:",
        "If we use the foreign phrase f1 as a pivot and backmap, we can extract the two English-to-English rules: X – (e 1,e3) and X – (e3,e 1).",
        "Backmapping using both f1 and f 2 produces the following new rules (ignoring duplicates and rules that map any English phrase to itself):",
        "Each rule production in a Hiero grammar is weighted by several feature values defined on the rule themselves.",
        "In order to perform accurate backmapping, we must recompute these feature functions for the newly created English-to-English grammar.",
        "Rather than computing approximations based on feature values already existing in the bilingual Hiero grammar, we calculate these features in a more principled manner, by computing maximum likelihood estimates directly from the fractional counts that Hiero accumulates in the penultimate training step.",
        "We use the following features in our induced English-to-English grammar:",
        "X -",
        "(e 1,e2>",
        "X -",
        "-> (e 1, e3>",
        "X-",
        "(el,e4>",
        "X-",
        "(e 2, e 1>",
        "X-",
        "(e 2, e 4>",
        "• The joint probability of the two English hierarchical paraphrases, conditioned on the nonterminal symbol, as defined by this formula:",
        "where the numerator is the fractional count of the rule under consideration and the denominator represents the marginal count over all the English hierarchical phrase pairs.",
        "• The conditionals p(ei,x|e2) and p(e2,x|ei) defined as follows:",
        "Finally, for all induced rules, we calculate a word penalty exp( – T(e2)), where T(e2) just counts the number of terminal symbols in e 2.",
        "This feature allows the model to learn whether it should produce shorter or longer paraphrases.",
        "In addition to the features above that are estimated from the training data, we also use a trigram language model.",
        "Since we are decoding to produce English sentences, we can use the same language model employed in a standard statistical MT setting.",
        "Calculating the proposed features is complicated by the fact that we don't actually have the counts for English-to-English rules because there is no English-to-English parallel corpus.",
        "This is where the counts provided by Hiero come into the picture.",
        "We estimate the counts that we need as follows:",
        "An intuitive way to think about the formula above is by using an example at the corpus level.",
        "Assume that, in the given bilingual parallel corpus, there are m sentences in which the English phrase",
        "ei co-occurs with the foreign phrase / and n sentences in which the same foreign phrase f co-occurs with the English phrase e 2.",
        "The problem can then be thought of as defining a function g(m, n) which computes the number of sentences in a hypothetical English-to-English parallel corpus wherein the phrases e i and e i co-occur.",
        "For this paper, we define g(m, n) to be the upper bound mn.",
        "Tables 1 and 2 show some examples of paraphrases generated by our system across a range of paraphrase quality for two different pivot languages.",
        "Although the goal of the paraphrasing approach is to make it less data-intensive to tune log-linear model parameters for translation, our paraphrasing approach, since it is based on an English-to-English log-linear model, also requires its own parameter tuning.",
        "This, however, is straightforward: regardless of how the paraphrasing model will be used in statistical MT, e.g., irrespective of source language, it is possible to use any existing set of English paraphrases as the tuning set for English-to-English translation.",
        "We used the 2002 NIST MT evaluation test set reference translations.",

        "This might prove beneficial for various discriminative training methods (Tillmann and Zhang, 2006).",
        "This has important implications for data acquisition strategies For example, it suggests that rather than obtaining four reference translations per sentence for development sets, it may be more worthwhile to obtain fewer translations for a wider range of sentences, e.g., expanding into new topics and genres.",
        "In addition, this approach can significantly increase the utility of datasets which include only a single reference translation.",
        "A number of future research directions are possible.",
        "First, since we have already demonstrated that noisy paraphrases can nonetheless add value, it would be straightforward to explore the quantity/quality tradeoff by expanding the MERT reference translations with n-best paraphrases for n > 1.",
        "We also plan to conduct an intrinsic evaluation of the quality of paraphrases that our technique generates.",
        "It is important to note that a different tradeoff ratio may lead to even better results, e.g, using only the paraphrased references when they pass some goodness threshold, as used in Ueffing's (2006) self-training MT approach.",
        "We have also observed that named entities are usually paraphrased incorrectly if there is a genre mismatch between the training and the test data.",
        "The Hiero decoder allows spans of source text to be annotated with inline translations using XML.",
        "We plan to identify and annotate named entities in the English source so that they are left unchanged.",
        "Also, since the language F for English-F pivoting is arbitrary, we plan to investigate using English-to-English grammars created using multiple English-F grammars based on different languages, both individually and in combination, in order to improve paraphrase quality.",
        "We also plan to explore a wider range of paraphrase-creation techniques, ranging from simple word substitutions (e.g., based on WordNet) to using the pivot technique with other translations systems."
