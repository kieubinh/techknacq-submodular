        "One of the stated goals for the shared task of this workshop is \"to offer newcomers a smooth start with hands-on experience in state-of-the-art statistical machine translation methods\".",
        "As our previous research in machine translation has been mainly concerned with rule-based methods, we jumped at this offer.",
        "We chose to work on German-to-English translation for two reasons.",
        "Our primary practical interest lies with translation between Swedish and English, and of the languages offered for the shared task, German is the one closest in structure to Swedish.",
        "While there are differences in word order and morphology between Swedish and German, there are also similarities, e.g., that both languages represent nominal compounds as single orthographic words.",
        "We chose the direction from German to English because our knowledge of English is better than our knowledge of German, making it easier to judge the quality of translation output.",
        "Experiments were performed on the Europarl data.",
        "With factored statistical machine translation, different levels of linguistic information can be taken into account during training of a statistical translation system and decoding.",
        "In our experiments we combined syntactic and morphological factors from an off-the-shelf parser with the factored translation framework in Moses (Moses, 2007).",
        "We wanted to test the following hypotheses:",
        "• Translation models based on lemmas will improve translation quality (Popovic and Ney, 2004)",
        "• Decompounding German nominal compounds will improve translation quality (Koehn and Knight, 2003)",
        "• Reordering models based on word forms and parts-of-speech will improve translation quality (Zens and Ney, 2006)."

        "For our experiments with Moses we basically followed the shared task baseline system setup to train our factored translation models.",
        "After training a statistical model, minimum error-rate tuning was performed to tune the model parameters.",
        "All experiments were performed on an AMD 64 Athlon 4000+ processor with 4 Gb of RAM and 32 bit Linux (Ubuntu).",
        "Since time as well as computer resources were limited we designed a model that we hoped would make the best use of all available factors.",
        "This model turned out to be too complex for our machine and in later experiments we abandoned it for a simpler model.",
        "In the preprocessing step we used the standard preprocessing of the shared task baseline system, parsed the German and English texts and processed the output to obtain four factors: word form, lemma, part-of-speech and morphology.",
        "Missing values for lemma, part-of-speech and morphology were replaced with default values.",
        "Noun compounds are very frequent in German, 2.9% of all tokens in the tuning corpus were identified by the parser as noun compounds.",
        "Compounds tend to lead to sparse data problems and splitting them has been shown to improve German-English translation (Koehn and Knight, 2003).",
        "Thus we decided to decompund German noun compounds identified as such by our parser.",
        "We used a simple strategy to remove fillers and to correct some obvious mistakes.",
        "We removed the filler '-s' that appear before a marked split unless it was one of '-ss', '-urs', '-eis' or '-us'.",
        "This applied to 35% of the noun compounds in the tuning corpus.",
        "The fillers were removed both in the word form and the lemma (see Figure 2).",
        "There were some mistakes made by the parser, for instance on compounds containing the word 'nahmen' which was incorrectly split as 'stel-lungn#ahmen' instead of 'stellung#nahmen' (\"statement\").",
        "These splits were corrected by moving the 'n' to the right side of the split.",
        "We then split noun-lemmas on hyphens unless there were numbers on either side of it and on the places marked by '#'.",
        "Word forms were split in the corresponding places as the lemmas.",
        "The part-of-speech and morphology of the last word in the compound is the same as for the whole compound.",
        "For the other parts we hypothesized that part-of-speech is Noun and the morphology is unknown, marked by the tag UNK.",

        "After pre-processing, the German-English Eu-roparl training data contains four factors: 0: word form, 1: lemma, 2: part-of-speech, 3: morphology.",
        "As a first step in training our translation models we performed word alignment on lemmas as this could potentially improve word alignment.",
        "Factored translation requires a number of decoding steps, which are either mapping steps mapping a source factor to a target factor or generation steps generating a target factor from other target factors.",
        "Our first setup contained three mapping steps, T0-T2, and one generation step, G0.",
        "With the generation step, word forms that did not appear in the training data may still get translated if the lemma, part-of-speech and morphology can be translated separately and the target word form can be generated from these factors.",
        "Word order varies a great deal between German and English.",
        "This is especially true for the placement of verbs.",
        "To model word order changes we included part-of-speech information and created two reordering models, one based on word form (0), the other on part-of-speech (2):",

        "The decoding times for this setup turned out to be unmanageable.",

        "In the second iteration decoding time increased to approx.",
        "30 min/sentence.",
        "Removing one of the reordering models did not result in a significant change in decoding time.",
        "Just translating the 2000 sentences of test data with untuned parameters would take several days.",
        "We interrupted the tuning and abandoned this setup.",
        "Because of the excessive decoding times of the first factored setup we resorted to a simpler system that only used the word form factor for the translation and reordering models.",
        "This setup differs from the shared task baseline in the following ways: First, it uses the tokenization provided by the parser.",
        "Second, alignment was performed on the lemma factor.",
        "Third, German compounds were split using the method described above.",
        "To speed up tuning and decoding, we only used the first 200 sentences of development data (dev2006) for tuning and reduced stack size to 50.",
        "R: 0-0.msd-bidirectional-fe",
        "To test our hypothesis that word reordering would benefit from part-of-speech information we created another simpler model.",

        "Decompounding of nouns reduced the number of untranslated words, but there were still some left.",
