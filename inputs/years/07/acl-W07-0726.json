      "text": [
        "Recent work on statistical machine translation has led to significant progress in coverage and quality of translation technology, but so far, most of this work focuses on translation into English, where relatively simple morphological structure and abundance of monolingual training data helped to compensate for the relative lack of linguistic sophistication of the underlying models.",
        "As SMT systems are trained on massive amounts of data, they are typically quite good at capturing implicit knowledge contained in co-occurrence statistics, which can serve as a shallow replacement for the world knowledge that would be required for the resolution of ambiguities and the insertion of information that happens to be missing in the source text but is required to generate well-formed text in the target language.",
        "Already before, decades of work went into the implementation of MT systems (typically rule-based) for frequently used language pairs, and these systems quite often contain a wealth of linguistic knowledge about the languages involved, such as fairly complete mechanisms for morphological and syntactic analysis and generation, as well as a large number of bilingual lexical entries spanning many application domains.",
        "It is an interesting challenge to combine the different types of knowledge into integrated systems that could then exploit both explicit linguistic knowledge contained in the rules of one or several conventional MT system(s) and implicit knowledge that can be extracted from large amounts of text.",
        "The recently started EuroMatrix project will explore this integration of rule-based and statistical knowledge sources, and one of the approaches to be investigated is the combination of existing rule-based MT systems into a multi-engine architecture.",
        "The work described in this paper is one of the first incarnations of such a multi-engine architecture within the project, and a careful analysis of the results will guide us in the choice of further steps within the project."

      "heading": "2. Architectures for multi-engine MT",
      "text": [
        "Combinations of MT systems into multi-engine architectures have a long tradition, starting perhaps with (Frederking and Nirenburg, 1994).",
        "Multi-engine systems can be roughly divided into simple architectures that try to select the best output from a number of systems, but leave the individual hypotheses as is (Tidhar and Kiissner, 2000; Akiba et al., 2001; Callison-Burch and Flournoy, 2001; Akiba et al., 2002; Nomoto, 2004; Eisele, 2005) and more sophisticated setups that try to recombine the best parts from multiple hypotheses into a new utterance that can be better than the best of the given candidates, as described in (Rayner and Carter, 1997; Hogan and Frederking, 1998; Bangalore et al., 2001; Jayaraman and Lavie, 2005; Matusov et al., 2006; Rosti et al., 2007).",
        "Recombining multiple MT results requires finding the correspondences between alternative renderings of a source-language expression proposed by different MT systems.",
        "This is generally not straightforward, as different word order and errors in the output can make it hard to identify the alignment.",
        "Still, we assume that a good way to combine the various MT outcomes will need to involve word alignment between the MT output and the given source text, and hence a specialized module for word alignment is a central component of our setup.",
        "Additionally, a recombination system needs a way to pick the best combination of alternative building blocks; and when judging the quality of a particular configuration, both the plausibility of the building blocks as such and their relation to the context need to be taken into account.",
        "The required optimization process is very similar to the search in a SMT decoder that looks for naturally sounding combinations of highly probable partial translations.",
        "Instead of implementing a special-purpose search procedure from scratch, we transform the information contained in the MT output into a form that is suitable as input for an existing SMT decoder.",
        "This has the additional advantage that resources used in standard phrase-based SMT can be flexibly combined with the material extracted from the rule-based MT results; the optimal combination can essentially be reduced to the task of finding good relative weights for the various phrase table entries.",
        "A sketch of the overall architecture is given in Fig. 1, where the blue (light) parts represent the modules and data sets used in purely statistical MT, and the red (dark) parts are the additional modules and data sets derived from the rule-based engines.",
        "It should be noted that this is by far not the only way to combine systems.",
        "In particular, as this proposed setup gives the last word to the SMT decoder, we risk that linguistically well-formed constructs from one of the rule-based engines will be deteriorated in the final decoding step.",
        "Alternative architectures are under exploration and will be described elsewhere."

        "For the experiments, we used a set of six rule-based MT engines that are partly available via web interfaces and partly installed locally.",
        "The web based systems are provided by Google (based on Systran for the relevant language pairs), SDL, and ProMT which all deliver significantly different output.",
        "Locally installed systems are OpenLogos, Lucy (a recent offspring of METAL), and translate pro by lin-genio (only for German <-> English).",
        "In addition to these engines, we also used the scripts included in the Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2006) to generate phrase tables from the training data.",
        "We enhanced the phrase tables with information on whether a given pair of phrases can also be derived via a third, intermediate language.",
        "We assume that this can be useful to distinguish different degrees of reliability, but due to lack of time for fine-tuning we could not yet show that it indeed helps in increasing the overall quality of the output."

        "The input text and the output text of the MT systems was aligned by means of GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), a tool with which statistical models for alignment of parallel texts can be trained.",
        "Since training new models on merely short texts does not yield very accurate results, we applied a method where text can be aligned based on existing models that have been trained on the Europarl Corpus (Koehn, 2005) beforehand.",
        "This was achieved by using a modified version of GIZA++ that is able to load given models.",
        "The modified version of GIZA++ is embedded into a client-server setup.",
        "The user can send two corresponding files to the server, and specify two models for both translation directions from which alignments should be generated.",
        "After generating alignments in both directions (by running GIZA++ twice), the system also delivers a combination of these alignments which then serves as input to the following steps described below.",
        "We then concatenated the phrase tables from the SMT baseline system and the phrase tables obtained from the rule-based MT systems and augmented them by additional columns, one for each system used.",
        "With this additional information it is clear which of the MT systems a phrase pair stems from, enabling us to assign relative weights to the contributions of the different systems.",
        "The optimal weights for the different columns can then be assigned with the help of minimum error rate training (Och, 2003)."

        "For a statistical system, lexical coverage becomes an obstacle - especially when the bilingual lexical entries are trained on documents from different domains.",
        "However, due to the distinct mechanisms used to generate these entries, rule-based systems and statistical systems usually differ in coverage.",
