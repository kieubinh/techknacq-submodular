        "Phrase-to-phrase translation pairs are extracted by training IBM Model-4 word alignments in both directions, using the GIZA++ toolkit (Och and Ney, 2000), and then extracting phrase pair candidates which are consistent with these alignments, starting from the intersection of both alignments.",
        "This is done with the help of phrase model training code provided by University of Edinburgh during the NAACL 2006 Workshop on Statistical Machine Translation (Koehn and Monz, 2006).",
        "The raw relative frequency estimates found in the phrase translation tables are then smoothed by applying modified Kneser-Ney discounting as explained in (Foster et al., 2006).",
        "The resulting phrase translation tables are pruned by using the combined translation model score as determined by Minimum Error Rate (MER) optimization on the development set.",
        "We apply a part-of-speech (POS) based reordering scheme (J. M. Crego et al., 2006) to the POS-tagged source sentences before decoding.",
        "For this, we use the GIZA++ alignments and the POS-tagged source side of the training corpus to learn reordering rules that achieve a (locally) monotone alignment.",
        "Figure 1 shows an example in which three reordering rules are extracted from the POS tags of an English source sentence and its corresponding Spanish GIZA++ alignment.",
        "Before translation, we construct lattices for every source sentence.",
        "The lattices include the original source sentence along with all the reorderings that are consistent with the learned rules.",
        "All incoming edges of the lattice are annotated with distortion model scores.",
        "Figure 2 gives an example of such a lattice.",
        "In the subsequent lattice decoding step, we apply either monotone decoding or decoding with a reduced local reordering window, typically of size 2.",
        "The ISL beam search decoder (Vogel, 2003) combines all the different model scores to find the best translation.",
        "Here, the following models were used:",
        "• The translation model, i.e. the phrase-to-phrase translations extracted from the bilingual corpus, annoted with four translation model scores.",
        "These four scores are the smoothed forward and backward phrase translation probabilities and the forward and backward lexical weights.",
        "• A 4-gram language model.",
        "The SRI language model toolkit was used to train the language model and we applied modified Kneser-Ney smoothing.",
        "• An internal word reordering model in addition to the already described POS-based reordering.",
        "We all agree on that PRP DT VB IN DT",
        "This internal reordering model assigns higher costs to longer distance reordering.",
        "• Simple word and phrase count models.",
        "The former is essentially used to compensate for the tendency of the language model to prefer shorter translations, while the latter can give preference to longer phrases, potentially improving fluency.",
        "The ISL SMT decoder is capable of loading several language models (LMs) at the same time, namely n-gram SRI language models with n up to 4 and suffix array language models (Zhang and Vogel, 2006) of arbitrary length.",
        "While we typically see gains in performance for using suffix array LMs with longer histories, we restricted ourselves here to one 4-gram SRI LM only, due to a limited amount of available LM training data.",
        "The decoding process itself is organized in two stages.",
        "First, all available word and phrase translations are found and inserted into a so-called translation lattice.",
        "Then the best combination of these partial translations is found by doing a best path search through the translation lattice, where we also allow for word reorderings within a predefined local reordering window.",
        "To optimize the system towards a maximal BLEU or NIST score, we use Minimum Error Rate (MER) Training as described in (Och, 2003).",
        "For each model weight, MER applies a multi-linear search on the development set n-best list produced by the system.",
        "Due to the limited numbers of translations in the n-best list, these new model weights are suboptimal.",
        "To compensate for this, a new full translation is done.",
        "The resulting new n-best list is then merged with the old n-best list and the optimization process is repeated.",

        "Detailed corpus statistics can be found in Table 1.",
        "The available parallel News Commentary training data of approximately 1 million running words for both languages was only used as additional language model training data, to adapt our in-domain (Europarl) system to the out-of-domain (News Commentary) task.",
        "The development sets consist of 2000 Europarl sentences (dev-EU) and 1057 News Commentary sentences (dev-NC).",

        "All development and development-test sets have only one reference translation per sentence.",
        "The ACL shared task is very close in form and content to the Final Text Editions (FTE) task of the TC-STAR (TC-STAR, 2004) evaluation.",
        "For this reason, we decided to apply a similar normalization scheme to the training data as was applied in our TC-STAR verbatim SMT system.",
        "Although trained on \"verbatimized\" data that did not contain any numbers, but rather had all numbers and dates spelled out, it yielded consistently better results than our TC-STAR FTE SMT system.",
        "When translating FTE content, the verbatim system treated all numbers as unknown words, i.e. they were left unchanged during translation.",
        "To compensate for this, we applied extended postprocessing to the translations that conducts the necessary conversions between Spanish and English numbers, e.g. the conversion of decimal comma in Spanish to decimal point in English.",
        "Other key points which we adopted from this normalization scheme were the tokenization of punctuation marks, the true-casing of the first word of each sentence, as well as extended cleaning of the training data.",
        "The latter mainly consisted of the removal of sections with a highly unbalanced source to target words ratio and the removal of unusual string combinations and document references, like for example \"B5-0918/2000\", \"(COM(2000) 335 -C5-0386/2000 - 2000/0143(CNS))\", etc.",
        "Based on this normalization scheme, we trained and optimized a baseline in-domain system on accordingly normalized source and reference sentences.",
        "For optimization, we combined the available development sets for the Europarl task and the News Commentary task.",
        "In order to further improve the applied normalization scheme, we experimented with replacing all numbers with the string \"NMBR\", rather than spelling them out and by replacing all document identifiers with the string \"DCMNT\", rather than deleting them.",

        "The BLEU scores for both translation directions on the different development and development-test sets can be found in Table 3.",
        "In order to adapt our in-domain system towards the out-of-domain News Commentary task, we considered two approaches based on language model adaptation.",
        "First, we interpolated the in-domain LM with an out-of-domain LM computed on the available News Commentary training data.",
        "The interpolation weights were chosen such as to achieve a minimal LM perplexity on the out-of-domain development set.",
        "For both languages, the interpolation weights were approximately 0.5.",
        "Our second approach was to simply load the out-of-domain LM as an additional LM into our decoder.",
        "In both cases, we optimized the translation system on the out-of-domain development data only.",
        "For the second approach, MER optimization assigned three to four times higher scaling factors to the considerably smaller out-domain LM than to the original indomain LM.",
        "Table 4 shows the results in BLEU on the out-of-domain development and developmenttest sets for both translation directions.",
