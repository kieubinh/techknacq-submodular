        "The 'noisier channel': translation from morphologically complex languages",
        "Christopher J. Dyer",
        "This paper presents a new paradigm for translation from inflectionally rich languages that was used in the University of Maryland statistical machine translation system for the WMT07 Shared Task.",
        "The system is based on a hierarchical phrase-based decoder that has been augmented to translate ambiguous input given in the form of a confusion network (CN), a weighted finite state representation of a set of strings.",
        "By treating morphologically derived forms of the input sequence as possible, albeit more \"costly\" paths that the decoder may select, we find that significant gains (10% BLEU relative) can be attained when translating from Czech, a language with considerable inflectional complexity, into English."

      "text": [
        "Morphological analysis occupies a tenuous position statistical machine translation systems.",
        "Conventional translation models are constructed with no consideration of the relationships between lexical items and instead treat different inflected (observed) forms of identical underlying lemmas as completely independent of one another.",
        "While the variously inflected forms of one lemma may express differences in meaning that are crucial to correct translation, the strict independence assumptions normally made exacerbate data sparseness and lead to poorly estimated models and suboptimal translations.",
        "A variety of solutions have been proposed: Niessen and Ney (2001) use of morphological information to improve word reordering before training and after decoding.",
        "Goldwater and McClosky (2005) show improvements in a Czech to English word-based translation system when inflectional endings are simplified or removed entirely.",
        "Their method can, however, actually harm performance since the discarded morphemes carry some information that may have bearing on the translation (cf.",
        "Section 3.3).",
        "To avoid this pitfall, Talbot and Osborne (2006) use a data-driven approach to cluster source-language morphological variants that are meaningless in the target language, and Yang and Kirchhoff (2006) propose the use of a backoff model that uses morphologically reduced forms only when the translation of the surface form is unavailable.",
        "All of these approaches have in common that the decisions about whether to use morphological information are made in either a pre-or post-processing step.",
        "Recent work in spoken language translation suggests that allowing decisions about the use of morphological information to be made along side other translation decisions (i.e., inside the decoder), will yield better results.",
        "At least as early as Ney (1999), it has been shown that when translating the output from automatic speech regonition (ASR) systems, the quality can be improved by considering multiple (rather than only a single best) transcription hypothesis.",
        "Although state-of-the-art statistical machine translation systems have conventionally assumed unambiguous input; recent work has demonstrated the possibility of efficient decoding of ambiguous input (represented as confusion networks or word lattices) within standard phrase-based models (Bertoldi et al., to appear 2007) as well as hierarchical phrase-based models (Dyer and Resnik, 2007).",
        "These hybrid decoders search for the target language sentence e that maximizes the following probability, where G (o) represents the set of weighted transcription hypotheses produced by an ASR decoder:",
        "The conditional probability p(e, f |o) that is maximized is modeled directly using a log-linear model (Och and Ney, 2002), whose parameters can be tuned to optimize either the probability of a development set or some other objective (such as maximizing BLEU).",
        "In addition to the standard translation model features, the ASR system's posterior probability is another feature.",
        "The decoder thus finds a translation hypothesis e that maximizes the joint translation/transcription probability, which is not necessarily the one that corresponds to the best single transcription hypothesis."

        "We extend the concept of translating from an ambiguous set of source hypotheses to the domain of text translation by redefining G(â€¢) to be a set of weighted sentences derived by applying morphological transformations (such as stemming, compound splitting, clitic splitting, etc.)",
        "to a given source sentence f .",
        "This model for translation extends the usual noisy channel metaphor by suggesting that an \"English\" source signal is first distorted into a morphologically neutral \"French\" and then morphological processes represent a further distortion of the signal, which can be modeled independently.",
        "Whereas in the context of an ASR transcription hypothesis, G( ) assigns a posterior probability to each sentence, we redefine of this value to be a backoff penalty.",
        "This can be intuitively thought of as a measure of the \"distance\" that a given morphological alternative is from the observed input sentence.",
        "The remainder of the paper is structured as follows.",
        "In Section 2, we describe the basic hierarchical translation model.",
        "In Section 3, we describe the data and tools used and present experimental results for Czech-English.",

      "text": [
        "Chiang (2005; to appear 2007) introduced hierarchical phrase-based translation models, which are formally based on synchronous context-free grammars.",
        "These generalize phrase-based translation models by allowing phrase pairs to contain variables.",
        "Like phrase correspondences, the corresponding synchronous grammar rules can be learned automatically from aligned, but otherwise unannotated, training bitext.",
        "For details about the extraction algorithm, refer to Chiang (to appear 2007).",
        "The rules of the induced grammar consist of pairs of strings of terminals and non-terminals in the source and target languages, as well one-to-one correspondences between non-terminals on the source and target side of each pair (shown as indexes in the examples below).",
        "Thus they encapsulate not only meaning translation (of possibly discontinuous spans), but also typical reordering patterns.",
        "For example, the following two rules were extracted from the Spanish <-> English segment of the Europarl corpus (Koehn, 2003):",
        "Rule (2) expresses the fact that possessors can be expressed prior to the possessed object in English but must follow in Spanish.",
        "Rule (3) shows that the adjective verde follows the modified expression in Spanish whereas the corresponding English lexical item green precedes what it modifies.",
        "Although the rules given here correspond to syntactic constituents, this is accidental.",
        "The grammars extracted make use of only a single non-terminal category and variables are posited that may or may not correspond to linguistically meaningful spans.",
        "Given a synchronous grammar G, the translation process is equivalent to parsing an input sentence with the source side of G and thereby inducing a target sentence.",
        "The decoder we used is based on the CKY+ algorithm, which permits the parsing of rules that are not in Chomsky normal form (Chep-palier and Rajman, 1998) and that has been adapted to admit input that is in the form of a confusion network (Dyer and Resnik, 2007).",

        "language model probabilities into the model, which is important for translation quality, the grammar is intersected during decoding with an m-gram language model.",
        "This process significantly increases the effective size of the grammar, and so a beam-search heuristic called cube pruning is used, which has been experimentally determined to be nearly as effective as an exhaustive search but far more efficient."

        "Czech was selected because it exhibits a rich inflectional morphology, but its other morphological processes (such as compounding and cliticization) that affect multiple lemmas are relatively limited.",
        "This has the advantage that a morphologically simplified (i.e., lemmatized) form of a Czech sentence has the same number of tokens as the surface form has words, which makes representing G(f) as a confusion network relatively straightforward.",

        "Recasing was carried out using SRI's disambig tool using a trigram language model.",
        "The feature set used included bidirectional translation probabilities for rules, lexical translation probabilities, a target language model probability, and count features for target words, number of non-terminal symbols used, and finally the number of morphologically simplified forms selected in the CN.",
        "Feature weight tuning was carried out using minimum error rate training, maximizing BLEU scores on a held-out development set (Och, 2003).",
        "Translation scores are reported using case-insensitive BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) with a single reference translation.",
