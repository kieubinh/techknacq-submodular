        "In recent decades, alongside the growing research on Machine Translation (MT), automatic MT evaluation has become a critical problem for MT system developers, who are interested in quick turnaround development cycles.",
        "The state-of-the-art automatic MT evaluation is an n-gram based metric represented by BLEU (Papineni et al., 2001) and its variants.",
        "Ever since its creation, the BLEU score has been the gauge of Machine Translation system evaluation.",
        "Nevertheless, the research community has been largely aware of the deficiency of the BLEU metric.",
        "BLEU captures only a single dimension of the vitality of natural languages: a candidate translation gets acknowledged only if it uses exactly the same lexicon as the reference translation.",
        "Natural languages, however, are characterized by their extremely rich mechanisms for reproduction via a large number of syntactic, lexical and semantic rewriting rules.",
        "Although BLEU has been shown to correlate positively with human assessments at the document level (Papineni et al., 2001), efforts to improve state-of-the-art MT require that human assessment be approximated at sentence level as well.",
        "Researchers report the BLEU score at document level in order to combat the sparseness of n-grams in BLEU scoring.",
        "But, ultimately, document-level MT evaluation has to be pinned down to the granularity of the sentence.",
        "Unfortunately, the correlation between human assessment and BLEU score at sentence level is extremely low (Liu et al., 2005, 2006).",
        "While acknowledging the appealing simplicity of BLEU as a way to access one perspective of an MT candidate translation's quality, we observe the following facts of n-gram based MT metrics.",
        "First, they may not reflect the mechanism of how human beings evaluate sentence translation quality.",
        "More specifically, optimizing BLEU does not guarantee the optimization of sentence quality approved by human assessors.",
        "Therefore, BLEU is likely to have a low correlation with human assessment at sentence level for most candidate translations.",
        "Second, it is conceivable that human beings are more reliable ranking the quality of multiple candidate translations than assigning a numeric value to index the quality of the candidate translation even with significant deliberation.",
        "Consequently, a more intuitive approach for automatic MT evaluation is to replicate the quality ranking ability of human assessors.",
        "Thirdly, the BLEU score is elusive and hard to interpret; for example, what can be concluded for a candidate translation's quality if the BLEU score is 0.0168, particularly when we are aware that even a human translation can receive an embarrassingly low BLEU score?",
        "In light of the discussion above, we propose an alternative scenario for MT evaluation, where, instead of assigning a numeric score to a candidate translation under evaluation, we predict its rank with regard to its peer candidate translations.",
        "This formulation of the MT evaluation task fills the gap between an automatic scoring function and human MT evaluation practice.",
        "The results from the current study will not only interest MT system evaluation moderators but will also inform the research community about which features are useful in improving the correlation between human rankings and automatic rankings."

      "heading": "2. Problem Formulation",
      "text": [
        "We use two data sets for the experiments: the test data set from the LDC MTC corpus (LDC2003T17) and the data set from the MT evaluation workshop at ACL05.",
        "Both data sets are for Chinese-English language pairs and each has four reference translations and seven MT system translations as well as human assessments for fluency and adequacy on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 indicating the best quality.",
        "For the LDC2003T17 data, human assessments exist for only three MT systems; for the ACL05 workshop data, there are human assessments for all seven MT systems.",
        "Table 1 summarizes the information from these two data sets.",
        "The Kappa scores (Cohen, 1960) for the human assessment scores are negative, both for fluency and adequacy, indicating that human beings are not consistent when assigning quality scores to the candidate translations.",
        "We have much sympathy with a concern expressed in (Turian, 2003) that \"Automatic MT evaluation cannot be faulted for poor correlation with the human judges, when the judges do not correlate well each other.",
        "\"To determine whether human assessor might be more consistent when ranking pairs of sentences, we examined the \"ranking consistency score\"of the human assessment data for the LDC2003T17 data.",
        "For this consistency score, we are only concerned with whether multiple judges are consistent in terms of which sentence of the two sentences is better: we are not concerned with the quantitative difference between judges.",
        "Since some sentences are judged by three judges while others are judged by only two judges, we calculated the consistency scores under both circumstances, referred to as \"Consistent 2\"and \"Consistent 3\"in the following table.",
        "For \"Consistent 2\", for every pair of sentences, where sentence 1 is scored higher (or lower or equal) than sentence 2 by both judges, then the two judges are deemed consistent.",
        "For \"Consistent 3\", the proportion of sentences that achieved the above consistency from triple judges is reported.",
        "Additionally, we also considered a consistency rate that excludes pairs for which only one judge says sentence 1 is better and the other judge(s) say(s) sentence 2 is better.",
        "We call these \"Consistent 2 with tie\"and \"Consistent 3 with tie\".",
        "From the rank consistency scores in Table 2, we observe that two annotators are more consistent with the relative rankings for sentence pairs than with the absolute quality scores.",
        "This finding further supports the task of ranking MT candidate sentences as more reliable than the one of classifying the quality labels.",
        "As discussed in the previous section, it is difficult for human assessors to perform MT candidate translation evaluation with fine granularity (e.g., using real-valued numeric score).",
        "But humans' assessments are relatively reliable for judgments of quality ranking using a coarser ordinal scale, as we have seen above.",
        "Several approaches for automatically assigning quality scores to candidate sentences are available, including classification, regression or ranking, of which ranking is deemed to be a more appropriate approach.",
        "Nominalize the quality scores and formulating the task as a classification problem would result in a loss of the ordinal information encoded in the different scores.",
        "Additionally, the low Kappa scores in the human annotation reliability analysis reported above also confirms our previous speculation that a classification approach is less appropriate.",
        "Regression would be more reasonable than classification because it preserves the ordinal information in the quality labels, but it also inappropriately imposes interval scaling onto the quality labels.",
        "In contrast, ranking considers only the relative ranking information from human labels and does not impose any extra information onto the quality labels assigned by human beings.",
        "The specific research question addressed in this paper is three-fold: First, in addition to investigating the correlation between automatic numeric scoring and human assessments, is ranking of peer candidate translations an alternative way of examining correlation that better suits the state of affairs of human annotation?",
        "Second, if the answer to the above question is yes, can better correlation be achieved with human assessment under the new task scenario?",
        "Finally, in addition to n-gram matching, which other knowledge sources can combat and even improve the rank order correlation?",
        "The process of ranking is a crucial technique in Information Retrieval (IR) where search engines rank web pages depending on their relevance to a query.",
        "In this work, sentence level MT evaluation is considered as a ranking problem.",
        "For all candidate translations of the same source Chinese sentence, we predict their translation quality ranks.",
        "We evaluate the ranker by Spearman's rank order correlation coefficient between human ranks and predicted ranks described by the following formula (Siegel,1956):",
        "where D is the difference between each pair of ranks and N is the number of candidates for ranking."

        "But our analysis shows a mean BLEU of only 0.1456398, with a standard deviation of 0.1522381, which means that BLEU is not very predictive of sentence level evaluation.",

        "Additionally, this language model could represent the style of a certain group of translators in a certain domain on the genre of news articles.",
        "To pursue such a language model, we explore a language model that is trained on all sentences in the four references.",

        "The perplexity score obtained this way reflects the degree to which a candidate translation can be generated from the n-gram probability distribution of the whole collection of sentences in the four references.",

        "The high correlation between adequacy and fluency scores from human assessments (both pearson and spearman correlations are 0.67) also indicates that the same features will achieve improvements for adequacy evaluation.",
