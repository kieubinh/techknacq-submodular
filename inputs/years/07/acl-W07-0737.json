        "For translators, not all source sentences are created equal.",

        "The focus of this paper is on identifying Difficult-to-Translate Phrases (DTPs) within a source sentence and determining their impact on the translation process.",
        "We investigate three questions: (1) how should we formalize the notion of difficulty as a measurable quantity over an appropriately defined phrasal unit?",
        "(2) To what level of accuracy can we automatically identify DTPs?",
        "(3) To what extent do DTPs affect an MT system's performance on other (not-as-difficult) parts of the sentence?",
        "Conversely, would knowing the correct translation for the DTPs improve the system's translation for the rest of the sentence?",
        "In this work, we model difficulty as a measurement with respect to a particular MT system.",
        "We further assume that the degree of difficulty of a phrase is directly correlated with the quality of the translation produced by the MT system, which can be approximated using an automatic evaluation metric, such as BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002).",
        "Using this formulation of difficulty, we build a framework that augments an off-the-shelf phrase-based MT system with a DTP classifier that we developed.",
        "We explore the three questions in a set of experiments, using the framework as a testbed.",
        "In the first experiment, we verify that our proposed difficulty measurement is sensible.",
        "The second experiment evaluates the classifier's accuracy in predicting whether a source phrase is a DTP.",
        "For that, we train a binary SVM classifier via a series of lexical and system dependent features.",
        "The third is an oracle study in which the DTPs are perfectly identified and human translations are obtained.",
        "These human-translated phrases are then used to constrain the MT system as it translates the rest of the sentence.",
        "We evaluate the translation quality of the entire sentence and also the parts that are not translated by humans.",

        "There are several reasons for investigating ways to identify DTPs.",

        "It can also be used as a preprocessing step, an alternative to post-editing.",
        "For many languages, MT output requires posttranslation editing that can be cumbersome task for low quality outputs, long sentences, complicated structures and idioms.",
        "Pre-translation might be viewed as a kind of preventive medicine; that is, a system might produce an overall better output if it were not thwarted by some small portion of the input.",
        "By identifying DTPs and passing those cases off to an expensive translation resource (e.g. humans) first, we might avoid problems further down the MT pipeline.",
        "Moreover, pre-translation might not always have to be performed by humans.",
        "What is considered difficult for one system might not be difficult for another system; thus, pre-translation might also be conducted using multiple MT systems."

        "The input is a source sentence (a1 ... an), from which DTP candidates are proposed.",
        "Because the DTPs will have to be translated by humans as independent units, we limit the set of possible phrases to be syntactically meaningful units.",
        "Therefore, the framework requires a source-language syntactic parser or chunker.",
        "In this paper, we parse the source sentence with an off-the-shelf syntactic parser (Bikel, 2002).",

        "In the following subsections, we describe how we develop the DTP classifier with machine learning techniques and how we constrain the underlying MT system with human translated DTPs.",
        "Training the DTP Classifier",
        "Given a phrase in the source language, the DTP classifier extracts a set of features from it and predicts whether it is difficult or not based on its feature values.",
        "We use an SVM classifier in this work.",
        "We train the SVM-Light implementation of the algorithm (Joachims 1999).",
        "To train the classifier, we need to tackle two challenges.",
        "First, we need to develop some appropriate training data because there is no corpus with annotated DTPs.",
        "Second, we need to determine a set of predictive features for the classifier.",
        "Development of the Gold Standard",
        "Unlike the typical SVM training scenario, labeled training examples of DTPs do not exist.",
        "Manual creation of such data requires deep understanding of the linguistics differences of source and target languages and also deep knowledge about the MT system and its training data.",
        "Such resources are not accessible to us.",
        "Instead, we construct the gold standard automatically.",
        "We make the strong assumption that difficulty is directly correlated to translation quality and that translation quality can be approximately measured by automatic metrics such as BLEU.",
        "We have two resource requirements - a sentence-aligned parallel corpus (different from the data used to train the underlying MT system), and a syntactic parser for the source language.",
        "The procedure for creating the gold standard data is as follows:",
        "1.",
        "Each source sentence is parsed.",
        "2.",
        "Phrase translations are extracted from the parallel corpus.",
        "Specifically, we generate word-alignments using GIZA++ (Och 2001) in both directions and combine them using the refined methodology (Och and Ney 2003), and then we applied Koehn's toolkit (2004) to extract parallel phrases.",
        "We have relaxed the length constraints of the toolkit to ensure the extraction of long phrases (as long as 16 words).",
        "3.",
        "Parallel phrases whose source parts are not well-formed constituents are filtered out.",
        "4.",
        "The source phrases are translated by the underlying MT system, and a baseline BLEU score is computed over this set of MT outputs.",
        "5.",
        "To label each source phrase, we remove that phrase and its translation from the MT output and calculate the set's new BLEU score.",
        "If new-score is greater than the baseline score by some threshold value (a tunable parameter), we label the phrase as difficult, otherwise we label it as not difficult.",
        "Rather than directly calculating the BLEU score for each phrase, we performed the round-robin procedure described in steps 4 and 5 because BLEU is not reliable for short phrases.",
        "BLEU is calculated as a geometric mean over n-gram matches with references, assigning a score of zero to an entire phrase if no higher-ordered n-gram matches were found against the references.",
        "However, some phrases with a score of 0 might have more matches in the lower-ordered n-grams than other phrases (and thus ought to be considered \"easier\").",
        "A comparison of the relative changes in BLEU scores while holding out a phrase from the corpus gives us a more sensitive measurement than directly computing BLEU for each phrase.",
        "Features",
        "By analyzing the training corpus, we have found 18 features that are indicative of DTPs.",
        "Some phrase-level feature values are computed as an average of the feature values of the individual words.",
        "The following first four features use some probabilities that are collected from a parallel data and word alignments.",
        "Such a resource does not exist at the time of testing.",
        "Instead we use the history of the source words (estimated from the large parallel corpus) to predict the feature value.",
        "(I) Average probability of word alignment crossings: word alignment crossings are indicative of word order differences and generally structural difference across two languages.",
        "We collect word alignment crossing statistics from the training corpus to estimate the crossing probability for each word in a new source phrase.",
        "For example the Arabic word rhl has 67% probability of alignment crossing (word movement across English).",
        "These probabilities are then averaged into one value for the entire phrase.",
        "(II) Average probability of translation ambiguity: words that have multiple equally-likely translations contribute to translation ambiguity.",
        "For example a word that has 4 different translations with similar frequencies tends to be more ambiguous than a word that has one dominant translation.",
        "We collect statistics about the lexical translational ambiguities from the training corpus and lexical translation tables and use them to predict the ambiguity of each word in a new source phrase.",
        "The score for the phrase is the average of the scores for the individual words.",
        "(III) Average probability of POS tag changes: Change of a word's POS tagging is an indication of deep structural differences between the source phrase and the target phrase.",
        "Using the POS tagging information for both sides of the training corpus, we learn the probability that each source word's POS gets changed after the translation.",
        "To overcome data sparseness, we only look at the collapsed version of POS tags on both sides of the corpus.",
        "The phrase's score is the average the individual word probabilities.",
        "(IV) Average probability of null alignments: In many cases null alignments of the source words are indicative of the weakness of information about the word.",
        "This feature is similar to average ambiguity probability.",
        "The difference is that we use the probability of null alignments instead of lexical probabilities.",
        "(V-IX) Normalized number of unknown words, content words, numbers, punctuations: For each of these features we normalize the count (e.g.: unknown words) with the length of the phrase.",
        "The normalization of the features helps the classifier to not have length preference for the phrases.",
        "(X) Number of proper nouns: Named entities tend to create translation difficulty, due to their diversity of spellings and also domain differences.",
        "We use the number of proper nouns to estimate the occurrence of the named entities in the phrase.",
        "(XI Depth of the subtree: The feature is used as a measure of syntactic complexity of the phrase.",
        "For example continuous right branching of the parse tree which adds to the depth of the subtree can be indicative of a complex or ambiguous structure that might be difficult to translate.",
        "(XII) Constituency type of the phrase: We observe that the different types of constituents have varied effects on the translations of the phrase.",
        "For example prepositional phrases tend to belong to difficult phrases.",
        "(XIII) Constituency type of the parent phrase",
        "(XIV) Constituency types of the children nodes of the phrase: We form a set from the children nodes of the phrase (on the parse tree).",
        "(XV) Length of the phrase: The feature is based on the number of the words in the phrase.",
        "(XVI) Proportional length of the phrase: The proportion of the length of the phrase to the length of the sentence.",
        "As this proportion gets larger, the contextual effect on the translation of the phrase becomes less.",
        "(XVII) Distance from the start of the sentence and: Phrases that are further away from the start of the sentence tend to not be translated as well due to compounding translational errors.",
        "(XVIII) Distance from a learned translation phrase: The feature measure the number of words before reaching a learned phrase.",
        "In other words it s an indication of the level of error that is introduced in the early parts of the phrase translation.",
        "Once human translations have been obtained for the DTPs, we want the MT system to only consider output candidates that contain the human translations.",
        "The additional knowledge can be used by the phrase-based system without any code modification.",
        "Figure 2 shows the data-flow for this process.",
        "First, we append the pre-trained phrase-translation table with the DTPs and their human translations with a probability of 1.0.",
        "We also include the human translations for the DTPs as training data for the language model to ensure that the phrase vocabulary is familiar to the decoder and relax the phrase distortion parameter that the decoder can include all phrase translations with any length in the decoding.",

        "Our DTP classification differs from the confidence measuring in several aspects: one of the main purposes of our classification of DTPs is to optimize the usage of outside resources.",
        "To do so, we focus on classification of phrases which are syntactically meaningful, because those syntactic constituent units have less dependency to the whole sentence structure and can be translated independently.",
        "Our classification relies on syntactic features that are important source of information about the MT difficulty and also are useful for further error tracking (reasons behind the difficulty).",
        "Our classification is performed as a pre-translation step, so it does not rely on the output of the MT system for a test sentence; instead, it uses a parallel training corpus and the characteristics of the underlying MT system (e.g.: phrase translations, lexical probabilities).",
        "Confidence measures have been used for error correction and interactive MT systems.",
        "Ueffing and Ney (2005) employed confidence measures within a trans-type-style interactive MT system.",
        "In their system, the MT system iteratively generates the translation and the human translator accepts a part of the proposed translation by typing one or more prefix characters.",
        "The system regenerates a new translation based on the human prefix input and word level confidence measures.",
        "In contrast, our proposed usage of human knowledge is for translation at the phrase level.",
        "We use syntactic restrictions to make the extracted phrases meaningful and easy to translate in isolation.",
        "In other words, by the usage of our framework trans-type systems can use human knowledge at the phrase level for the most difficult segments of a sentence.",
        "Additionally by the usage of our framework, the MT system performs the decoding task only once.",
        "The idea of isolated phrase translation has been explored successfully in MT community.",
        "Koehn and Knight (2003) used isolated translation of NP and PP phrases and merge them with the phrase based MT system to translate the complete sentence.",
        "In our work, instead of focusing on specific type of phrases (NP or PP), we focus on isolated translation of difficult phrases with an aim to improve the translation quality of non-difficult segments too."
