        "This approach provides flexibility and adaptability features in our system and it can be easily configured to work with different languages, NLP applications, and domains.",
        "In order to determine the best rules for recognition of person names, various Arabic text corpora were analyzed.",
        "Phrases containing person names were retrieved, the underlying pattern was learned and person indicators such as titles were identified.",
        "Apart from this, person names were extracted from the available corpora and other resources to build up a lexicon, in the form of gazetteer name lists, or gazetteer for short.",
        "The various Arabic naming conventions and the person indicators identified helped in deriving fine rules that gave high-quality recognition of person names in Arabic text.",

        "Many researchers have attacked this problem in a variety of languages but only a few limited researches have focused on NER for Arabic text.",

        "This work was done in three main stages: 1) marking the phrases that might include names, 2) building up graphs to represent the words in these phrases and the relationships between them, and 3) applying rules to generate the names, classify each of them, and saves them in a database.",

        "(2005) has used parallel corpora in Spanish, and Arabic and an NE tagger in Spanish to tag the names in the Arabic corpus.",

        "Zitouni et al.",
        "(2005) has adopted a statistical approach for the entity detection and recognition (EDR).",
        "In this work, a mention can be either named (e.g. John Mayor), nominal (the president) or pronominal (she, it).",
