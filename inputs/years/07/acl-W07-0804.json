        "An important problem that has not been sufficiently explored is cross-lingual cross-document normalization.",
        "This problem would pose unique and interesting challenges.",
        "The described approach could be generalized to perform normalization of entities of different types across multilingual documents.",
        "Also, the normalization problem was treated as a classification problem.",
        "Examining the problem as a clustering (or alternatively an incremental clustering) problem might prove useful.",
        "Lastly, the effect of cross-document normalization should be examined on applications such as information extraction, information retrieval, and relationship and social network visualization."
