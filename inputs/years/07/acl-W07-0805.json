        "Unlike most known languages, no one needs to learn how to spell Amharic words.",
        "In support of the above point, Leslaw (1995) noted that no real problems exist in Amharic orthography, as there is more or less, a one-to-one correspondence between the sounds and the graphic symbols, except for the gemination of consonants and some redundant symbols.",
        "Many (Bender 1976; Cowley 1976; Baye 1986) have claimed the Amharic orthography as a syllabary for a relatively long period of time.",

        "Both of these arguments are based on the special feature of the orthography; the possibility of representing speech using either isolated phoneme symbols or concatenated symbols.",
        "In the concatenated feature, commonly known to most of the population, each orthographic symbol represents a consonant and a vowel, except for the sixth order, which is sometimes realized as a consonant without a vowel and at other times a consonant with a vowel.",
        "This representation of concatenated speech sounds by a single symbol has been the basis for the claim made of the writing system, as syllabary.",
        "Amharic orthography does not indicate gemination, but since there are relatively few minimal pairs of geminations, Amharic readers do not find this to be a problem.",
        "This property of the writing system is analogous to the vowels of Arabic and Hebrew, which are not normally indicated in writing.",
        "The Amharic orthography, as represented in the Amharic Character set - also called [fidall] consists of 276 distinct symbols.",
        "In addition, there are twenty numerals and eight punctuation marks.",
        "A sample of the orthographic symbols is given in Table 3.......",
        "However, research in speech recognition should only consider distinct sounds instead of all the orthographic symbols, unless there is a need to develop a dictation machine that includes all of the orthographic symbols.",
        "Therefore, redundant orthographic symbols that represent the same syllabic sounds can be eliminated.",
        "Thus, by eliminating redundant graphemes, we are left with a total of 233 distinct CV syllable characters.",

        "To have a good HMM model for Amharic CV syllables, one needs to conduct experiments to select the optimal model topology.",
        "Designing an HMM topology has to be done with proper consideration of the size of the unit of recognition and the amount of the training speech data.",
        "This is because as the size of the recognition unit increases and the size of the model (in terms of the number of parameters to be re-estimated) grows, the model requires more training data.",
        "We, therefore, carried out a series of experiments using a left-to-right HMM with and without jumps and skips, with a different number of emitting states (3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11) and different number of Gaussian mixtures (from 2 to 98).",

        "Figure 1 shows a left-to-right HMM of 5 emitting states with jumps and skips.",
        "We have assumed that the problem of gemination may be compensated by the looping state transitions of the HMM.",
        "Accordingly, CV syllables containing geminated consonants should have a higher loop probability than those with the non-geminated consonants.",

        "The CV syllable with the glottal stop consonant and the 6th order vowel have both jumps.",
        "These topologies have been chosen so that the models recognize the absence of the vowel and the glottal stop consonant of CV syllables.",
        "This assumption was confirmed by the observation that the trained models favor such a jump.",
        "A model, which has 5 emitting states, of the glottal stop consonant with the sixth order vowel tends to start emitting with the 3rd emitting state with a probability of 0.72.",

        "A similar model of this consonant with the other vowels (our example is the 5th order vowel) tend to start emitting with the 3rd emitting state with a probability of 0.68.",
        "This is two times the probability (0.32) of its transition from the starting (non-emitting state) to the 1st emitting state.",
        "The models of the other consonants with the sixth order vowel, which are exemplified by the model of the syllable [jI], tend to jump from the 3rdemitting state to the last (non-emitting) state with a probability of 0.39, which is considerably greater than that of continuing with the next state (0.09).",
        "Since the amount of available training speech is not enough to train transition probabilities for skipping two or more states, the number of states to be skipped have been limited to one.",
        "To determine the optimal number of Gaussian mixtures for the syllable models, we have conducted a series of experiments by adding two Gaussian mixtures for all the models until the performance of the model starts to degrade.",
        "Considering the difference in the frequency of the CV syllables, a hybrid number of Gaussian mixtures has been tried.",
        "By hybrid, we mean that Gaussian mixtures are assigned to different syllables based on their frequency.",
        "For example: the frequent syllables, like [nI], are assigned up to fifty-eight while rare syllables, like [pi], are assigned not more than two Gaussian mixtures.",
        "We present recognition results of only those recognizers which have competitive performance to the best performing models.",
        "For example: the performance of the model with 11 emitting states with skips and hybrid Gaussian mixtures is more competitive than those with 7, 8, 9, and 10 emitting states.",
        "We have also systematically left out test results which are worse than those presented in Table 6.",
        "Table 6 shows evaluation results made on the 5k development test set.",
        "From Table 6, we can see that the models with five emitting states, with twelve Gaussian mixtures, without skips and jumps has the best (89.80%) word recognition accuracy.",
        "It has 87.69% word recognition accuracy on the 20k development test set.",
        "Since the most commonly used number of HMM states for phone-based speech recognizers is three emitting states, one may expect a model of six emitting states to be the best for an HMM of concatenated consonant and vowel.",
        "But the result of our experiment shows that a CV syllable-based recognizer with only five emitting states performed better than all the other recognizers.",
