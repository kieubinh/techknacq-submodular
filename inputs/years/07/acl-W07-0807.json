      "text": [
        "Arabic is a Semitic language written from right to left, with most words derived from three-character root words.",
        "The Arabic alphabet has 28 characters, each with a distinct sound.",
        "Short vowels do not have any associated characters, but are instead indicated by diacritics attached to other characters.",
        "For example, the letter i_i /f/ with the diacritic Fatha i_i is pronounced /fa/, with the diacritic Kasra i_i is pronounced /fi/, and with the diacritic Damma i_i is pronounced /fu/.",
        "In general written Arabic, diacritics are not indicated; readers must rely on context to determine implicit diacritics, and so how the word should be pronounced.",
        "For example, some of the variants of tub/ (books), or olf /kutiba/ (is written).",
        "There are also three long vowels – represented by the letters {I ^ j} – that are more pronounced than short vowels.",
        "For instance, the letter i_i can be followed by the long vowel I /a:/ to form U /fa:/, by j /u:/ to form y /fu:/, and by ^ /i:/ to form ^ /fi:/.",
        "From an information retrieval (IR) perspective, foreign words in Arabic can be classified into two general categories: translated and transliterated (Nwesri et al., 2006).",
        "Translated words, sometimes referred to as Arabised words, are foreign words that are modified or remodelled to conform to Arabic word paradigms, and are well assimilated into the language.",
        "The assimilation process includes changes in the structure of the borrowed word, including segmental and vowel changes, addition or deletion of syllables, and modification of stress patterns (Al-Qinal, 2002).",
        "Foreign words of this category usually have a single consistent spelling variant, for example ^jjp (virus), i-a^I (archive), andyj\\j (radio).",
        "Where equivalent native terms are not available early enough for widespread adoption, foreign terms are used directly with their original pronunciation represented using Arabic letters.",
        "As these do not appear in standard Arabic lexicons – that may include adopted words – they are considered to be Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) words.",
        "With transliterated words, the phonemes of a foreign word are replaced with their nearest Arabic equivalents.",
        "Since Arabic phonemes cannot represent all phonemes found in other languages, the original phonemes are usually not represented uniformly by different transliterators, resulting in multiple spelling variants for the same foreign word (Stalls and Knight, 1998).",
        "Faced with the need to use new foreign terms, native speakers often cannot wait for formal equivalents to be defined.",
        "This is particularly true for news agencies, which encounter new foreign nouns and technical terms daily.",
        "This urgency leads to more transliteration than translation, with the associated problem of multiple spellings.",
        "In Arabic, short vowels must be indicated using diacritics, but these are rarely used in general text, and there are no standard rules on when and where diacritics must be indicated.",
        "Context does not help in predicting diacritics for foreign words such as proper nouns or technical terms, and so long vowels are often used to make the pronunciation explicit in the spelling of the word without relying on diacritics.",
        "This, too, is subject to variation; some translit-erators add a long vowel after each consonant in the word, while others add just enough long vowels to clarify word segments with ambiguous pronunciation.",
        "The absence of certain sounds in Arabic, and varying pronunciations across dialects, also contributes to the multiplicity of spellings.",
        "For instance, the sound /g/ has no standard equivalent in Arabic, since transliterators represent it according to how they pronounce it.",
        "For instance, the English letter G /g/ is at times mapped to the Arabic letters J /y/, 3 /q/, or _>■ /j/ (Abduljaleel and Larkey, 2003); we have also observed it mapped to the letter _f /k/: i_j>jJiJLj_y.&, i_jySJl;j_yi, i_iySJl;jy»., and i_iySJl;jyf are transliterations of (Gorbachev) we have found on the Web.",
        "Similarly, the interpretation of character combinations varies between transliterators.",
        "Moreover, Typographical and phonetic errors during transliteration may add even more variants (Borgman and",
        "Siegfried, 1992).",
        "When different variants of a word exist, only a subset of related documents can be found when the search uses only one variant.",
        "Typical search engine users are unlikely to recognise the problem and hence do not add other variants to their query.",
        "Currently, major search engines such as Google, Yahoo, and MSN search use exact match for Arabic search, and no publicly available Arabic Information Retrieval (AIR) system has been reported to retrieve different spelling variants (Abdelali et al., 2004).",
        "In this paper we explore how the different variants of a foreign word may be captured.",
        "We test existing similarity techniques, and introduce three techniques to search for variants of foreign words in Arabic.",
        "In the first technique, we convert different variants to a single normalised form by removing vowels and conflating homophones.",
        "In the second technique, we extend the well-known Soundex technique – commonly used to identify variants of names in English – to the OOV problem in Arabic, and in the third technique, we modify the English Editex algorithm to identify similar foreign words in Arabic."

        "Approaches to identify similar-sounding but differently spelt words have been heavily investigated in English; among these are techniques that make use of string or phonetic similarity.",
        "String similarity approaches include the Edit Distance (Hall and Dowling, 1980), used to measure the similarity of two strings by counting the minimal number of character insertions, deletions, orreplace-ments needed to transform one string into another.",

        "edit(i,j) = min[edit(i – 1, j) + 1, edit(i,j – 1) + 1, edit(i – 1, j – 1) + d(si ,U)] where d(si, ti) = 1 if si = ti, 0 otherwise.",
        "This measure can be used to rank words in the collection with respect to a query word.",
        "Zobel and Dart (1995) showed that Edit Distance performed the best among the techniques they evaluated for matching English names.",
        "It is not known how this technique will perform with Arabic words.",
        "Another candidate approach that can be used to identify similar foreign words in Arabic is n-grams (Hall and Dowling, 1980).",
        "This approach is language independent; the strings are divided into grams (substrings) of length n, and the similarity of the strings is computed on the basis of the similarity of their n-grams.",
        "Pfeifer et al.",
        "(1996) compute the similarity as the number of shared grams divided by the total number of distinct grams in the two strings.",
        "where Gs is the set of grams in string s. For example, with n=2, the similarity of \"ahmed\" and \"ahmmed\" using this measure is 0.8 because both strings contain the four 2-grams ah, hm, me, and ed, while there are five distinct 2-grams across the two strings.",
        "Gram distance (Ukkonen, 1992) is another string similarity technique.",
        "When grams are not repeated - which is the case in names – the similarity is computed as (Zobel and Dart, 1996):",
        "According to this measure, the similarity between \"ahmed\" and \"ahmmed\" is 1.",
        "With the Dice (1945) measure, the similarity of strings s and t is computed as twice the number of common n-grams between s and t, divided by the total number of n-grams in the two strings:",
        "DlCe{'%t) = | Gs | + | Gt | where Gs denotes the set of n-grams in s, and Gt denotes the set of n-grams in t.",
        "The longest common subsequence (LCS) algorithm measures the similarity between two strings based on the common characters in the two strings (Wagner and Fischer, 1974; Stephen, 1992).",
        "Similarity is normalised by dividing the length of the common subsequence by the length ofthe longer string (Melamed, 1995).",
        "The similarity between between \"ahmed\" and \"ahmmed\" is (5/6=0.833).",
        "Phonetic approaches to determine similarity between two words include the well-known Soundex algorithm developed by Odell and Russell, patented in 1918 and 1922 (Hall and Dowling, 1980).",
        "This has predefined codes for the sounds in a language, with similar-sounding letters grouped under one code.",
        "During comparisons, all letters in a word bar the first one are encoded, and the resulting representation is truncated to be at most four characters long.",
        "A variant of Soundex is the Phonix algorithm (Gadd, 1990), which transforms letter groups to letters and then to codes; the actual mappings are different from Soundex.",
        "Both Soundex and Phonix have been reported to have poorer precision in identifying variants of English names than both Edit Distance and n-grams (Zobel and Dart, 1995).",
        "Aqeel et al.",
        "(2006) propose an Arabic version of English Soundex (Asoundex-final).",
        "They include diacritics in a list of Arabic names, and created queries by altering some of these names by adding, deleting, or inserting characters.",
        "Most Arabic names are meaningful words – for example, (the praised one) – and rarely do have spelling variants.",
        "This leads to morphological ambiguity as names may match verbs, pronouns and other categories of the language.",
        "We have found that using Asoundex-final with the misspelt query (ju*^ on an Arabic collection with 35 949 unique words returns (exaggeration), (she isation), ^J- (she governs), (she defeats).",
        "Moreover, it is not clear when and how diacritics are removed, nor where the long vowel ^ belongs in their implementation.",
        "Editex, developed by Zobel and Dart (1996), enhances the Edit Distance technique by incorporating the letter-grouping strategy used by Soundex and Phonix, and has been shown to have better performance than these two algorithms, as well as Edit Distance, on a collection of 30000 distinct English names.",
        "The similarity between two strings s and t is computed as: edit(0,0) = 0 where: r(si ,tj) is 0 if si=tj, 1 if group(si)=group(tj), and 2 otherwise; and d(si,tj) is 1 if si = tj and si is \"h\" or \"w\", and r(si, tj) otherwise.",
        "We used two different data sets.",
        "The first set is generated from text crawled from the Web, and the second is prepared by manual transliteration of foreign words from English to Arabic.",

        "From this data we extracted 18 873 073 Arabic words, 383 649 of them unique.",
        "We used the Microsoft Office 2003 Arabic spellchecker to build a reference list of OOV words.",
        "To avoid duplicates in the 40 514 OOV words returned by the spellchecker, we removed the first character if it is an Arabic preposition, and if the string remaining after that character exists in the collectionWe also removed the definite article \"Al\" to obtain a list of 32583 words.",
        "Through manual inspection, we identified 2039 foreign words.",
        "To evaluate alternative techniques, we use a reference list of foreign words and their variants.",
        "To identify variants, we generated all possible spelling variants of each word according to the patterns we describe in Section 4.1.1, and kept only the patterns that exist in our collection; 556 clusters of foreign words remain.",
        "To generate foreing words variants, we first remove any vowels and then reinsert vowel combinations of the three long vowels {j ^ 1} between the consonants that remain.",
        "For a word of length n, this process generates 4(n-1) variants.",
        "Consider the word j»ISCu (Beckham).",
        "We remove vowels to obtain and then add all possible vowels to obtain the variants shown in Table 1.",
        "As discussed in Section 2.2, inconsistent representation of sounds between transliterators adds to the variations in spelling.",
        "Thus, the number of possible transliterations for a foreign word is given by 4(ra_1) multiplied by the number of possible transliterations for each of its consonants.",
        "In our example, the letter _L /q/ may also be used in place of /k/, and so we generate another set; since the representation tends to be consistent within a given word, we need to create only as many sets as there are Arabic representations for the sound.",
        "We validate the generated variants against our collection and keep only those that appear in the crawled text.",
        "For our example word \"Beckham\", we found only two correct variants: *ISCu and £o.",
        "Some of the generated variants could be correct Arabic words that would be valid when checked against the collection.",
        "Many of the generated clusters were found to be noisy - that is, they included many native Arabic words.",
        "We manually corrected these clusters by removing unrelated Arabic words.",
        "The average cluster length is 2.8 words; the smallest cluster has two variants, and the largest has nine, with a total of 1 718 words.",
        "Our second collection reflects one pattern in which OOV words are introduced by ordinary users transliterating English words into Arabic.",
        "We extracted a list of 1 134 foreign words from the TREC 2002 Arabic collection, and passed these to the Google translation engine to obtain their English equivalents.",
        "We manually inspected these and corrected any incorrect translations.",
        "We also removed the 57 words mapped by Google to multiple English words.",
        "These are usually a word and a possible conjunction or preposition.",
        "For example the word ^jiA^Sy (Luxembourg) is transliterated to (For June).",
        "We passed the English list to seven Arabic native speakers and asked them to transliterate each word in the list back into Arabic, even if the word has an Arabic equivalent.",
        "Four of the translators are PhD candidates in the sciences or engineering, and have finished an advanced-level English course; the other three are currently enrolled in an intermediate-level English course.",
        "Participants were asked to type in their transliteration next to each English word.",
        "We noticed that some translit-erators had only basic computing skills, and made many spelling mistakes.",
        "For example, instead of typing the character I, we found that transliterators sometimes mistakenly type J.",
        "We clustered transliterations by the original English words, removed duplicates from each cluster, and also removed 103 clusters where all transliter-ators agreed on the same version of transliteration.",
        "This left 3 582 words in 207 clusters of size 2, 252 clusters of size 3, 192 clusters of size 4, 149 clusters of size 5, 93 clusters of size 6, and 47 clusters of size 7.",

        "Foreign words transliterated into Arabic can appear with multiple spellings, hindering effective recall in a text-retrieval system.",
        "In this work, we have evaluated nine techniques to find such variants.",
        "Edit Distance, Gram Count, Dice, Asoundex-final, Gram Distance, and Longest Common Subsequence are language independent techniques used to find variant names in other languages; Soutex and AEdi-tex are extended techniques to accommodate Arabic Words; and NORM is a novel technique to find OOV variants in Arabic.",
        "We show that these techniques are effective for finding foreign word variants.",
        "The phonetic approaches generally perform better on a collection of newswire text than on a manually transliterated word list, although our Sou-tex algorithm performs well on both datasets.",
        "LCS was the best of the string-similarity techniques, especially with the manually transliterated dataset, and is the most robust choice overall.",
        "The way the transliterated dataset was created affected the results of phonetic approaches; the dataset has many spelling mistakes, with words interpreted differently and often wrongly by users not fluent in English.",
        "Often users only hear these words in the news, and are not even familiar with the spelling of the word in the original language.",
        "To construct a more realistic data set, we could ask Arabic writers to transliterate words from a recording; this would allow pronunciation to be accurately captured by users not fluent in English.",
        "Information retrieval systems must cater for common spelling variants; our results help understand how to identify these in Arabic text."
