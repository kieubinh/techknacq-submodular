        "We discuss in this paper a specific issue related to the definition of a POS tagset for Modern Hebrew, as an example to clarify the method through which such variations can be defined.",
        "It is widely assumed that Hebrew has no syntactic category of modals.",
        "There is, however, an identified class of words which are modal-like in their semantics, and can be characterized through distinct syntactic and morphologic criteria.",
        "We have found wide disagreement among traditional dictionaries on the POS tag attributed to such words.",
        "We describe three main approaches when deciding how to tag such words in Hebrew.",
        "We illustrate the impact of selecting each of these approaches on agreement among human taggers, and on the accuracy of automatic POS taggers induced for each method.",
        "We finally recommend the use of a \"modal\" tag in Hebrew and provide detailed guidelines for this tag.",
        "Our overall conclusion is that tagset definition is a complex task which deserves appropriate methodology."

        "In this paper we address one linguistic issue that was raised while tagging a Hebrew corpus for part of speech (POS) and morphological information.",
        "Our corpus is comprised of short news stories.",
        "It includes roughly 1,000,000 tokens, in articles of typical length between 200 to 1000 tokens.",
        "The articles are written in a relatively simple style, with a high token/word ratio.",
        "Of the full corpus, a sample of articles comprising altogether 100,000 tokens was assembled at random and manually tagged for part of speech.",
        "We employed four students as taggers.",
        "An initial set of guidelines was first composed, relying on the categories found in several dictionaries and on the Penn treebank POS guidelines (San-torini, 1995).",
        "Tagging was done using an automatic tool.",
        "We relied on existing computational lexicons (Segal, 2000; Yona, 2004) to generate candidate tags for each word.",
        "As many words from the corpus were either missing or tagged in a non uniform manner in the lexicons, we recommended looking up missing words in traditional dictionaries.",
        "Disagreement was also found among copyrighted dictionaries, both for open and closed set categories.",
        "Given the lack of a reliable lexicon, the taggers were not given a list of options to choose from, but were free to tag with whatever tag they found suitable.",
        "The process, although slower and bound to produce unintentional mistakes, was used for building a lexicon, and to refine the guidelines and on occasion modify the POS tagset.",
        "When constructing and then amending the guidelines we sought the best trade-off between accuracy and meaningfulness of the categorization, and simplicity of the guidelines, which is important for consistent tagging.",
        "Initially, each text was tagged by four different people, and the guidelines were revised according to questions or disagreements that were raised.",
        "As the guidelines became more stable, the disagreement rate decreased, each text was tagged by three people only and eventually two taggers and a referee that reviewed disagreements between the two.",
        "The disagreement rate between any two taggers was initially as high as 20%, and dropped to 3% after a few rounds of tagging and revising the guidelines.",
        "Major sources of disagreements that were identified, include:",
        "Prepositional phrases vs. prepositions In Hebrew, formative letters - np,:>,2 b,c,l,m - can be attached to a noun to create a short prepositional phrase.",
        "In some cases, such phrases function as a preposition and the original meaning of the noun is not clearly felt.",
        "Some taggers would tag the word as a prepositional prefix + noun, while others tagged it as a preposition, e.g., mipyi b'iqbot (following), that can be tagged as Trapy-2 b-iqbot (in the footsteps of).",
        "Adverbial phrases vs. Adverbs the problem is similar to the one above, e.g.,py>ii bdiyuq (exactly), can be tagged as b-diyuq (with accuracy).",
        "Participles vs. Adjectives as both categories can modify nouns, it is hard to distinguish between them, e.g, o»no 0212 mabat m'ayem (a threatening stare) - the category of o»no m'ayem is unclear.",
        "Another problem, on which the remainder of the article focuses, was a set of words that express modality, and commonly appear before verbs in the infinitive.",
        "Such words were tagged as adjectives or adverbs, and the taggers were systematically uncertain about them.",
        "Beside the disagreement among taggers, there was also significant disagreement among Modern Hebrew dictionaries we examined, as well as computational analyzers and annotated corpora.",
        "Table 1 lists the various selected POS tags for these words, as determined by: (1) Rav Milim (Choueka et al., 1997), (2) Sapir (Avneyon et al., 2002), (3) Even-Shoshan (Even-Shoshan, 2003), (4) Knaani (Knaani, 1960), (5) HMA (Carmel and Maarek, 1999), (6) Segal (Segal, 2000), (7) Yona (Yona, 2004), (8) Hebrew Treebank (Sima'an et al., 2001).",
        "As can be seen, eight different POS tags were suggested by these dictionaries: adjective (29.6%), adveRb (25.9%), Verb (22.2%), Auxilary verb (8.2%), Noun (4.4%), parTicle (3.7%), Preposition (1.5%), and Unknown (4.5%).",
        "The average number of options per word is about 3.3, which is about 60% agreement.",
        "For none of the words there was a comprehensive agreement, and the PoS of only seven words (43.75%) can be determinded by voting (i.e., there is one major option).",
        "In the remainder of the paper, we investigate the existence of a modal category in Modern Hebrew, by analyzing the characteristic of these words, from a morphological, syntactic, semantic and practical point of view.",
        "The decision whether to introduce a modal tag in a Hebrew tagset has practical consequences: we counted that over 3% of the tokens in our 1M token corpus can potentially be tagged as modals.",
        "Beyond this practical impact, the decision process illustrates the relevant method through which a tagset can be derived and fine tuned."

        "This class covers as many as 3% of the tokens observed in our corpus.",
        "Our main motivation in introducing this tag in our tagset is that the alternative (no modal tag) creates confusion and disagreement: we have shown that both traditional dictionaries and previous computational resources had a high level of disagreement over the class of words we tag as modals.",
        "We have confirmed that our guidelines can be applied consistently by human taggers, with agreement level similar to the rest of the tokens (over 99% pairwise).",

        "Finally, the immediate context of modals includes a high proportion of infinitive words.",
        "Infinitive words in Hebrew are particularly ambiguous morphologically, because they begin with the letter l which is a formative letter, and often include the analysis le+ participle, e.g. -iio\\jft can be interpreted, depending on context, as lismwr (to guard), lesamur (to a guarded), or la-samur (to the guarded).",
        "Other ambiguities might occur too, e.g.,ity7 can be interpreted as lasir (to sing), le-sir (to a song), or as la-sir (to the song).",
        "We have measured that on average, infinitive verbs in our expanded corpus can be analyzed in 4.9 distinct manners, whereas the overall average for all word tokens is 2.65.",
        "The identification of modals can serve as an anchor which helps disambiguate neighboring infinitive words."
