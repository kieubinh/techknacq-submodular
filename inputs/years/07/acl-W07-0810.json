        "Sentence alignment consists in mapping sentences of the source language with their translations in the target language.",
        "Automatic sentence alignment approaches face two kinds of difficulties: robustness and accuracy.",
        "A number of automatic sentence alignment techniques have been proposed (Kay and Röscheisen, 1993; Gale and Church, 1991; Brown et al., 1991; Debili and Samouda, 1992; Papageorgiou et al., 1994; Gaussier, 1995; Melamed, 1996; Fluhr et al., 2000).",
        "The method proposed in (Kay and Roscheisen, 1993) is based on the assumption that in order for the sentences in a translation to correspond, the words in them must correspond.",
        "In other words, all necessary information (and in particular, lexical mapping) is derived from the to-be-aligned texts themselves.",
        "1991) , the authors start from the fact that the length of a source text sentence is highly correlated with the length of its target text translation: short sentences tend to have short translations, and long sentences tend to have long translations.",
        "The method proposed in (Debili and Sammouda, 1992) is based on the preliminary alignment of words using a conventional bilingual lexicon and the method described in (Papageorgiou et al., 1994) added grammatical labeling based on the assumption that the same parts of speech tend to be employed in the translation.",
        "In this paper, we present a sentence aligner which is based on a cross-language information retrieval approach and combines different information sources (bilingual lexicon, sentence length and sentence position).",
        "This sentence aligner was first developed for aligning French-English parallel text.",
        "It is now ported to Arabic-French and Arabic-English language pairs.",
        "We present in section 2 the main components of the cross-language search engine, in particular, we will focus on the linguistic processing.",
        "In section 3, the prototype of our sentence aligner is described.",
        "We discuss in section 4 results obtained after aligning sentences of the MD (Monde Diplomatique) corpus of the ARCADE II project.",
        "Section 5 concludes our study and presents our future work."

        "For languages such as Arabic which presents agglutination of articles, prepositions and conjunctions at the beginning of the word as well as pronouns at the ending of the word, we added two other dictionaries for proclitics and enclitics in order to split the input words into proclitics, simple forms and enclitics.",

        ").",
        "• Bilingual dictionaries used in cross-language querying.",

        "• A set of rules for shallow parsing of sentences, extracting compounds from the input text.",
        "• A set of rules for the identification of named entities: gazetteers and contextual rules that use special triggers to identify named entities and their type.",

        "• A Tokenizer which separates the input stream into a graph of words.",

        "If this word is found, it will be associated with its lemma and all its morpho-syntactic tags.",
        "If the word is not found in the general dictionary, it is given a default set of morpho-syntactic tags based on its typography.",

        "and enclitics.",
        "If the simple form computed by the clitic stemmer does not exist in the general dictionary, rewrite rules are applied (Darwish, 2002).",

        "The detection of idiomatic expressions is performed by applying a set of rules that are triggered on specific words and tested on left and right contexts of the trigger.",

        "Non-contiguous expressions such as phrasal verbs in English: \"switch...on\" or \"tomber vaguement dans les pommes\" in French are recognized too.",
        "• A Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagger which searches valid paths through all the possible tags paths using attested trigrams and bigrams sequences.",
        "The trigram and bigram matrices are generated from a manually annotated training corpus (Grefen-stette et al., 2005).",
        "They are extracted from a hand-tagged corpora of 13 200 words for Arabic and 25 000 words for French.",
        "If no continuous trigram full path is found, the POS tagger tries to use bigrams at the points where the trigrams were not found in the matrix.",
        "The accuracy of the part-of-speech tagger is around 91% for Arabic and 94% for French.",
        "• A Syntactic analyzer which is used to split word graph into nominal and verbal chain and recognize dependency relations (especially those within compounds) by using a set of syntactic rules.",
        "We developed a set of dependency relations to link nouns to",
        "other nouns, a noun with a proper noun, a proper noun with the post nominal adjective and a noun with a post nominal adjective.",
        "These relations are restricted to the same nominal chain and are used to compute compound words.",
        "For example, in the nominal chain 5UJ\" (water supply), the syntactic analyzer considers this nominal chain as a compound word (»U*_£Oj3') composed of the words \"to?\"",
        "(supply) and \"»V (water).",
        "• A Named Entity recognizer which uses name triggers (e.g., President, lake, corporation, etc.)",

        "For example, the expression \"oJ^> t> JjVl\" (The first of March) is recognized as a date and the expression jj'JiJl\" (The Middle East) is recognized as a location.",
        "• Eliminating Empty Words consists in identifying words that should not be used as search criteria and eliminating them.",
        "These empty words are identified using only their parts of speech (such as prepositions, articles, punctuations and some adverbs).",
        "• Finally, words are normalized by their lemma.",
        "In the case the word has a set of synonymous lemmas, only one of these lemmas is taken as a normalization.",
        "Each normalized word is associated with its morpho-syntactic tag.",
        "The role of the statistical analysis is to attribute a weight to each word or a compound word according to the information the word or the compound word provides in choosing the document relevant to a query.",
        "This weight is computed by an idf formula (Salton and McGill, 1983).",

        "This weight is used by the comparator to compute the semantic intersection between query and documents containing different words.",
