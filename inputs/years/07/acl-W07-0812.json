        "Base Phrase Chunking (BPC), also known as shallow syntactic parsing, is the process by which adjacent words are grouped together to form non-recursive chunks in a sentence.",
        "The base chunks form phrases such as verb phrases, noun phrases and adjective phrases, etc.",
        "An English example of base phrases is [I]np [would eat]vp [red luscious apples]np [on Sundays]pp .",
        "The BPC task is proving to be an enabling step that is useful to many natural language processing (NLP) applications such as information extraction and semantic role labeling (Hacioglu & Ward, 2003).",
        "In English, these applications have shown robust relative performance when exploiting BPC when compared to using full syntactic parses.",
        "In general, BPC is appealing as an enabling technology since state of the art performance for BPC is higher (F^=1 95.48%) than that for full syntactic parsing (F^=1 90.02% ) in English (Collins, 2000; Kudo & Matsumato, 2000).",
        "Moreover, since BPC had been cast as a classification problem by Ramshaw and Marcus (1995), the task is performed with greater efficiency and is easily portable to new languages in a supervised manner (Diab et al., 2004; Diab et al., 2007).",
        "For Arabic, BPC is especially interesting as it constitutes a viable alternative to full syntactic parsing due to the low performance in Arabic full syntactic parsing (labeled F^=1 = -80% compared to F/3=1=91.44% for BPC) (Bikel, 2004; Diab et al., 2007; Kulick et al., 2006).",
        "In this paper, we present a support vector machine (SVM) based supervised method for Arabic BPC.",
        "The new BPC system achieves an F/ =1 of 96.33% across 10 base phrase chunk types.",
        "We vary the feature sets along two different factors: the usage of explicit morphological features, and the use of different part of speech (POS) tag sets.",
        "We introduce a new enriched POS set for Arabic which comprises 75 POS tags.",
        "The new POS tag set enriches the standard reduced POS tag set (RTS), distributed with the LDC Arabic Treebank (ATB) (Maamouri et al., 2004), by adding definiteness, gender and number information to the basic RTS.",
        "We devise an automatic POS tagger based on the enriched tag set, ERTS.",
        "We use the same unified discriminative model approach to both POS tagging and BPC.",
        "The POS tagging results using ERTS are comparable to state of the art POS tagging using RTS with an accuracy of 96.13% for ERTS and 96.15% for RTS.",
        "However, using the ERTS as a feature in the BPC task, we note an overall significant increase of 1% absolute F^=1 improvement over the usage of RTS alone.",
        "Moreover, we experiment with different explicit morphological features together with the different POS tag sets with no significant improvement.",
        "The paper is laid out as follows: Section 2 discusses state of the art related work in the field of BPC in both English and Arabic; Section 3 illustrates our approach for both POS and BPC in detail; Section 4 presents the experimental setup, results and discussions."

        "These full morphological tags amount to over 2000 tag types (FULL).",
        "As expected, such morphological tags are not very useful for automatic statistical syntactic parsing since they are extremely sparse.",

        "We restricted ERTS to this set of features as they tend to be explicitly marked in the surface form of unvowelized Arabic text.",
        "In ERTS, definiteness is encoded with a present (D) or an absent one.",
        "Gender is encoded with an F or an M, corresponding to Fem and Masc, respectively.",
        "Number is encoded with (Du) for dual or an (S) for plurals or the absence of any marking for singular.",
        "For example, Table 2 illustrates some words with the FULL morphological tag and their corresponding RTS and ERTS definitions.",
        "Our approach: ERTS comprises 75 tags.",
        "For the current system, only 57 tags are instantiated.",

        "We adopt the YAMCHA sequence model based on the TinySVM classifier.",
