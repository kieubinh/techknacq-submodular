        "Stemming is the process of reducing morphological variants of a word into a common form.",
        "For morphologically less complex languages like English or Swedish, this usually involves removal of suffixes.",
        "For languages like Amharic or Arabic, that have a much richer morphology, this process also involves dealing with prefixes, infixes and derivatives in addition to the suffixes.",
        "Stemming is widely used in IR, with the assumption that morphological variants represent similar meaning.",
        "It is applied during indexing and is used to reduce the vocabulary size, and it is used during query processing in order to ensure similar representation as that of the document collection.",
        "In cross language information retrieval (CLIR) where a query is typically posed in one language, and the document collection from where the documents are retrieved is in another language, some form of translation is required.",
        "For low resource languages such as Amharic, machine readable dictionaries (MRDs) play a crucial role by enabling look up of translations of query terms.",
        "In most cases such MRDs have all entries represented only by their citation form.",
        "Thus in CLIR applications, it is of outmost importance that query terms in the source language are reduced to the exact corresponding citation form as presented in the MRD.",
        "In this paper we address this particular problem of stemming Amharic words and reducing them to their citation forms for CLIR applications.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.",
        "Section 2 provides a background information about the Amharic language, followed by related work in Section 3 and a brief description of Amharic morphology in Section 4.",
        "Section 5 presents the resources utilized, while Section 6 deals with a detailed description of the stemmer.",
        "In section 7 we describe experiments conducted to evaluate the performance of the stemmer and discuss the obtained results.",
        "We give concluding remarks in Section 8."

      "text": [
        "Amharic is the official working language of the federal government of the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and is estimated to be spoken by well over 20 million people as a first or second language.",
        "Amharic is the second most spoken Semitic language in the world (after Arabic).",
        "It is today probably the second largest language in Ethiopia (after Oromo, a Cushitic language) and possibly one of the five largest languages on the African continent.",
        "Following the Constitution drafted in 1993, Ethiopia is divided into nine fairly independent regions, each with it's own nationality language.",
        "However, Amharic is the language for countrywide communication and was also for a long period the principal literal language and medium of instruction in primary and secondary schools of the country, while higher education is carried out in English.",
        "Despite it's wide speaker population, computational linguistic resources for Amharic, as most 'low resource' languages, are very limitted and almost non existent.",
        "Written Amharic uses a unique script which has originated from the Ge'ez alphabet (the liturgical language of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church).",
        "Written Ge'ez can be traced back to at least the 4th century A.D.",
        "The first versions of the language included consonants only, while the characters in later versions represent consonant-vowel (CV) phoneme pairs.",
        "In the modern Ethiopic script each syllable pattern comes in seven different forms (called orders), reflecting the seven vowel sounds.",
        "The first order is the basic form; the other orders are derived from it by more or less regular modifications indicating the different vowels.",
        "There are 33 basic forms, giving 7*33 syllable patterns (syllographs), or fidels.",
        "Two of the base forms represent vowels in isolation, but the rest are for consonants (or semi-vowels classed as consonants) and thus correspond to CV pairs, with the first order being the base symbol with no explicit vowel indicator.",
        "The writing system also includes four (incomplete, five-character) orders of labialised velars and 24 additional labialised consonants.",
        "In total, there are 275 fidels, but not all the letters of the Amharic script are strictly necessary for the pronunciation patterns of the spoken language; some were simply inherited from Ge'ez without having any semantic or phonetic distinction in modern Amharic.",
        "There are many cases where numerous symbols are used to denote a single phoneme, as well as words that have extremely different orthographic form and slightly distinct phonetics, but with the same meaning.",
        "So are, for example, most labialised consonants basically redundant, and there are actually only 39 context-independent phonemes (monophones): of the 275 symbols of the script, only about 233 remain if the redundant ones are removed.",
        "The script also has a unique set of punctuation marks and digits.",
        "Unlike Arabic or Hebrew, the language is written from left to right.",
        "The Amharic writing system uses multitudes of ways to denote compound words and there is no agreed upon spelling standard for compounds.",
        "As a result of this - and of the size of the country leading to vast dialectal dispersion - lexical variation and homophony is very common."

        "Pioneering the work on morphological analysis of Amharic verbs, Abiyot (Bayou, 2000) designed and implemented a prototype word parser for Amharic verbs and their derivation.",
        "He designed a knowledge-based system that parses verbs, and nouns derived from verbs.",
        "He used root pattern and affixes to determine the lexical and inflectional category of the words.",
        "He tested his system on a limited number of words (200 verbs and 200 nouns) and the result showed that 86% of the verbs and 84% of the nouns were recognized correctly.",
        "Another prototype morphological analyzer for Amharic was developed by Tesfaye Bayu (Bayu, 2002) where he used an unsupervised learning approach based on probabilistic models to extract morphemic components (prefix, stem and suffix) to construct a morphological dictionary.",
        "He also investigated an approach whereby he applied the principle of Auto segmental Phonology to identify morphemic component of a stem such as consonantal root, vocalic melodies and CV-templates.",
        "The first system was able to parse successfully 87% of words of the test data (433 of 500 words).",
        "This result corresponds to a precision of 95% and a recall of 90%.",
        "Tested with 255 stems, the second system identified the morphemic compo-nentes of 241 (or 94% of the) stems correctly.",
        "Fissaha and Haller (Fissaha and Haller, 2003) discuss the morphology of Amharic verbs in the context of Machine Translation and present an implemetation of a morphological analyser for Amharic using Xerox Finite State Tools (XFST).",
        "The different classification shemes for Amharic verbs that have been forwarded are discussed followed by the implication such classifications have on the implementation strategy.",
        "They claim that morphological analysis for Amharic with XFST can handle most of the morphologcal phenomena except some derivation processes which involve simultaneous application of both stem interdigitation and reduplication.",
        "Saba and Gibbon (Amsalu and Gibbon, 2005) extend the XFST implementation of Amharic morpholgy to include all word categories.",
        "Testing with 1620 words text from an Amharic bible, they report recall levels of 94% for verbs, 85% for nouns, and 88% for adjectives while they report precisions of 94% for nouns, 81% for adjectives, 91% for adverbs, and 54% for verbs, at the above specified recall levels.",
        "A more recent work that applies Conditional Random Fields to segment and part of speech tag Amharic words is done by Fissaha (Adafre, 2005).",
        "He reports an accuracy of 84% for the word segmentation.",
        "The work deals with bound morphemes of prepositions, conjunctions, relative markers, auxiliary verbs, nagation marker and coordinate conjunction, but leaves out other bound morphemes such as definite article, agreement features such as gender and number, case markers, etc, and considers them to be part of the word.",
        "The best result (84%) is obtained by using character, morphological and lexical features.",
        "There has been a work done by Alemayehu and Willet (Alemayehu and Willett, 2002) which investigates the effectiveness of stemming in information retrieval for Amharic.",
        "They compare performance of word-based, stem-based, and root-based retrieval of 40 Amharic queries against 548 Amharic documents, and show better recall levels for stem and root based retrieval over word based, but they don't provide information on the precision of these experiments.",
        "All the above mentioned works attempt to address the need to develop a morphological analyser for Amharic, and show that there has been a great deal of effort put in the design and implementation of each system.",
        "Although that is the case, none of them are publicly available, and/or are limitted in some way.",
        "For our current task of stemming for the purpose of CLIR dictionary lookup, full fledged morphological analysis is most likely an overkill since we only need citation forms of words, and precision plays a very important role."

        "Amharic nouns can be inflected for gender, number, definiteness, and case, although gender is usually neutral.",

        "The definte article in Amharic is also a bound morpheme, and attaches to the end of a noun.",
        "We have given a very brief description of some aspects of Amharic morphology, detailed information can be found in (Bender, 1968), (Bender and Fulas, 1978), (Yimam, 1995).",

        "We have presented the design and development of an Amharic stemmer which reduces words to their citation forms for the purpose of dictionary lookup in CLIR.",
        "Given the resource constraints we have, and the specificity of the stemmer, the overall performance could be acceptable, but needs further im-provment.",
        "The stemming depends highly on word entries in the three MRDs for verification purposes.",
        "These MRDs altogether consist of a limitted amount of entries, overall 83000, with a very high level of overlap, leaving 47176 unique entries.",
        "Although itis not the largest source of error, it accounts for around 15% of the words segmentation decided on corpus statististics only since they are not found in the dictionaries.",
        "We intend to use more dictionaries with the assumption that there will be a performance increase with the increasing number of citation forms to refer to.",
        "On the other hand, increasing the amount of citation forms also will increase the percentage of words that will have more than one match in the dictionaries.",
        "That would lead us to focus on the disambiguation strategy in the future.",
        "So long as the morphological rule exists, we are able to get the correct segmentation for a word in a possible segmentations list.",
        "And when we have two or more likely segmentations that are picked out since they have matching stems in dictionaries, we need to design a smarter way of disambiguation that would take into account contextual information and part of speech tags, etc, in addition to the currently used occurence frequency approach.",
        "Although conducting a full fledged morphological analyser for Amharic is beyond the scope of this paper, we would like to note that there is a need to create a forum for collaboration and exchange among researchers involved in developing NLP resources for Amharic and other Semitic languages and organize the considerable effort that is being made individually.",
        "We also hope that some of the ideas and procedures that are described in this paper could be more generally applicable to other Semitic languages as well."
