        "Litteraturbanken <http://litteraturbanken.se/> (the Swedish Literature Bank) is a cultural heritage project financed by the Swedish Academy.",
        "Littera-turbanken has as its aim to make available online the full text of significant works of Swedish literature, old and new, in critical editions suitable for literary research and for the teaching of literature.",
        "There is also abundant ancillary material on the website, such as author presentations, bibliographies, thematic essays about authorships, genres or periods, written by experts in each field.",
        "Similarly to many other literature digitization initiatives, most of the works in Litteraturbanken are such for which copyright has expired (i.e., at least 70 years have passed since the death of the author); at present the bulk of the texts are from the 18th, 19th and early 20th century.",
        "However, there is also an agreement with the organizations representing authors' intellectual property rights, allowing the inclusion of modern works according to a uniform royalty payment scheme.",
        "At present, Lit-teraturbanken holds about 150 works - mainly novels - by about 50 different authors.",
        "The text collection is slated to grow by 80-100 novel-length works (appr.",
        "4-6 million words) annually.",
        "1 The present permanent version of Litteraturbanken was preceded by a two-year pilot project by the same name, funded by the Bank of Sweden Tercentenary Foundation.",
        "Even at outset of the Litteraturbanken project, it was decided to design the technical solutions with language technology in mind.",
        "The rationale for this was that we saw these literary texts not only as representing Sweden's literary heritage, but also as high-grade empirical data for linguistic investigations, i.e. as corpus components.",
        "Hence, we wanted to build an infrastructure for Litteraturbanken which would allow this intended dual purpose of the material to be realized to the fullest.",
        "However, we soon started to think about how the kinds of annotations that language technology could provide could be of use to others than linguists, e.g. literary scholars, historians and researchers in other fields in the humanities and social sciences.",
        "Here, we will focus on one of these annotation types, namely NER and entity annotation.",
        "Combined with suitable interfaces for displaying, searching, selecting, correlating and browsing named entities, we believe that the recognition and annotation of named entities in Litteraturbanken will facilitate more advanced research on literature (particularly in the field of literary onomastics; see Dalen-Oskam and Zundert, 2004), but also, e.g., historians could find this facility useful, insofar as these fictional narratives also contain, e.g. descriptions of real locations, characterizations of real contemporary public figures, etc.",
        "Flanders et al.",
        "(1998: 285) argue that references to people in historical sources are of intrinsic interest since they may reveal \"networks of friendship, enmity, and collaboration; familial relationships; and political alliances [...] class position, intellectual affiliations, and literary bent of the author\"."

        "For a concise overview of the technology see Borthwick,",
        "2 This precluded the use of ready-made digital library or CMS solutions, as we wanted to be compatible with emerging standards for language resources and tools, e.g. TEI/(X)CES and ISO TC37/SC07, which to our knowledge has never been a consideration in the design of digital library or CM systems.",
        "(1999).",
        "Even though this technology is widely used in a number of domains, studies dealing with historical corpora are mostly comparatively recent (see for instance the recent workshop on historical text mining; <http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/events/htm06/>).",
        "Shoemaker (2005) reports on how the Old Bailey Proceedings, which contain accounts of trials that took place at the Old Bailey, the primary criminal court in London, between 1674 and 1834, was marked up for a number of semantic categories, including the crime date and location, the defendant's gender, the victim's name etc.",
        "Most of the work was done manually while support was provided for automatic person name identification (cf. Bontcheva et al., 2002).",

        "The quality of their results vary for different entity types, from 99.3% precision for Streets to 57.5% precision for Products.",
        "The authors suggest the kinds of knowledge that digital libraries need to assemble as part of their machine readable reference collections in order to support entity identification as a core service, namely, the need for bigger authority lists, more refined rule sets and rich knowledge sources as training data.",

        "The nature and type of named entities vary depending on the task under investigation or the target application.",
        "In any case, personal names, location and organization names are considered \"generic\".",
        "Since semantic annotation is not as well understood as grammatical annotation, there is no consensus on a standard tagset and content to be generally applicable.",
        "Recently, however, there have been attempts to define and apply richer name hierarchies for various tasks, both specific (Fleisch-man and Hovy, 2002) and generic (Sekine, 2004).",

        "The temporal expressions recognized include both relative (nasta vecka 'next week') and absolute expressions (klockan 8 pa morgonen i dag '8 o'clock in the morning today'), and sets or sequences of time points or stretches of time (varje dag 'every day').",
        "The rule-based component of the person-name recognition grammar is based on a large set of designator words and a group of phrases and verbal predicates that most probably require an animate subject (e.g. beratta 'to tell', fundera 'to think', trottna 'to become tired').",
        "These are used in conjunction with orthographic markers in the text, such as capitalization, for the recognition of personal names.",
        "In this work, we consider the first group (designators) as relevant knowledge to be extracted from the person name recognizer, which is explored for the annotation of animate instances in the literary texts.",
        "The designators are implemented as a separate module in the current pipeline, and constitute a piece of information which is considered important for a wide range of tasks (cf Orasan and Evans, 2001).",
        "The designators are divided into four groups: designators that denote the nationality or the ethnic/racial group of a person (e.g. tysken 'the German [person]'); designators that denote a profession (e.g. lakaren 'the doctor'); those that denote family ties and relationships (e.g. svarson 'son in law'); and finally a group that indicates a human individual but cannot be unambiguously categorized into any of the three other groups (e.g. patienten 'the patient').",
        "Apart from this grouping, inherent qualities, for at least a large group of the designators, (internal evidence/morphological cues) also indicate referent (natural) gender.",
        "In this way, the animacy annotation is further specified for male, female or unknown gender; unknown in this context means unresolved or ambiguous, such as barn 'child'.",
        "Swedish is a compounding language and compound words are written as a single orthographic unit (i.e. solid compounds).",
        "This fact makes the recognition of animacy straightforward with minimal resources and feasible by the use of a set of suitable headwords, and by capturing modifiers by simple regular expressions.",
        "Approximately 25 patterns are enough to identify the vast majority of animate entities in a text; patterns such as \"inna/innan/innor\", \"man/rnannen/man/mannen\", \"log/logen/loger\", \"ktor/ktoren/ktorer\" and \"iker/ikern/ikerna\".",
        "For instance, the pattern in (1) consists of a reliable suffix \"inna\" which is a typical designator for female individuals, preceded by a set of obligatory strings and an optional regular expression which captures a long list of compounds (2).",

        "Although there is a large overlap between the names in the texts and the gazetteer lists, there were cases that could be considered as entity candidates but were left unmarked.",
        "This is because exhaustive lists of names even for limited domains are hard to obtain, and, in some domains even difficult to manage.",
        "Therefore, we also calculated the orthographic similarity between such words and the gazetteer content, according to the following criteria: a potential entity starts with a capital letter; it is > 5 characters long; it is not part of any other annotation and it does not stand in the beginning of a sentence.",
        "We have empirically observed that the length of 5 characters is a reliable threshold, unlikely to exclude many NEs.",
        "As a matter of fact, only two such cases could be found in the evaluation sample, namely atten Puff 'the family Puff and \"Yen-\" in the context \"Yen- kenberg\"",
        "As measure of orthographic similarity (or rather, difference) we used the Levenshtein distance (LD; also known as edit distance) between two strings.",

        "Although the Swedish system is mainly rule-based, using a handcrafted grammar for each entity group, it can also be considered a hybrid system in the sense that it applies a document-centered approach (DCA) to entity annotation, which is a different paradigm compared to the local context approach, called external evidence by McDonald (1996).",

        "This implies a form of online learning from the document being processed where unambiguous usages are used for assigning annotations to ambiguous words, and information for disambiguation is derived from the entire document.",

        "However, we have observed that there are problems with entities composed of more than a single word, particularly within the group Work&Art, which can produce conflicting information, if we allow the individual words in such content (often nouns or adjectives) to be reapplied in the text.",
        "For instance, the name of the novel Syster och bror occurred 32 times in one of the evaluation texts (Almqvist's Collected Works Volume 29).",
        "If we allow the individual words that constitute the title, Syster, och and bror to be reapplied in the text as individual words (2 common nouns and a conjunction), then we would have degraded the precision considerably since we would have allowed Work&Art annotations for irrelevant words.",

        "In this paper we have described the application of a generic Swedish named entity recognition system to a number of literary texts, novels from the 19th century, part of Litteraturbanken, the Swedish Literature Bank.",
        "We evaluated the results of the named entity recognition and identified a number of error sources which we tried to resolve and then introduce changes that would cover for such cases in the rule-based component of the system, in order to increase its performance (precision and recall) during a second evaluation round.",
        "Entity annotations open up a whole new research spectrum for new kinds of qualitative and quantitative exploitations of literary and historical texts, allowing more semantically-oriented exploration of the textual content.",
        "In the near future, we will annotate and evaluate a larger sample and possibly integrate machine learning techniques in order to improve the results even more.",
        "We are also working to integrate the handling of named entity annotations into Litteraturbanken's search and browsing interfaces and hope to be able to conduct our first demonstrations and tests with users later this year."
