        "Recently, many on-line digital libraries have been publishing large quantities of digitized ancient handwritten documents, which allows the general public to access this kind of cultural heritage resources.",
        "This is a new, comfortable way of consulting and querying this material.",
        "The Biblioteca Valenciana Digital (BiValDi) is an example of one such digital library, which provides an interesting collection of handwritten documents.",
        "This work has been supported by the EC (FEDER), the Spanish MEC under grant TIN2006-15694-C02-01, and by the Consellerta d'Empresa, Universitat i Ciencia - Generalitat Valenciana under contract GV06/252.",
        "Several of these handwritten documents include both, the handwritten material and its proper transcription (in ASCII format).",
        "This fact has motivated the development of methodologies to align these documents and their transcripts; i.e. to generate a mapping between each word image on a document page with its respective ASCII word on its transcript.",
        "This word by word alignment would allow users to easily find the place of a word in the manuscript when reading the corresponding transcript.",
        "For example, one could display both the handwritten page and the transcript and whenever the mouse is held over a word in the transcript, the corresponding word in the handwritten image would be outlined using a box.",
        "In a similar way, whenever the mouse is held over a word in the handwritten image, the corresponding word in the transcript would be highlighted (see figure 1).",
        "This kind of alignment can help paleography experts to quickly locate image text while reading a transcript, with useful applications to editing, indexing, etc.",
        "In the opposite direction, the alignment can also be useful for people trying to read the image text directly, when arriving to complex or damaged parts of the document.",
        "Creating such alignments is challenging since the transcript is an ASCII text file while the manuscript page is an image.",
        "Some recent works address this problem by relying on a previous explicit image-processing based word pre-segmentation of the page image, before attempting the transcription alignments.",
        "For example, in (Kornfield et al., 2004), the set of previously segmented word images and their corresponding transcriptions are transformed into two different times series, which are aligned",
        "Figure 1: Screen-shot of the alignment prototype interface displaying an outlined word (using a box) in the manuscript (left) and the corresponding highlighted word in the transcript (right).",
        "using dynamic time warping (DTW).",
        "In this same direction, (Huang and Srihari, 2006), in addition to the word pre-segmentation, attempt a (rough) recognition of the word images.",
        "The resulting word string is then aligned with the transcription using dynamic programming.",
        "The alignment method presented here (henceforward called Viterbi alignment), relies on the Viterbi decoding approach to handwritten text recognition (HTR) based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) (Bazzi et al., 1999; Toselli et al., 2004).",
        "These techniques are based on methods originally introduced for speech recognition (Jelinek, 1998).",
        "In such HTR systems, the alignment is actually a byproduct of the proper recognition process, i.e. an implicit segmentation of each text image line is obtained where each segment successively corresponds to one recognized word.",
        "In our case, word recognition is not actually needed, as we do already have the correct transcription.",
        "Therefore, to obtain the segmentations for the given word sequences, the so-called \"forced-recognition\" approach is employed (see section 2.2).",
        "This idea has been previously explored in (Zimmermann and Bunke, 2002).",
        "Alignments can be computed line by line in cases where the beginning and end positions of lines are known or, in a more general case, for whole pages.",
        "We show line-by-line results on a set of 53 pages from the \"Cristo-Salvador\" handwritten document (see section 5.2).",
        "To evaluate the quality of the obtained alignments, two metrics were used whichgive information at different alignment levels: one measures the accuracy of alignment mark placements and the other measures the amount of erroneous as-",
        "Figure 2: Example of 5-states HMM modeling (feature vectors sequences) of instances of the character \"a\" within the Spanish word \"cuarenta\" (forty).",
        "The states are shared among all instances of characters of the same class.",

        "signments produced between word images and transcriptions (see section 4).",
        "The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.",

        "HMM-based handwritten text recognition is briefly outlined in this section, followed by a more detailed presentation of the Viterbi alignment approach.",
        "The traditional handwritten text recognition problem can be formulated as the problem of finding a most likely word sequence w = (wi, w2,..., wn), for a given handwritten sentence (or line) image represented by a feature vector sequence x = x\\ = (x\\, x2,..., xp), that is:",
        "where Pr(x|w) is usually approximated by concatenated character Hidden Markov Models whereas Pr(w) is approximated typically by an n-gram word language model (Jelinek, 1998).",
        "Thus, each character class is modeled by a continuous density left-to-right HMM, characterized by a set of states and a Gaussian mixture per state.",
        "The Gaussian mixture serves as a probabilistic law to model the emission of feature vectors by each HMM state.",

        "character \"a\".",
        "The process to obtain feature vector sequences from text images as well as the training of HMMs are explained in section 3.",
        "HMMs as well as n-grams models can be represented by stochastic finite state networks (SFN), which are integrated into a single global SFN by replacing each word character of the n-gram model by the corresponding HMM.",
        "The search involved in the equation (1) to decode the input feature vectors sequence x into the more likely output word sequence w, is performed over this global SFN.",
        "This search problem is adequately solved by the Viterbi algorithm (Jelinek, 1998).",
        "As a byproduct of the Viterbi solution to (1), the feature vectors subsequences of x aligned with each of the recognized words wi; w2,..., wn can be obtained.",
        "These implicit subsequences can be visualized into the equation (1) as follows:",
        "w = arg max where b is an alignment; that is, an ordered sequence of n + 1 marks (b0, bi;..., bn), used to demarcate the subsequences belonging to each recognized word.",
        "The marks b0 and bn always point out to the first and last components of x (see figure 3).",
        "Now, approximating the sum in (2) by the dominant term:",
        "where b is the optimal alignment.",
        "In our case, we are not really interested in proper text recognition because the transcription is known beforehand.",
        "Let w be the given transcription.",

      "text": [
        "The implementation of the alignment prototype involved four different parts: document image preprocessing, line image feature extraction, HMMs training and alignment map generation.",
        "Document image preprocessing encompasses the following steps: first, skew correction is carried out on each document page image; then background removal and noise reduction is performed by applying a bi-dimensional median filter (Kavalliera-tou and Stamatatos, 2006) on the whole page image.",
        "Next, a text line extraction process based on local minimums of the horizontal projection profile of page image, divides the page into separate line images (Marti and Bunke, 2001).",
        "In addition connected components has been used to solve the situations where local minimum values are greater than zero, making impossible to obtain a clear text line separation.",
        "Finally, slant correction and non-linear size normalization are applied (Toselli et al., 2004; Romero et al., 2006) on each extracted line image.",
        "An example of extracted text line image is shown in the top panel of figure 3, along with the resulting deslanted and size-normalized image.",
        "Note how non-linear normalization leads to reduced sizes of ascenders and descenders, as well as to a thiner underline of the word \"ciudadanos\".",
        "As our alignment prototype is based on Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), each preprocessed line image is represented as a sequence of feature vectors.",
        "To do this, the feature extraction module applies a grid to divide line image into N x M squared cells.",
        "In this work, N = 40 is chosen empirically (using the corpus described further on) and M must satisfy the condition M/N = original image aspect ratio.",
        "From each cell, three features are calculated: normalized gray level, horizontal gray level derivative and vertical gray level derivative.",
        "The way these three features are determined is described in (Toselli et al., 2004).",
        "Columns of cells or frames are processed from left to right and a feature vector is constructed for each frame by stacking the three features computed in its constituent cells.",
        "Hence, at the end of this process, a sequence of M 120-dimensional feature vectors (40 normalized gray-level components, 40 horizontal and 40 vertical derivatives components) is obtained.",
        "An example of feature vectors sequence, representing an image of the Spanish word \"cuarenta\" (forty) is shown in figure 2.",
        "As it was explained in section 2.1, characters are modeled by continuous density left-to-right HMMs with 6 states and 64 Gaussian mixture components per state.",
        "This topology (number of HMM states and Gaussian densities per state) was determined by tuning empirically the system on the corpus described in section 5.1.",
        "Once a HMM \"topology\" has been adopted, the model parameters can be easily trained from images of continuously handwritten text (without any kind of segmentation) accompanied by the transcription of these images into the corresponding sequence of characters.",
        "This training process is carried out using a well known instance of the EM algorithm called forward-backward or Baum-Welch re-estimation (Jelinek, 1998).",
        "The last phase in the alignment process is the generation of the mapping proper by means of Viterbi \"forced recognition\", as discussed in section 2.2."
