        "Furthermore, subject terms associated with hierarchical and faceted thesaural senses promise to further improve precision in image access.",
        "Such terms map to standardized thesaurus records that include the term's preferred, variant, and related names, including both broader and specific concepts, and other related concepts.",
        "This information can then be filtered, linked, and subsequently tested for usefulness in performing richer image access.",
        "As with other research on disambiguation, our hypothesis is that accurate assignment of senses to metadata index terms will results in higher precision for searchers.",
        "This hypothesis will be fully tested as we incorporate the disambiguation module in our end-to-end CLiMB Toolkit, and as we perform user studies.",
        "Finding subject terms and mapping them to a thesaurus is a time-intensive task for catalogers (Rasmussen 1997, Ferguson and Intner 1998).",

        "In this paper, our primary focus is on task (i); we handle task (ii) with a simple ranking approach; we do not address task (iii).",

        "We have shown that it is possible to create an automated program to perform word sense disambiguation in a field with specialized vocabulary.",
        "Such an application could have great potential in rapid development of metadata for digital collections.",
        "Still, much work must be done in order to integrate our disambiguation program into the CLiMB Toolkit, including the following:",
        "(1) Our algorithm's disambiguation accuracy is between 48-55% (Table 5 and Table 6), and so there is room for improvement in the algorithm.",
        "Currently we depend on an external program (SenseRelate) to perform much of the disambiguation (Table 7).",
        "Furthermore, SenseRelate maps terms to WordNet and we then map the WordNet sense to an AAT sense.",
        "This extra step is overhead, and it causes errors in our algorithm.",
        "We can either explore the option of reimplementing concepts behind SenseRelate to directly map terms to the AAT, or we may need to find additional approaches to employ hybrid techniques (including machine learning) for disambiguation.",
        "At the same time, we may benefit from the fact that WordNet, as a general resource, is domain independent and thus offers wider coverage.",
        "We will need to explore the trade-off in precision between different configurations using these different resources.",
        "(2) We need more and better groundtruth.",
        "Our current data set of noun phrases includes term like favor, kind, and certain aspects.",
        "These terms are unlikely to be used as meaningful subject terms by a cataloger and will never be mapped to AAT.",
        "Thus, we need to develop reliable heuristics to determine which noun phrases are potentially high value subject index terms.",
        "A simple frequency count does not achieve this purpose.",
        "Currently we are evaluating based on ground-truth that our project members created.",
        "Instead, we would like to extend the study to a wider set of image catalogers as labelers, since they will be the primary users of the CLiMB tool.",
        "Image catalogers have experience in finding subject terms and mapping subject terms to the AAT.",
        "They can also help determine which terms are high quality subject terms.",
        "In contrast to working with the highly experienced image cataloger, we also want to extend the study to include various groups with different user needs.",
        "For example, journalists have ongoing needs for images, and they tend to search by subject.",
        "Using participants like these for markup and evaluation promises to provide comparative results, ones which will enable us to effectively reach a broad audience.",
        "We also would like to test our algorithm on more collections.",
        "This will help us ascertain what kind of improvements or additions would make CLiMB a more general tool."
