        "Cultural Heritage Institutions are the keepers of large collections of data.",
        "To optimize the core tasks of indexing and searching through these collections, controlled vocabularies like thesauri are often used.",
        "These vocabularies are structured concept networksand help indexers to select proper subjects for description, and users to formulate queries or to browse collections using the concepts that appear in the metadata.",
        "The Netherlands Institute for Sound and Vision, for example, uses the gtaa thesaurus for indexing public radio and TV programs - gtaa is a Dutch abbreviation for \"Common Thesaurus [for] Audiovisual Archives\".",
        "Its hierarchy of subjects contains about 3800 Preferred Terms and 2000 Non Preferred terms.",
        "A second example is the gtt thesaurus, which contains 35000 concepts, gathering 50000 preferred and non-preferred Dutch terms.",
        "This thesaurus is used to index and retrieve books from the Dutch National Library - gtt is a Dutch abbreviation for \"goo keyword thesaurus\", goo referring to the Joint Subject Indexing system used by many Dutch libraries.",
        "Besides this classic scenario, thesauri can also allow for (semi-)automatic optimization of search processes, like query expansion exploiting their hierarchical structure.",
        "But the available structure might not be rich and regular enough for such purposes.",
        "In fact, it has been shown that a mapping to a richer and sounder terminology, like the English WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), would enable more sophisticated query expansion or other inferencing possibilities (Voorhees, 1994; Hollink, 2006).",
        "This will become especially true now that WordNet exists in the form of an RDF ontology (van Assem et al., 2006).",
        "Mapping Cultural Heritage controlled vocabularies in Dutch to WordNet can also be beneficial for sharing information across institutions, which is difficult when the metadata attached to the different documents come from different thesauri.",
        "This issue can be solved by building equivalence links between the elements from these different vocabularies, as in (van Gendt et al., 2006).",
        "This vocabulary alignment problem is comparable to the ontology matching one, and techniques similar to the ones developed by the Semantic Web research community can be applied here.",
        "As found e.g. in (Euzenat, 2004), the existing methods are quite diverse, and proposed strategies often mix several individual techniques:",
        "• lexical techniques, trying to compare the labels found in vocabularies;",
        "• structural techniques, assessing similarities between concepts from the structure of vocabularies (e.g. hierarchical links);",
        "• instance-based techniques, looking at the objects that are actually populating the ontologies to infer from their similarities correspondences between the concepts they instantiate.",
        "• techniques making use of some background knowledge source, by trying to derive from the information found there relations between the elements from the original vocabularies.",
        "Here, we are interested in the last kind of techniques.",
        "In these approaches, concepts from the vocabularies to be aligned are first attached - \"anchored\" to the concepts from a third vocabulary (Aleksovski, 2006).",
        "Then, these anchors in the background vocabulary are compared together.",
        "When a relation is found between them, a similar relation can be inferred between the elements from the vocabularies to be aligned.",
        "This is especially interesting when the lexical overlap between the vocabularies is low or when the vocabularies are quite poorly structured: it is expected then that the background knowledge will alleviate these shortcomings.",
        "The choice of this knowledge is therefore crucial, and WordNet, which has a rich structure and a broad coverage, has been exploited in many existing alignment methods (Giunchiglia et al., 2005; Castano et al., 2005).",
        "For these reasons - even if this paper will only focus on the alignment scenario - we wanted to experiment the anchoring of two aforementioned Dutch thesauri to WordNet.",
        "Unlike literature about linking English thesauri to WordNet, we propose in this paper an anchoring method for vocabularies in other languages, and experiment it on these two thesauri, testing its usefulness in terms of possibilities for vocabulary alignment.",
        "The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we present the general anchoring methodology.",
        "The anchoring experiment is described in section 3: first the gtaa case (section 3.1) and then the gtt one (section 3.2), as a reusability test.",
        "We evaluate the two anchoring processes in section 3.3 and conclude on general reflexions about this method.",
        "Then, we show examples of such anchorings in the context of a possible alignment between gtaa and gtt in section 4.",
        "We conclude on perspectives to this research in section 5."

        "The anchoring experiment presented in this paper is based on a comparison of lexical descriptions of the thesaurus terms with the ones of WordNet synsets, the glosses: WordNet is a lexical database of English, which entries are grouped \"into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept\".",
        "In contrast to many anchoring methods, like the one in (Khan and Hovy, 1997), we do not compare the terms from our thesauri to the labels of synsets, but measure the lexical overlap of their descriptions.",
        "The same approach has already been followed, for example, by (Knight and Luk, 1994).",
        "As the thesauri we focus on in this paper are in Dutch, we first need to map their terms to English descriptions, and possibly translations, to make a comparison with the English glosses.",
        "Given the fact that these thesauri cover a broad range of topics, we hypothesize that using a general language bilingual dictionary will lead to a good coverage of their content.",
        "Additionally, it might give on top of the definitions - i.e. the natural language descriptions of a term's meaning - useful information such as term translations and Part Of Speech (POS) tags - their grammatical category: noun, verb, etc.",
        "For each thesaurus term which has been associated to an English definition, the rest of the anchoring procedure consists in checking the overlap between the lexical content of the definitions and the one of the different WordNet glosses, considered as bags of words.",
        "The hypothesis is that the closest gloss should give us a pointer to a synset semantically equivalent to the intended meaning of a thesaurus term."

        "First step: Finding English definitions for GTAA terms The first step in mapping Dutch terms from the GTAA to WordNet was to select an online dictionary that would cover a significant part of the thesaurus entries and that would allow automatic queries for these terms.",
        "We have tested the bilingual dictionary LookWAYup, which returned a 2222 results definitions and translations - on our query set.",
        "This query set consisted in the list of GTAA Preferred terms (3800), Non preferred terms (2000) and their singular forms (3200).",
        "These singular forms were computed in the context of a MultimediaN project, on the basis of linguistic derivational rules and a manual correction.",
        "Given the fact that most of the thesaurus terms are in plural form, but not all of them, and knowing that the dictionary entries are only standard lemma forms (most of the time in singular), we first assumed that queries on the dictionary with a plural form would not generate a result, and simply added the singular forms to the singular ones in the query set.",
        "It turned out that the dictionary gave result for some plural forms, creating noise: some plural forms corresponded to lemmas of verbs, and a spelling correction facility provided definitions for some plural forms.",
        "Removing doubles We cleaned manually the first set of errors, and automatically the last one, based on POS tag information.",
        "In the future, we will avoid introducing duplicate lemmas in our the query set.",
        "After cleaning, 1748 terms had one or more translation in English together with their associated POS tag(s) and definition(s).",
        "This low number, compared with the original set of 5800 distinct thesaurus terms can be explained by the fact that our vocabulary contains numerous multi-words terms and also compound entries, both of which are rarely dictionary entries.",
        "We discuss possible solutions to this shortcoming in section 3.3.",
        "POS tag-based cleaning We did then a rough manual evaluation of these candidate definitions.",
        "The evaluation was conducted by three people and took about one day each.",
        "It turned out that some of the definitions were irrelevant for our task: the Dutch Bij was associated with the English Bee and Honey bee, but also with the preposition by.",
        "We used again the information given by the POS tag to remove these irrelevant definitions: we kept only definitions of Nouns and (relevant) Verbs.",
        "After this last cleaning, some terms still had more then one definition.",
        "Cleaning based on thesaurus relationships We used the hierarchical relationship in the thesaurus to check the intended meaning of these terms: for example, Universiteit (University) had a Broader Term relationship with Wetenschappelijk onderwijs (Scientific education), so its meaning is restricted to the \"Educational aspect\", and it should not be used to describe TV programs about University buildings for instance.",
        "We used this information to restrict the",
        "Table 1: gtaa term anchoring experiment number of valid candidate definitions associated with every gtaa term.",
        "But in some cases the distinction was hard to make between the different definitions, or no clue was provided by the thesaurus to dismabiguate the senses of the term: sometimes it did not have any relationship to other concepts nor explanatory text (Scope Note).",
        "Conclusion of the first step As a final result, as summarized in table 1, 1655 gtaa terms had one or more English equivalent and their related candidate definitions (7530).",
        "We decided to postpone a more in-depth validation to the evaluation of anchoring results with WordNet: we kept all candidate definitions and translations that were not obviously incorrect, and checked the WordNet anchoring result to see if some further refinement had to be done.",
        "The idea was that the anchoring process would only work for parts of the definitions, so we wanted to keep as many data as possible.",
        "Second step: Anchoring to WordNet synsets We stemmed the candidate definitions of gtaa terms and the glosses from WordNet with the Porter stemmer to augment mapping possibilities.",
        "Stemming is the operation of reducing words to a root, for example by removing the \"s' character at the end of an (English) word in plural form.",
        "This process can reduce different unrelated words to a same root, and hence should be handled with care, but it requires less resources then a full fledged lemmatizing and helps comparing a larger number of words then on the basis of the graphical forms only.",
        "As announced, in order to map synset to gtaa terms, we compared their lexical descriptions: we compared the different sets of stems in a simple bag-of-words approach.",
        "We actually found out that the definitions of the online dictionary were exact matches with WordNet glosses, thus all defined terms could be straightforwardly anchored to one or more synsets.",
        "In the end, 1060 concepts from gtaa are successfully anchored to a synset, which represents 28% of the total number of concepts.",
        "Evaluation of the results We evaluated the number of semantically relevant anchorings for a random representative part of the the 1655 gtaa terms that had one or more WordNet anchor: we evaluated 1789 mappings out of 7530.",
        "On these 1789 mappings, 85 were not equivalence links: 5 out of these 85 links were relating Related Terms (like zeerov anchored to corsair, the first being in gtaa a profession and the second a ship in Wordnet), 17 pointed to Broader Terms, and the others were mapping a term with a correct translation that was correct per se but did not correspond to the intended meaning of the term in gtaa.",
        "For example, two anchorings were proposed for Vrouwen: marriedjwoman and female-person, the latter one being the only valid for our thesaurus.",
        "The first cases (RT and BT relationships between the original term and its anchoring) still provide useful information for aligning vocabularies, but we took only equivalence relationships into account in this experiment.",
        "An additional evaluation that was also performed on a sample set was to check that non-preferred terms that were given a definition were pointing to the same synset as their related preferred terms.",
        "It turned to be correct for the evaluated pairs.",
        "On a qualitative perspective, we found different types of mappings:",
        "• some gtaa terms had more then one translation, all of them pointing to the same synset: this was the confirmation that the mapping from the term to the synset was correct;",

        "We also tried to assess the quality of the translations associated to the concepts of this set by our method: out of 5747 terms proposed as translations, 1479 matched the expert translation.",
        "This precision rate is low (25.7%) but it actually highlights one of the problem of the expert translations found in the thesaurus: the manual translation had a very low lexical coverage, having provided with very few synonyms for the \"preferred\" translations.",

        ".",
        "The evaluation by comparison to the expert translation brings useful information, but it has some drawbacks, especially the limited coverage of the translation work and a correctness assumption bringing a (small) error rate.",
        "To complete it, we carried out a manual investigation, inspired by what had been done for the GTAA thesaurus.",
        "For this, we selected the 179 concepts that were translated by our method but had not previously been assigned English labels by experts.",
        "For this subset, 441 glosses had been assigned.",

        "Some of the previously mentioned anchorings to wrong glosses could have been successfully found by applying the heuristics mentioned in section 3.1.",
        "The use of POS tags and the checking of the singular form of terms allowed to manually spot 41 obviously wrong results.",

        "It is however still uncertain whether these different kinds of information can be used in a more automatised setting.",
        "If we could count on translation of broader and related terms to be done by the process we have applied, taking into account scope notes would require more effort.",
        "And the poor structure of thesauri such as gtt - some 20000 concepts have no parents at all - makes such validations by semantic links difficult.",
        "It is also important to notice that in 14 cases, it was necessary to check the books which have been indexed by a concept to find out its precise meaning.",
        "This could yet be compensated by an interesting result we have observed: the anchoring method gave us material for inferring new semantic links, as in the gtaa case.",
        "Amongst the translated gtt concepts, 689 concepts are sharing at least one synset and are not connected by a thesaurus link.",
        "We found interesting matches, such as gratie (pardon) and absolutie (absolution) or between honger (hunger) and dorst (thirst).",
        "This potential for enriching thesauri could actually be used to spark some positive feedback loop for the anchoring process itself: a richer vocabulary enables for example to use with greater profit the selection strategies based on thesaurus structure.",
        "An important problem for the implementation of such strategies remains to deal with disambiguation (when several English definitions are found, which one shall be selected?)",

        "Both gtt and WordNet have a high level of precision, but they are focused on different matters.",

        "Finally, we made rough estimattions of recall the number of concepts that were correctly anchored compared to the number of concepts anchored in the ideal case.",
        "If we compare the 1479 correctly defined concepts to the 25775 concepts being given an expert translation, we find a very disappointing recall rate of 5.7%.",
        "This very low performance is in fact largely due to three recurrent situations in which the online dictionary could not give any translation:",

        "Nevertheless, the more interesting cases are the ones involving concepts with large semantic overlap but a small lexical one, as in the case of gtaa:plant (Plant) and gtt:begroeiing (Excessive growth ofve-getation) via the WordNet flora synset.",
        "Begroeiing is actually semantically related in the gtt to the concept Planting.",
        "Here, the translation process compensates for the lack of lexical coverage in the respective vocabularies, which precisely corresponds to one of the traditional features background knowledge-based techniques boast.",
        "We can also derive general conceptual similarity relationship based on the overlap between glosses, such as the one between gtaa:drank and gtt:alcohol, which are not direct matches but for which our method has found some common glosses like \"an alcoholic beverage that is distilled rather than fermented\"."

        "Yet, a significant part of the gtaa thesaurus could be anchored, and with some improvement to the method this could be true for gtt too.",

        "Even if the number of results given by the current implementation of our method is quite low, the reader should notice that the process can already, as is, suggest new relationships between concepts of the source thesauri.",
        "Moreover, proposed strategies in the alignment field often advocate using combined methods: combined contributions can be used to proceed with some cross validation if they overlap, or to provide with larger number of candidate for further (semi-)automatic selection.",
        "In such a setting, every contribution of candidate links is welcome.",
        "In this respect, what is useful here is the ability of a WordNet-based method to provide with results that could not be obtained with other techniques because of the lack of explicit semantic information and hierarchical structure in the original vocabularies.",
        "Finally, as mentioned in the introduction, there are other motivating use cases that we plan to experiment with.",
        "Especially interesting is the way a mapping with WordNet can enhance the existing access to document collections of the Dutch Cultural Heritage Institutes by providing with query refinement services and browsing possibilities."
