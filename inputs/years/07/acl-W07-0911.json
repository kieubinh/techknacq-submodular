        "Online Cultural Heritage (CH) content is being produced in many countries by organisations such as national libraries, museums, galleries and audiovisual archives.",
        "Additionally, there are increasing amounts of CH relevant content available more generally on the World Wide Web.",
        "While some of this material concerns national or regional content only of local interest, much material relates to items involving multiple nations and languages, for example concerning events in Europe or Asia.",
        "In order to gain a full understanding of such events, including details contained in different collections and exploring different cultural perspectives requires effective multilingual search technologies.",
        "Facilitating search ofthis type requires translation tools to cross the language barrier between users and the available information sources.",
        "CH content encompasses various different media, including of course text documents, images, videos, and audio recordings.",
        "Search of text documents between languages forms the focus of cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) research, while search for images is the concern ofcontent-based image retrieval.",
        "However, whatever the media of the items they are accompanied by metadata.",
        "Such metadata may include simple factual details such as date of creation, but also descriptive details relating to the contents of the item.",
        "Multilingual searching using metadata content requires that either the metadata be translated into a language with which the user is able to search or that the search query be translated into the language of the metadata.",
        "This alternative of document or query translation is a well rehearsed argument in CLIR, which has generally concerned itself with full text document searching.",
        "However, the features of metadata require a more careful analysis.",
        "Metadata is typically dense in search terms, while lacking the linguistic structure and information redundancy of full text documents.",
        "The absence of linguistic structure makes precise translation of content problematic, while the lack of redundancy means that accurate translation of individual words and phrases is vital to minimise mismatch between query and document terms.",
        "Furthermore, CH content is typically in specialised domains requiring domain specific resources for accurate translation.",
        "Developing reliable and robust approaches to translation for metadata search is thus an important component of search for many CH archives.",
        "The EU FP6 MultiMatch project is concerned with information access for multimedia and multilingual content for a range of European languages.",
        "In the investigation reported in this paper we introduce the first stage multilingual search functionality of the MultiMatch system, and describe its use in an investigation for multilingual metadata search.",
        "Since at present we do not have a search test collection specifically developed for MultiMatch we use data from the CLEF 2006 Cross-Language Speech Retrieval (CL-SR) task for our experiments (Oard et al., 2006).",
        "The remainder of this paper is organised as follows: Section 2 gives an overview of the MultiMatch search architecture, Section 3 outlines the experimental search task, Section 4 describes the translation resources used for this study, Section 5 and 6 concern our experimental setup and results, and finally Section 7 summarises our conclusions and gives details of our ongoing work."

        "The MultiMatch search system is centered on the MILOS Multimedia Repository system (Amato et al., 2004) which incorporates free-text search using Lucene (Hatcher and Gospodnetic, 2004) and image search using an open source image retrieval system GIFT (Muller et al., 2001).",
        "In order to support multilingual searching a number of translation tools are being developed based on standard online machine translation tools and dictionaries augmented with domain-specific resources gathered from the WWW and elsewhere.",
        "In this section we briefly introduce the relevant details of MILOS and Lucene.",
        "Since this paper focuses on text search within MultiMatch, we do not describe the multimedia features of the MultiMatch system.",
        "MILOS (Multimedia digital Library for On-line Search) is a repository system conceived to support the distributed storage and retrieval of multimedia objects.",
        "This Multimedia Content Management System (MCMS) is able to manage not only structured data, as in databases, but also textual data (using information retrieval technologies), semi-structured data (typically in XML), mixed-mode data, and multimedia data.",
        "In MultiMatch, we use MILOS as a metadata repository to enable querying on the structure of the data stored.",
        "MILOS has a three-tier architecture composed of three main components:",
        "1. the XML Search Engine (XMLSE) component which manages the metadata;",
        "2. the MultiMedia Server (MMS) component which manages the documents; and",
        "3. the MultiMedia Digital Library service (MMDLS) component MMDLS which provides application developers with a uniform and integrated way of accessing MMS and",
        "XMLSE.",
        "Each of these components is implemented using solutions providing flexibility, scalability, and efficiency.",
        "XMLSE is an enhanced native XML database/repository system with special features for digital library applications.",
        "This is especially justified by the well known and accepted advantages of representing metadata as XML documents.",
        "Metadata represented with XML can have arbitrary complex structures, which allows it to handle with complex metadata schemas, and can easily be exported and imported.",
        "Our XML database can store and retrieve any valid XML document.",
        "No metadata schema or XML schema definition is needed before inserting an XML document, except optional index definitions for performance boosting.",
        "Once an arbitrary XML document has been inserted in the database it can be immediately retrieved using XQuery.",
        "This allows digital library applications to use arbitrary (XML encoded) metadata schemas and to deal with heterogeneous metadata, without any constraint on schema design and/or overhead due to metadata translation.",
        "Thus, the native XML database/repository system is simpler than a general purpose XML database system, but offers significant improvements in specific areas: it supports standard XML query languages such as XPath and XQuery, and offers advanced search and indexing functionality on arbitrary XML documents.",
        "It supports high performance search and retrieval on heavily structured XML documents, relying on specific index structures.",
        "Moreover XMLSE provides the possibility of using particular indexes.",
        "For example, using the configuration file of XMLSE the system administrator can associate the <abstract> elements of a document with a full-text index and to the MPEG-7 <visuaiDescriptor> elements can be associated with a similarity search index.",
        "XMLSE uses Apache Lucene to provide partial (or approximate) text string matching, effectively providing information retrieval functionality within MILOS.",
        "This allows XMLSE to use the ranked searching and wildcard queries of Lucene to solve queries like \"find all the articles whose title contains the word XML\" and so on.",
        "This application allows users to interrogate the dataset combining full text, and exact or partial match search.",
        "For example the user can look for documents whose <metadata> element contains the word \"Switzerland\".",
        "MILOS generates and submits to XMLSE the following XQuery query:",
        "for $a in /document where $a//metadata ~ 'Switzerland' <result>",
        "The query will return a list of results which consist of the title and author of all documents whose metadata contains the term \"Switzerland\".",
        "Full text search in MILOS is provided by using Lucene as a plugin.",
        "Ranked retrieval uses the standard tf x idf vector-space method provided in Lucene (Hatcher and Gospodnetic, 2004).",
        "Lucene also provides additional functionality to improve retrieval effectiveness by providing various query expansion services using techniques such as relevance feedback, although these are not used in the current investigation.",
        "Documents and search requests are preprocessed to remove stop words and stemming is applied using the standard resources supplied with Lucene."
