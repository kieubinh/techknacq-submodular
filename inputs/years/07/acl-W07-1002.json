        "Most medical concepts are expressed via a domain specific terminology that can either be explicitly agreed upon or extracted empirically from domain specific text.",
        "Regardless of how it is constructed, a terminology serves as a foundation for information encoding, processing and exchange in a specialized sub-language such as medicine.",
        "Concepts in the medical domain are encoded through a variety oflin-guistic forms, the most typical and widely accepted is the noun phrase (NP).",
        "In some even further specialized subdomains within medicine, such as nursing and surgery, an argument can be made that some concepts are represented by an entire predication rather than encapsulated within a single nominal-ized expression.",
        "For example, in order to describe someone's ability to lift objects 5 pounds or heavier above their head, it may be necessary to use a term consisting of a predicate such as [LIFT] and a set of arguments corresponding to various thematic roles such as <PATIENT> and <PATH> (Ruggieri et al., 2004).",
        "In this paper, we address typical medical terms encoded as noun phrases (NPs) that are often structurally ambiguous, as in Example 1, and discuss a case for extending the proposed method to non-nominalized terms as well.",

        "The NP in Example 1 can have at least two interpretations depending on the syntactic analysis:",
        "The term in Example 2 denotes an obstruction in the small bowel, which is a diagnosable disorder; whereas, the term in Example 3 refers to a small unspecified obstruction in the bowel.",
        "Unlike the truly ambiguous general English cases such as the classical \"American History Professor\" where the appropriate interpretation depends on the context, medical terms, such as in Example 1, tend to have only one appropriate interpretation.",
        "The context, in this case, is the discourse domain of medicine.",
        "From the standpoint of the English language, the interpretation that follows from Example 3 is certainly plausible, but unlikely in the context of a medical term.",
        "The syntax of a term only shows what interpretations are possible without restricting them to any particular one.",
        "From the syntactic analysis, we know that the term in Example 1 has the potential for being ambiguous; however, we also know that it does have an intended interpretation by virtue of being an entry term in a standardized terminology with a unique identifier anchoring its meaning.",
        "What we do not know is which syntactic structure generated that interpretation.",
        "Being able to determine the structure consistent with the intended interpretation of a clinical term can improve the analysis of unrestricted medical text and subsequently improve the accuracy of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks that depend on semantic interpretation.",
        "To address this problem, we propose to use a model-fitting method which utilizes an existing statistical measure, the Log Likelihood Ratio.",

        "The problem of resolving structural ambiguity has been previously addressed in the computational linguistics literature.",
        "There are multiple approaches ranging from purely statistical (Ratnaparkhi, 1998), to hybrid approaches that take into account the lexical semantics of the verb (Hindle and Rooth, 1993), to corpus-based, which is the approach discussed in this paper.",
        "(Marcus, 1980) presents an early example of a corpus-based approach to syntactic ambiguity resolution.",
        "One type of structural ambiguity that has received much attention has to do with nominal compounds as seen in the work of (Resnik, 1993), (Resnik and Hearst, 1993), (Pustejovsky et al., 1993), and (Lauer, 1995).",

        "The correct analysis is chosen based on the \"acceptability\" of the adjacent bigrams A[XY] and A[YZ].",
        "If A[XY] is more acceptable than A[YZ], then the left-branching analysis [[XY]Z] is preferred.",
        "(Lauer and Dras, 1994) and (Lauer, 1995) address the issue of structural ambiguity by developing a dependency model where instead of computing the acceptability of A[YZ] one would compute the acceptability of A[XZ].",

        "(La-pata and Keller, 2004) results also support this assertion.",
        "The difference between the approaches within the two models is the computation of acceptability.",
        "Proposals for computing acceptability (or preference) include raw frequency counts ((Evans and Zhai, 1996) and (Lapata and Keller, 2004)), Latent Semantic Indexing ((Buckeridge and Sutcliffe, 2002)) and statistical measures of association ((Lapata et al., 1999) and (Nakov and Hearst, 2005)).",
        "One of the main problems with using frequency counts or statistical methods for structural ambiguity resolution is the sparseness of data; however, (Resnik and Hearst, 1993) used conceptual associations (associations between groups of terms deemed to form conceptual units) in order to alleviate this problem.",
        "(Lapata and Keller, 2004) use the document counts returned by WWW search engines.",

        "The ability to determine the syntactic structure that gives rise to a particular semantic interpretation of a medical term may enable accurate mapping of unstructured medical text to standardized terminologies and nomenclatures.",
        "Future directions to improve the accuracy ofour method include determining how other measures of association, such as dice coefficient and X, perform on this task.",
        "We feel that there is a possibility that no single measure performs best over all types of terms.",
        "In that case, we plan to investigate incorporating the different measures into an ensemble-based algorithm.",
        "We believe the model-fitting method is not limited to structural ambiguity resolution.",
        "This method could be applied to automatic term extraction and automatic text indexing of terms from a standardized vocabulary.",
        "More broadly, the principles of using distributional characteristics of word sequences derived from large corpora may be applied to unsupervised syntactic parsing."
