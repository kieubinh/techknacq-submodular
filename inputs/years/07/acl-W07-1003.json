        "Today, the Internet is a powerful tool for discovering novel information via news feed providers.",
        "This is becoming increasingly important for the public health domain because it can help to detect emerging and re-emerging diseases.",
        "In infectious disease surveillance systems such as the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) system (Public Health Agency of Canada, 2004) and",
        "ProMed-Mail (International Society for Infectious Diseases, 2001), the detection and tracking of outbreaks using the Internet has been proven to be a key source of information for public health workers, clinicians, and researchers interested in communicable diseases.",
        "The basis for such systems is the monitoring of a large number of news articles simultaneously.",
        "The classification of news articles into disease-related or none disease-related classes is the first stage in any automated approach to this task.",
        "In practice though there are a large number of news articles whose main subject is related to diseases but which should not necessarily be notified to users together with a relatively small number of high priority articles that experts should be actively alerted to.",
        "Alerting criteria broadly include news related to newly emerging diseases, the spread of diseases across international borders, the deliberate release of a human or engineered pathogen, etc.",
        "The use of only raw text in the classification process inevitably fails to resolve many subtle ambiguities, for example semantic class ambiguities in polysemous words like \"virus\", \"fever\", \"outbreak\", and \"control\" which all exhibit a variety of senses depending on context.",
        "These different senses appear with relatively high frequency in the news especially in headlines.",
        "A further challenge is that diseases can be denoted by many variant forms.",
        "Therefore we consider that the use of advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques like named entity recognition (NER) and anaphora resolution are needed in order to achieve high classification accuracy.",
        "Text classification is defined as the task of assigning documents into one or more predefined categories.",
        "As shown by (Cohen and Hersh, 2005), an accurate text classification system can be especially valuable to database curators.",
        "A document in the biomedical domain can be annotated using NER techniques with enriched semantic information in the form of NEs such as the disease, pathogen, location, and time.",
        "NER and term identification in general have been recognized as an important research topic both in the NLP and biomedical communities (Krauthammer and Nenadic, 2004).",
        "However, an investigation into the contribution of NEs on the performance of annotated biomedical text classification has remained an open question until now.",
        "There are two main reasons for this: Firstly there are a small number of open annotation schema for biomedical text, and secondly there is no benchmark annotated data for testing.",
        "The BioCaster project (Collier, 2006) is working towards the detection and tracking of disease outbreaks from Internet news articles.",
        "Although there are several schema for biomedical text (Wilbur et al., 2006), little work has been done on developing one specifically for public health related text.",
        "BioCaster therefore provides an annotation schema that can fill this gap.",
        "Our schema, which is based on discussions with biologists, computational linguists and public health experts, helps identify entities related to infectious diseases which are then used to build up a detailed picture of events in later stages of text mining.",
        "One significant aspect of the schema is that it is based on conceptual analysis with a formal ontological methodology.",
        "As discussed in (Kawazoe et al., 2006), by applying meta-properties (Guarino and Welty, 2000a; Guarino and Welty, 2000b), our \"markable\" concepts are classified into \"Type\" and \"Role\".",
        "Information about Role concepts is integrated into the schema as attributes on NEs.",
        "This work takes the investigation one step forward by showing empirical evidence for the usefulness of Role concepts in a practical application.",
        "In this paper, we focus on the task of text classification, proceeding under the simplifying assumption that given enough annotated training data for NEs and their Roles both can be automatically tagged with high accuracy.",
        "In recent years there have been many studies on text classification using general methods (Sebastiani, 2002; Yang and Liu, 1999) semi-structured texts (Kudo and Matsumoto, 2004), and XML classification (Zaki and Aggarwal, 2003).",
        "Other research has investigated the contribution of semantic information in the form of synonyms, syntax, etc.",
        "in text representation (Bloehdorn and Hotho, 2004; Hotho et al., 2003; Frurnkranz et al., 1998).",
        "Feature selection (Scott and Matwin, 1999) has also been studied.",
        "The contribution of this paper is to provide an analysis and evaluation on the Roles of NEs in annotated text classification.",
        "The rest of this paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we outline the BioCaster schema for the annotation of terms in biomedical text; Section 3 presents a description of the BioCaster gold standard corpus; Section 4 provides details of the method and experimental results of classification on the gold standard corpus.",

        "Based on the improvements of transmission and therapeutic in Table 6, we can draw their effectiveness are the same on their NEs, that is therapeutic = transmission.",
        "When we compare the effect of all Roles on performance, we can see that the improvements ofRole case and also Quality number are much higher than the improvements of Roles therapeutic and transmission.",
        "We think this is because the frequency of PERSON (NE associated to Role case and Quality number) is higher than the frequency of NEs which",
        "FEATURES Accuracy Pre/Rec are associated to Roles therapeutic and transmission in the corpus.",
        "Then, we can have the effect of Roles/Qualities is in the order case > number > therapeutic = transmission.",
        "We continue to investigate the effectiveness of Roles for combined NEs.",
        "The experimental results are given in Table 7.",
        "We note that there are two Roles therapeutic and transmission in disease-related NE classes, and all 3 Roles case, therapeutic and transmission in all NE classes.",
        "We can easily see that Roles improved performance of text classification significantly.",
        "In details, for disease-related NE classes, Roles therapeutic and transmission helped to improve the accuracy from 74.40% to 76.20%, and Precision from 64.35% to 66.% compared to the baseline.",
        "For all NE classes, all 3 Roles case, therapeutic, and transmission help to improve the accuracy from 74.40% to 84.40% and Precision from 64.35% to 74.76%.",
        "We conclude that all 3 Roles achieved the best results in performance.",
