        "In the past decade, biomedical discoveries and publications have increased exponentially due to high-throughput technologies such as automated genomic sequencing, and therefore, it is impossible for researchers to keep up-to-date with the most recent knowledge by manually reading the literature.",
        "Therefore, automated text mining tools, such as information retrieval and information extraction systems, have received great amounts of interest (Erhardt et al., 2006; Krallinger and Valencia, 2005).",
        "Biomedical entity recognition is a first crucial step for text mining tools in this domain, but is a very challenging task, partially due to the ambiguity (one name referring to different entities) of names in the biomedical field.",
        "Genes are among the most important biological entities for understanding biological functions and processes, but gene names and symbols are highly ambiguous.",
        "Chen et al.",
        "(2005) obtained gene information from 21 organisms and found that ambiguities within species, across species, with English words and with medical terms were 5.02%, 13.43%, 1.10%, 2.99%, respectively, when both official gene symbols and aliases were considered.",
        "When mining MEDLINE abstracts, they found that 85.1% of mouse genes in the articles were ambiguous with other gene names.",
        "Recently, Fundel and Zimmer (2006) studied gene/protein nomenclature in 5 public databases.",
        "Their results showed that the ambiguity problem was not trivial.",
        "The degree of ambiguity also varied among different organisms.",
        "Unlike other abbreviations in the literature, which usually are accompanied by their corresponding long forms, many gene symbols occur alone without any mention of their long forms.",
        "According to Schuemie et al.",
        "(2004), only 30% of gene symbols in abstracts and 18% in full text were accompanied by their corresponding full names, which makes the task of gene symbol normalization much harder.",
        "Gene symbol disambiguation (GSD) is a particular case of word sense disambiguation (WSD), which has been extensively studied in the domain of general English.",
        "One type of method for WSD uses established knowledge bases, such as a machine readable dictionary (Lesk, 1986; Harley and Glennon, 1997).",
        "Another type of WSD method uses supervised machine learning (ML) technologies (Bruce and Wiebe, 1994; Lee and Ng, 2002; Liu et al., 2002).",
        "In the biomedical domain, there are many gene related knowledge sources, such as Entrez Gene (Maglott et al., 2005), developed at NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information), which have been used for gene symbol disambiguation.",
        "Podowski et al.",
        "(2004) used MEDLINE references in the LocusLink and SwissProt databases to build Bayesian classifiers for GSD.",
        "A validation on MEDLINE documents for a set of 66 human genes showed most accuracies were greater than 90% if there was enough training data (more than 20 abstracts for each gene sense).",
        "More recently, information retrieval (IR) based approaches have been applied to resolve gene ambiguity using existing knowledge sources.",
        "Typically, a profile vector for each gene sense is built from available knowledge source(s) and a context vector is derived from the context where the ambiguous gene occurs.",
        "Then similarities between the context vector and candidate gene profile vectors are calculated, and the gene corresponding to the gene profile vector that has the highest similarity score to the context vector is selected as the correct sense.",
        "Schijvenaars et al.",
        "(2005) reported on an IR-based method for human GSD.",
        "It utilized information from either Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) annotation or MEDLINE abstracts.",
        "The system achieved an accuracy rate of 92.7% on an automatically generated testing set when five abstracts were used for the gene profile.",
        "Xu et al.",
        "(2007) studied the performance of an IR-based approach for GSD for mouse, fly and yeast organisms when different types of information from different knowledge sources were used.",
        "They also used a simple method to combine different types of information and reported that a highest precision of 93.9% was reached for a testing set of mouse genes using multiple types of information.",
        "In the field of IR, it has been shown that combining heterogeneous evidence improves retrieval effectiveness.",
        "Studies on combining multiple representations of document content (Katzer et al., 1982), combining results from different queries (Xu and Croft, 1996), different ranking algorithms (Lee, 1995), and different search systems (Lee, 1997) have shown improved performance of retrieval systems.",
        "Different methods have also been developed to combine different evidence for IR tasks.",
        "The inference-network-based framework, developed by Turtle and Croft (1991), was able to combine different document representations and retrieval algorithms into an overall estimate of the probability of relevance.",
        "Fox et al.",
        "(1988) extended the vector space model to use sub-vectors to describe different representations derived from documents.",
        "An overall similarity between a document and a query is defined as a weighted linear combination of similarities of sub-vectors.",
        "A linear regression analysis was used to determine the value of the coefficients.",
        "Though previous related efforts (Schijvenaars et al., 2005, Xu et al., 2007) have explored the use of multiple types of information from different knowledge sources, none have focused on development of formal methods for combining multiple evidence for the GSD problem to optimize performance of an IR-based method.",
        "In this study, we adapted various IR-based combination models specifically for the GSD problem.",
        "Our motivation for this work is that there are diverse knowledge sources containing different types of information about genes, and the amount of such information is continuously increasing.",
        "A primary source containing gene information is MEDLINE articles, which could be linked to specific genes through annotation databases.",
        "For example, Entrez Gene contains an annotated file called \"gene2pubmed\", which lists the PMIDs (PubMed ID) of articles associated with a particular gene.",
        "From related MEDLINE articles, words and different ontological concepts can be obtained and then be used as information associated with a gene.",
        "However they could be noisy, because one article could mention multiple genes.",
        "Another type of source contains summarized annotation of genes, which are more specific to certain aspects of genes.",
        "For example, Entrez Gene contains a file called \"gene2go\".",
        "This file lists genes and their associated Gene Ontology (GO) (Ashburner et al., 2000) codes, which include concepts related to biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components of genes.",
        "Therefore, methods that are able to efficiently combine the different types of information from the different sources are important to explore for the purpose of improving performance of GSD systems.",
        "In this paper, we describe various models for combining different types of information from MEDLINE abstracts for IR-based GSD systems.",

        "Figure 1 shows an overview of the IR combination-based approach.",
        "We generated three different sub-vectors for the context and three for the profile, so that each sub-vector corresponded to a different type of information.",
        "The similarity scores between context and profile were measured for each type of sub-vector and then combined to generate the overall similarity scores to determine the correct sense.",
        "We explored five different combination methods using two testing sets.",
        "The \"gene2pubmed\" file in Entrez Gene was downloaded in January 2006.",
        "A profile was then built for each gene using information derived from the related articles.",
        "We used the following three types of information: 1) Words in the related MEDLINE articles (title and abstract).",
        "This is the simplest type of information about a gene.",
        "General English stop words were removed and all other words were stemmed using the Porter stemming algorithm (Porter, 1980).",
        "2) UMLS (Unified Medical Language System) (Bodenreider 2004) CUIs (Concept Unique Identifier), which were obtained from titles and abstracts of MEDLINE articles using an NLP system called MetaMap (Aronson 2001).",
        "3) MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) terms, which are manually annotated by curators based on full-text articles at the National Library of Medicine (NLM) of the United States.",
        "Using the \"gene2pubmed\" file, we downloaded the MEDLINE abstracts that were known to be related to human genes.",
        "Articles associated with more than 25 genes (as determined by our observation) were excluded, since they mostly discussed high-throughput technologies and provided less valuable information for GSD.",
        "This excluded 168 articles and yielded a collection of 116,929 abstracts, which were used to generate gene profiles and one of the test sets.",
        "Two test sets were obtained for evaluating the combination methods: testing set 1 was based on the \"gene2pubmed\" file, and testing set 2 was based on the BioCreAtIvE II evaluation.",
        "Testing set 1 was automatically generated from the 116,929 abstracts, using the following 3 steps:",
        "1) Identifying ambiguous gene symbols in the abstracts.",
        "This involved processing the entire collection of abstracts using an NLP system called BioMedLEE (Biomedical Language Extracting and Encoding System) (Lussier et al.",
        "2006), which was shown to identify gene names/symbols with high precision when used in conjunction with GO annotations.",
        "When an ambiguous gene was identified in an article, the candidate gene identifiers (GeneID from Entrez Gene) were listed by the NLP system, but not disambiguated.",
        "For each ambiguous gene that was detected, a pair was created consisting of the PMID of the article and the gene symbol, so that each pair would be considered a possible testing sample.",
        "Repeated gene symbols in the same article were ignored, because we assumed only one sense per gene symbol in the same article.",
        "Using this method, 69,111 PMID and ambiguous human gene symbol pairs were identified from the above collection of abstracts.",
        "2) Tagging the correct sense of the ambiguous gene symbols.",
        "The list of candidate PMID/gene symbol pairs generated from the articles was then compared with the list of gene identifiers known to be associated with the articles based on \"gene2pubmed\".",
        "If one of the candidate gene senses matched, that gene sense was assumed to be the correct sense.",
        "Then the PMID/gene-symbol pair was tagged with that sense and set aside as a testing sample.",
        "We identified a pool of 12,289 testing samples, along with the corresponding tagged senses.",
        "3) Selecting testing set 1.",
        "We randomly selected 2,000 testing samples from the above pool to form testing set 1.",
        "Testing set 2 was derived using the training and evaluation sets of the BioCreAtIvE II Gene Normalization (GN) task (Morgan 2007).",
        "The Bio-CreAtIvE II GN task involved mapping human gene mentions in MEDLINE abstracts to gene identifiers (Entrez Gene ID), which is a broader task than the GSD task.",
        "However, these abstracts were useful for creating a testing set for GSD, because whenever a gene mention mapped to more than one identifier, disambiguation was required.",
        "Therefore, it was possible to derive a list of ambiguous gene symbols based on data that was provided by BioCreAtIvE.",
        "We combined both manually annotated training (281 abstracts) and evaluation (262 abstracts) sets provided by BioCreAtIvE.",
        "Using the same process as described in step 1 of testing set 1, we processed the abstracts and identified 217 occurrences of ambiguous gene symbols from the combined set.",
        "Following a similar procedure as was used for step 2 in the testing set 1 (except that the reference standard in this case was the manually annotated results obtained from Bio-CreAtIvE instead of \"gene2pubmed\"), we obtained 124 PMID/gene-symbol pairs with the corresponding tagged senses, which formed testing set 2.",
        "Because one article may contain multiple ambiguous gene symbols, a total of 2,048 PMIDs were obtained from both testing sets 1 and 2.",
        "Articles with those PMIDs were excluded from the collection of 116,929 abstracts.",
        "We used the remaining document set to generate gene profiles, which were used for both testing sets.",
        "For each gene in \"gene2pubmed\" file, we created a profile.",
        "It consisted of three sub-vectors containing word, CUI, or MeSH, respectively, using the information derived from the related MEDLINE abstracts.",
        "Similarly, a context vector was also formed for each testing sample, using three sub-vectors containing word, CUI, or MeSH, which were derived from the abstract whose PMID was stated in the testing sample.",

        "Given a document d, the Term Frequency (tf) of term t is defined as the frequency of t occurring in d. The Inverse Document Frequency (idf) of term t is defined as the logarithm of the number of all documents in the collection divided by the number of documents containing the term t. Then term t in document d is weighted as tf*idf.",
        "The similarity score between the same type of context and profile sub-vectors were measured as cosine similarity of two vectors.",

        "We implemented five methods to combine similarity scores from each basic classifier, which are described as follows:",
        "1) CombMax - Each individual similarity score from a basic classifier was normalized by dividing the sum of similarity scores of all candidate genes for that basic classifier.",
        "Then the decision made by the classifier with the highest normalized score was selected as the final decision of the combined method.",
        "2) CombSum - Each individual similarity score from a basic classifier was normalized by dividing the maximum similarity score of all candidate genes for that basic classifier.",

        "The candidate gene",

        "3) CombSumVote - The overall similarity score was considered as the similarity score from CombSum, multiplied by the number of basic classifiers that voted for that gene as the correct sense.",
        "4) CombLR - The overall similarity score was defined as a predicted probability (P) of being the correct sense, given the coefficients obtained from a logistic regression model and similarity scores from all three basic classifiers for that gene.",

        "Following a procedure called Borda count (Black, 1958), the top predicted gene sense was given a ranking score of N-1, the second top was given N-2, and so on, where N is the total number of candidate senses.",

        "ranking score was selected as the correct sense.",
        "In this study, we measured both precision and coverage of IR-based GSD approaches.",

        "When a candidate gene had an empty profile or different candidate gene profiles had the same similarity scores (e.g. zero score) with a particular context vector, the disambiguation method was not able to make a decision.",
        "Therefore, we also reported on coverage, which was defined as the number of testing samples that could be disambiguated using the profile-based method over the total number of testing samples.",

        "It used the majority sense of an ambiguous gene symbol as the correct sense.",

        "When one partition was used for testing, the remaining nine partitions were combined and used for training, which also involved deriving coefficients for each round.",
        "To make other combination methods comparable with CombLR, we tested the performance of other combination methods on the same partitions as well.",
        "Therefore, we had 10 measurements for each combination method.",

        "For testing set 2, we did not test the CombLR method because the set was too small to train a regression model.",

        "The idea behind CombMax was to use the single classifier that had the most confidence, but it did not seem to improve performance very much because it ignored evidence from the other two basic classifiers.",
        "The CombSum was a simple combination method, but with reasonable performance, which was also observed by other studies for the IR task (Fox and Shaw, 1994).",
        "CombSumVote was a variant of CombSum.",
        "It favors the candidate genes selected by more basic classifiers.",
        "In Lee (1997), a similar implementation of CombSumVote (named \"CombMNZ\") also achieved better performance in the IR task.",
        "CombLR, the combination method trained on a logistic regression model, achieved the best performance in this study.",
        "It used a set of coefficients derived from the training data when combining the similarities from individual basic classifiers.",
        "Therefore, it could be considered as a more complicated linear combination model than CombSum.",
        "In situations where training data is not available, CombSum or CombSumVote would be a good choice.",
        "CombRank did not perform as well as methods that used similarity scores, probably due to the loss of subtle probability information in the similarity scores.",
        "We explored ranking because it was independent of the weighting schema and could be valuable if it performed well.",
        "The typical scenario where combination should help is when a classifier based on one type of information made a wrong prediction, but the other(s), based on different types of information, made the correct predictions.",
        "In those cases, the overall prediction may be correct when an appropriate combination method applies.",
        "For example, an ambiguous gene symbol PDK1 (in the article with PMID 10856237), which has two possible gene senses ('GeneID:5163 pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase, isoenzyme 1' and 'GeneID:5170 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1'), was incorrectly predicted as 'GeneID: 5163' when only \"word\" was used.",
        "But the classifiers using \"CUI\" and \"MeSH\" predicted it correctly.",
        "When the CombSum method was used to combine the similarity scores from all three classifiers, the correct sense 'GeneID: 5170' was selected.",
        "When all three classifiers were incorrect in predicting a testing sample, generally none of the combination methods would help in making the final decision correct.",
        "Therefore, there is an upper bound on the performance of the combined system.",
        "In our case, we detected that all three classifiers made incorrect predictions for 65 testing samples of the 2,000 samples.",

        "The methods for combining different types of information from biomedical knowledge sources described in this study, though targeted to the GSD problem, could be also applicable to other text mining tasks that are based on similarity measurement, such as text categorization, clustering, and the IR task in the biomedical domain.",
        "The IR-based gene symbol disambiguation method described in this paper aims to resolve intra-species gene ambiguity.",
        "We focused on ambiguous gene symbols within the human species and used articles known to be associated with human genes.",

        "It would be interesting to compare our work with other related work, but that would require use of the same testing set.",
        "For example, it is not straightforward to compare our precision result (92.2%) with that (92.7%) reported by Schijvenaars et al.",
        "(2005), because they used a testing set that was generated by removing ambiguous genes with less than 6 associated articles for each of their senses, and they did not report on coverage.",

        "There are a few possible explanations for this.",
        "First, the version of the Entrez Gene database used by the NLP system was not the most recent one, so some new genes were not listed as possible candidate senses.",

        "The combination method using coefficients obtained from a logistic regression model reached the highest precision of 92.2% on an automatically generated testing set of ambiguous human gene symbols.",
        "On a testing set derived from BioCreAtIvE II GN task, the combination method that performed summation of individual similarities reached the highest precision of 90.6%.",
        "However, the regression-based method could not be used, because the testing sample was small.",
        "In the future, we will add information that is specifically related to genes, such as GO codes, into the combination model.",
        "Meanwhile, we will also study the performance gain in terms of coverage by integrating different knowledge sources."
