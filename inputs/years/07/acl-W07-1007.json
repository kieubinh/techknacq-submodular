        "The field of health literacy has garnered much attention recently.",
        "Studies show that most documents targeted at health consumers are ill-fitted to the intended audience and its level of health literacy (Rudd et al., 1999; McCray, 2005).",
        "While there are many components involved in health literacy that are specific to the reader (e.g., reading level and cultural background), we investigate what can be done from the standpoint of the text to adapt it to the literacy level of a given reader.",
        "As such, we set ourselves in the context of a text-to-text generation system, where a technical text is edited to be more comprehensible to a lay reader.",
        "An essential resource for such an editing tool is a lexicon of paraphrases, or semantically equivalent terms.",
        "In this paper, we investigate a corpus-driven method for building such a lexicon.",
        "We focus on terms that are recognized by the UMLS (UMLS, 1995), both for technical and lay candidate terms for equivalence.",
        "Because we have lay audiences in mind, our definition of semantic equivalence must be broader than a notion of strict medical equivalence utilized by medical experts.",
        "Thus, while a medical dictionary like UMLS assigns different concept unique identifiers (CUIs) to two particular terms, such as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and angioplasty, these terms should be considered semantically equivalent for the purposes of lay readers.",
        "Besides enabling a text tailoring system to adapt technical texts for a lay audience, a lexicon of semantically equivalent technical/lay terms would benefit other tools as well.",
        "For instance, the Consumer Health Vocabulary initiative is a comprehensive list of UMLS terms familiar to lay readers.",
        "Our lexicon could help augment the terms with equivalence links to technical terms.",
        "While much research of late has been devoted to identifying terms incomprehensible to lay readers, such research has not established links between technical terms and equivalent lay terms beyond their CUI information (Zeng et al., 2005; Elhadad, 2006).",
        "The key points of our approach are: (1) the use of combined measures of association to identify pairs of semantically equivalent terms, and (2) a knowledge-based heuristic which acts as a powerful filter for identifying semantically equivalent pairs.",
        "Our method does not rely on human labeling of semantically equivalent term pairs.",
        "As such, it is unsupervised, and achieves results that are promising considering the small size of the corpus from which the results are derived.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "The next section describes our parallel corpus of paired technical/lay documents.",
        "The Methods section describes the different measures of association we experimented with, how we combine them to leverage their complimentary strengths, and our semantic filter.",

        "Because our ultimate goal is to learn, in a data-driven fashion, semantic equivalents of terms that are too technical for lay readers, we can benefit from having instances of texts which relay similar information but are conveyed in different styles.",
        "We collect a corpus similar in structure to those used in the field of statistical machine translation.",
        "But, instead of having two collections in different languages, we collect texts written for two different audiences: medically trained readers (technical collection) and health consumers (lay collection).",
        "The lay collection is composed of news stories from the ReutersHealth E-line newsfeed summarizing research in the medical field.",
        "Reuters journalists take technical publications and report the main findings and methods and, on occasion, include interviews with the authors of the scientific publication.",
        "The stories are targeted at a lay audience with a 12th-grade reading level.",
        "Furthermore, every story in our collection contains a reference to the original scientific publication.",
        "Thus, it is possible to gather the original texts, which convey similar information but were written for a technical audience.",
        "The stories draw upon studies from reputable medical journals, such as Annals of Internal Medicine, New England Journal of Medicine and Lancet.",
        "The technical collection in our corpus is composed of the original scientific articles corresponding to each news story in the lay collection.",
        "Accordingly, the lay and technical collections contain the same number of documents and are parallel at the document level.",
        "That is, each technical document has a lay equivalent and vice-versa.",
        "Because a lay document is a summary of a technical article and is, hence, much shorter than the original scientific article, we decided to include only the abstract of the technical document in our collection.",
        "This way, the technical and lay documents are comparable in content and length.",
        "It should be noted, however, that the content in a technical/lay document pair is not parallel, but comparable (McEnery and Xiao, 2007): there is no natural sentence-to-sentence correspondence between the two texts.",
        "This is to be expected: technical abstracts contain many technical details, while lay stories, to provide background, introduce information entirely absent from abstracts.",
        "In addition, the lay stories drastically rearrange the order in which information is typically conveyed in technical abstracts.",
        "For these reasons, our corpus is not parallel at the sentence level and, thus, differs from other bilingual parallel corpora used in machine translation.",
        "To ensure that some significant number of terms appears with sufficient frequency in our corpus in order to induce equivalent pairs automatically, we focused on articles and stories in a single domain: cardiology.",
        "We identified the original scientific article manually, as the lay document only contains a reference, not an actual link.",
        "For this reason, only a relatively small amount of data could be collected: 367 pairs of documents (see Table 1 for statistics)."

        "We focus in this paper on finding term equivalents when both terms are recognized by the UMLS.",
        "Thus, our first step in processing our collections is to identify terms as defined by the UMLS.",
        "Both collections are processed by our tool TermFinder (Teufel and Elhadad, 2002).",
        "Sentences are identified and the texts are tokenized and tagged with part-of-speech information.",
        "Noun phrases are identified with a shallow parser.",
        "Next, terms are identified by looking up the noun phrases in the meta-lexicon of UMLS for an exact match.",
        "Terms are tagged with their concept unique identifier (CUI) and a semantic type, both provided by UMLS.",
        "For our purposes, we only consider a subset of all the terms listed in UMLS, based on their semantic type.",
        "This is due to the fact that certain UMLS semantic types are unlikely to yield technical terms in need of simplification.",
        "As such, terms belonging to semantic types such as \"Activity,\" \"Family Group\" or \"Behavior\" were left untagged.",
        "Terms with semantic types such as \"Disease or Syndrome\" or \"Therapeutic or Preventive Procedure,\" on the other hand, were considered terms.",
        "For instance, both the terms PTCA and percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty have the same CUI C0002997, as they are considered synonyms by UMLS.",
        "The term balloon angioplasty has the CUI C0002996.",

        "For any such pair, we can compute a contingency table based on co-occurrence.",
        "Our definition of co-occurrence is slightly unusual: techJerm and layJerm co-occur in one document pair if techJerm appears at least once in the technical document and layJerm appears at least once in the corresponding lay document.",
        "Our unit of content is document frequency for a CUI, i.e., the number of documents in which a given CUI appears.",
        "For instance, in our data, the contingency table for the term pair (MI, heart attack) shows the following counts: the document frequency of the CUI corresponding to MI in the technical collection is 98; the document frequency of the CUI corresponding to heart attack in the lay collection is 161.",
        "Among these documents, there are 84 technical/lay document pairs (out of the total of 367 paired documents) in which the CUI for MI occurs on the technical side and the CUI for heart attack occurs on the lay side.",
        "Hence, the contingency table for this term pair is, following the notations of Table 2: a = 84, b = 98-84 = 14, c = 161-84 = 77, and d = 367-98-161+84 = 192.",
        "At this stage of processing, lexical terms are abstracted by their CUIs.",
        "We do this to maximize the possible evidence that two terms co-occur.",

        "Section 3.7 describes how we proceed from identifying equivalent terms at the CUI level to finding lexical equivalents.",
        "To evaluate the validity of our approach, we collected all possible term pairs at the CUI level in our corpus (that is, all the term pairs for which a contingency table is computed).",
        "We then whittled this set down to those pairs where each CUI occurs in at least two documents.",
        "This resulted in 2,454 pairs of CUIs.",

        "We indicated to our expert that the terms should be equivalent out ofcontext.",

        "One important constraint for the measures to be valid is that the observed data be large enough (more than five observations per cell in the contingency table).",
        "The x statistic for our 2x2 contingency table, and with N being the total number of document pairs, is calculated as follows:",
        "Since x is a true statistic, we can rely on critical values to filter out pairs with low associative power.",

        "Since a lay document is always written based on an original technical document, it is a plausible assumption that the presence of a specific term in the technical document influenced the lexical choices of the author of the lay document.",

        "In our setting in particular, any contingency table where a=b will provide a A of 0.",
        "Since A is computed as a function of maxima of rows and columns, A can easily be biased toward the original proportions in the antecedent.",
        "In our example, for instance, a very large proportion of technical documents has no occurrence of C0011849, diabetes mellitus (94.3% of the technical documents).",
        "But for our purposes, such contingencies should not affect our measure of association, as the proportion of technical documents happening not to contain a particular term is just an artificial consequence of corpus collection.",
        "A* is a variant of A also proposed by Goodman and Kruskal (1979) and is able to take this fact into account.",
        "It is computed using the same formula as A, but the elements of the contingency table are modified so that each category of the antecedent is equally likely.",
        "In our case, this means: N*=1, a*=0.5a/N(a+b), b*=0.5b/N(a+b), c*=0.5c/N(c+d), and d*=0.5d/N(c+d).",
        "Going back to our example of diabetes mellitus and diabetes, we now find A* = 0.324, which is much higher than the original A of 0.094, and which indicates a strong association.",
        "We focus on A* as a measure of association for semantic equivalence of term pairs.",
        "Since A and A* are not true statistics, there is no significance level we can rely on to set a threshold for them.",
        "Instead, we estimate an optimal threshold from the performance of A* on a development set.",
        "The development set was obtained in the same manner as the gold standard and contains 50 term pairs.",
        "This is a small number of pairs, but the term pairs in the development set were carefully chosen to contain mostly semantically equivalent pairs.",
        "In our experiments, the optimal value for A* was 0.3.",
        "Thus, A* is used as a binary test for our purposes: techJerm and layJerm are considered semantically equivalent if their A* is above 0.3.",
        "Odds ratio is a measure of association that focuses on the extent to which one category in the contingency table affects another (Fleiss et al., 2003).",
        "For our contingency table, the odds ratio is expressed as follows:",
        "For instance, given the contingency table of Table 4, the odds ratio for the pair (diabetes mellitus, diabetes) is 12.43, which means that a lay document is 12.43 times more likely to contain the CUI C0011847, for diabetes, if its original technical document contains the term C0011849, for diabetes mellitus.",
        "Like A*, odds ratio is not a true statistic and, therefore, does not have any critical value for statistical significance.",
        "We estimated the optimal value of a threshold for OR based on the same development set described above.",
        "The threshold for OR is set to 6.",
        "Thus, OR is used as a binary test for our purposes: techJerm and layJerm are considered semantically equivalent if their OR is above 6.",
        "Each of the measures of association described above leverages different characteristics of the contingency tables, and similarly, each has its limitations.",
        "For instance, x cannot be computed when there are not sufficient observations, and A* can equal 0, even when there is a strong association between the two terms.",
        "We combine measures of association in the following fashion: two terms are considered equivalent if at least one of the measures determined so.",
        "The measures of association described above and their combination provide information solely based on corpus-derived data.",
        "Since all our counts are based on co-occurrence, a measure of association by itself can encompass many types of semantic relations.",
        "For instance, the pair for (stroke, brain) tests positive with our three measures of association.",
        "Indeed, there is a strong semantic association between the two terms: strokes occur in the brain.",
        "These terms, however, do not fit our definition of semantic equivalence.",
        "We rely on knowledge provided by the UMLS, namely semantic types, to help us filter equivalent types of associations among the candidate term pairs.",
        "One can assume that sharing semantic types is a necessary condition for semantic equivalence.",
        "Our semantic filter consists of testing whether techJerm and layJerm share the same semantic types, as identified by our tool TermFinder.",
        "So far, term pairs are at the CUI level.",
        "The measures of association and the semantic filter provide a way to identify candidates for semantic equivalence.",
        "We still have to figure out which particular lexical items among the different lexical terms of a given CUI are appropriate for a lay reader.",
        "For instance, the pair (C0027051, C0027051) is considered a good candidate for semantic equivalence.",
        "In the technical collection, the lexical terms contributing to the CUI are AMI, AMIs, MI, myocardial infarction, myocardial infarct and myocardial necrosis.",
        "In the lay collection, however, the lexical terms contributing to the same CUI are heart attack, heart attacks, and myocardial infarction.",
        "Clearly, not all lexical items for a given CUI are appropriate for a lay reader.",
        "To select an appropriate lay lexical term, we rely on the term frequency of each lexical item in the lay collection (Elhadad, 2006).",
        "In our example, the lexical term \"heart attack\" has the highest term frequency in the lay collection among all the variants with the same CUI.",
        "Thus, we chose it as a semantic equivalent of any lexical term of the CUI C0027051 in the technical collection.",
        "If a technical term has several candidate semantic equivalents at the CUI level, the lexical lay term is chosen among all the lay terms.",
        "For instance, (adverse effect, side effect) and (adverse effect, complications) are two valid equivalents, but side effects has a term frequency of 16 in our lay collection, and complications has a lay term frequency of 35.",

        "When combined with OR, it improves the recall from 74.3 (odds) to 77 (lam,odds); when combined with x, it improves the recall from 23.7 (chi) to 39.5 (chi,lam).",
        "Combining the three measures of association (chi,lam,odds) yields the best recall (80.3), confirming our hypothesis that the measures are complementary and identify pairs with different characteristics in our corpus.",
        "While combining measures of association improves recall, the semantic filter is very effective in filtering inaccurate pairs and, therefore, improving precision: A*, for instance, improves from a precision of 40.8 (lam) to 76.3 (sem,lam) when the filter is added, with very little change in recall.",
        "The best variant of our system in terms of F measure is, not surprisingly, combining the three measures of association and adding the semantic filter (sem,chi,lam,odds in Table 5).",
        "The results of these experiments are surprisingly good, considering that the contingency tables are built from a corpus of only 367 document pairs and rely on document frequency (not term frequency).",

        "Our work belongs to the field of paraphrase identification.",
        "Much work has been done to build lexicons of semantically equivalent phrases.",
        "In generation systems, a lexicon is built manually (Robin, 1994) or by relying on an electronic thesaurus like WordNet (Langkilde and Knight, 1998) and setting constraints on the type of accepted paraphrases (for instance, accepting only synonyms as paraphrases, and not hypernyms).",
        "Building paraphrase lexicons from a corpus has also been investigated.",
        "Jacquemin and colleagues (1997) identify morphological and syntactic variants of technical terms.",
        "Barzilay and McKeown (2001) identify multi-word paraphrases from a sentence-aligned corpus of monolingual parallel texts.",
        "One interesting finding of this work is that the mined paraphrases were distributed across different semantic links in WordNet: some paraphrases had a hypernym relation, while others were synonyms, and others had no semantic links at all.",
        "The composition of our gold standard confirms this finding, since half of the semantically equivalent terms had different CUIs (see Table 3 for examples of such pairs).",
        "If we consider technical and lay writing styles as two sublanguages, it is easy to see an analogy between our task and that of machine translation.",
        "Identifying translations for words or phrases has been deeply investigated in the field of statistical machine translation.",
        "The IBM models of word alignments are the basis for most algorithms to date.",
        "All of these are instances of the EM algorithm (Expectation Maximization) and rely on large corpora aligned at the sentence level.",
        "We cannot apply an EM-based model to our task since we have a very small corpus of paired technical/lay documents, and EM requires large amounts of data to achieve accurate results.",
        "Moreover, the technical and lay documents are not parallel, and thus, we do not have access to a sentence alignment.",
        "Of course, our task is easier than the one of machine translation, since we focus on \"translating\" only technical terms, rather than every single word in a technical document.",
