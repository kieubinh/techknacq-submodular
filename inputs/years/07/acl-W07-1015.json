        "During the past years, clinical practices have considerably evolved towards standardization and effectiveness.",
        "A major improvement is the development of practice guidelines (Brownson et al., 2003).",
        "However, even if widely distributed to hospitals, doctors and other medical staff, clinical practice guidelines are not routinely fully exploited.",
        "There is now a general tendency to transfer these guidelines to electronic devices (via an appropriate XML format).",
        "This transfer is justified by the assumption that electronic documents are easier to browse than paper documents.",
        "However, migrating a collection of texts to XML requires a lot of re-engineering.",
        "More precisely, it means analyzing the full set of textual documents so that they can fit with strict templates, as required either by XML schemas or DTD (document type definition).",
        "Unfortunately, most of the time, the semantic blocks of information required by the XML model are not explicitly marked in the original text.",
        "These blocks of information correspond to discourse structures.",
        "This problem has thus renewed the interest for the recognition and management of discourse structures, especially for technical domains.",
        "In this study, we show how technical documents belonging to a certain domain (namely, clinical practice guidelines) can be semi-automatically structured using NLP techniques.",
        "Practice guidelines describe best practices with the aim of guiding decisions and criteria in specific areas of healthcare, as defined by an authoritative examination of current evidence (evidence-based medicine, see Wikipedia or Brownson et al., 2003).",
        "The Guideline Elements Model (GEM) is an XML-based guideline document model that can store and organize the heterogeneous information contained in practice guidelines (Schiffman, 2000).",
        "It is intended to facilitate translation of natural language guideline documents into a format that can be processed by computers.",
        "The main element of",
        "GEM, knowledge component, contains the most useful information, especially sequences of conditions and recommendations.",
        "Our aim is thus to format these documents which have been written manually without any precise model, according to the GEM DTD (see annex A).",
        "The organization of the paper is as follows: first, we present the task and some previous approaches (section 2).",
        "We then describe the different processing steps (section 3) and the implementation (section 4).",

        "As we have previously seen, practice guidelines are not routinely fully exploited.",
        "One reason is that they are not easily accessible to doctors during consultation.",
        "Moreover, it can be difficult for the doctor to find relevant pieces of information from these guides, even if they are not very long.",
        "To overcome these problems, national health agencies try to promote the electronic distribution of these guidelines (so that a doctor could check recommendations directly from his computer).",
        "Several attempts have already been made to improve the use of practice guidelines: for example knowledge-based diagnostic aids can be derived from them (e.g. Seroussi et al., 2001).",
        "GEM is an intermediate document model, between pure text (paper practice guidelines) and knowledge-based models like GLIF (Peleg et al., 2000) or EON (Tu and Musen, 2001).",
        "GEM is thus an elegant solution, independent from any theory or formalisms, but compliant with other frameworks.",
        "GEM Cutter (http://gem.med.yale.edu/) is a tool aimed at aiding experts to fill the GEM DTD from texts.",
        "However, this software is only an interface allowing the end-user to perform the task through a time-consuming cut-and-paste process.",
        "The overall process described in Shiffman et al.",
        "(2004) is also largely manual, even if it is an attempt to automate and regularize the translation process.",
        "The main problem in the automation of the translation process is to identify that a list of recommendations expressed over several sentences is under the scope of a specific condition (conditions may refer to a specific pathology, a specific kind of patients, temporal restrictions, etc.).",
        "However, previous approaches have been based on the analysis of isolated sentences.",
        "They do not compute the exact scope of conditional sequences (Georg and Jaulent, 2005): this part of the work still has to be done by hand.",
        "Our automatic approach relies on work done in the field of discourse processing.",
        "As we have seen in the introduction, the most important sequences of text to be tagged correspond to discourse structures (conditions, actions ...).",
        "Although most researchers agree that a better understanding of text structure and text coherence could help extract knowledge, descriptive frameworks like the one developed by Halliday and Hasan are poorly formalized and difficult to apply in practice.",
        "Some recent works have proposed more operational descriptions of discourse structures (Péry-Woodley, 1998).",
        "Several authors (Halliday and Matthiessen, 2004; Charolles, 2005) have investigated the use of non-lexical cues for discourse processing (e.g temporal adverbials like \"in 1999\").",
        "These adverbials introduce situation frames in a narrative discourse, that is to say a 'period' in the text which is dependent from the adverbial.",
        "We show in this study that condition sequences play the same role in practice guidelines: their scope may run over several dependent clauses (more precisely, over a set of several recommendations).",
        "Our plan is to automatically recognize these using surface cues and processing rules.",
        "Our aim is to semi-automatically fill a GEM template from existing guidelines: the algorithm is fully automatic but the result needs to be validated by experts to yield adequate accuracy.",
        "Our system tries to compute the exact scope of conditional sequences.",
        "In this paper we apply it to the analysis of several French practice guidelines.",
        "The main aim of the approach is to go from a textual document to a GEM based document, as shown on Figure 1 (see also annex A).",
        "We focus on conditions (including temporal restrictions) and recommendations since these elements are of paramount importance for the task.",
        "They are especially difficult to deal with since they require to accurately compute the scope of conditions.",

        "This default segmentation corresponds to a highly conventionalized writing style used in the document (a norm).",

        "If the condition is included in the sequence (inside a sentence), its default scope is restricted to the current sentence (Charolles, 2005 for similar observations on different text types).",
        "This default segmentation can be revised if some linguistic cues suggest another more accurate segmentation (violation of the norm).",
        "We make use of Halliday's theory of text cohesion (Halliday and Hasan, 1976).",
        "According to this theory, some \"cohesion cues\" suggest extending the default segmentation while some others suggest limiting the scope of the conditional sequence (see section 3.4).",
        "The preprocessing stage concerns the analysis of relevant linguistic cues.",
        "These cues vary in nature: they can be based either on the material structure or the content of texts.",

        "The scope of conditions is recognized with accuracy above .7 (we calculated this score using the same method as for inter-annotator agreement, see section 5.2).",
        "This result is encouraging, especially considering the large number of parameters involved in discourse processing.",
        "In most of successful cases the scope of a condition is recognized by the default rule (default segmentation, see section 3.4).",
        "However, some important cases are solved due to the detection of cohesion or boundary cue (especially titles).",
        "The system fails to recognize extended scopes (beyond the default boundary) when the cohesion marks correspond to lexical items which are related (synonyms, hyponyms or hypernyms) or to complex anaphora structures (nominal anaphora; hypo-nyms and hypernyms can be considered as a special case of nominal anaphora).",
        "Resolving these rarer complex cases would require \"deep\" domain knowledge which is difficult to implement using state-of-art techniques."
