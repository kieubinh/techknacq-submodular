        "Recognition of named entities (NER), such as names referring to genes and proteins, forms a major building block for text mining systems.",
        "Especially in the life sciences, a large amount of different entity types and their instances exist.",
        "Two basic strategies for NER are classification-and dictionary-based approaches.",
        "Classifiers learn (or are given) models to decide whether a sequence of tokens refers to an entity or not.",
        "Such decisions are based on various forms of input, for instance, tokens and their sequence in a sentence, part-of-speech tags, characteristic suffixes, and trigger keywords (Hakenberg et al., 2005).",
        "Models can be learned from a given training sample.",
        "Dictionary-based approaches rely on curated word lists containing (all known) representatives of an entity type.",
        "Manual or automated refinement of the dictionary and inexact matching strategies allow to cover a broad spectrum of name variations (Hanisch et al., 2005).",
        "Classification-based approaches have proven to be very robust towards unseen tokens and names, because they also incorporate knowledge on names of the given class in general (Crim et al., 2005).",
        "Dictionaries, on the other hand, reflect the knowledge about an entity class at a given time, and such approaches cannot find instances unknown to them.",
        "However, the main advantage of dictionary-based NER is that they bring the explicit possibility to map recognized entities to the source of the entries (most times, a database.)",
        "This alleviates the task of named entity identification (NEI) that is needed to annotate texts properly or link text-mined facts to database entries.",
        "In this paper, we want to concentrate on dictionary-based approaches and present ideas of how these could be automatically refined and enriched.",
        "In such a setting, named entity recognition functions as a method of 'spotting' entities in a text, after which further identification (disambiguation) is needed.",
        "NER components thus should guarantee very high recall rates with a reasonable precision.",
        "NEI then refines the predictions of NER, eliminating false positive annotations and identifying names.",
        "That such a setup would perform quite well is reflected, for example, in a study presented by Xu et al.",
        "(2007).",
        "They showed that sophisticated disambiguation strategies currently yield up to 93.9% precision (for mouse genes; yeast: 89.5%, fly: 77.8%.)",
        "Participants in the BioCreAtlvE 2 challenge showed similar values for human genes (up to 84.1% precision, 87.5% recall, or 81.1% F1), see Morgan and Hirschman (2007) for a summary.",
        "Hand-coded rules for creating spelling variations have been proposed before, see section on Related Work.",
        "Such rules are applied to synonyms to generate morphological and orthographical variations (\"Fas ligand\" – \"Fas ligands\" and \"Ifn gamma\" – \"Ifn-Y\", respectively).",
        "In the same manner, systems use known patterns for structural changes of names and mappings for lexical variations to enrich existing dictionaries (\"CD95R\" – \"receptor of CD95\" and \"gastric alcohol dehydrogenase\" – \"stomach alcohol dehydrogenase\").",
        "Our research question in this paper is, how such rules can be learned automatically from dictionaries that contain entries of the same entity class with multiple, typical synonyms each.",
        "Learning about the composition of names comes down to an analysis of known names.",
        "A human, given the same task, would look through a lot of examples to derive term formation patterns.",
        "Questions to ask are:",
        "• What are frequent orthographical and morphological variations?",

        "• Which are the parts of a name that can be exchanged with other terms or skipped entirely?",
        "• Which are the important parts of a name, which are additional descriptive elements?",
        "In this paper, we demonstrate methods to analyze names in order to find the semantically important parts.",
        "We map these parts to potential syntactic variations thereof observed within a name and its synonyms.",
        "We assess the frequency of such mappings (exchange of tokens, different ordering of tokens, etc.)",
        "and transfer this knowledge to all other names in the same dictionary.",
        "In this setup, understanding a name results in a structured decomposition of the name.",
        "Such decompositions provide knowledge on how to find (and identify) the name in arbitrary text, as they give insights into its mandatory, unique, and ambiguous parts.",
        "This paper should be seen as a vision paper, though we implemented most of the ideas presented herein and show first results.",
        "We first explain the idea behind learning name composition rules, motivated by manual curation as described in Related Work.",
        "We then explain the basic techniques needed for our analysis.",
        "We show how single entries (a name and all its synonyms) can be analyzed to find composition rules, and how these can be transferred to other entries.",
        "Preliminary results using some of the ideas presented here are also given.",

        "A recent assessment of named entity recognition and identification was done during the BioCreAtIvE 2 evaluation.",
        "Official results will be available in April 2007.",

        "Hanisch et al.",
        "(2005) proposed the ProMiner system to recognize and identify protein names in text.",
        "They observed that the ordering of tokens in a name occur quite frequently, but do not change the semantics of the overall name.",
        "They presented a model for protein names, partitioning tokens into token classes according to their semantic significance: modifiers (\"receptor\"), specifiers (\"alpha\"), non-descriptive tokens (\"fragment\"), standard tokens (\"TNF\"), plus common English words and interpunctuation.",

        "and expand and prune it afterwards.",
        "Expansion and pruning are based on manually defined rules (separating numbers and words, expanding known unambiguous synonyms with known synonyms, applying curation lists maintained by biological experts, predefined regular expressions).",
        "The final matching procedure found names by comparing (expanded) tokens and their classes to arbitrary text, where some token classes were mandatory for the identification and others could be missing.",
        "ProMiner yielded results between 78 and 90% F1-measure on the BioCreAtIvE 1 (Task 1B), depending on the organism-specific sub-task.",
        "The highest recall was found to be 84.1% for fly, 81.4% for mouse, and 84.8% for yeast genes.",
        "We used a similar method, relying entirely on manually defined rules for name variations, for the",
        "BioCreAtIvE 2 GN task (Hakenberg et al., 2007).",
        "We expanded the dictionary applying these rules to every synonym (treating abbreviations and spelled-out names slightly different).",
        "This yielded a recall of 92.7 and 87.5% on the training and test sets, respectively (F1: 81.1%).",
        "In the aftermath of BioCreAtIvE 2, we now try to improve this high recall values further, by automatically analyzing the whole dictionary of gene names instead of manually composing useful rules in a trial-and-error approach."

        "Afterwards, we explain how such rules can be exchanged between different genes and add to the understanding of each genes 'meaning.'",
        "We apply several techniques to the analysis of names.",
        "To detect abbreviations by pairwise comparison of synonyms, we use the algorithm proposed by Schwartz and Hearst (2003) as the core component.",
        "We changed some of the details so that, for instance, the first letter of the potential abbreviation has to match the first letter of the proposed long form.",
        "We perform the detection of abbreviations not only on whole synonyms, but also on parts of each name (like for \"TNF-alpha stimulated ABC protein\"), so that this property of Schwartz and Hearst's algorithm (S&H) is recovered.",
        "A trivial adaptation also reveals which parts of an abbreviation (one or more characters) map to which parts of the long form (one token, one partial token.)",
        "As S&H allows for missing tokens in the long form, we can also add the possibility for (few) characters in the abbreviation not being reflected in the long form.",
        "To detect inexact matches (that is, slight variations in morphology or orthography), we use an adaptation of the biological sequence alignment algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970).",
        "Using the computed alignment score, this yields an immediate quantification of the similarity of two terms.",
        "We compare the sequence of identified name parts (parts of a name where a mapping from this part to a part of the other synonym exists) in order to find parts that can be skipped or exchanged with each other.",
        "In addition, this yields insights into potential permuations of all parts of a name, and shows where certain parts typically do or do not occur.",

        "In Table 1, the descriptors \"antigen\" and \"ligand\", for instance, appear to be of the same type, but analysis will reveal that while the mention of \"antigen\" in a name is skipped frequently, \"ligand\" represents a mandatory concept in many synonyms.",

        "Knowledge about this kind of relationships has to be encoded in the dictionary, however.",
        "Spotting a gene family's name without any specific number could lead to the assignment of the first member to the match, see Table 3, rule no.",
        "8 (or dismissing the name, depending on user-specific demands).",
        "Such information can also be used for disambiguating names.",
        "Analyzing the names \"CD95 ligand\" and \"CD95 receptor\" of two different genes, it can be concluded that \"CD95\" by itself contains not enough information to justify the identification of either gene directly.",
        "Finding other \"receptor\"s in the dictionary will also mark \"receptor\" as a concept crucial, but not sufficient, for identifying a gene's name in text.",
        "For \"CD95\", on the other hand, we have shown before that this token might be exchanged with others.",
        "Knowledge about (partial) abbreviations, like in aforementioned \"HIF\" = \"Hypoxia-inducible factor\" and \"OR\" = \"olfactory receptor\", can be transferred to all synonyms from other entries in the dictionary that have the same long or short forms (but possibly do not mention the respective other in any synonym.)",
        "Similarly, presumed lexical variations (\"gastric\" versus \"stomach\") that have been found for one gene name (one concept) can be included in all corresponding concepts to spread the information that \"gastric\" can appear as \"stomach\" in text.",
        "This is necessary to detect the name \"stomach alcohol dehydrogenase\", where the corresponding Entrez Gene entry (ADH7, 131) does have the token \"stomach\" in any of its synonyms.",
        "Also, synonyms mentioning the species (like \"hIAN1\" to depict human) are not contained for every entry.",
        "Learning that \"h\" can be added to a gene name helps recognizing such a variation in text for other names (the dictionary lacks the variation \"hFasL\" of FASLG, which is sometimes used.)"

        "We evaluated some ideas presented in this paper on the BioCreAtIvE 2 (BC2) dataset for the gene normalization task.",
        "For the purpose of this study, we were interested in how our method would perform concerning the recall, as compared to methods based on hand-curated dictionary refinement.",
        "We conducted the following experiment: the BC2 GN gold standard consists of references to abstracts (PubMed IDs), genes identified in each abstract (Entrez Gene IDs) and text snippets that comprise each gene's name.",
        "For one abstract, there could be multiple, different snippets representing the same gene, ADH7 (131): \"stomach alcohol dehydrogenase\", \"class IV alcohol dehydrogenase\", or \"sigma-ADH\", all in the same abstract.",
        "For identification, it was sufficient in BC2 to report the ID, regardless of number of occurrences or name variations.",
        "As the method presented in this paper lacks a matching strategy for spotting of names, we performed our initial evaluation on the text snippets only.",
        "Finding the right ID for each snippet thus ultimately yielded the recall performance.",
        "In the above example, we would try to identify ID 131 three times, counting every miss as a false negative.",
        "The methods presented above were able to yield a recall of 73.1%.",
        "With the original BC2 evaluation scheme, we achieve a recall of 84.2%.",
        "Compared to the highest result for our system with a manually refined dictionary, this figure is more than 8% lower.",
        "This shows that still, many name variations are not recognized.",
        "Some errors could be accounted to ranges or enumerations of gene names (\"SMADs 1, 5 and 8\"), others to not far enough reaching analyses: for detecting \"SMAD8\", we only had the synonyms \"SMAD8A\", \"SMAD8B\", and \"SMAD9\" for the correct gene in the dictionary (all are synonyms for the same gene, according to Entrez Gene).",
        "It should thus have been learned that the letter \"A\" can be left out (similar to \"1\", see rule no.",
        "8 in Table 3.)",
        "Another undetected example is \"G(olf) alpha\" (GNAL, 2774).",

        "- guanine nucleotide binding protein (G protein), alpha stimulating activity polypeptide, olfactory type - Adenylate cyclase-stimulating G alpha protein, olfactory type - Guanine nucleotide-binding protein, alpha-subunit, olfactory",
        "to this mentioning in text could have been deduced as follows:",
        "(1) Learn in another gene: description before \"protein\" can be left out => \"G(olf), alpha subunit\" could be a name of its own.",
        "(2) Learn in this or another gene: \"alpha subunit\" can be expressed as \"alpha\" (or \"subunit\" skipped) => \"G(olf) alpha\" could be a name.",
        "We see that most orthographical and morphological variations (Greek symbols/English words, singular/plural forms, capitalization) can be integrated quite easily in matching techniques.",
        "The general knowledge about such variations is far-reaching and can be applied to most domains.",
        "In contrast, structural and lexical variations are much harder to pinpoint and express in general ways; mostly, such possible variations are specific to a sub-domain and thus present the main challenge for our method.",
        "The ideas discussed in this paper originated from work on the aforementioned BioCreAtIvE 2 task.",
        "In that work, we used manually designed rules to generate variations of gene names.",
        "Hanisch et al.",
        "(Hanisch et al., 2005) and other groups propose similar methods all based on human observation and experience leading to refined dictionaries.",
        "As many causes for name variations are easy to spot and express, we concluded it was entirely possible to gain such insights in an automated manner.",
        "Left undetermined is the potential impact of composition rules on machine-learning techniques that use dictionaries as input for features.",
        "However, the methodology should work for other task using the same or similar initial observations (This remains to be proven.)",
        "We are currently applying the method to the analysis of Gene Ontology terms (Ashburner et al., 2000).",
        "There, many terms are mere descriptions of concepts than precise labels, and there are less additional synonyms (with structural and lexical variations.)",
        "A good starting point for assessing possible patterns in name composition could also be the MeSH controlled vocabulary.",
        "Entries in MeSH typically contain many structural and lexical variations, a deeper understanding of which bears more insights than of orthographical or morphological variations.",
        "Readers of this manuscript should either gain more insights into name compositions of gene names in order to help refining dictionaries based on manual rule sets-, or be convinced that the idea of learning composition rules can be tackled in automated ways, promising examples of and basic techniques for which we discussed herein.",
