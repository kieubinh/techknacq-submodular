        "However, when a POS tagger is simply ported to another domain the tagger's accuracy drops.",
        "This problem can be addressed through hand annotation of a corpus in the new domain and supervised training of a new tagger.",
        "In our methodology, we use existing raw text and a generic POS annotated corpus to develop taggers for new domains without hand annotation or supervised training.",
        "We focus in particular on out-of-vocabulary words since they reduce accuracy (Lease and Charniak.",
        "2005; Smith et al.",
        "2005).",
        "There is substantial information in the derivational suffixes and few inflectional suffixes of English.",
        "We look at individual words and their suffixes along with the morphologically related words to build a domain specific lexicon containing POS tags and probabilities for each word."

        "3) Construct a partial sub-domain lexicon matching relative frequencies of morphologically related words with words from the generic annotated text averaging POS probabilities of the k nearest neighbors.",
        "4) Combine common generic words and orthographic word categories with the partial lexicon making the sub-domain lexicon.",

        "Next we biased a few initial state transition probabilities, changing P(VB|MD) from very high to a very low and increasing P(NN|NN), and attained an accuracy of 94.63%.",
