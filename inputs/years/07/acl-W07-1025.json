      "text": [
        "Various rule-based, statistical, and machine learning methods have been developed for the purpose of information extraction.",
        "Unfortunately, they have rarely been tested on Polish texts, whose rich in-Sectional morphology and relatively free word order is challenging.",
        "Here, we present results of two experiments aimed at extracting information from mammography reports and hospital records of diabetic patients.",
        "Since there are no annotated corpora of Polish medical text which can be used in supervised statistical methods, and we do not have enough data for weakly supervised methods, we chose the rule-based extraction schema.",
        "The processing procedure in both experiments consisted of four stages: text preprocessing, application of IE rules based on the morphological information and domain lexicons, postprocessing (data cleaning and structuring), and conversion into a relational database.",
        "Preprocessing included format unification, data anonymization, and (for mammography reports) automatic spelling correction.",
        "The extraction rules were defined as grammars of the SProUT system, (DroZdZynski et al., 2004).",
        "SProUT consists of a set of processing components for basic linguistic operations, including tokeniza-tion, sentence splitting, morphological analysis (for Polish we use Morfeusz (Wolinski, 2006)) and gazetteer lookup.",
        "The SproUT components are combined into a pipeline that generates typed feature structures (TFS), on which rules in the form of regular expressions with unification can operate.",
        "Small specialized lexicons containing both morphological and semantic (concept names) information have been created for both document types.",
        "Extracted attribute values are stored in a relational database.",
        "Before that, mammography reports results undergo additional postprocessing – grouping together of extracted data.",
        "Specially designed scripts put limits that separate descriptions of anatomical changes, tissue structure, and diagnosis.",
        "More details about mammography IE system can be found in (Mykowiecka et al., 2005)."

        "In both cases, the relevant part of the ontology was translated into a TFS hierarchy.",

        "For the first task, nearly the entire text is covered by the rules, while for the second, only a small part of the text is extracted (e.g., from many blood tests we are interested only in HBA1C).",
        "Polish inflection is handled by using the morphological analyzer and by inserting the most frequent morphological forms into the gazetteer.",
