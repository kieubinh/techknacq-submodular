        "There are two major approaches for the automatic indexing of text documents: statistical approaches that rely on various word counting techniques [such as vector space models (Salton, 1989), Latent Semantic Indexing (Deerwester et al., 1990) or probabilistic models (Sparck-Jones et al., 2000)] and linguistic approaches that involve syntactical and lexical analysis [see for example term extraction and term variation recognition in systems such as MetaMap (Aronson, 2001), FASTR (Jacquemin and Tzoukermann, 1999) or IndDoc (Nazarenko and Ait El Mekki, 2005)].",
        "In many cases, the combination of these approaches has been shown to improve the performance of a single approach both for controlled indexing (Aronson et al., 2004) and free text indexing (Byrne and Klein, 2003).",

      "heading": "2. A k-Nearest-Neighbors approach for indexing",
      "text": [
        "The k-Nearest-Neighbors (k-NN) approach views indexing as a multi-class classification problem where a document may be assigned several \"classes\" in the form of indexing terms.",
        "It requires a large set of labeled data composed of previously indexed documents.",
        "k-NN relies on the assumption that similar documents should be classified in a similar way.",
        "The algorithm consists of two steps: 1/documents that are most \"similar\" to the query document must be retrieved from the set of labeled documents.",
        "They are considered as \"neighbors\" for the query document; 2/an indexing set must be produced from these and assigned to the query document.",
        "Finding similar documents",
        "All documents are represented using a vector of distinctive features within the representation space.",
        "Based on this representation, labeled documents may be ranked according to their similarity to the query document using usual similarity measures such as cosine or Dice.",
        "The challenge in this step is to define an appropriate representation space for the documents and to select optimal features for each document.",
        "Another issue is the number (k) of neighbors that should be selected to use in the next step.",
        "Producing an indexing set",
        "When applied to a single-class classification problem, the class that is the most frequent among the k neighbors is usually assigned to the query document.",
        "Indexing is a multi-class problem for which the number of classes a document should be assigned is not known, as it may vary from one document to another.",
        "Therefore, indexing terms from the neighbor documents are all taken into account and ranked according to the number of neighbors that were labeled with them.",
        "The more neighbors labeled with a given indexing term, the higher the confidence that it will be a relevant indexing term for the query document.",
        "This resulting indexing set may then be filtered to select only the terms that were obtained from a defined minimum number of neighbors.",
        "A generic representation of documents is obtained from the text formed by the title and abstract.",
        "This text is processed so that punctuation is removed, stop-words from a predefined list (of 310 words) are removed, remaining words are switched to lower case and a minimal amount of stemming is applied.",
        "As described by Salton (1989) words should be weighted according to the number of times they occur in the query document and the number of times they occur in the whole collection (here, MEDLINE).",
        "Moreover, words from the title are given an additional weight compared to words from the abstract.",
        "Further adjustments relative to document length and local weighting according to the Poisson distribution are detailed in (Aronson et al., 2000; Kim et al., 2001) where the PubMed Related Citations (PRC) algorithm is discussed.",
        "Further experiments showed that the best results were obtained by using the ten nearest neighbors.",
        "Domain-specific representation",
        "In specialized domains, documents from the literature may be represented with concepts or objects commonly used or studied in the field.",
        "For example, (Rhodes et al., 2007) meet specific chemistry oriented search needs by representing US patents and patent applications with molecular information in the form of chemical terms and structures.",
        "A similar representation is used for PubChem (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) records.",
        "In the genetics domain, genes are among the most commonly discussed or manipulated concepts.",
        "Therefore, genes should provide a relevant domain-specific description of documents from the genetics literature.",
        "The second indexing algorithm that we describe in this paper, know as the Gene Reference Into Function (GeneRIF) Related Citations (GRC) algorithm, uses \"GeneRIF\" links (defined in the paragraph below) to retrieve neighbors for a query document.",
        "To form a specific representation of the document, gene names are retrieved by ABGene (Ta-nabe and Wilbur, 2002) and mapped to Entrez Gene unique identifiers.",
        "The mapping was performed with a version of SemRep (Rindflesch and Fiszman, 2003) restricted to human genes.",
        "It consists in normalizing the gene name (switch to lower case, remove spaces and hyphens) and matching the resulting string to one of the gene names or aliases listed in Entrez Gene.",
        "For each gene, the GeneRIF links supply a subset of MEDLINE citations manually selected by NLM indexers for describing the functions associated with the gene.",
        "These sets were used in two ways:",
        "To complete the document representation.",
        "If a citation was included in the GeneRIF of a given gene, the gene was given an additional weight in the document representation.",
        "To limit the set of possible neighbors.",
        "In the generic representation, all MEDLINE citations contain the representation features, words.",
        "Therefore, they all have to be considered as potential neighbors.",
        "However, only a subset of citations actually contains genes.",
        "Therefore, only those citations need to be considered as potential neighbors.",
        "This observation enables us to limit the specific processing to relevant citations.",
        "Possible neighbors for a query document consist of the union of the GeneRIF citations corresponding to each gene in the document representation.",
        "For each query document, the set of possible neighbors was processed and ranked according to gene similarity using a cosine measure.",
        "Table 1 shows the description of a sample MEDLINE citation and its two nearest neighbors.",

        "5 Discussion 5.1 Performance of the methods",
        "As can be seen from the bolded figures in table 2, the best performance is obtained either from the PRC algorithm, or from a combination of PRC and GRC.",
        "When indexing methods are combined, it is usually expected that statistical methods will provide the best recall whereas linguistic methods will provide the best precision.",
        "Combining complementary methods is then expected to provide the best overall performance.",
        "In this context, it seems that the option of pooling the indexing sets should be retained for further experiments.",
        "The most significant result of this study is that the pooling of methods achieves a recall of 92% for standalone subheading retrieval.",
        "While the precision is only 19%, the selection of standalone subheadings offered by our methods is nearly exhaustive and it reduces by 70% the size of the list of allowable subheadings that could potentially be used.",
        "NLM indexers have declared this could prove very useful to enhance their indexing practice.",
        "In order to qualify the added value of the specific description, we looked at the descriptors that were correctly recommended by GRC and not recommended by PRC.",
        "Check Tags (descriptors used to denote the species, age and gender of the subjects discussed in an article) seemed prominent, but only Human was significantly recommended correctly more often than it was recommended incorrectly (~2.2 times more correct than incorrect recommendations - 2,712 correct vs. 1,250 incorrect).",
        "No other descriptor could be identified as being consistently recommended either correctly or incorrectly.",
        "Specifrepresent",
        "For both methods, filtering the indexing sets according to the number of neighbors that lead to include the indexing terms results in an increase of precision and a loss of recall.",
        "The best trade-off (measured by F1) is obtained when indexing terms come from at least three neighbors (data not shown).",
        "5.2 A scale of indexing performance",
        "The problem with evaluating indexing is that, although inter-indexer variability is reduced when a controlled vocabulary is used, indexing is an open cognitive task for which there is no unique \"right\" solution.",
        "In practice, this means that there is no ideal unique set of descriptors to use for the indexing of a particular document.",
        "Therefore, when comparing an indexing set obtained automatically (e.g. here with the PRC or GRC methods) to a \"gold standard\" indexing set produced by a trained indexer (e.g. here, NLM indexers) the difference observed can be due to erroneous descriptors produced by the automatic methods.",
        "But it is also likely that the automatic methods will produce terms that are semantically close to what the human indexer selected or even relevant terms that the human indexer considered or forgot to select.",
        "While evaluation methods to assess the semantic similarity between indexing sets are investigated (Neveol et al.",
        "2006), a consistency study by Funk et al.",
        "(1983) can shade some light on inter-indexer consistency in MEDLINE and what range of performance may be expected from automatic systems.",
        "In this study, Hooper's consistency (the average proportion of terms in agreement between two indexers) for standalone subheadings (SH) was 48.7%.",
        "It was 33.8% for pairs (MH/SH) and 48.2% for main headings (MH).",
        "In light of these figures, although no direct comparison with the results of our experiment is possible, the precision obtained from the common recommendations (especially for standalone subheadings, 36%) seems reasonably useful.",
        "Further more, when informally presenting the indexers sample recommendations obtained with these methods, they expressed their interest in the high recall as reviewing a larger selection of potentially useful terms might help them track important descriptors they may not have thought of using otherwise.",
        "In comparison with other research, the results are also encouraging: the recall resulting from either PRC or pooling the indexing sets is significantly better than that obtained by Neveol et al.",
        "(2007) on a larger set of MEDLINE 2005 citations - 20% at best for main heading/subheading pairs with a dictionary-based method which consisted in extracting main heading and subheading separately from the citations (using MTI and string matching dictionary entries) before forming all the allowable pairs as recommendations.",
        "5.3 Limitations of the experiment",
        "In the specific description, the mapping between gene names and Entrez Gene IDs only takes human genes into account, which potentially limits the scope of the method, since many more organisms and their genes may be discussed in the literature.",
        "In some cases, this limitation can lead to confusion with other organisms.",
        "For example, the gene EPO \"erythropoietin\" is listed in Entrez Gene for 11 organisms including Homo Sapiens.",
        "With our current algorithm, this gene will be assumed to be a human gene.",
        "In the case of PMID 15213094 in our test corpus, the organism discussed in the paper was in fact Mus Musculus (common mouse).",
        "In this particular case, the check tag Humans, which was erroneous, could be found in the candidate indexing set.",
