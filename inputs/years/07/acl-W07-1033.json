        "Difficulty and potential application of biomedical named-entity recognition has attracted many researchers of both natural language processing and bioinformatics.",
        "The difficulty of the task largely stems from a wide variety of named entity expressions used in the domain.",
        "It is common for practical protein or gene databases to contain hundreds of thousands of items.",
        "Such a large variety of vocabulary naturally leads to long names with productive use of general words, making the task difficult to be solved by systems with naive Markov assumption of label sequences, because such systems must perform their prediction without seeing the entire string of the entities.",
        "Importance of the treatment of long names might be implicitly indicated in the performance comparison of the participants of JNLPBA shared task (Kim et al., 2004), where the best performing system (Zhou and Su, 2004) attains their scores by extensive post-processing, which enabled the system to make use of global information of the entity labels.",
        "After the shared task, many researchers tackled the task by using conditional random fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001), which seemed to promise improvement over locally optimized models like maximum entropy Markov models (MEMMs) (McCallum et al., 2000).",
        "However, many of the CRF systems developed after the shared task failed to reach the best performance achieved by Zhou et al.",
        "One of the reasons may be the deficiency of the dynamic programming-based systems, that the global information of sequences cannot be incorporated as features of the models.",
        "Another reason may be that the computational complexity of the models prevented the developers to invent effective features for the task.",
        "We had to wait until Tsai et al.",
        "(2006), who combine pattern-based postprocessing with CRFs, for CRF-based systems to achieve the same level of performance as Zhou et al.",
        "As such, a key to further improvement of the performance of bio-entity recognition has been to employ global features, which are effective to capture the features of long names appearing in the bio domain.",
        "In this paper, we use reranking architecture, which was successfully applied to the task of natural language parsing (Collins, 2000; Charniak and",
        "Johnson, 2005), to address the problem.",
        "Reranking enables us to incorporate truly global features to the model of named entity tagging, and we aim to realize the state-of-the-art performance without depending on rule-based post-processes.",
        "Use of global features in named-entity recognition systems is widely studied for sequence labeling including general named-entity tasks like CoNLL 2003 shared task.",
        "Such systems may be classified into two kinds, one of them uses a single classifier which is optimized incorporating non-local features, and the other consists of pipeline of more than one classifiers.",
        "The former includes Relational Markov Networks by Bunescu et al.",
        "(2004) and skip-edge CRFs by Sutton et al.",
        "(2004).",
        "A major drawback of this kind of systems may be heavy computational cost of inference both for training and running the systems, because non-local dependency forces such models to use expensive approximate inference instead of dynamic-programming-based exact inference.",
        "The latter, pipelined systems include a recent study by Krishnan et al.",
        "(2006), as well as our reranking system.",
        "Their method is a two stage model of CRFs, where the second CRF uses the global information of the output of the first CRF.",
        "Though their method is effective in capturing various non-local dependencies of named entities like consistency of labels, we may be allowed to claim that reranking is likely to be more effective in bio-entity tagging, where the treatment of long entity names is also a problem.",
        "This paper is organized as follows.",
        "First, we briefly overview the JNLPBA shared task of bio-entity recognition and its related work.",
        "Then we explain the components of our system, one of which is an MEMM n-best tagger, and the other is a reranker based on log-linear models.",
        "Then we show the experiments to tune the performance of the system using the development set.",
        "Finally, we compare our results with the existing systems, and conclude the paper with the discussion for further improvement of the system."

        "Though existing studies suggest that changing the tag set of the original corpus, such as splitting of O tags, can contribute to the performances of named entity recognizers (Peshkin and Pfefer, 2003), our system uses the original tagset of the training data, except that the 'BOS' label is added to represent the state before the beginning of sentences.",

        "We expect that reranking architecture can readily accommodate dictionary-based features, because we can apply elaborated string-matching algorithms to the qualified candidate strings available at reranking phase.",
        "We also plan to apply self-training of n-best tagger which successfully boosted the performance of one of the best existing English syntactic parser (McClosky et al., 2006).",
        "Since the test data of the shared-task consists of articles that represent the different publication years, the effects of the publication years of the texts used for self-training would be interesting to study.",
