        "Multiword expressions (MWEs) are widely used in written language as well as in colloquial speech.",
        "An MWE is composed of two or more words that together form a single unit of meaning, e.g., frying pan, take a stroll, and kick the bucket.",
        "Most MWEs behave like any phrase composed of multiple words, e.g., their components may be separated, as in She took a relaxing stroll along the beach.",
        "Nonetheless, MWEs are distinct from multiword phrases because they involve some degree of semantic idiosyncrasy, i.e., the overall meaning of an MWE diverges from the combined contribution of its constituent parts.",
        "Because of their frequency and their peculiar behaviour, MWEs pose a great challenge to the creation of natural language processing (NLP) systems (Sag et al., 2002).",
        "NLP applications, such as semantic parsing and machine translation should not only identify MWEs, but also should know how to treat them when they are encountered.",
        "Semantic idiosyncrasy is a matter of degree (Nunberg et al., 1994).",
        "The idiom shoot the breeze is largely idiosyncratic, because its meaning (\"to chat\") does not have much to do with the meaning of shoot or breeze.",
        "MWEs such as give a try (\"try\") and make a decision (\"decide\") are semantically less idiosyncratic (more predictable).",
        "These are MWEs because the overall meaning of the expression diverges from the combined meanings of the constituents.",
        "Nonetheless, there is some degree of predictability in their meanings that makes them distinct from idioms.",
        "In these, the complement of the verb (here, a noun) determines the primary meaning of the overall expression.",
        "This class of expressions is referred to as light verb constructions (LVCs) in the linguistics literature (Miyamoto, 2000; Butt, 2003).",
        "Clearly, a computational system should distinguish idioms and LVCs, both from each other, and from similar-on-the-surface (literal) phrases such as shoot the bird and give a present.",
        "Idioms are largely idiosyncratic; a computational lexicographer thus may decide to list idioms such as shoot the breeze in a lexicon along with their idiomatic meanings.",
        "In contrast, the meaning of MWEs such as make a decision can be largely predicted, given that they are LVCs.",
        "Table 1 shows the different underlying semantic structure of a sentence containing an idiom (shoot the breeze) and a sentence containing an LVC (give a try).",
        "As can be seen, such MWEs should also be treated differently when translated into another language.",
        "Note that in contrast to a literal combination, such as shoot the bird, for idioms and LVCs, the number of arguments expressed syntactically may differ from the number of the semantic participants.",
        "Many NLP applications also need to distinguish another group of MWEs that are less idiosyncratic",
        "Class English sentence Semantic representation French translation",
        "Table 1: Sample English MWEs and their translation in French.",
        "than idioms and LVCs, but more so than literal combinations.",
        "Examples include give confidence and make a living.",
        "These are idiosyncratic because the meaning of the verb is a metaphorical (abstract) extension of its basic physical semantics.",
        "Moreover, they often take on certain connotations beyond the compositional combination of their constituent meanings.",
        "They thus exhibit behaviour often attributed to collocations, e.g., they appear with greater frequency than semantically similar combinations.",
        "For example, searching on Google, we found much higher frequency for give confidence compared to grant confidence.",
        "As can be seen in Table 1, an abstract combination such as make a living, although largely compositional, may not translate word-forword.",
        "Rather, it should be translated taking into account that the verb has a metaphorical meaning, different from its basic semantics.",
        "Here, we focus on a particular class of English MWEs that are formed from the combination of a verb with a noun in its direct object position, referred to as verb+noun combinations.",
        "Specifically, we provide a framework for identifying members of the following semantic classes of verb+noun combinations: (i) literal phrases (LIT), (ii) abstract combinations (ABS), (iii) light verb constructions (LVC), and (iv) idiomatic combinations (IDM).",
        "Section 2 elaborates on the linguistic properties related to the differences in the degree of semantic idiosyncrasy observed in members of the above four classes.",
        "In Section 3, we propose statistical measures for quantifying each of these properties, and use them as features for type classification of verb+noun combinations.",
        "Section 4 and Section 5 present an evaluation of our proposed measures.",
        "Section 6 discusses the related studies, and Section 7 concludes the paper."

        "Linguists and lexicographers often attribute certain characteristics to semantically idiosyncratic expressions.",
        "Some of the widely-known properties are institutionalization, lexicosyntactic fixedness, and non-compositionality (Cowie, 1981; Gibbs and Nayak, 1989; Moon, 1998).",
        "The following paragraphs elaborate on each property, as well as on its relevance to the identification of the classes under study.",
        "Institutionalization is the process through which a combination of words becomes recognized and accepted as a semantic unit involving some degree of semantic idiosyncrasy.",

        "In contrast to LIT and ABS combinations, IDMs and LVCs are expected to exhibit lexical fixedness to some extent.",
        "An expression is syntactically fixed if it cannot undergo syntactic variations and at the same time retain its original semantic interpretation.",
        "IDMs and LVCs are known to show strong preferences for the syntactic patterns they appear in (Cacciari and Tabossi, 1993; Brinton and Akimoto, 1999).",
        "E.g., compare Joe gave a groan with ?A groan was given by Joe, and Tim kicked the bucket with *Tim kicked the buckets (in the idiom reading).",
        "Nonetheless, the type and degree of syntactic fixedness in LVCs and IDMs are different.",
        "For example, most LVCs prefer the pattern in which the noun is introduced by the indefinite article a (as in give a try and make a decision), whereas this is not the case with IDMs (e.g., shoot the breeze and kick the bucket).",
        "IDMs and LVCs may also exhibit preferences with respect to adjectival modification of their noun constituent.",
        "LVCs are expected to appear both with and without an adjectival modifier, as in give a (loud) groan and make a (wise) decision.",

        "Much recent work on classifying MWEs focuses on determining different levels of compositionality in verb+particle combinations using a measure of distributional similarity (McCarthy et al., 2003; Baldwin et al., 2003; Bannard et al., 2003).",
        "Another group of research attempts to classify a particular MWE subtype, such as verb-particle constructions (VPCs) or LVCs, according to some fine-grained semantic criteria (Wanner, 2004; Uchiyama et al., 2005; Cook and Stevenson, 2006).",
        "Here, we distinguish subtypes of MWEs that are defined according to coarse-grained distinctions in their degree of semantic idiosyncrasy.",
        "Wermter and Hahn (2004) recognize the importance of distinguishing MWE subtypes that are similar to our four classes, but only focus on separating MWEs as one single class from literal combinations.",
        "For this, they use a measure that draws on the limited modifiability of MWEs, in addition to their expected high frequency.",
        "Krenn and Evert (2001) attempt to separate German idioms, LVCs, and literal phrases (of the form verb+prepositional phrase).",
        "They treat LVCs and idioms as institutionalized expressions, and use frequency and several association measures, such as PMI, for the task.",
        "The main goal of their work is to find which association measures are particularly suited for identifying which of these classes.",
        "Here, we look at properties of MWEs other than their institutionalization (the latter we quantify using an association measure).",
        "The work most similar to ours is that of Venkata-pathy and Joshi (2005).",
        "They propose a minimally-supervised classification schema that incorporates a variety of features to group verb+noun combinations according to their level of compositionality.",
        "Their work has the advantage of requiring only a small amount of manually-labeled training data.",
        "However, their classes are defined on the basis of composition-ality only.",
        "Here, we consider classes that are linguistically salient, and moreover need special treatment within a computational system.",
        "Our work is also different in that it brings in a new group of features, the fixedness measures, which prove to be very effective in identifying particular classes of MWEs.",
