        "Most progress has been made especially in the field of multiword identification (Villada Moiron and Tiede-mann, 2006; Katz and Giesbrecht, 2006; Zhang et al., 2006).",
        "Moreover, interesting papers have been written on the representation of MWEs, most of them focusing on a single class of MWEs, see section 2.",
        "This paper elaborates on a standard lexical representation for Dutch MWEs developed within the STEVIN IRME project.",
        "Part of the project focused on the design and implementation of an electronic resource of 5,000 Dutch expressions that meets the criterion of being highly theory-and implementation-independent, and which can be used in various Dutch NLP systems.",
        "The selection of the lexical entries and their properties is corpus-based.",
        "Work has been conducted on collecting Dutch MWEs in the past, yielding one commercial printed dictionary (de Groot, 1999), and an electronic resource called the Referentiebestand Nederlands ('Reference Database of The Dutch Language') (Martin and Maks, 2005), both mainly meant for human users.",
        "No focus had been put on creating a standard representation for Dutch MWEs that can be converted into any system specific representation.",
        "The approach taken is innovative, since it is based on the Equivalence Class Method (ECM) (Odijk, 2004b).",
        "The idea behind the ECM is that MWEs that have the same pattern require the same treatment in an NLP system.",
        "MWEs with the same pattern form so-called Equivalence Classes (ECs).",
        "Having the ECs, it requires some manual work to convert one instance of an EC into a system specific representation, but all other members of the same EC can be done in a fully automatic manner.",
        "This method is really powerful since very detailed pattern descriptions can be used for describing the characteristics of a group of MWEs.",
        "Besides the description of the MWE patterns, we designed a uniform representation for the description of the individual expressions.",

        "The lexical selection of the verb is highly restricted.",
        "Examples of SVCs are give/*make a demo, make/*do a mistake.",
        "As stated, no exhaustive research on a standard representation of MWEs has been done for Dutch before.",

        "The linguistic properties can be of any type, e.g. in line is an MWE according to its syntactic characteristics, since it lacks a determiner preceding the singular count noun line, which is obligatory in standard English grammar.",
        "Various aspects played a role in the representation as it is in the Lexicon ofDutch MWEs.",
        "First of all, the main requirement of the standard encoding is that it can be converted into any system specific representation with a minimal amount of manual work.",
        "The method adopted to achieve this goal is the",
        "Equivalence Class Method (ECM) (Odijk, 2004b).",
        "As stated, the ECM is based on the idea that given a class of MWE descriptions, representations for a specific theory and implementation can be derived.",
        "The procedure is that one instance of an Equivalence Class (EC) must be converted manually.",
        "By defining and formalizing the conversion procedure, the other instances of the same EC can be converted in a fully automatic manner.",
        "In other words, having the ECs consisting of MWEs with the same pattern, it requires some manual work to convert one instance of each EC into a system specific representation, but all other members of the same EC can be done fully automatically.",
        "In the current approach, a formal representation of the patterns has been added to the pattern descriptions.",
        "Since this formal representation is in agreement with a de facto standard for Dutch (van Noord et al., 2006), most Dutch NLP systems are able to use it for the conversion procedure, yielding an optimal reduction of manual labor.",
        "The creation of MWE descriptions is a very timeconsuming task and of course we aim at an error-free result.",
        "Accordingly, we decided to describe the minimal ingredients of an MWE that are needed for successful incorporation in any Dutch NLP system.",
        "For the development of the representation two Dutch parsers are consulted, viz. the Alpino parser and the Rosetta MT system (Rosetta, 1994).",
        "Another requirement of the lexicon structure is that the information needed for the representation is extractable from corpora, since we want to avoid analyses entirely based on speaker-specific intuitions.",

        "In general, our classification conforms to the categorization given in Sag et al.",

        "Fixed MWEs always occur in the same word order and there is no variation in lexical item choice.",
        "Fixed MWEs cannot undergo morpho-syntactic variation and are contiguous, i.e. no other elements can intervene between the words that are part of the fixed MWE.",
