        "The taxonomic approach adopted here, the systematic survey of the lexicon and its formal representation, resulted in a complex linguistic database of Spanish compound adverbs.",
        "This may have many applications, not strictly in Linguistics, but also in Didactics and in Lexicography.",
        "It can further be used in several applications on natural language processing.",
        "The relatively high precision (77,4%) of the finite state methods used in this paper are very encouraging, and in some cases, discussed above, they can and will be improved in a future version both of the reference graphs and of the lexicon-grammar matrices.",
        "However, the major difficulty to a better identification of compound adverbs in texts seems to reside in the fact that no syntactic analysis (parsing) has been performed on the text.",
        "Therefore, there is no possibility of using information regarding (sub-)phrases and other constituents of the compounds in order to preclude incorrect matching.",
        "Another aspect that hinders better results has to do with the formal variation of compound adverbial expressions.",
        "Adverbs present more problems for their recognition as the limit between free sequence and fixed sequence is more difficult to establish than in others categories of compounds.",
        "The building of electronic dictionaries may benefit from a (more) corpus-based approach, so as to retrieve variants of a given lexical entry, but a careful and time-consuming verification is needed in order to group variants as different expressions of the same meaning unit.",
        "Finally, the relatively small portion of the dictionary matched on the corpus imposes that it should be tested on texts of a more diverse nature and of a larger size, thus probably yielding a larger perspective of the use of these idiomatic expressions.",
        "Still, it is now possible to consider the study of the distribution of these adverbs, trying to specify the type of predicates (verbs, nouns, adjectives, mainly) on which they operate.",
