        "Identification of multiword expressions (MWEs), such as car park, make a decision,and kick the bucket, is extremely important for accurate natural language processing (NLP) (Sag et al., 2002).",
        "Most MWEs need to be treated as single units of meaning, e.g., make a decision roughly means \"decide\".",
        "Nonetheless, the components of an MWE can be separated, making it hard for an NLP system to identify the expression as a whole.",
        "Many researchers have recently developed methods for the automatic acquisition of various properties of MWEs from corpora (Lin, 1999; Krenn and Evert, 2001; Baldwin et al., 2003; McCarthy et al., 2003; Venkatapathy and Joshi, 2005; Villada Moiron and Tiedemann, 2006;",
        "Fazly and Stevenson, 2006).",
        "These studies look into properties, such as the collocational behaviour of MWEs, their semantic non-compositionality, and their lexicosyntactic fixedness, in order to distinguish them from similar-on-the-surface literal combinations.",
        "Most of these methods have been aimed at recognizing MWE types; less attention has been paid to the identification of instances (tokens) of MWEs in context.",
        "For example, most such techniques (if successful) would identify make a face as a potential MWE.",
        "This expression is, however, ambiguous between an idiom, as in The little girl made a funny face at her mother, and a literal combination, as in She made a face on the snowman using a carrot and two buttons.",
        "Despite the common perception that phrases that can be idioms are mainly used in their idiomatic sense, our analysis of idioms has shown otherwise.",
        "We found that close to half of these idioms also have a clear literal meaning; and ofthe expressions with a literal meaning, on average around of their usages are literal.",
        "Distinguishing token phrases as MWEs or literal combinations ofwords is thus essential for NLP applications that require the identification of multiword semantic units, such as semantic parsing and machine translation.",
        "Recent studies addressing MWE token classification mainly perform the task as one of word sense disambiguation, and draw on the local context of an expression to disambiguate it.",
        "Such techniques either do not use any information regarding the linguistic properties of MWEs (Birke and Sarkar, 2006), or mainly focus on their non-compositionality (Katz and Giesbrecht, 2006).",
        "Previous work on the identification of MWE types, however, has found other properties of MWEs, such as their syntactic fixedness, to be relevant to their identification (Evert et al., 2004; Fazly and Stevenson, 2006).",
        "In this paper, we propose techniques that draw on this property to classify individual tokens of a potentially idiomatic phrase as literal or idiomatic.",
        "We also put forward classiication techniques that combine such information with evidence from the local context of an MWE.",
        "We explore the hypothesis that informative prior knowledge about the overall syntactic behaviour of an idiomatic expression (type-based knowledge) can be used to determine whether an instance of the expression is used literally or idiomatically (token-based knowledge).",
        "Based on this hypothesis, we develop unsupervised methods for token classiication, and show that their performance is comparable to that of a standard supervised method.",
        "Many verbs can be combined with one or more of their arguments to form MWEs (Cowie et al., 1983; Fellbaum, 2002).",
        "Here, we focus on a broadly documented class of idiomatic MWEs that are formed from the combination of a verb with a noun in its direct object position, as in make a face.",
        "In the rest of the paper, we refer to these verb+noun combinations, which are potentially idiomatic, as VNCs.",
        "In Section 2, we propose unsupervised methods that classify a VNC token as an idiomatic or literal usage.",

        "We irst explain an important linguistic property attributed to idioms – that is, their syntactic fixedness (Section 2.1).",
        "We then propose unsupervised methods that draw on this property to automatically distinguish between idiomatic and literal usages of an expression (Section 2.2).",
        "Idioms tend to be somewhat ixed with respect to the syntactic conigurations in which they occur (Nunberg et al., 1994).",
        "For example, pull one's weight tends to mainly appear in this form when used idiomatically.",
        "Other forms of the expression, such as pull the weights, typically are only used with a literal meaning.",
        "In their work on automatically identifying idiom types, Fazly and Stevenson (2006) – henceforth FS06 – show that an idiomatic VNC tends to have one (or at most a small number of) canonical form(s), which are its most preferred syntactic patterns.",
        "The preferred patterns can vary across different idiom types, and can involve a number of syntactic properties: the voice of the verb (active or passive), the determiner introducing the noun (the, one's, etc.",
        "), and the number of the noun (singular or plural).",
        "For example, while pull one s weight has only one canonical form, holdfire and hold one's fire are two canonical forms of the same idiom, as listed in an idiom dictionary (Seaton and Macaulay, 2002).",
        "In our work, we assume that in most cases, idiomatic usages of an expression tend to occur in a small number of canonical form(s) for that idiom.",
        "We also assume that, in contrast, the literal usages of an expression are less syntactically restricted, and are expressed in a greater variety of patterns.",
        "Because of their relative unrestrictiveness, literal usages may occur in a canonical idiomatic form for that expression, but usages in a canonical form are more likely to be idiomatic.",
        "Usages in alternative syntactic patterns for the expression, which we refer to as the non-canonical forms of the idiom, are more likely to be literal.",
        "Drawing on these assumptions, we develop three unsupervised methods that determine, for each VNC token in context, whether it has an idiomatic or a literal interpretation.",
        "The following paragraphs elaborate on our proposed methods for identifying the idiomatic and literal usages of a VNC: the CForm method that uses knowledge of canonical forms only, and two Diff methods that draw on further contextual evidence as well.",
        "All three methods draw on our assumptions described above, that usages in the canonical form for an idiom are more likely to be idiomatic, and those in other forms are more likely to be literal.",
        "Thus, for all three methods, we need access to the canonical form of the idiom.",
        "Since we want our token identification methods to be unsupervised, we adopt the unsupervised statistical method of FS06 for finding canonical forms for an idiomatic VNC.",
        "This method determines the canonical forms of an expression to be those forms whose frequency is much higher than the average frequency of all its forms.",
        ": The underlying assumption of this method is that information about the canonical form(s) of an idiom type is extremely informative in classifying the meaning ofits individual instances (tokens) as literal or idiomatic.",
        "Our classifies a token as idiomatic if it occurs in the automatically determined canonical form(s) for that expression, and as literal otherwise.",
        ": Our two methods combine local context information with knowledge about the canonical forms of an idiom type to determine if its token usages are literal or idiomatic.",
        "In developing these methods, we adopt a distributional approach to meaning, where the meaning of an expression is approximated by the words with which it co-occurs (Firth, 1957).",
        "Although there may be fine-grained differences in meaning across the idiomatic usages of an expression, as well as across its literal usages, we assume that the idiomatic and literal usages correspond to two coarse-grained senses of the expression.",
        "Since we further assume these two groups of usages will have more in common semantically within each group than between the two groups, we expect that literal and idiomatic usages of an expression will typically occur with different sets of words.",
        "We will refer then to each of the literal and idiomatic designations as a (coarse-grained) meaning of the expression, while acknowledging that each may have multiple fine-grained senses.",
        "Clearly, the success of our method depends on the extent to which these assumptions hold.",
        "We estimate the meaning of a set of usages of an expression as a word frequency vector where each dimension of is the frequency with which",
        "co-occurs with word across the usages of .We similarly estimate the meaning of a single token of an expression as a vector capturing that usage.",
        "To determine if an instance of an expression is literal or idiomatic, we compare its co-occurrence vector to the co-occurrence vectors representing each of the literal and idiomatic meanings of the expression.",
        "We use a standard measure of distributional similarity, , to compare co-occurrence vectors.",
        "In supervised approaches, such as that of Katz and Giesbrecht (2006), co-occurrence vectors for literal and idiomatic meanings are formed from manually-annotated training data.",
        "Here, we propose unsupervised methods for estimating these vectors.",
        "We use one way of estimating the idiomatic meaning of an expression, and two ways for estimating its literal meaning, yielding two methods for token classification.",
        "Our first Diff method draws further on our expectation that canonical forms are more likely idiomatic usages, and non-canonical forms are more likely literal usages.",
        "We estimate the idiomatic meaning of an expression by building a co-occurrence vector,",
        "- , for all uses of the expression in its automatically determined canonical form(s).",
        "Since we hypothesize that idiomatic usages of an expression tend to occur in its canonical form, we expect these co-occurrence vectors to be largely representative of the idiomatic usage of the expression.",
        "We similarly estimate the literal meaning by constructing a cooccurrence vector, j^-wcF, of all uses of the expression in its non-canonical forms.",
        "We use the term - - to refer to this method.",
        "Our second Diff method also uses the vector",
        "- to estimate the idiomatic meaning of an expression.",
        "However, this approach follows that of Katz and Giesbrecht (2006) in assuming that literal meanings are compositional.",
        "The literal meaning of an expression is thus estimated by composing (summing and then normalizing) the co-occurrence vectors for its component words.",
        "The resulting vector is referred to as - , and this method as - - .",
        "For both Diff methods, if the meaning of an instance of an expression is determined to be more similar to its idiomatic meaning (e.g., - - ), then we label it as an idiomatic usage.",

        "Note that all three of our proposed techniques for token identification depend on how accurately the canonical forms of an expression can be acquired.",

        "While a great deal of research has focused on properties of MWE types, such as their compositional-ity, less attention has been paid to issues surrounding MWE tokens.",
        "In this study, we have developed techniques for a semantic classification of tokens of a potential MWE in context.",
        "We focus on a broadly documented class of English MWEs that are formed from the combination of a verb and a noun in its direct object position, referred to as vNCs.",
        "We annotated a total of tokens for vNCs according to whether they are a literal or idiomatic usage, and we found that approximately of the tokens were literal usages.",
        "These figures indicate that automatically determining whether a vNC token is used idiomatically or literally is of great importance for NLP applications.",
        "In this work, we have proposed three unsupervised methods that perform such a task.",
        "Our proposed methods incorporate automatically acquired knowledge about the overall syntactic behaviour of a VNC type, in order to do token classification.",
        "More specifically, our methods draw on the syntactic fixedness of VNCs – a property which has been largely ignored in previous studies of MWE tokens.",
        "Our results confirm the usefulness of this property as incorporated into our methods.",
        "All our methods outperform the baseline of always predicting the most frequent class.",
        "Moreover, considering our approach is unsupervised, our best accuracy of is not substantially lower than the accuracy of a standard supervised approach at .",
