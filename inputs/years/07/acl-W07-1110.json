        "NCs such as satellite navigation system are abundant in news and technical texts.",
        "In other languages such as Chinese, NCs have been more productive since earlier days as evidenced by the fact that many simple words in Chinese are actually a result of compounding of morphemes.",
        "Many aspects in Natural Language Processing (NLP), such as machine translation, information retrieval, question answering, etc.",
        "call for the automatic interpretation of NCs, that is, making explicit the underlying semantic relationships between the constituent concepts.",
        "For example, the semantic relations involved in satellite communication system can be expressed by the conceptual graph (Sowa, 1984) in Figure 1, in which, for instance, the semantic relation between satellite and communication is MANNER.",
        "Due to the productivity of NCs and the lack of syntactic clues to guide the interpretation process, the automatic interpretation of NCs has been proven to be a very difficult problem in",

        "In this paper, we deal with the semantic interpretation of NCs in Chinese.",
        "Especially, we will focus on a subset of NCs in which the head word is a verb nominalization.",
        "Nominalization is a common phenomenon across languages in which a predicative expression is transformed to refer to an event or a property.",
        "For example, the English verb communicate has the related nominalized form communication.",
        "Different from English, Chinese has little morphology.",
        "Verb nominalization in Chinese has the same form as the verb predicate.",
        "Nominalizations retain the argument structure of the corresponding predicates.",
        "The semantic relation between a noun modifier and a verb nominalization head can be characterized by the semantic role the modifier can take respecting to the corresponding verb predicate.",
        "Our method uses a Maximum Entropy model to label coarse-grained semantic roles in Chinese compound nominalizations.",

        "The rule-based approaches such as (Finin, 1980; Mcdonald, 1982; Leonard, 1984; Vanderwende, 1995) think that the interpretation of NCs depends heavily on the constituent concepts and model the semantic interpretation as a slot-filling process.",

        "In such approaches, first, parsers are used to identify syntactic clues such as prepositional types.",

        "Compared to English, the main difficulty of using supervised method for Chinese, as noted by Xue (2006), is that the precision of current parsers of Chinese is very low due to the lack of morphology, difficulty in segmentation and lack of sufficient training materials in Chinese.",
