        "(2005) introduce a class of graphical dependency models, called graph drawings (which differ from standard dependency structures), that are equivalent to lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammar (LTAG) derivations (Joshi and Schabes 1997).",
        "Whereas TAG is a generative framework in which each well-formed expression corresponds with a legitimate derivation in that system, the graph drawing approach provides a set of structures and a set of constraints on well-formedness.",
        "Bodirsky et al.",
        "offer the class of graph drawings that satisfy these constraints as a model-based perspective on TAG.",
        "Section 2 summarizes this relationship between TAG derivations and these graph drawings.",
        "In related work, Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006) evaluate a number of constraints that have been proposed to restrict the class of dependency structures characterizing natural language with respect to two dependency treebanks: the Prague Dependency Treebank (PDT) (Hajic et al., 2001) and the Danish Dependency Treebank (DDT) (Kromann, 2003).",
        "The results indicate that two properties provide good coverage of the structures in both treebanks.",
        "The first is a binary well-nestedness constraint.",
        "The other is a bound on gap degree, a graded measure of discontinuity.",
        "These results are given in Table 1.",
        "What is noteworthy is that the graph drawings which correspond to LTAG derivations share these two properties: LTAG induced graph drawings are both well-nested and have gap degree < 1, and for every graph drawing that is both well-nested and gap degree < 1, there exists a corresponding LTAG derivation (Möhl 2006).",
        "In section 3, these two properties are defined.",
        "Nivre (2006).",
        "In section 4, we show that gap degree can be used to distinguish between strong island violations and weak island violations in English.",
        "This supports the notion that gap-degree is a linguistically relevant measure.",
        "Although TAG is a linguistically expressive formalism, a closer look at the linguistic data has motivated extensions of TAG.",
        "One of the most widely used extensions for handling cases that are difficult for classic TAG is Multi-Component TAG (Weir 1988).",
        "Like basic TAG, MC-TAG is a formalism for rewriting nodes of a tree as other trees.",
        "The set of underived trees are called elementary trees.",
        "The rewriting is accomplished via two operations: substitution, which rewrites a leaf node labeled X with a tree rooted in a node labeled X, and adjoining, which rewrites a node X with a tree that labels both its root and a distinguished leaf node, the foot, with X.",
        "The observation that linguistic dependencies typically occur within some sort of local domain is expressed in the TAG hypothesis that all such dependencies occur within the basic building blocks of the grammar.",
        "Recursive structure is \"factored out,\" which allows apparent nonlocal dependencies to be recast as local ones.",
        "Whereas basic TAG takes the basic unit to be a single elementary tree, MC-TAG extends the domain of locality to encompass a set of elementary trees.",
        "That is, these sets are the objects over which the combinatory operations apply.",
        "The MC-extension allows for linguistically satisfying accounts for a number of attested phenomena, such as: English extraposition (Kroch and Joshi 1986), subj-aux inversion in combination with raising verbs (Frank 1992), anaphoric binding (Ryant and Scheffler 2006), quantifier scope ambiguity (Joshi et al.",
        "2003), clitic climbing in Romance (Bleam 1994), and Japanese causatives (Heycock 1986).",
        "The primary concern of this paper is the reconciliation of the observation noted above, that MC-TAG appears to be on the right track for a good generative characterization of natural language, with a second observation: The graph drawings that correspond to MC-TAG derivations, are not guaranteed to retain the properties of basic-TAG induced graph drawings.",
        "Kuhlmann and Möhl (2006) report that if an entire MC set is anchored by a single lexical element (the natural extension of \"lexicalization\" of TAGs to MC-TAGs), then the class of dependency structures is expanded with respect to both conditions that characterized the TAG-induced graph drawings: MC-TAG induced graph drawings include structures that are not well-nested, have gap degree > 1, or both.",
        "As Kuhlmann and Möhl point out, the gap degree increases with the number of components, which we will elaborate in section 6.",
        "This is true even if we require that all components of a set combine with a single elementary tree (i.e. tree-local MC-TAG, which is known to allow more derivation structures (i.e. derivation trees) than TAG, although they generate the same set of derived trees).",
        "If we suppose that the characterization of dependency structures as reported by Kuhlmann and Nivre (2006) for Czech and Danish extends cross-linguistically, i.e. the dependency structures for natural language falls within the class of well-nested and gap degree < 1 dependency structures, then MC-TAG appears to correspond to the wrong class of model-theoretic dependency structures.",
        "It is desirable to account for the apparent mismatch.",
        "One possibility is that the linguistic analyses that depend on a multicomponent approach are extremely infrequent, and that this is reflected in the small proportion (< 1%) of data in the PDT and DDT that are not both well-nested and gap degree < 1.",
        "A second possibility is that the structures in the PDT and DDT are actually not good representatives of the structures needed to characterize natural languages in general.",
        "However, a look at the cases in which MC-TAG is employed reveals that these particular analyses yield derivations that correspond to graph drawings that do satisfy well-nestedness and have gap degree < 1.",
        "In practice, MC-TAG seems to be used more restrictively than what the formal system allows in principle.",

        "That is, auxiliary trees that comprise a singleton set may still have pronounced material on both sides of the foot.",
        "Since Kuhlmann and Möhl (2006) show that even a MC-TAG that allows only non-auxiliary trees in MC-sets will expand the drawings to include non-well-nested drawings, there is no way to pare back the MC-TAG via restrictions on the types of trees allowed in MC-sets so as to avoid interleaving.",
        "Recall that to satisfy the definition of interleaving, it is necessary that the two MC-sets are not in any dominance relation in the derivation structure.",
        "In Kuhlmann and Möhl's example, this is satisfied because the two MC-sets are sisters in the derivation; they combine into the same tree.",
        "In the linguistic analyses considered here, no more than one MC-set combines into the same tree.",
        "For tree-local MC-TAG, it appears to be sufficient to bar more than one MC-set from combining into a single tree.",

        "In subordinate clauses in Standard German, the canonical order of verbs and their subject arguments is a nested dependency order.",
        "However, other orderings are also possible.",
        "For example, in the case of a clause-final cluster of three verbs, the canonical order is as given in (13), NP1NP2NP3V3V2V1, but all the other permutations of the NP arguments are also possible orderings.",
        "All six permutations of the NPs can be derived via tree-local MC-TAG.",
        "From the graph-model perspective adopted here, this is unsurprising: All the sequences are well-nested and have gap degree < 1.",

        "However, with an additional level of embedding, i.e. four NPs and four verbs, the situation is different, both linguistically and formally.",
        "Our focus is on making the formal predictions of a linguistically informed system precise.",
        "We start with a tree-local MC-TAG that is restricted to linguistically motivated tree-sets and to semantically coherent derivations.",
        "The former linguistic restriction is illustrated in (14), the possible tree-sets anchored by a verb that takes a VP argument.",
        "The latter linguistic restriction is that there is no semantic feature clash at any stages of the derivation: the VP argument of Vi must be associated with Vi+1.",
        "Single and two-component sets for Vi",
        "As MC-TAG is enriched in various ways (by allowing flexible composition, multiple adjoining at the same node, and/or components from the same MC-set to target the same node), all 24 orderings where the nouns permute while the verbs remain fixed can be derived.",
        "(We are aware that German also allows verbs to scramble.)",
        "Taking the dependency structures of these sequences to consist of an edge from each verb Vi to its subject NP and to the head of its argument VP, Vi+1, we can compare the predictions of the graph drawing approach and the MC-TAG approach.",
        "It turns out that the permutations of gap degree < 1 and those of gap-degree 2 do not align in an obvious way with particular enrichments.",
        "For example, NP4NP2NP3NP1V4V3V2V1 (gap degree 2) is derivable via basic tree-local MC-",
        "TAG, but NP3NP1NP4NP2V4V3V2V1 and NP3NP2NP4NP1V4V3V2V1 (also gap degree 2) appear to require both flexible composition and allowing components from the same MC-set to target the same node.",
        "Conclusion and Future Work",
        "This paper reviews the connection established in previous work between TAG derivations and model-theoretic graph drawings, i.e. well-nested dependency structures of gap degree < 1, and reports several observations that build on this work.",
        "First, additional evidence of the linguistic relevance of the gap degree measure is given.",
        "The gap degree measure can distinguish wh-movement that is assumed to be generally disallowed from wh-movement that is permitted in natural language.",
        "Second, we observe that the graph drawings induced by MC-TAGs used in linguistic analyses continue to fall within the class of well-nested, gap degree < 1 dependency structures.",
        "While",
        "Kuhlmann and Möhl (2006) show that MC-TAGs in which each set has a single lexical anchor induce graph drawings that are outside this class, this extra complexity in the dependency structures does not appear to be utilized.",
        "Even for the crucial cases used to argue for MC-extensions, MC-TAG is used in a manner requiring less complexity than the formal system allows.",
        "Examining these particular grammars lays the groundwork for identifying a natural class of MC-TAG grammars whose derivations correspond to well-nested graph drawings of gap degree < 1.",
        "Specifically, the observations suggest the class to be MC-TAGs in which 1) component sets have up to two members, 2) auxiliary trees that are members of non-singleton MC-sets have pronounced material on only one side of the foot, whether the auxiliary member is derived or not, and 3) up to one MC-set may combine into each tree.",
        "Though these constraints appears stipu-lative from a formal perspective, a preliminary look suggests that natural language will not require their violation.",
        "That is, we may find linguistic justification for these constraints.",
        "Lastly, in ongoing work, we explore how allowing flexible composition and multiple adjoining enables MC-TAGs to derive a range of scrambling patterns."
