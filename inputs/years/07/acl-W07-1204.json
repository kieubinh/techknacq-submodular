        "In parsing, for example, symbolic grammars are combined with stochastic models (Oepen et al., 2004; Malouf and van Noord, 2004).",
        "Much of the gain in statistical parsing using lexicalized models comes from the use of a small set of function words (Klein and Manning, 2003).",
        "Features based on general relations provide little improvement, presumably because the data is too sparse: in the Penn treebank standardly used to train and test statistical parsers stocks and skyrocket never appear together.",
        "However, the superordinate concepts capital (D stocks) and move upward (D sky rocket) frequently appear together, which suggests that using word senses and their hypernyms as features may be useful",
        "However, to date, there have been few combinations of sense information together with symbolic grammars and statistical models.",
        "We hypothesize that one of the reasons for the lack of success is that there has been no resource annotated with both syntactic and semantic information.",
        "In this paper, we use a treebank with both syntactic information (HPSG parses) and semantic information (sense tags from a lexicon) (Bond et al., 2007).",
        "We use this to train parse selection models using both syntactic and semantic features.",
        "A model trained using syntactic features combined with semantic information outperforms a model using purely syntactic information by a wide margin (69.4% sentence parse accuracy vs. 63.8% on definition sentences)."

        "We are using Japanese data from the Hinoki Corpus consisting of around 95,000 dictionary definition and example sentences (Bond et al., 2007) annotated with both syntactic parses and senses from the same dictionary.",
        "Syntactic annotation in Hinoki is grammar based corpus annotation done by selecting the best parse (or parses) from the full analyses derived by a broad-coverage precision grammar.",
        "The grammar is an HPSG implementation (JACY: Siegel and Bender, 2002), which provides a high level of detail, marking not only dependency and constituent structure but also detailed semantic relations.",
        "As the grammar is based on a monostratal theory of grammar (HPSG: Pollard and Sag, 1994), annotation by manual disambiguation determines syntactic and semantic structure at the same time.",
        "Using a grammar helps treebank consistency â€“ all sentences annotated are guaranteed to have well-formed parses.",
        "The flip side to this is that any sentences which the parser cannot parse remain unannotated, at least unless we were to fall back on full manual mark-up of their analyses.",
        "The actual annotation process uses the same tools as the Redwoods treebank of English (Oepen et al., 2004).",
        "A (simplified) example of an entry is given in Figure 1.",
        "Each entry contains the word itself, its part of speech, and its lexical type(s) in the grammar.",

        "There were 4 parses for the definition sentence.",
        "The correct parse, shown as a phrase structure tree, is shown in Figure 2.",
        "The two sources of ambiguity are the conjunction and the relative clause.",
        "The parser also allows the conjunction to combine densha and hito.",
        "In Japanese, relative clauses can have gapped and non-gapped readings.",
        "In the gapped reading (selected here), hito is the subject of jUk unten \"drive\".",
        "In the non-gapped reading there is some underspecified relation between the modifee and the verb phrase.",
        "This is similar to the difference in the two readings of the day he knew in English: \"the day that he knew about\" (gapped) vs \"the day on which he knew (something)\" (non-gapped).",
        "Such semantic ambiguity is resolved by selecting the correct derivation tree that includes the applied rules in building the tree (Fig 3).",
        "The semantic representation is Minimal Recursion Semantics (Copestake et al., 2005).",
        "We simplify this into a dependency representation, further abstracting away from quantification, as shown in Figure 4.",
        "One of the advantages of the HPSG sign is that it contains all this information, making it possible to extract the particular view needed.",
        "In order to make linking to other resources, such as the sense annotation, easier predicates are labeled with pointers back to their position in the original surface string.",

        "Assuming further that, by and large, there is a unique relation for each semantic variable for which it serves as the main index (thus assuming, for example, that adjectives and adverbs have event variables of their own, which can be motivated in predicative usages at least), an MRS can be broken down into a set of basic dependency tuples of the form shown in Figure 4 (Oepen and Lonning, 2006).",
