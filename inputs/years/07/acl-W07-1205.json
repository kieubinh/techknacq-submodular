        "In this paper, we propose a new syntax-based machine translation (MT) approach based on reducing the MT task to a tree-labeling task, which is further decomposed into a sequence of simple decisions for which discriminative classifiers can be trained.",
        "The approach is very flexible and we believe that it is particularly well-suited for exploiting the linguistic knowledge encoded in deep grammars whenever possible, while at the same time taking advantage of databased techniques that have proven a powerful basis for MT, as recent advances in statistical MT show.",
        "A full system using the Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) parsing system XLE and the grammars from the Parallel Grammar development project (ParGram; (Butt et al., 2002)) has been implemented, and we present preliminary results on English-to-German translation with a tree-labeling system trained on a small subsection of the Eu-roparl corpus."

      "text": [
        "Machine translation (MT) is probably the oldest application of what we call deep linguistic processing techniques today.",
        "But from its inception, there have been alternative considerations of approaching the task with databased statistical techniques (cf. Warren Weaver's well-known memo from 1949).",
        "Only with fairly recent advances in computer technology have researchers been able to build effective statistical MT prototypes, but in the last few years, the statistical approach has received enormous research interest and made significant progress.",
        "The most successful statistical MT paradigm has been, for a while now, the so-call phrase-based MT approach (Och and Ney, 2003).",
        "In this paradigm, sentences are translated from a source language to a target language through the repeated substitution of contiguous word sequences (\"phrases\") from the source language for word sequences in the target language.",
        "Training of the phrase translation model builds on top of a standard statistical word alignment over the training corpus of parallel text (Brown et al., 1993) for identifying corresponding word blocks, assuming no further linguistic analysis of the source or target language.",
        "In decoding, i.e. the application of the acquired translation model to unseen source sentences, these systems then typically rely on n-gram language models and simple statistical reordering models to shuffle the phrases into an order that is coherent in the target language.",
        "An obvious advantage of statistical MT approaches is that they can adopt (often very idiomatic) translations of mid-to high-frequency constructions without requiring any language-pair specific engineering work.",
        "At the same time it is clear that a linguistics-free approach is limited in what it can ultimately achieve: only linguistically informed systems can detect certain generalizations from lower-frequency constructions in the data and successfully apply them in a similar but different linguistic context.",
        "Hence, the idea of \"hybrid\" MT, exploiting both linguistic and statistical information is fairly old.",
        "Here we will not consider classical, rule-based systems with some added databased resource acquisition (although they may be among the best candidates for high-quality special-purpose translation - but adaption to new language pairs and sublanguages is very costly for these systems).",
        "The other form of hybridization - a statistical MT model that is based on a deeper analysis of the syntactic structure of a sentence - has also long been identified as a desirable objective in principle (consider (Wu, 1997; Yamada and Knight, 2001)).",
        "However, attempts to retrofit syntactic information into the phrase-based paradigm have not met with enormous success (Koehn et al., 2003; Och et al., 2003), and purely phrase-based MT systems continue to outperform these syntax/phrase-based hybrids.",
        "In this work, we try to make a fresh start with syntax-based statistical MT, discarding the phrase-based paradigm and designing a MT system from the ground up, using syntax as our central guiding star - besides the word alignment over a parallel corpus.",
        "Our approach is compatible with and can benefit substantially from rich linguistic representations obtained from deep grammars like the ParGram LFGs.",
        "Nevertheless, contrary to classical interlingual or deep transfer-based systems, the generative stochastic model that drives our system is grounded only in the cross-language word alignment and a surface-based phrase structure tree for the source language and will thus degrade gracefully on input with parsing issues - which we suspect is an important feature for making the overall system competitive with the highly general phrase-based MT approach.",
        "Preliminary evaluation of our nascent system indicates that this new approach might well have the potential to finally realize some of the promises of syntax in statistical MT."

        "We refer to these annotated sentence pairs as complete translation objects.",

      "text": [
        "Before going on to actually describe a translation procedure (and how to induce it), we need to specify our prior assumptions about how the translation objects will be annotated.",
        "For this paper, we want to exploit the syntax information that we can gain from an LFG-parser, hence we will assume the following annotations:",
        "(1) In the training and evaluation corpora, the source sentences will be parsed with the XLE-parser.",
        "The attribute-value information from LFG's f-structure is restructured so it is indexed by (c-structure) tree nodes; thus a tree node can bear multiple labels for various pieces ofmorphological, syntactic and semantic information.",
        "(2) In the training corpus, the source and target sentence of every translation object will be aligned using GIZA++ (http://www.fjoch.com/).",
        "In other words, our complete translation objects will be aligned tree-string pairs (for instance, Figure 1), while our partial translation objects will be trees (the tree portion of Figure 1).",
        "No other annotations will be assumed for this paper."

      "heading": "4. Syntax MT as Tree Labeling",
      "text": [
        "It is not immediately clear how one would learn a process to map a parsed source sentence into an aligned tree-string pair.",
        "To facilitate matters, we will map complete translation objects to an alternate representation.",
        "In (Galley et al., 2003), the authors give a semantics to aligned tree-string pairs by associating each with an annotated parse tree (hereafter called a GHKM tree) representing a specific theory about how the source sentence was translated into the destination sentence.",
        "In Figure 1, we show an example translation object and in Figure 2, we show its associated GHKM tree.",
        "The GHKM tree is simply the parse tree f of the translation object, annotated with rules (hereafter referred to as GHKM rules).",
        "We will not describe in depth the mapping process from translation object to GHKM tree.",
        "Suffice it to say that the alignment induces a set of intuitive translation rules.",
        "Essentially, a rule like: \"not 1 â€“ ne 1 pas\" (see Figure 2) means: if we see the word \"not\" in English, followed by a phrase already translated into French, then translate the entire thing as the word \"ne\" + the translated phrase + the word \"pas.\"",
        "A parse tree node gets labeled with one of these rules if, roughly speaking, its span is still contiguous when projected (via the alignment) into the target language.",
        "The advantage of using the GHKM interpretation of a complete translation object is that our translation task becomes simpler.",
        "Now, to induce a complete translation object from a partial translation object (parse tree), all we need to do is label the nodes of the tree with appropriate rules.",
        "We have reduced the vaguely defined task of translation to the concrete task of tree labeling."

      "heading": "5. The Generative Process",
      "text": [
        "At the most basic level, we could design a naive generative process that takes a parse tree and then makes a series of decisions, one for each node, about what rule (if any) that node should be assigned.",
        "However it is a bit unreasonable to expect to learn such a decision without breaking it down somewhat, as there are an enormous number of rules that could potentially be used to label any given parse tree node.",
        "So let's break this task down into simpler decisions.",
        "Ideally, we would like to devise a generative process consisting of decisions between a small number of possibilities (ideally binary decisions).",
        "We will begin by deciding, for each node, whether or not it will be annotated with a rule.",
        "This is clearly a binary decision.",
        "Once a generative process has made this decision for each node, we get a convenient byproduct.",
        "As seen in Figure 3, the LHS of each rule is already determined.",
        "Hence after this sequence of binary decisions, half of our task is already completed.",
        "The question remains: how do we determine the RHS of these rules?",
        "Again, we could create a generative process that makes these decisions directly, but choosing the RHS of a rule is still a rather wide-open decision, so we will break it down further.",
        "For each rule, we will begin by choosing the template of its RHS, which is a RHS in which all sequences of variables are replaced with an empty slot into which variables can later be placed.",
        "For instance, the template of (\"ne\", x\\, \"pas\") is (\"ne\", X, \"pas\") and the template of (x3, xi, x2) is (X, X), where X represents the empty slots.",
        "Once the template is chosen, it simply needs to be filled with the variables from the LHS.",
        "To do so, we process the LHS variables, one by one.",
        "By default, they are placed to the right of the previously placed variable (the first variable is placed in the first slot).",
        "We repeatedly offer the option to push the variable to the right until the option is declined or it is no longer possible to push it further right.",
        "If the variable was not pushed right at all, we repeatedly offer the option to push the variable to the left until the option is declined or it is no longer possible to push it further left.",
        "Figure 4 shows this generative story in action for the rule RHS (x3, x1, x2).",
        "These are all of the decisions we need to make in order to label a parse tree with GHKM rules.",
        "A trace of this generative process for the GHKM tree of Figure 2 is shown in Figure 5.",
        "Notice that, aside from the template decisions, all of the decisions are binary (i.e. feasible to learn discriminatively).",
        "Even the template decisions are not terribly large-domain, if we maintain a separate feature-conditional distribution for each LHS template.",
        "For instance, if the LHS template is (\"not\", X), then RHS template ( \"ne\", X, \"pas\") and a few other select candidates should bear most of the probability mass.",
        "Having established this generative story, training is straightforward.",
        "As a first step, we can convert each complete translation object of our training corpus to the trace of its generative story (as in Figure 5).",
        "These decisions can be annotated with whatever feature information we might deem helpful.",
        "Then we simply divide up these feature vectors by decision type (for instance, rule node decisions, template decisions, etc.)",
        "and train a separate discriminative classifier for each decision type from the feature vectors.",
        "This method is quite flexible, in that it allows us to use any generic off-the-shelf classification software to train our system.",
        "We prefer learners that produce distributions (rather than hard classifiers) as output, but this is not required.",
        "The use of discriminative classifiers makes our approach very flexible in terms of the information that can be exploited in the labeling (or translation) process.",
        "Any information that can be encoded as features relative to GHKM tree nodes can be used.",
        "For the experiments reported in this paper, we parsed the source language side of a parallel corpus (a small subsection of the English-German Europarl corpus; (Koehn, 2002)) with the XLE system, using the ParGram LFG grammar and applying probabilistic disambiguation (Riezler et al., 2002) to obtain a single analysis (i.e., a c-structure [phrase structure tree] and an f-structure [an associated attribute-value matrix with morphosyntactic feature information and a shallow semantic interpretation]) for each sentence.",

        "The relational information is then used to systematically extend the learning feature set for the tree-node based classifiers.",
        "In future experiments, we also plan to exploit linguistic knowledge about the target language by factorizing the generation of target language words into separate generation of lemmas and the various mor-phosyntactic features.",

        "The standard search technique of depth-first branch-and-bound search takes advantage of search spaces with this particular characteristic by first finding greedy good-quality solutions and using their values to optimally prune a significant portion of the search space.",
        "Depth-first branch-and-bound search has the following advantage: it finds a good (suboptimal) solution in linear time and continually improves on this solution until it finds the optimal.",
        "Thus it can be run either as an optimal decoder or as a heuristic decoder, since we can interrupt its execution at any time to get the best solution found so far.",
