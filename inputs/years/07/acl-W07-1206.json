        "A large part of the work done in NLP deals with exploring how different tools and resources can be used to improve performance on a task.",
        "The quality and usefulness of the resource certainly is a major factor for the success of the research, but equally so is the creativity with which these tools or resources are used.",
        "There usually is more than one way to employ these, and the approach chosen largely determines the outcome of the work.",
        "This paper illustrates the above claims with respect to three lexical resources - FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998), PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) and VerbNet (Schuler, 2005) - that convey information about lexical predicates and their arguments.",
        "We describe two new and complementary techniques for using these resources and show the improvements to be gained when they are used individually and then together.",
        "We also point out problems that must be overcome to achieve these results.",
        "Compared with WordNet (Miller et al., 1993)-which has been used widely in QA-FrameNet, Prop-Bank and VerbNet are still relatively new, and therefore their usefulness for QA has still to be proven.",
        "They offer the following features which can be used to gain a better understanding of questions, sentences containing answer candidates, and the relations between them:",
        "• They all provide verb-argument structures for a large number of lexical entries.",
        "• FrameNet and PropBank contain semantically annotated sentences that exemplify the underlying frame.",
        "• FrameNet contains not only verbs but also lexical entries for other part-of-speeches.",
        "• FrameNet provides inter-frame relations that can be used for more complex paraphrasing to link the question and answer sentences.",
        "In this paper we describe two methods that use these resources to annotate both questions and sentences containing answer candidates with semantic roles.",
        "If these annotations can successfully be matched, an answer candidate can be extracted.",
        "We are able, for example, to give a complete frame-semantic analysis of the following sentences and to recognize that they all contain an answer to the question \"When was Alaska purchased?",
        "\":",
        "The United States purchased Alaska in 1867.",
        "Alaska was bought from Russia in 1867.",
        "In 1867, Russia sold Alaska to the United States.",
        "The acquisition ofAlaska by the United States in 1867 is known as \"Seward's Folly.",
        "The first algorithm we present uses the three lexical resources to generate potential answer-containing templates.",
        "While the templates contain holes - in particular, for the answer - the parts that are known can be used to create exact quoted search queries.",
        "Sentences can then be extracted from the output of the search engine and annotated with respect to the resource being used.",
        "From this, an answer candidate (if present) can be extracted.",
        "The second algorithm analyzes the dependency structure of the annotated example sentences in FrameNet and PropBank.",
        "It then poses rather abstract queries to the web, but can in its candidate sentence analysis stage deal with a wider range of syntactic possibilities.",
        "As we will see, the two algorithms are nicely complementary."

      "heading": "2. Method 1: Question Answering by Natural Language Generation",
      "text": [
        "The first method implemented uses the data available in the resources to generate potential answer sentences to the question.",
        "While at least one component of such a sentence (the answer) is yet unknown, the remainder of the sentence can be used to query a web search engine.",
        "The results can then be analyzed, and if they match the originally-proposed answer sentence structure, an answer candidate can be extracted.",
        "The first step is to annotate the question with its semantic roles.",
        "For this task we use a classical semantic role labeler combined with a rule-based approach.",
        "Keep in mind that our task is to annotate questions, not declarative sentences.",
        "This is important for several reasons:",
        "1.",
        "The role labeler we use is trained on FrameNet and PropBank data, i.e. mostly on declarative sentences, whose syntax often differs considerably from the sytax of questions.",
        "Aa a result, the training and test set differ substantially in nature.",
        "2.",
        "Questions tend to be shorter and simpler syntactically than declarative sentences-especially those occurring in news corpora.",
        "3.",
        "Questions contain one semantic role that has to be annotated but which is not or is only implicitly (through the question word) mentioned the answer.",
        "Because of these reasons and especially because many questions tend to be gramatically simple, we found that a few simple rules can help the question annotation process dramatically.",
        "We rely on Mini-Par (Lin, 1998) to find the question's head verb, e.g. \"purchase\" for \"Who purchased YouTube?\"",
        "(In the following we will often refer to this question to illustrate our approach.)",
        "We then look up all entries in one of the resources, and for FrameNet and Prop-Bank we simplify the annotated sentences until we achieve a set of abstract frame structures, similar to those in VerbNet.",
        "By doing this we intentionally remove certain levels of information that were present in the original data, i.e. tense, voice, mood and negation.",
        "(In a later step we will reintroduce some of it.)",
        "Here is what we find in FrameNet for \"purchase\":",
        "Buyer[Subj,NP] VERB Goods[Obj,NP] Buyer[Subj,NP] VERB Goods[Obj,NP]",
        "Seller [Dep,PP-from]",
        "Buyer[Subj,NP] VERB Goods[Obj,NP]",
        "Money[Dep,PP-for] Buyer[Subj,NP] VERB Goods[Obj,NP]",
        "Recipient [Dep,PP-for]",
        "A syntactic analysis of the question (also obtained from MiniPar) shows that \"Who\" is the (deep) subject and \"YouTube\", the (deep) object.",
        "The first of the above frames fits this analysis best, because it lists only the two roles with the desired grammatical functions.",
        "By mapping the question analysis to this frame, we can assign the roles Goods to \"YouTube\" and Buyer to \"Who\".",
        "From this we can conclude that the question asks for the Buyer role.",
        "An additional point suitable to illustrate why a few simple rules can achieve in many cases more that a statistical classifier, are When-and Where-questions.",
        "Here, the hint that leads to the correct detection of the answer role lies in the question word, which is of course not present in the answer sentence.",
        "Furthermore, the answer role in an answer sentence will usually be realized as a PP with a totally different dependency path than the one ofques-tion's question word.",
        "In contrast, a rule that states that whenever a temporal or location question is detected the answer role becomes, in FrameNet terms, Place or Time, respectively, is very helpful here.",
        "Once the role assignment is complete, we use all abstract frames which contain the roles found in the question to generate potential answer templates.",
        "This is also the point where we reintroduce tense and voice information: If the question was asked in the a past tense, we will now create from each abstract frame, all surface realizations in all past tenses, both in active and passive voice.",
        "If we had used the annotated data directly without the detour over the abstract frames, we would have difficulty sorting out negated sentences, those in undesired moods and those in unsuitable tenses.",
        "In contrast our approach guarantees that all possible tenses in both voices are generated, and no meaning-altering information like mood and negation is present.",
        "For the example given above we would create inter alia the following answer templates:",
        "ANSWER[NP] purchased YouTube YouTube was purchased by ANSWER[NP] ANSWER[NP] had purchased YouTube",
        "The part (or parts) of the templates that are known are quoted and sent to a search engine.",
        "For the second example, this would be \"YouTube was purchased by\".",
        "From the snippets returned by the search engine, we extract candidate sentences and match them against the abstract frame structure from which the queries were originally created.",
        "In this way, we annotate the candidate sentences and are now able to identify the filler of the answer role.",
        "For example, the above query returns \"On October 9, 2006, YouTube was purchased by Google for an incredible US$1.65 billion\", from which we can extract \"Google\", because it is the NP filling the buyer role.",
        "So far, we have mostly discussed questions whose answer role is an argument of the head verb.",
        "However, for questions like \"When was YouTube purchased?\"",
        "this assumption does not hold.",
        "Here, the question asks for an adjunct.",
        "This is an important difference for at least three reasons:",
        "1.",
        "FrameNet and VerbNet do not or only sparsely annotate peripheral adjuncts.",
        "(PropBank however does.)",
        "2.",
        "In English, the position ofadjuncts varies much more than those of arguments.",
        "3.",
        "In English, different kinds of adjuncts can occupy the same position in a sentence, although naturally not at the same time.",
        "The following examples illustrate point 2:",
        "YouTube was purchased by Google on October 9.",
        "On October 9, YouTube was purchased by Google.",
        "YouTube was purchased on October 9 by Google.",
        "All variations are possible, although they may differ in frequency.",
        "PPs conveying other peripheral adjuncts ( e.g. \"for $1.65 billion\") could replace all the above temporals PPs, or they could be added at other positions.",
        "The special behavior of these types of questions has not only to be accounted for when annotating the question with semantic roles, but also and when creating and processing potential answer sentences.",
        "We use an abstract frame structure like the following to create the queries:",
        "Buyer[Subj,NP,unknown]",
        "VERB Goods[Obj,NP,\"YouTube\"]",
        "While this lacks a role for the answer, we can still use it to create, for example, the query \"has purchased YouTube\".",
        "When sentences returned from the search engine are then matched against the abstract structure, we can extract all PPs directly before the Buyer role, between the Buyer role and the verb and directly behind the Goods role.",
        "Then we can check all these PPs on their semantic types and keep only those that match the answer type of the question (if any)."

        "The method presented so far can be used with all three resources.",

        "This section will explain how we make use of these relations.",
        "The purchase.v entry is organized in a frame called CommerceJbuy which also contains the entries for buy.v and purchase_((act)).n.",

        "The latter example illustrates that we can also generate target paraphrases with heads which are not verbs.",
        "Handling these is usually easier than sentences based on verbs, because no tense/voice information has to be introduced.",
        "Furthermore, frames themselves can stand in different relations.",
        "The frame Commercegoods-transfer, for example, relates both to the already mentioned Commerce Jjuy frame and to Commerce .sell in an is_perspectivizedJn relation.",

        "Other templates created from this frame seem odd, e.g.",
        "YouTube has been retailed to ANSWER [NP] .",
        "because the verb \"to retail\" usually takes mass-products as its object argument and not a company.",
        "But FrameNet does not make such fine-grained distinctions.",

        "So far, there has been little work at the intersection of QA and semantic roles.",
        "Fliedner (2004) describes the functionality of a planned system based on the German version of FrameNet, SALSA, but no so far no paper describing the completed system has been published.",
        "Novischi and Moldovan (2006) use a technique that builds on a combination of lexical chains and verb argument structures extracted from VerbNet to re-rank answer candidates.",
        "The authors' aim is to recognize changing syntactic roles in cases where an answer sentence shows a head verb different from the question (similar to work described here in Section 2).",
        "However, since VerbNet is based on thematic rather than semantic roles, there are problems in using it for this purpose, illustrated by the following VerbNet pattern for buy and sell:",
        "Starting with the sentence \"Peter bought a guitar from Johnny\", and mapping the above roles for buy to those for sell, the resulting paraphrase in terms of sell would be \"Peter sold UNKNOWN a guitar\".",
        "That is, there is nothing blocking the Agent role of buy being mapped to the Agent role of sell, nor anything linking the Source role of buy to any role in sell.",
        "There is also a coverage problem: The authors report that their approach only applies to 15 of 230 TREC 2004 questions.",
        "They report a performance gain of 2.4% (MMR for the top 50 answers), but it does not become clear whether that is for these 15 questions or for the complete question set.",
        "The way in which we use the web in our first method is somewhat similar to (Dumais et al., 2002).",
        "However, our system allows control of verb argument structures, tense and voice and thus we can create a much larger set of reformulations.",
        "Regarding our second method, two papers describe related ideas: Firstly, in (Bouma et al., 2005) the authors describe a Dutch QA system which makes extensive use of dependency relations.",
        "In a preprocessing step they parsed and stored the full text collection for the Dutch CLEF QA-task.",
        "When their system is asked a question, they match the dependency structure of the question against the dependency structures of potential answer candidates.",
        "Additionally, a set of 13 equivalence rules allows transformations of the kind \"the coach of Norway, Egil Olsen\" <^ \"Egil Olsen, the coach of Norway\".",
        "Secondly, Shen and Klakow (2006) use dependency relation paths to rank answer candidates.",
        "In their work, a candidate sentence supports an answer if relations between certain phrases in the candidate sentence are similar to the corresponding ones in the question.",
        "Our work complements that described in both these papers, based as it is on a large collection of semantically annotated example sentences: We only require a candidate sentence to match one of the annotated example sentences.",
        "This allows us to deal with a much wider range ofsyntactic possibilities, as the resources we use do not only document verb argument structures, but also the many ways they can be syntactically realized."

      "heading": "7. Discussion",
      "text": [
        "Both methods presented in this paper employ semantic roles but with different aims in mind: The first method focuses on creating obvious answer-containing sentences.",
        "Because in these sentences, the head and the semantic roles are usually adjacent, it is possible to create exact search queries that will lead to answer candidates of a high quality.",
        "Our second method can deal with a wider range of syntactic variations but here the link to the answer sentences' surface structure is not obvious, thus no exact queries can be posed.",
        "The overall accuracy we achieved suggests that employing semantic roles for question answering is indeed useful.",
        "Our results compare nicely to recent TREC evaluation results.",
        "This is an especially strong point, because virtually all high performing TREC systems combine miscellaneous strategies, which are already know to perform well.",
        "Because the research question driving this work was to determine how semantic roles can benefit QA, we deliberately designed our system to only build on semantic roles.",
        "We did not chose to extend an already existing system, using other methods with a few features based on semantic roles.",
        "Our results are convincing qualitatively as well as quantitavely: Detecting paraphrases and drawing inferences is a key challenge in question answering, which our methods achieve in various ways:",
        "• They both recognize different verb-argument structures ofthe same verb.",
        "• Method 1 controls for tense and voice: Our system will not take a future perfect sentence for an answer to a present perfect question.",
        "• For method 1, no answer candidates altered by mood or negation are accepted.",
        "• Method 1 can create and recognize answer sentences, whose head is synonymous or related in meaning to the answers head.",
        "In such transformations, we are also aware ofpotential changes in the argument structure.",
        "• The annotated sentences in the resources enables method 2 to deal with a wide range of syntactic phenomena."

      "heading": "8. Conclusion",
      "text": [
        "This paper explores whether lexical resources like FrameNet, PropBank and VerbNet are beneficial for QA and describes two different methods in which they can be used.",
        "One method uses the data in these resources to generate potential answer-containing sentences that are searched for on the web by using exact, quoted search queries.",
        "The second method uses only a keyword-based search, but it can annotate a larger set of candidate sentences.",
        "Both methods perform well solemnly and they nicely complement each other.",
        "Our methods based on semantic roles alone achieves an accuracy of 0.39.",
        "Furthermore adding the described features to our already existing system boosted accuracy by 21%."
