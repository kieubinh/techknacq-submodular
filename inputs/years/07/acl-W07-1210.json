        "Minimal Recursion Semantics (mrs: Copestake et al.",
        "(2005)) is a flat semantic representation which factors semantics into elementary predications (eps) and allows for underspecification of scope.",
        "It has been widely used, especially for HPSG.",
        "Robust Minimal Recursion Semantics (rmrs: Copestake (2003)) is a variant of mrs which takes this factorisation further to allow underspecification of relational information as well.",
        "While mrs has generally been used with hand-built HPSG grammars, rmrs is also suitable for use with shallower approaches to analysis, including part-of-speech tagging, noun phrase chunking and stochastic parsers which operate without detailed lexicons.",
        "mrss can be converted into rmrss: rmrs output from shallower systems is less fully specified than the output from deeper systems, but in principle fully compatible.",
        "In our work, the semantics produced by a deep grammar is taken as normative when developing semantic representations from shallower processing.",
        "For English, the target semantic representations are those produced by the English Resource Grammar (erg, Flickinger (2000)).",
        "The mrs/rmrs approach has been adopted as a common framework for the delph-in initiative (Deep Linguistic Processing with HPSG: http://www.delph-in.net).",
        "An algebra for mrs was defined by Copestake et al.",
        "(2001) (henceforth CLF) and forms the starting point for the work reported here.",
        "The aim of CLF was to formalise the notion of semantic composition within grammars expressed in a typed feature structure (TFS) logic.",
        "Here, we extend that work to non-lexicalist approaches and also describe how the formal principles of composition used in mrs can be adapted to produce a formalism for rmrs composition.",
        "Thus we demonstrate that the algebra applies to grammar engineering across a much wider range of frameworks than was originally envisaged.",
        "Besides its theoretical interest, this result has practical benefits when combining multiple processing systems in that it allows compatible semantic representations at a phrasal level as well as at a sentence level.",
        "The next section (§2) describes the most important features of mrs, rmrs and the earlier work on the algebra.",
        "We then outline how the algebra can be used for implementing deep non-TFS approaches (§3) and explain how it works with rmrs (§4).",
        "This is followed by discussion of the extension to grammars without a detailed lexicon (§5).",
        "To briefly illustrate the practical applications, section (§6) outlines how rmrs semantics is constructed from rasp (Robust accurate domain-independent statistical parsing: Briscoe and Carroll (2002))."

        "Fig.",
        "1 illustrates an mrs from a deep grammar (based on the erg output, but simplified for expository purposes), an equivalent rmrs and a very underspecified rmrs, derived from a POS tagger.",
        "mrs achieves a flat representation via the use of labels on eps, thus factoring out scopal relationships.",
        "Scope constraints (HCONS) are shown as qeq relationships (=q equality modulo quantifiers: the mrs representation:",
        "Figure 1: mrs and rmrs for the fat cat sat on a mat details are not important to understand this paper).",
        "In mrs, implicit conjunction is indicated by equality between labels.",
        "For instance, the labels on 11: fat(x) and 12: cat1(x) are equated.",
        "In this figure, we show mrs using explicit equalities (eqs: =) rather than coindexation of variables since this corresponds to the formalism used in the algebra.",
        "rmrs uses the same approach to scope but adopts a variant of a neo-Davidsonian representation, where arguments (ARGs) are represented as distinct elements.",
        "In the very underspecified rmrs at the bottom of Fig.1, no relational information is known so there are no ARGs.",
        "Separating out ARGs from the eps and allowing them to be omitted permits a straightforward notion of a specificity hierarchy in terms of information content.",
        "ARGs may also be underspecified: e.g., ARGn indicates that there is some argument relationship, but it is unknown whether it is an ARG1, ARG2 or ARG3.",
        "In the version of rmrs described in this paper, the ARGs are related to the main eps via an 'anchor' element.",
        "An ep and its associated ARGs share a unique anchor.",
        "This version of rmrs uses exactly the same mechanism for conjunction as does mrs: the anchor elements are required so that ARGs can still be associated with a single ep even if the label of the ep has been equated with another ep.",
        "This is a change from Copestake (2003): the reasons for this proposal are discussed in §4, below.",
        "The conjunction information is not available from a POS tagger alone and so is not present in the second rmrs in Fig.1.",
        "The naming convention adopted for the relations (e.g., _sit_v) allows them to be constructed without access to a lexicon.",
        "'_v' etc are indications of the coarse-grained sense distinctions which can be inferred from part-of-speech information.",
        "Deep grammars can produce finer-grained sense distinctions, indicated by etc, and there is an implicit hierarchy such that _sit_v_1 is taken as being more specific than _sit_v.",
        "However, in what follows, we will use simple relation names for readability.",
        "mrs and rmrs both assume an inventory of features on variables which are used to represent tense etc, but these will not be discussed in this paper.",
        "In the algebra introduced by CLF, semantic structures (sements) for phrases consist of five parts:",
        "1.",
        "Hooks: can be thought of as pointers into the relations list.",
        "In a full grammar, hooks consist of three parts: a label (1), an index (i) and an external argument (omitted here for simplicity).",
        "2.",
        "Slots: structures corresponding to syntactic/semantic unsaturation – they specify how the semantics is combined.",
        "A slot in one sign is instantiated by being equated with the hook of another sign.",
        "(CLF use the term 'hole' instead of 'slot'.)",
        "For the TFS grammars considered in CLF, the slot corresponds to the part of the TFS accessed via a valence feature.",
        "The inventory of slot labels given by CLF is subj, spr, spec, comp1, comp2, comp3 and mod.",

        "4. hcons: qeq constraints (=q).",
        "5. eqs: the variable equivalences which are the re-suits of equating siots and hooks.",
        "sements are: [I, i]{slots}[eps][hcons]{eqs}.",
        "Some rules contribute their own semantics (construction semantics: e.g., compound nouns).",
        "However, the mrs approach requires that this can always be treated as equivalent to having an additional daughter in the rule.",
        "Thus construction semantics need not be considered separately in the formal algebra, although it does result in some syntactically binary rules being semantically ternary (and so on).",
        "The principles of composition are:",
        "1.",
        "A (syntactically specified) slot in one structure (the daughter which corresponds to the semantic head) is filled by the hook of the other structure (by adding equalities).",
        "2.",
        "The hook of the phrase is the semantic head's hook.",
        "3.",
        "The eps of the phrase is equal to appending the eps of the daughters.",
        "4.",
        "The eqs of the phrase is equal to appending the eqs of the daughters plus any eqs contributed by the filling of the slot.",
        "5.",
        "The slots of the phrase are the unfilled slots of the daughters (although see below).",
        "6.",
        "The hcons of the phrase is equal to appending the hcons of the daughters.",
        "Formally, the algebra is defined in terms of a series of binary operations, such as opspec, which each correspond to the instantiation of a particular labelled slot.",
        "Fig.",
        "2 illustrates this.",
        "The hook of cat instantiates the spec slot of a, which is the semantic head (though not the syntactic head in the erg).",
        "This leads to the equalities between the variables in the result.",
        "Since the spec slot has been filled, it is not carried up to the phrase.",
        "Thus, abstractly at least, the semantics of the HPSG specifier-head rule corresponds to opspec",
        "'As usual in MRS, in order to allow scope underspecification, the label l4 of the quantifier's hook is not coindexed with any EP.",
        "The mrs algebra was designed to abstract away from the details of the syntax and of the syntax-semantics interface, so that it can be applied to grammars with differing feature geometry.",
        "The assumption in CLF is simply that the syntax selects the appropriate op and its arguments for each application.",
        "i.e., semantic operations are associated with HPSG constructions so that there is a mapping from the daughters of the construction to the arguments of the operation.",
        "The algebra does not attempt to completely replicate all aspects of semantic construction: e.g., the way that the features (representing tense and so on) are instantiated on variables is not modelled.",
        "However, it does constrain semantic construction compared with the possibilities for TFS semantic compositional in general.",
        "For instance, as discussed by cLF, it enforces a strong monotonicity constraint.",
        "The algebra also contributes to limiting the possibilities for specification of scope.",
        "These properties can be exploited by algorithms that operate on mrs: e.g., generation, scope resolution.",
        "cLF did not discuss the syntax-semantics interface in detail, but we do so here for two reasons.",
        "Firstly, it is a preliminary for discussing the use of the algebra in frameworks other than HPSG in the following sections.",
        "Secondly, as CLF discuss, the constraints that the algebra imposes cannot be fully implemented in a TFS.",
        "Thus, for grammar engineering in TFS frameworks, an additional automatic checker is needed to determine whether a grammar meets the algebra's constraints.",
        "This requires specification of the syntax-semantics interface so that the checker can extract the slots from the TFSs and determine the slot operation(s) corresponding to a rule.",
        "Unfortunately, CLF are imprecise about the algebra in several respects.",
        "One problem is that they gloss over the issue of slot propagation in real grammars.",
        "CLF state that for an operation opx, the slot corresponding to opx on the semantic head is instantiated and all other slots appear on the result.",
        "For instance, the definition of opspec states that for all labels l = spec: slotl(opspec(ai, a2)) = sloti(ai) U sloti(a2).",
        "However, this is inadequate for real grammars, if a simple correspondence between the slot names and the valence paths in the feature structure is assumed.",
        "For instance, the passive rule involves coindexing a comp in the original lexical sign with the subj of the passive (informally, the complement 'becomes' the subject).",
        "There are two ways round this problem.",
        "The first is to keep the algebra unchanged, but to assume that, for instance, the subject-head grammar rule corresponds to opsubj in the algebra for non-passivized cases and to opcomp1 for passives of simple transitives and so on.",
        "Though possible formally, this is not in accord with the spirit of the approach since selection of the appropriate algebra operation in the syntax-semantics interface would require non-local information.",
        "Practically, it also precludes the implementation of an algebra checker, since keeping track of the slot uses would be both complex and grammar-specific.",
        "The alternative is to extend the algebra to allow for slot renaming.",
        "For instance, opcomp1-subj can be defined so that the compI slot on the daughter is a subj slot on the mother.",
        "2. slotsubj(opcomp1-subj(a)) = slotcomp1(a)",
        "This means extending the inventory of operations, but the choice of operation is then locally determinable from the rule (e.g., the passive rule would specify opcomp1-subj to be its operation).",
        "Another issue arises in grammars which allow for optional complements.",
        "For instance, one approach to a verb like eat is to give it a single lexical entry which corresponds to both transitive and intransitive uses.",
        "The complement is marked as optional and the corresponding variable in the semantics is assumed to be discourse bound if there is no syntactic complement in the phrase.",
        "Optional complements can be discharged by a construction.",
        "This approach is (arguably) appropriate for eat because the intransitive use involves an implicit patient (e.g., I already ate means I already ate something), in contrast to a verb like kick.",
        "CLF do not discuss optionality but it can be formalised in the algebra in terms of a construction-specified sement which has a hook containing the discourse referent and is otherwise empty.",
        "For instance, an optional complement construction corresponds to opcomp1 (ai, a2) where ai is the head (and the only daughter appearing in the TFS for the construction) and a2 is stipulated by the rule to be [1, d] {}[][]{}, where d is the discourse-bound referent."

        "As discussed, the algebra requires that ops are specified for each rule application, and the easiest way of achieving this is to associate semantic composition rules with each rule name.",
        "Composition operates on the tree output from rasp, e.g.,:",
        "Composition operates bottom-up: the semantic structures derived from the tags are combined according to the semantics associated with the rule.",
        "The implementation corresponds very directly to the algebra, although the transitive closure ofthe equalities is computed on the final structure, since nothing requires that it be available earlier.",
        "The notation used to specify semantics associated with the rules incorporates some simplifications to avoid having to explicitly specify the slot and ops.",

        "If no semantic rule is specified corresponding to a rule used in a tree, the rels are simply appended.",
        "Semantic composition is thus robust to omissions in the semantic component of the grammar.",
        "In fact, semantic rules can be constructed semi-automatically, rather than fully manually, although we do not have space to discuss this in detail here.",
        "There are cases of incompatibility between rasp-rmrs and erg-rmrs.",
        "For example, the erg treats it as expletive in it rains: the lexical entry for rain specifies an expletive subject (i.e., a semantically empty it).",
        "rasp makes no such distinction, since it lacks the lexical information and thus the sentence has extraneous relations for the pronoun and an incorrect ARG1 for rain.",
        "This is an inevitable consequence of the lack of lexical information in rasp.",
        "However, from the perspective of the evaluation of the revised algebra, the issue is whether there are any cases where compositional construction of rasp-rmrss which match erg-rmrss is impossible due to the restrictions imposed by the algebra.",

        "We have demonstrated that the mrs algebra, originally intended as a formalisation of some aspects of semantic composition in constraint-based grammars, can be extended to rmrs and other types of grammar framework and can be used as the basis of a full implementation of composition.",
        "The algebra can thus be used much more widely than originally envisaged and could be exploited by a wide range of parsers.",
        "Useful properties concerning monotonicity and scope (see Fuchss et al.",
        "(2004)) are thus guaranteed for a range of grammars.",
        "Phrasal-level compatibility of rmrs (to the extent that this is syntactically possible) is also an important result.",
        "The main practical outcome of this work so far has been a semantic component for the rasp system which produces representations compatible with that ofthe erg without compromising rasp speed or robustness.",
        "rasp-rmrss have already been used in systems for question answering, information extraction, email response, creative authoring and ontology extraction (e.g., Uszkoreit et al.",
