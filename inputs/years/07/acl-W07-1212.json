        "The lack of a large annotated systemic functional grammar (sfg) corpus has posed a significant challenge for the development of the theory.",
        "Automating sfg annotation is challenging because the theory uses a minimal constituency model, allocating as much of the work as possible to a set of hierarchically organised features.",
        "In this paper we show that despite the unorthodox organisation of sfg, adapting existing resources remains the most practical way to create an annotated corpus.",
        "We present and analyse SFGBank, an automated conversion of the Penn Treebank into systemic functional grammar.",
        "The corpus is comparable to those available for other linguistic theories, offering many opportunities for new research."

        "Systemic functional grammar (Halliday and Matthiessen, 2004) aims to describe the set of meaningful choices a speaker makes when putting a thought into words.",
        "Each of these choices is seen as a resource for shaping the meaning in a particular way, and the selection will have a distinct grammatical outcome as well as a semantic implication.",
        "The choices are presented hierarchically, so that early selections restrict other choices.",
        "For instance, if a speaker chooses imperative mood for a clause, they cannot choose a tense.",
        "Each selection is linked to a syntactic expression rule.",
        "When imperative mood is selected, the subject of the clause is suppressed; when interrogative mood is selected, the order of the subject and first auxiliary are reversed.",
        "Systemic grammars are very different from grammars influenced by the formalist tradition.",
        "Systemic analysis locates a constituent within a typology, and yields a set of features that describe its salient properties.",
        "These features have proven useful for research in applied linguistics, on topics such as stylistics, discourse analysis and translation.",
        "As a generative theory, systemic grammars are less effective.",
        "There have been a few attempts, such as those discussed by O'Donnell and Bateman (2005), but as yet a wide coverage systemic grammar that can be used for tractable parsing has not been developed.",
        "The lack of a corpus and parser has limited research on systemic grammars, as corpus studies have been restricted to small samples of manually coded examples, or imprecise queries of unannotated data.",
        "The corpus we present, obtained by converting the Penn Treebank, addresses this issue.",
        "It also suggests a way to automatically code novel text, by converting the output of a parser for a different formalism.",
        "This would also allow the use of sfg features for nlp applications to be explored, and support current research using sfg for applied linguistics.",
        "The conversion process relies on a set of manually coded rules.",
        "The first step of the process is to collect sfg clauses and their constituents from parses in the Penn Treebank.",
        "Each clause constituent is then assigned up to three function labels, for the three simultaneous semantic and pragmatic structures Hal-liday (1970) describes.",
        "Finally, the system features are calculated, using rules referring to the function labels assigned in the previous step.",

        "We employ a similar methodology, converting the corpus using manually specified rules.",
        "Since the sfg annotation is semantically oriented, the work also bears some resemblance to Prop-bank (Palmer et al., 2005).",
        "However, Propbank is concerned with manually adding information to the Penn Treebank, rather than automatically reinterpreting the same information through the lens of a different linguistic theory.",
        "We chose not to base our conversion on the Prop-bank annotation, as it does not currently cover the Brown or Switchboard sections of the Treebank.",
        "The wider variety of genres provided by these sections makes the corpus much more useful for sfg, since the theory devotes significant attention to pragmatic phenomena and stylistic variation."

        "Interpersonal function labels are assigned to clause constituents in determining the clause's communicative status.",

        "The Penn Treebank was designed as a largely theory neutral corpus.",
        "In deciding on an annotation scheme, it emphasised the need to have its annotators work quickly and consistent, rather than fidelity to any particular linguistic theory (Marcus et al., 1994).",
        "The fact that it has been successfully converted to so many other annotation schemes suggests that its annotation is indeed consistent and fine grained.",
        "It is therefore unsurprising that it is possible to convert it to sfg as well.",
        "Despite historically different concerns, sfg still fundamentally agrees with other theories about which constructions are syntactically distinct – it simply has an unorthodox strategy for representing that variation, delegating more work to feature structures and less work to the syntactic representation.",
        "Now that a sizable sfg corpus has been created, it can be put to use for linguistic and NLP research.",
        "Linguistically, we suggest that it would be interesting to use the corpus to explore some of the assertions in the literature that have until now been untestable.",
        "For instance, Halliday and Matthiessen (2004) suggests that the motivation for passivisation is largely structural – what comes first in a clause is an important choice in English.",
        "This implies that the combination of passive voice and a fronted adjunct should be unlikely.",
        "There should be many such simple queries that can shed interesting light on abstract claims in the literature.",
        "Large annotated corpora are currently very important for parsing research, making this work a vital first step towards exploring whether SFG annotation can be automated.",
        "The fact that Treebank parses can be converted into sfg annotation suggests it can be, although most parsers do not replicate the dash-tags attached to Treebank labels, which are necessary to distinguish SFG categories in our conversion system.",
        "Even without automating annotation, the corpus offers some potential for investigating how useful sfg features are for nlp tasks.",
        "The Penn Treebank includes texts from a variety of genres, including newspaper text, literature and spoken dialogue.",
        "The Switchboard section of the corpus also comes with various demographic properties about the speakers, and is over a million words.",
        "We therefore suggest that gold standard sfg features could be used in some simple document classification experiments, such as predicting the gender or education level of speakers in the Switchboard corpus."
