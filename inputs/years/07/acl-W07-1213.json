        "In the paper we propose a method to integrate the logical analysis of sentences with the linguistic approach to semantics, exploiting the complex valency frames (CVFs) in the VerbaLex verb valency lexicon, see (Hlavâckovâ, Horâk, Kadlec 2006).",
        "To this end we first present a brief survey of the logic we are going to use, namely Transparent Intensional Logic (TIL), which was originated by P. Tichy (Tichy 1988).",
        "Theoretical aspects of TIL were further developed in particular by P. Materna (Materna 1998) and also by co-authors of this paper (see, Materna, Duzi 2005, Horâk 2002).",
        "A question may be asked why we do not exploit first order predicate logic (PL1) where some of the presented problems have already been explored and PL1 has been used to represent logical forms.",
        "It is a well established fact that PL1 is not able to handle systematically the phenomena like propositional verbs (which, of course, appear in our valency frames), grammatical tenses and modalities (modal verbs and modal particles in natural language).",
        "On the other hand, since TIL works with types these problems either do not arise or they can be solved in an intuitive way (see Tichy 1988).",
        "In the second linguistic section we present CVFs by means of which the semantics of verbs in natural language such as Czech or English can be described.",
        "In Section 3 we show how CVFs describe the surface valencies of verbs (i.e. their respective morphological cases in Czech) as well as the semantics of their predicate-argument structure.",
        "Concerning the latter we make use of the deep semantic roles expressed by two-level labels based partly on the Top Ontology (EuroWordNet) and partly on the selected literals from Princeton",
        "WordNet.",
        "Since so far these two ways of description, namely the logical and linguistic one, have been treated separately, the task we set is to propose a method of their interrelation and coordination.",
        "Needless to say that both ways of description of verb semantics are useful.",
        "Hence we are going to show how to combine a logical description using mostly terms like types, individuals, classes, relations, propositions, or, in general, constructions of these entities, with the linguistic framework capturing the idiosyncratic semantic features of the verbs such as SUBS(liquid: 1) or AG(person:1|animal: 1).",
        "In Section 4 we adduce an example of the analysis of selected English and Czech verbs for which the above mentioned integration has been proposed."

      "text": [
        "In this Section we provide an introductory explanation of the main notions of Transparent Intensional Logic (TIL).",
        "For exact definitions and details see, e.g., Tichy (1988), Tichy (2004),",
        "Duzi (2005).",
        "TIL approach to knowledge representation can be characterised as the 'top-down approach'.",
        "TIL 'generalises to the hardest case' and obtains the 'less hard cases' by lifting various restrictions that apply only higher up.",
        "This way of proceeding is opposite to how semantic theories tend to be built up.",
        "The standard approach (e.g. predicate logic) consists in beginning with atomic sentences, then proceeding to molecular sentences formed by means of truth-functional connectives or by quantifiers, and from there to sentences containing modal operators and, finally, attitudinal operators.",
        "Thus, to use a simple case for illustration, once a vocabulary and rules of formation have been laid down, semantics gets off the ground by analysing an atomic sentence as follows:",
        "(1) \"Charles is happy\": Fa And further upwards:",
        "(2) \"Charles is happy, and Thelma is grumpy\": Fa a Gb (5) \"Thelma believes that Charles is happy\":",
        "Bb (Fa).",
        "In non-hyperintensional (i.e., non-procedural) theories of formal semantics, attitudinal operators are swallowed by the modal ones.",
        "But when they are not, we have three levels of granularity: the coarse level of truth-values, the fine-grained level of truth-conditions (propositions, truth-values-in-intension), and the very fine-grained level of hyper-propositions, i.e., constructions of propositions.",
        "TIL operates with these three levels of granularity.",
        "We start out by analysing sentences from the uppermost end, furnishing them with a hyperintensional semantics, and working our way downwards, furnishing even the lowest-end sentences (and other empirical expressions) with a hyperintensional semantics.",
        "That is, the sense of a sentence such as \"Charles is happy\" is a hyper-proposition, namely the construction of the denoted proposition (i.e., the instruction how to evaluate the truth-conditions of the sentence in any state of affairs).",
        "When assigning a construction to an expression as its meaning, we specify a procedural know-how, which must not be confused with the respective performancy know-how.",
        "Distinguishing performatory know-how from procedural know-how, the latter could be characterised \"that a knower x knows how A is done in the sense that x can spell out instructions for doing A.\"",
        "For instance, to know what Goldbach Conjecture means is to understand the instruction to find whether 'all positive even integers > 4 can be expressed as the sum of two primes'.",
        "It does not include either actually finding out (whether it is true or not by following a procedure or by luck) or possessing the skill to do so.Furthermore, the sentence \"Charles is happy\" is an 'intensional context', in the sense that its logical analysis must involve reference to empirical parameters, in this case both possible worlds and instants of time.",
        "Charles is only contingently happy; i.e., he is only happy at some worlds and only sometimes.",
        "The other reason is because the analysans must be capable of figuring as an argument for functions whose domain are propositions rather than truth-values.",
        "Construing ' Fa' as a name of a truth-value works only in the case of (1), (2) and (3).",
        "It won't work in (5), since truth-values are not the sort of thing that can be",
        "The term 'hyperintensional' has been introduced by Max Cresswell in Cresswell (1975).",
        "See also Cresswell (1985).",
        "For details on TIL handling knowledge see Duzi, Jespersen, Müller (2005).",
        "believed.",
        "Nor will it work in (4), since truth-values are not the sort of thing that can be possible.",
        "Constructions are procedures, or instructions, specifying how to arrive at less-structured entities.",
        "Being procedures, constructions are structured from the algorithmic point of view, unlike set-theoretical objects.",
        "The TIL 'language of constructions' is a modified hyper-intensional version of the typed À-calculus, where Montaguelike À-terms denote, not the functions constructed, but the constructions themselves.",
        "Constructions qua procedures operate on input objects (of any type, even on constructions of any order) and yield as output (or, in well defined cases fail to yield) objects of any type; in this way constructions construct partial functions, and functions, rather than relations, are basic objects of our ontology.",
        "By claiming that constructions are algorithmically structured, we mean the following: a construction C – being an instruction – consists of particular steps, i.e., sub-instructions (or, constituents) that have to be executed in order to execute C. The concrete/abstract objects an instruction operates on are not its constituents, they are just mentioned.",
        "Hence objects have to be supplied by another (albeit trivial) construction.",
        "The constructions themselves may also be only mentioned: therefore one should not conflate using constructions as constituents of composed constructions and mentioning constructions that enter as input into composed constructions, so we have to strictly distinguish between using and mentioning constructions.",
        "Just briefly: Mentioning is, in principle, achieved by using atomic constructions.",
        "A construction is atomic if it is a procedure that does not contain any other construction as a used subconstruction (a constituent).",
        "There are two atomic constructions that supply objects (of any type) on which complex constructions operate: variables and trivializations.",
        "Variables are constructions that construct an object dependently on valuation: they v-construct, where v is the parameter of valuations.",
        "When X is an object (including constructions) of any type, the Trivialization of X, denoted °X, constructs X without the mediation of any other construction.",
        "X is the atomic concept of X: it is the primitive, non-perspectival mode of presentation of X.",
        "There are three compound constructions, which consist of other constructions: Composition, Closure and Double Execution.",
        "Composition [X Y1 ... Ym] is the procedure of applying a function f v-constructed by X to an argument A v-constructed by Y1,...,Ym, i.e., the instruction to apply f to A to obtain the value (if any) of f at A. Closure [Àxr...xm Y] is the procedure of constructing a function by abstracting over variables, i.e., the instruction to do so.",
        "Finally, higher-order construction X can be used twice over as a constituent of a composed construction.",
        "This is achieved by the fifth construction called Double Execution X.",
        "TIL constructions, as well as the entities they construct, all receive a type.",
        "On the ground level of the type-hierarchy, there are entities unstructured from the algorithmic point of view belonging to a type of order 1.",
        "Given a so-called epistemic (or 'objectual') base of atomic types (o-truth values, i-individuals, T-time moments / real numbers, c-possible worlds), mereological complexity is increased by the induction rule for forming partial functions: where a, ß1,_,ßn are types of order 1, the set of partial mappings from ß1 x...x ßn to a, denoted (aß1^ßr), is a type of order 1 as well.",
        "Constructions that construct entities of order 1 are constructions of order 1.",
        "They belong to a type of order 2, denoted by *1.",
        "Inductively we define type of order n, *n.",
        "TIL is specific in a precise solution for intensions as non-empirical objects of the real world.",
        "Intensions are qualified as functions of a type ((aT)ra), i.e., functions from possible worlds to chronologies of the type a (in symbols: aTC0), where a chronology is a function of type (aT).",
        "Some important kinds of intensions are: Propositions, type oTC0 (shortened as n).",
        "They are denoted by empirical (declarative) sentences.",
        "Properties of members of a type a, or simply a-properties, type (oa)TC.",
        "General terms (some substantives, intransitive verbs) denote properties, mostly of individuals.",
        "Relations-in-intension, type (oß1_ßm)Tffl.",
        "For example transitive empirical verbs, also attitudinal verbs denote these relations.",
        "Omitting TC0 we get the type (oß1.",
        "ßm) of relations-in-extension (to be met mainly in mathematics).",
        "Collections, sets, classes of 'a-objects' are members of type (oa); TIL handles classes (subsets of a type) as characteristic functions.",
        "Similarly relations (-inextension) are of type(s) (oß1... ßm).",
        "a-roles or offices, type aTC0, where a ^ (oß).",

        "Thus valency frames in Verbalex include information about:",
        "1. the syntactic (surface) information about the syntactic valencies of a verb, i.e. what morphological cases (direct and prepositional ones in highly inflected languages such as Czech) are associated with (required by) a particular verb, and also adverbials, 2. semantic roles (deep cases) that represent the integration of the general labels with subcategorization features (or selectional restrictions) required by the meaning of the verb.",
        "The inventory of the semantic roles is partly inspired by the Top Ontology and Base Concepts as they have been defined within EuroWordNet project.",

        "The paper presented a first outline of comparison and integration of the two approaches, namely logical and linguistic, to the semantics of verbs in a natural language (English and Czech).",
        "We are aware that this work is still in a great progress and the results so presented rather fragmentary.",
        "Still, we are convinced that the research project we aim at is a relevant contribution to the semantics of natural language.",
        "We have shown that pursuing such a research is reasonable and comes up with a new viewpoint to the meaning of verbs.",
        "In this way we extend our knowledge in the important way.",
        "Actually, we are dealing with two deep levels of the meaning description and a question may be asked which one is deeper and better.",
        "Our answer is, do not contrast the two levels, and make use of both of them.",
        "In this way we believe to integrate them into one compact whole and perhaps obtain a unique data structure.",
        "The results of the presented research can be immediately applied in the area of knowledge representation and in the long-term Normal Translation System project that is being prepared.",
        "We have not tackled the other deep descriptions, such as the method that exploits the tectogramatical level as it is presently applied in PDT (Hajic 2004).",
        "This, obviously, is a topic of another paper."
