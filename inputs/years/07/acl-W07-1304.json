        "In the last decades, theoretical developments in the field of the biological evolution of species and populations have been combined with increasing computer facilities, which are likely to change the practice of phylogeny reconstruction drastically.",
        "Attempts to shift such a practice in order to reconstruct the evolution of language have been proposed, since the middle of the 20th century, as evidenced by several publications that display the whole range of methodologies.",
        "One of these approaches, called Numerical Taxonomy, consists in estimating some linguistic distances between pairs of languages, from which evolutionary trees or networks are inferred to produce some linguistic classifications.",
        "This approach is classically used in dialectometry.",

        "A more recent approach, based on Bayesian principles, suggests to attach some probabilities to each linguistic change (Gray et al., 2003), looking for the most likely tree, given the model and the observed data.",
        "Finally, the last kind of approach, inherited from XIXth century linguists, is the cladistic approach, as formalized by Hennig (1950) and clearly advocated by some linguists, although using various methodologies (Hoenigswald and Wiener, 1987; Wang, 1988; Holden, 2001; Ringe et al., 2002; Rexova et al., 2003; Nakhleh et al., 2005; Ben Hamed et al., 2005).",
        "The present work is focusing on cladistics, abandoning the purpose of capturing the global resemblance between languages and the ambition of giving a rational foundation to probability of linguistic changes, adopting instead a strategy enabling us to integrate linguistic hypotheses before drawing inference on the evolution of linguistic traits and languages, and possibly to refute them.",
        "To check the heuristic value of this methodology, we endeavour to apply cladistics to dialectal data from different sources, hoping to bring forward and discuss some arguments on their diversification in space and time.",
        "As far as we know, cladistic is more often applied to language families than to dialect areas, so that our research is pioneering the field, raising the controversial question concerning the best representation of dialectal diversity: treelike and/or networks."

        "A way to circumvent the parallelism problem, when several parsimonious trees are found, would be using a successive weighting process which looks for parsimonious trees by assigning to each trait a weight inversely proportional to its degree of homoplasy (only parallelism in our case since reversion are not allowed) (Farris 1969).",
