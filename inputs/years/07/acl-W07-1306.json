        "The work being presented in this paper belongs to the computational stream.",
        "Even in the computational stream, most of the previous work on inter-language distances had a strong linguistic dimension.",
        "For example, most of the quantitative measures of inter-language distance have been applied on handcrafted word lists (Swadesh, 1952; Dyen et al., 1992).",
        "However, with increasing use of computational techniques and the availability of electronic data, a natural question arises: Can languages be linguistically compared based on word lists extracted from corpora.",
        "A natural counter-question is whether such comparison will be valid from linguistic and psycholinguistic points of view.",
        "The aim of this paper is to examine such questions.",
        "To calculate inter-language distances on the basis of words in corpora, we propose two corpus based distance measures.",

        "These two are more linguistically grounded.",
        "Using these measures, we presented a synchronic comparison often major South Asian languages and a diachronic comparison of four historical varieties.",
        "The results of our experiments show that even these simple measures based on crosslingual comparison and on the data extracted from not very representative and noisy corpora can be used for obtaining or validating useful linguistic insights about language divergence, classification etc.",

        "If intra-lingual comparison is more meaningful than interlingual comparison, then these modified versions should be even more useful for comparative study of languages."
