        "Numerous theories have been proposed to explain the phenomenon of linguistic change, which, of late, are also being supported by allied mathematical or computational models.",
        "See (Steels, 1997; Perfors, 2002) for surveys on computational models of language evolution, and (Wang et al., 2005; Niyogi, 2006) for reviews of works on language change.",
        "The aim of these models is to explain why and how languages change under specific socio-cognitive assumptions.",
        "Although computational modeling is a useful tool in exploring linguistic change (Cangelosi and Parisi, 2002), due to the inherent complexities of our linguistic and social structures, modeling of real language change turns out to be extremely hard.",
        "Consequently, with the exception of a few (e.g., Hare and Elman (1995); Dras et al.",
        "(2003); Ke et al.",
        "(2003); Choudhury et al.",
        "(2006b)), all the mathematical and computational models developed for explaining language change are built for artificial toy languages.",
        "This has led several researchers to cast a doubt on the validity of the current computational models as well as the general applicability of computational techniques in diachronic explanations (Hauser et al., 2002; Poibeau, 2006).",
        "In this paper, we offer a functional explanationof a real world language change - the morpho-phonological change affecting the Bengali verb inflections (BVI).",
        "We model the problem as a multi-objective and multi-constraint optimization and solve the same using Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA).",
        "We show that the different forms of the BVIs, as found in the several modern dialects, automatically emerge in the MOGA framework under suitable modeling of the objective and constraint functions.",
        "The model also predicts several",
        "functionalist accounts of language change invoke the basic function of language, i.e. communication, as the driving force behind linguistic change (Boersma, 1998).",
        "Stated differently, languages change in a way to optimize their function, such that speakers can communicate maximum information with minimum effort (ease of articulation) and ambiguity (perceptual contrast).",
        "Often, ease of learnability is also considered a functional benefit.",

        "other possible dialectal forms of Bengali that seems linguistically plausible and might exist or have existed in the past, present or future.",
        "Note that the evolutionary algorithm (i.e., MOGA) has been used here as a tool for optimization, and has no relevance to the evolution of the dialects as such.",
        "Previously, Redford et al.",
        "(2001) has modeled the emergence of syllable systems in a multi-constraint and multi-objective framework using Genetic algorithms.",
        "Since the model fuses the individual objectives into a single objective function through a weighted linear combination, it is not a multi-objective optimization in its true sense and neither does it use MOGA for the optimization process.",
        "Nevertheless, the present work draws heavily from the quantitative formulation of the objectives and constraints described in (Redford, 1999; Redford and Diehl, 1999; Redford et al., 2001).",
        "Ke et al.",
        "(2003) has demonstrated the applicability and advantages of MOGA in the context of the vowel and tonal systems, but the model is not explicit about the process of change that could give rise to the optimal vowel systems.",
        "As we shall see that the conception of the genotype, which is arguably the most important part ofany MOGA model, is a novel and significant contribution of this work.",
        "The present formulation of the genotype not only captures a snapshot of the linguistic system, but also explicitly models the course of change that has given rise to the particular system.",
        "Thus, we believe that the current model is more suitable in explaining a case of linguistic change.",
        "The paper is organized as follows: Sec. 2 introduces the problem of historical change affecting the BVIs and presents a mathematical formulation of the same; Sec. 3 describes the MOGA model; Sec. 4 reports the experiments, observations and their interpretations; Sec. 5 concludes the paper by summarizing the contributions.",
        "In this paper, Bengali graphemes are represented in Roman script following the ITRANS notation (Chopde, 2001).",

        "In this section, we discuss the design choices explored for the problem ofBVI.",
        "We define the phenotype of a dialect d to be the lexicon of the dialect, Ad, consisting of the 28 inflected forms of the root verb kar.",
        "This choice of phenotype is justified because, at the end of the optimization process, we would like to obtain the Pareto-optimal dialects of Bengali and compare them with their real counterparts.",
        "The genotype of a dialect d could also be defined as Ad, where the word forms are the genes.",
        "However, for such a choice of genotype, crossover and mutation lead to counter-intuitive results.",
        "For example, mutation would affect only a single word in the lexicon, which is against the regularity principle of sound change (see Bhat (2001) for explanation).",
        "Similarly, exchanging a set of words between a pair of lexica, as crossover would lead to, seems insensible.",
        "Therefore, considering the basic properties of sound change as well as the genetic operators used in MOGA, we define a chromosome (and thus the genotype) as a sequence of APOs.",
        "The salient features of the genotype are described below.",
        "â€¢ Gene: A gene is defined as an APO.",
        "Since in order to implement the MOGA, every gene must be mapped to a number, we have chosen an 8-bit binary representation for a gene.",
        "This allows us to specify 256 distinct genes or APOs.",
        "However, for reasons described below, we use the first bit of a gene to denote whether the gene (i.e., the APO) is active (the bit is set to 1) or not.",
        "Thus, we are left with 128 distinct choices for APOs.",
        "Since the number of words in the lexicon is only 28, the APOs for Del, Asm and Met are limited, even after accounting for the various contexts in which an APO is applicable.",

        "To restrain the possible repertoire of APOs to 128, we avoided any APO related to the mutation of consonants.",
        "This allowed us to design a comprehensive set of APOs that are applicable on the classical Bengali lexicon and its derivatives.",
        "â€¢ Chromosome: A chromosome is a sequence of 15 genes.",
        "The number 15 has been arrived through experimentation, where we have observed that increasing the length of a chromosome beyond 15 does not yield richer results for the current choice of APOs and A0.",

        "It is easy to see that the regularity hypothesis regarding the sound change holds good for the aforementioned choice of genotype.",
        "Furthermore, crossover in this context can be interpreted as a shift in the course of language change.",
        "Similarly, mutation of the first bit turns a gene on or off, and of the other bits changes the APO.",
        "Note that according to this formulation, a chromosome not only models a dialect, but also the steps of its evolution from the classical forms.",
        "Formulation of the objective functions and constraints are crucial to the model, because the linguistic plausibility, computational tractability and the results of the model are overtly dependent on them.",

        "Although learnability is a complex notion, one can safely equate the learnability of a system to the regularity of the patterns within the system.",
        "In fact, in the context of morphology, it has been observed that the so called learning bottleneck has a regularizing effect on the morphological structures, thereby leaving out only the most frequently used roots to behave irregularly (Hare and Elman, 1995; Kirby, 2001).",

        "Therefore, fr(A) is negative for a regular lexicon and 0 or positive for an irregular one.",
        "In other words, fr(A) is also a minimizing objective function.",

        "In order to implement the MOGA model, we have used the Non-dominated Sorting GA-II or NSGA-II (Deb et al., 2002), which is a multi-objective, multi-constraint elitist GA.",
        "Different MOGA models have been incrementally constructed by introducing the different objectives and constraints.",
        "The motivation behind the incorporation of a new objective or constraint comes from the observations made on the emergent dialects of the previous models.",
        "For instance, with two objectives fe and fd, and no constraints, we obtain dialects that violate phonotactic constraints or/and are highly irregular.",
        "One such example of an emergent dialect is A = { kor, kara, kar, kore, korea, kore, karA, karAa, karA, *korAlm, *korl, korla, *koreAlm, korel, ko-rela, *karAlm, karAl, karAla }.",
        "The * marked forms violate the phonotactic constraints.",
        "Also note that the forms are quite indistinct or close to each other.",
        "These observations led to the formulation ofthe constraints Cp and Cd.",
        "Through a series of similar experiments, finally we arrived at a model, where we could observe the emergence of dialects, some of which closely resemble the real dialects and others also seem linguistically plausible.",
        "In this final model, there are two objectives, fe and fd, and 3 constraints, Cp, Cd and Cr.",
        "Table 4 lists the corresponding forms of some of the emergent dialects, whose real counterparts are shown in Table 1.",
        "Fig.",
        "2 shows the Pareto-optimal front obtained for the aforementioned model after 500 generations, with a population size of 1000.",
        "Since the objectives are minimizing in nature, the area on the plot below and left of the Pareto-optimal front represents impossible languages, whereas the area to the right and top of the curve pertains to unstable or suboptimal languages.",
        "It is interesting to note that the four real dialects lie very close to the Pareto-optimal front.",
        "In fact, ACB and SCB lie on the front, whereas classical Bengali and Sylheti appears to be slightly suboptimal.",
        "Nevertheless, one should always be aware that impossibility and suboptimality are to be interpreted in the context of the model and any generalization or extrapolation of these concepts for the real languages is controversial and better avoided.",
        "Several inferences can be drawn from the experiments with the MOGA models.",
        "We have observed that the Pareto-optimal fronts for all the MOGA Models look like rectangular hyperbola with a horizontal and vertical limb; the specific curve of Fig. 2 satisfies the equation:",
        "Several interesting facts, can be inferred from the above equation.",
        "First, the minimum value of fe under the constraints Cr and Cd, and for the given",
        "Figure 2: The Pareto-optimal front.",
        "The gray triangles (light blue in colored version available online) show the position of the real dialects: 0 - Classical Bengali, 1 - SCB, 2 - ACB, 3 - Sylheti.",
        "The topmost dot in the plot corresponds to the emergent dialect D0 shown in Table 4.",
        "repertoire of APOs is 5.6.",
        "Second, at fe(A) = 6, the slope of the front, i.e. dfd/dfe, is approximately â€“ 2, and the second derivative dfd/dfe is around 20.",
        "This implies that there is sharp transition between the vertical and horizontal limbs at around fe(A) = 6.",
        "Interestingly, all the real dialects studied here lie on the horizontal limb of the Pareto-optimal front (i.e., fe(A) > 6), classical Bengali being placed at the extreme right.",
        "We also note the negative correlation between the value of fe for the real dialects, and the number of APOs invoked during derivation of these dialects from classical Bengali.",
        "These facts together imply that the natural direction of language change in the case of BVIs has been along the horizontal limb of the Pareto-optimal front, leading to the formation of dialects with higher and higher articulatory ease.",
        "Among the four dialects, SCB has the minimum value for fe (A) and it is positioned on the horizontal limb of the front just before the beginning of the vertical limb.",
        "Therefore, it is natural to ask whether there are any real dialects of modern Bengali that lie on the vertical limb of the Pareto-optimal front; and if not, what may be the possible reasons behind their inexistence?",
        "In the absence of any comprehensive collection of Bengali dialects, we do not have a clear answer to the above questions.",
        "Nevertheless, it may",
        "Table 4: Examples of emergent dialects in the MOGA model.",
        "Note that the dialects Dl, D2 and D3 resemble SCB, ACB and Sylheti, whereas DO seems to be linguistically implausible.",
        "For legends, refer to Table l be worthwhile to analyze the emergent dialects of the MOGA models that lie on the vertical limb.",
        "We have observed that the vertical limb consists of dialects similar to DO - the one shown in the first column of Table 4.",
        "Besides poor distinctiveness, DO also features a large number of diphthongs that might result in poorer perception or higher effort of articulation of the forms.",
        "Thus, in order to eliminate the emergence of such seemingly implausible cases in the model, the formulations of the objectives feand fd require further refinements.",
        "Similarly, it can also be argued that the structure of the whole lexicon, which has not been modeled here, has also a strong effect on the BVIs.",
        "This is because even though we have measured the acoustic distinctiveness fd with respect to the 28 inflected forms of a single verb root kar, ideally fd should be computed with respect to the entire lexicon.",
        "Thus, change in other lexical items (borrowing or extinction of words or change in the phonological structures) can trigger or restrain an event of change in the BVIs.",
        "Furthermore, merging, extinction or appearence of morphological attributes can also have significant effects on the phonological change of inflections.",
        "It is interesting to note that while Vedic Sanskrit had different morphological markers for three numbers (singular, dual and plural) and no gender markers for the verbs, Hindi makes a distinction between the genders (masculine and feminine) as well as numbers (but only singular and plural), and Bengali has markers for neither gender nor number.",
        "Since both Hindi and Bengali are offshoots of Vedic Sanskrit, presumably the differences between the phonological structure of the verb inflections of these two languages must have also been affected by the loss or addition of morphological attributes.",
        "It would be interesting to study the precise nature of the interaction between the inflections and attributes within the current computational framework, which we deem to be a future extension of this work."

        "In this paper, we have described a MOGA based model for the morpho-phonological change ofBVIs.",
        "The salient contributions of the work include: (l) the conception of the genotype as a sequence of APOs, whereby we have been able to capture not only the emergent dialects, but also the path towards their emergence, and (2) a plausible functional explanation for the morpho-phonological changes affecting the BVIs.",
        "Nevertheless, the results of the experiments with the MOGA models must be interpreted with caution.",
        "This is because, the results are very much dependent on the formulation of the fitness functions and the choice of the constraints.",
        "The set of APOs in the repertoire also play a major role in shaping the Pareto-optimal front of the model.",
        "Before we conclude, we would like to re-emphasize that the model proposed here is a functional one, and it does not tell us how the dialects of Bengali have self-organized themselves to strike a balance between the functional pressures, if at all this had been the case.",
        "The evolutionary algorithm (i.e., MOGA) has been used here as a tool for optimization, and has no relevance to the evolution of the dialects as such.",
        "Nevertheless, if it is possible to provide linguistically grounded accounts of the sources of variation and the process of selection, then the MOGA model could qualify as an evolutionary explanation of language change as well.",
        "Although such models have been proposed in the literature (Croft, 2000; Baxter et al., 2006), the fact, that global optimization can be an outcome oflocal interactions between the speakers (e.g., Kirby (l999), de",
